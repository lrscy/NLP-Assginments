The Presidency has made this a priority.
The Integrated Security in Europe conference which was held in November gave rise to a debate on stricter control of the sector.
The Council wishes to point out that the concern expressed by the European Parliament is at the top of the agenda.
However, the careful implementation of such mechanisms is a complicated process in which the balance in the Europol system must be carefully monitored.
According to the draft instrument, Eurojust, for its part, should only be assigned a cooperative and coordinating role.
All decisions will be taken by the competent national authorities who will be handling the cases.
However, it is possible for the European Parliament to be kept up-to-date with Eurojust' s activities provided that they are not of an operational nature.
The instrument establishing Eurojust therefore specifies that Parliament will receive an annual activity report which deals amongst other things with data protection.
Parliament is also giving discharge for the implementation of Eurojust' s budget.
A democratic deficit has also been observed by the European Parliament. This deficit refers to the lack of the EP' s involvement in the definition of the strategy of the European Union in all its parts, both inside and outside the Union, except for the fact that Parliament is only kept fully informed and has access to the so-called sensitive information.
I must say at this juncture that the Council is applying the institutional convention provisions to the letter.
In this context, when the matter relates to a proposal or initiative that falls under police or judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the Council applies the provisions of Article 39 of the Treaty establishing the European Union, and when the matter is one that is covered by Title IV concerning asylum and immigration or judicial cooperation in civil matters, it applies Article 67 of the Treaty establishing the European Union.
Experience shows us that the Council has consulted the European Parliament whenever the Commission or one of the Member States has submitted a proposal or an initiative to it.
The Council was in fact present during the plenary sessions and meetings of the appropriate committee of the European Parliament, and Parliament was given ongoing information about the state of affairs.
And now to the final set of problems I would like to discuss with you, which concern the need to keep the European Parliament informed about important changes occurring in the negotiation process within the Council, both in relation to legislative proposals by the Commission and in relation to initiatives developed by the Member States.
As I have already said, it was the Council' s wish to fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative procedures at Community level in accordance with the provisions of the convention.
It is true that the activities of the Council bodies will result in changes to the tenor of some provisions of the proposals or initiatives being submitted to them.
This is in fact in keeping with the common wish to find solutions which have the support of everyone in the Union.
In practice we know that if the European Parliament has not yet issued its advice on a proposal or an initiative, the Council has always been willing to provide the information requested so that the European Parliament can satisfy itself as to the direction the activities are taking.
This having been said, the Council knows that the European Union' s standpoints have a specific value added which differs from those of the Member States.
Since it aims in its advice to respond to a different institutional logic and give the Council the right elements within the framework of the democratic task with which it is charged, this task must obviously not depend on developments of the work done by the Council on one decision or another.
What is more, the Council consults the European Parliament, if necessary, in accordance with the provisions of the convention.
Please allow me to conclude this part of my speech by expressing my satisfaction as President for the way in which we have been able to cooperate with the European Parliament.
We sometimes had to seek advice about very profound matters in particularly difficult circumstances and at very short notice.
I think that this is something that may even have been unique to this Presidency.
We have never appealed to you in vain.
The European Parliament has exercised flexibility when giving advice, sometimes at very short notice.
This method of cooperation, coupled with our cooperation with the Commission and the Commissioner, has made it possible to take a major step towards, amongst other things, the European arrest warrant, which I believe is the most important common denominator, because this has enabled us to undertake an action in this area which is comparable to the introduction of the euro in the financial and monetary sphere.
Thus the European arrest warrant has also come into being as far as cooperation in judicial matters and mutual recognition in criminal matters are concerned.
This is only possible if all players demonstrate the good, positive attitude that we have encountered.
I am therefore pleased that in these circumstances, the early annual report relating to judicial and home affairs matters has been given a different perspective than it has in the past.
Mr President, first of all, allow me to say that, once again, I consider this Parliamentary procedure whereby the Commissioner speaks after three speakers and the Minister after seven, as if to say that all those who will speak from now onwards are not even worthy of an answer, to be strange.
Having said that - I do not agree with it but I abide by it - I shall speak particularly about the Watson report, which proposes a useful, appropriate initiative to regulate the security side of future summits of any kind.
The proposal started off, it must be said, in decidedly lifeless tones as regards an objective analysis; then the tone improved along the way. This is just the opposite of what happened with a parallel initiative for the fight against terrorism, which arose out of the emotional response to 11 September and then all of a sudden became an opportunity not only to produce a European arrest warrant but more especially to cause a real witch-hunt within Italian politics.
But the leader of my Group, Mr Tajani, will speak at greater length on this.
I return now to the Watson report, which proposes the requirement of agreeing public order measures for major summit meetings. A truly appropriate idea, I was saying: it is a pity that it should have become both an excuse for preparing a summary trial of the events at previous Summits, and especially a Trojan horse in its attempts at party political speculation in a decidedly national vein.
This has all come about through instrumental amendments, in the form of direct attacks on the Italian Government and its President. Not just this, but it also reiterates a defamatory action, as has already been mentioned, against the Italian forces of law and order, which are accused of serious offences and Gestapo-like behaviour that have never been proved in the numerous inquiries that have so far been opened.
This, then, amongst other things, violates the Italian State' s legitimate autonomy and sovereignty to deal with public order issues.
To those Members who still confuse the limits between national sovereignty and Community competences I say quite plainly - but still calmly - that it is time to stop doing the dirty washing of national politics in the European Parliament, but it is also time to put an end to the widespread sport of misusing points of order and questions in order to provoke improper debates and vitriolic attacks on persons rather than on ideas and political positions.
I say this particularly to the Italian left-wing Members, the diligent supporters who regularly find room to express themselves in this House and also in the newspapers, thanks to the work of partisan reporters with little objectivity.
Fortunately most of Parliament has understood this.
In the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, almost all the amendments from the left were rejected.
I propose that Parliament should do the same in its plenary session, and to make it quite clear I shall indicate the dangerous points: Amendment Nos 22, 25 and 29 are real chemical weapons against the truth.
They should be rejected, otherwise I shall be forced to ask my coordinator to vote against this report.
Mr President, I am glad that, although you are from Regensburg, you are willing to give a minute's speaking time to a Nuremberger like myself.
Mr Santini, who has just spoken, has shown what this is all about.
If we are talking about an area of freedom, security and justice in Europe, if, like the President-in-Office, we are talking about a European home affairs policy, then even such a faithful servant of this master as Mr Santini will have to come to terms with the fact that we will also discuss Italian domestic politics.
Now, I am not an Italian left-winger, but a German left-winger, and I can tell you that I do not share the view expressed by Mr Verwilghen and Mr Vitorino, according to whom what happened in Rome yesterday represents progress.
Yesterday saw us achieve a victory in the first round, for 14 States of the European Union were consistent and determined in ensuring the failure of the attempt by the Italian Prime Minister, out of naked self-interest, to make use of his office of state to obstruct a criminal investigation that could involve him, and in ensuring that private interests were prevented from paralysing the European arrest warrant.
Yesterday, this same Mr Berlusconi - a former Member of this House, who, thanks to its President, was not subject to any proceedings to lift his immunity - had this to say, and what I quote relates to what was told me by President-in-Office of the Council Verwilghen, who drew a parallel between the European arrest warrant and the euro - accurately, in fact, in terms of their dimension and political significance.
What does Mr Berlusconi have to say about it?
Mr Berlusconi says: "Other nations have named 2004 as the deadline for the European arrest warrant to be put into effect, although it could be later."
I quote word for word.
If the Italian constitution is not amended, then we cannot join in, in much the same way that Great Britain is not joining in the euro.
Why do I speak in terms of winning a round?
I prophesy this to you: After all we have experienced in the Council, after all Italy's stonewalling in the interest of its Prime Minister, I tell you here and now that the same Prime Minister will now hold a referendum in order to prevent the European arrest warrant from being effective in Italy.
This is very likely, and so I do not yet believe that we have now implemented the European arrest warrant.
I do believe that this House will have to insist, with the utmost consistency, on the isolation Italy has imposed on itself over the last few weeks being maintained by the 14other European states, because anyone who has, like me or like Mrs Paciotti, crossed swords in this House with Mr Berlusconi or Mr Dell'Utri, will be painted by the Berlusconi press, as I was, as an old Stalinist - and I am not old yet, nor am I yet a Stalinist - or, like Mrs Paciotti, will be described as head of a communist conspiracy against Italy.
Looking at you, Mr Tajani, I understand why the people of Rome did not elect you as their mayor.
I can understand it, above all, when I hear you speak.
Anyone who, even tentatively, questions Italian policy, gets slandered in this House.
Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Watson, who has presented a very balanced and good report despite the ongoing attempts at blockade and the policy of permanent obstruction which Forza Italia, part of the Group of the European People's Party - though hopefully not for much longer - has adopted.
(Applause)
Sir, your speaking time is up.
Mr Tajani has a point of order.
On which item of the agenda do you wish to speak, sir?
Mr President, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure must be enforced!
It seems that in this House there is a claque supporting Mr Schulz in the public gallery, although in this House, as in all parliaments, members of the public are forbidden to applaud or call out in support of one argument or another.
I therefore ask you, Mr President, to enforce the Rules of Procedure and perhaps have spectators removed if they are supporters of one side and do not intend to watch the work of Parliament but just want to cheer someone on.
Mr Tajani, on this point you are right, but I ask you what the President is supposed to do.
Should I have the visitors removed from the gallery?
Should I have their hands tied behind their backs?
What has happened, has happened, and I cannot do anything about it.
You are right, but I cannot do anything about it now.
In the fight for security from terrorism, we have rightly proclaimed that we are defending fundamental values but, if we compromise individual rights in the pursuit of security, we will have sacrificed some of what we hold so dear.
In the last two years since Tampere, the programme of cooperation on justice matters has been heavily weighted to the security side of the scales - especially since 11 September with the anti-terrorism package.
All this is necessary, but it is time to rebalance the work programme.
At the Laeken Summit, Heads of Government should commit themselves to a thorough review of the degree of respect in practice for the standards we have signed up to in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
There needs to be a programme to ensure observance of minimum standards of due process, fair trials in criminal proceedings and approximation of rights of defendants.
We should project these standards in our international agreements because there are some worrying developments.
In the UK, there are proposals for executive decisions for detention without trial and an attempt to avoid any significant degree of judicial review.
In the United States, President Bush has signed an order providing for trial in military courts in the absence of fundamental safeguards for fair trial provided for in international law. The EU must not agree to any extradition agreement with the US whereby people could be convicted in these military tribunals.
Finally, the case of the 14 British and Dutch plane-spotters detained for nearly five weeks in Greece without trial is extremely disturbing.
They have been denied bail, the evidence has been presented in secret and there has been no transparent schedule of court hearings.
They may be guilty at most of a misdemeanour.
It will be a disgrace if the European arrest warrant is agreed this weekend and this situation has still not been resolved.
I call, in particular, on Prime Minister Blair to withhold agreement if they have not been either charged or released by Friday.
Mr President, Mr President-in-office of the Council, Commissioner, fellow MEPs. Our desire to create a European area of safety and justice is a common one.
Over the past few weeks and even over the past few days, we have taken some important steps, and I would like to personally congratulate you on the efforts you have made in this regard and on the results you have achieved, because efforts are not always enough; we also have to achieve results.
Having said this, I would like to point out - and I share your opinion, but I know that there are others who do not - that security cannot be used as an excuse for threatening fundamental rights.
I am indeed a little concerned when I see how quick some people are to use the word 'terrorism' and to apply it to all kinds of things they do not like, both in international and national politics.
The European Parliament has rightly been pressing for a strict definition, and has been knocking the eagerness to label all dissidents as terrorists on the head.
I am pleased to hear you say that the Council is following Parliament on this.
I would also like to see this confirmed in all texts, because people who want to change the constitution in their country are not necessarily terrorists, and people demonstrating against globalisation and injustice in the world are also not necessarily terrorists.
Absolutely not, in most cases.
We believe that anyone who equates this with terrorism is violating fundamental rights.
We would like to return to the European arrest warrant, including the guarantees being demanded by the European Parliament.
However, I think it is very important that you have been able to implement this and that you were able to bring us this message today.
Mr President, in correspondence that is still being kept from Members in spite of my requests, Mr Bush put four intolerable demands to Mr Prodi.
They are intolerable because they are made by a government that has set up military courts and introduced measures described as 'patriotic' but that in fact take away any right to defence, by a government that, since 11 September, has kept nearly a thousand immigrants in prison without lawyers and without charging them, by a government that, when all is said and done, has still not abolished the death penalty.
In the name of urgency, but also in a state of total confusion, the Council and Commission are trying to make us swallow texts on terrorism that are always questionable and often have not even been put to the vote.
I believe it is time to call a stop to this masquerade and this caricature of democratic debate.
In the name of the war against terrorism, they are waging war against democratic freedoms and the social acquis.
This is not our war; the war we should be waging is against violence, poverty, unemployment, hunger in the world and dictatorships, against corruption and safe havens for Mr Berlusconi.
Mr President, the Watson report uses the issues of the day to accelerate the communitisation of the EU.
This is because better coordination between Member States overcomes the problem described to a large extent.
It is incomprehensible that the report only refers to the Charter, a political statement, whilst the European Convention on Human Rights, the perfect convention for the protection of our citizens' rights, is not mentioned in it.
Since the US terrorist attacks of 11 September, the EU' s attitude towards the US has been highly critical as well as supportive.
The object of our criticism is the new anti-terrorism legislation.
Some discretion in this regard would not be out of place.
Please do not get me wrong; I am no advocate of trials by military tribunals without the possibility of appeal, and I believe that the USA must reconsider this, but I do wonder how we would have reacted if these attacks had taken place in the EU.
Refusing point blank to extradite terrorists to the USA is sending out the wrong signal.
It would be more reasonable for the EU to make clear arrangements with the USA about the conditions of the extradition.
Mr President, first I would like to say that I entirely agree with what Mr Vitorino said about the problems besetting our quest for an area of justice, freedom and security, while remaining very much aware that we cannot have an area of security without justice or justice without police.
We should be lucid enough to realise that generally speaking Europe is in quite a privileged position in this respect, for we have a fairly well-established level of citizens' freedoms, even though we have to remain very vigilant.
We know how to alternate Community responses - and I hope the arrest warrant and our response will be worthy of us - with the proper degree of subsidiarity.
We base our activity on a system of values that have been set out and listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and on an approach under which monitoring by the states of the level of citizens' freedoms alternates with recourse to the Court of Justice, both the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the Strasbourg Court.
Unfortunately, however, Europe is not an oasis and the world is interactive: if I may put it this way, the world around us does not stand still, which justifies taking external action in the field of justice and home affairs.
First there are the candidate countries.
We cannot allow any differentiation in respect of these countries.
Naturally, we will have to require the same level and the same perception of citizens' freedoms.
Then there are the countries close to us, the countries that will become close to us by what I might call capillary action.
I am thinking of countries such as Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine, in respect of which we will have to decide how to act.
Lastly there are the partner countries, countries that are the source of immigrants and asylum seekers and with which we must maintain a constant dialogue.
Hence the need for external action.
We have two types of external action.
The first type is rather messianic, involving the export and globalisation of law and order and the constitutional state as we understand it.
Then we have protective action vis-Ã -vis this external world, because, of course, there are crimes and scourges that know no frontiers, a problem to which we will have to find the appropriate answers, without of course ever abandoning the values we have set out and proclaimed.
In this respect I would like to defend the European Parliament, which has to play its full role, because traditionally parliaments are meant to be the custodians of citizens' freedoms and we have to play this role.
Obviously this means more than involving our Parliament in the strategy and implementation of external actions in the field of justice and home affairs.
It is also a question of our resources.
In this regard, in my few remaining seconds of speaking time and under the authority of Mr Watson, the chairman of our Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would plead for this committee to be given additional resources in terms of staffing.
After many struggles, including a decision this Chamber adopted unanimously, we have managed to acquire one extra member of staff for the committee, although this person is in fact employed by DG IV; meanwhile the Committee on Foreign Affairs has nine members of staff assigned to human rights.
I find it irresponsible that if a Parliament wants to give its Committee on Citizens' Freedoms the resources to do its job, it does not to give it the staff needed to assist the colleagues who are responsible for the committee' s reports.
Mr President, the European arrest warrant was saved in the nick of time.
It was dragged away from the gates of Laeken.
How pleased should we be now?
The creation of an area of freedom, security and justice goes to the very core of the relationship between governments and citizens.
The exercising of legitimate pressure versus the upholding of the citizen' s essential fundamental rights.
In the past, revolutions were fought and extensive constitutional debates were held in Europe over this tense relationship.
However, legislation on this matter is now being introduced in the third pillar of the European Union by means of framework resolutions engineered by the Council using secret diplomacy, monitored by national parliaments and the European Parliament.
In this respect, we are back in the 19th Century.
Our desire to reform the European decision-making process and to close the so-called democratic loophole are well-known.
However, it will require a Treaty change and sufficient political will to do this, but we cannot wait that long.
The procedure concerning the European arrest warrant demonstrates that a critical boundary has been crossed.
Our own credibility as representatives of the people is at stake, so democratic legitimacy must also be increased in the current Treaty in the near future.
The proposal that was recently adopted in the Dutch Upper Chamber is one way of doing this.
It asks for the introduction of a phase of active openness in the Council' s decision-making process.
According to this proposal, a final decision on draft framework resolutions is only taken after a period of at least six weeks, during which time citizens and organisations in the Member States are given the opportunity to form their opinions.
The role of national parliaments and the European Parliament should also gain in significance in this way.
This would at the very least prevent us from voting on out-of-date documents as we did in November, or only nodding our assent retrospectively, which we may do this week.
I propose that we lay down such a modest reform of the decision-making process in a new interinstitutional agreement, and if anyone thinks that this is asking too much, they should say so.
Mr President, of course terrorism must be combated, but a number of the measures currently being introduced at breakneck speed are in danger of undermining the rule of law in society which the war against terrorism is intended to strengthen.
Sweden, for example, has frozen all the assets of a number of Swedish citizens of Somali origin on the basis solely of a US list.
They have no opportunity to defend themselves or to lodge an appeal.
Two days ago, a Swede was expelled from Belgium for having put up posters for one of the legal demonstrations to be held in conjunction with the Laeken Summit.
With this in mind, one may well ask how far we can go before destroying both the rule of law and freedom of movement within the EU.
Are all these precipitous measures really only targeting terrorism or is it in actual fact the case that, despite all promises to the contrary, this is in practice turning into a campaign on the part of the authorities and the establishment against both immigrants from Muslim countries and normal legal protest movements against the neo-liberal class-based society?
It would be excellent if the Commission and the Council could show that this is not the case.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whereas Mrs Hazan seeks by means of her report to make the methods of 'Fortress EU' an export hit around the world, the Watson report expresses concern for the safety of the Heads of State and Government at their meeting within the framework of democracy as it really exists.
What security in Laeken will mean was learned by the people, who, in the run-up to the summit, got a letter in which the police in GÃ¶ttingen advised against participation in protest actions and threatened that disregarding this advice would meet with preventive measures.
The murder victim Carlo Giugliani probably did not get such a letter, any more than did the people who were beaten up and shot at in the Diaz School or on the streets of Gothenburg.
They were told about the framework programme on terrorism only after the event, because they had demonstrated against the EU and G8 and had defended themselves against police violence.
I wanted to say in addition that the rulers are enforcing their right to security, which is defined in the context of security, justice and freedom, at the expense of the lack of freedom for demonstrators, and so it will not only be demonstrators at Laeken who will not have much to laugh about.
Mr President, an agreement was reached in Rome yesterday on the European arrest warrant; Italy too will sign it.
It is certainly a positive step, but it is no more than the beginning of a long process of trying to set up, at last, a genuine European area of freedom, security and justice.
The new European Constitution should lead to harmonisation of criminal law and procedure in our Union.
The Member States should work towards a situation in which crimes and penalties do not differ from one place to another.
We must all, in short, commit ourselves to establishing fair trials, that is, to having a third judge, allowing evidence to take shape in the course of the trial and to having the prosecuting magistrates separate from the judges.
This is not blackmail, Mr Watson; it is not an Italian caprice, as has been suggested in this House; it is the will of Parliament, which, in 1997, voted for the Roth report, which invited the Member States to carry out a genuine reform of justice in favour of a fair trial.
That is why so many criticisms levelled by the left against the Italian Government in this House are unfounded and the result of propaganda by a handful of fundamentalist magistrates.
Moreover, the foreign press in Italy has recognised this; in this respect, I quote the words of a respected journalist in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Hans JÃŒrgen Fischer, who said, 'All these charges against the Berlusconi Government seemed quite out of proportion to me.'
It is therefore our duty to reject all the attacks made on the Italian Government by left-wing MEPs who do not understand the situation in Italy and who, beginning with the leader of the Socialist Group, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, have made absolutely unfounded attacks on the Italian Government and on Italy.
I repeat, they are attacks that we firmly reject because it is all just propaganda.
In short, a lot of fuss has been made about nothing and Parliament has not achieved any results.
The results were actually achieved thanks to the action of the Italian Government, which concluded the agreement with Mr Verhofstadt yesterday.
Mr President, Mr Tajani, who has just spoken, makes me very glad that I have a minute less in which to speak, and that is the least I can offer, for what is a mere minute against Mr Berlusconi?.
After an intervention like that, I am glad Mr Schulz got a minute from me and was able to speak for longer.
Now, though, I really do want to deal with different subject matter, one that is very, very important to me.
For 16 months we have had an EU-wide problem that we have not yet been able to resolve.
It was terrible for us to have to face what happened at Dover.
Now we have another 13 people found in a lorry in Ireland, eight of them dead, among them two children.
Minister, I ask the Council, the Commission and Mr Vitorino, that in this area, above all, we should, as we must, carefully go over our homework again, in order to bring in the measures that are so urgently needed if we are not to find even more refugees dead.
Mr President, more than two years ago, on the initiative of the Aznar Government, a new page was turned in Tampere with regard to European integration: to make a politically and judicially viable new common European area of freedom, security and justice, which would make the freedom and security of citizens compatible - and here is the great political debate - with the efficient functioning of, and access to, justice within this area.
The events that have taken place over these last two years, such as the tragic deaths of Moroccan and sub-Saharan citizens in the Straits of Gibraltar and off the Andalusian coast, the death of immigrants in Dover or the recent incidents in Ireland, the repugnant traffic in, and corruption of, minors, and prostitution, combined with the horrific murders committed by ETA and the tragedy of 11 September, have caused an upheaval in the debate and have accelerated the need for the speedy implementation of measures to cope with such a dangerous and worrying situation.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the work carried out by the Council, the Commission and Parliament in this field has its good and bad points.
The good points include the fight against terrorism, where the important role which our President, Nicole Fontaine, has played in this area, as well as Commissioner Vitorino, deserve a special mention; the European arrest warrant and the definition of terrorism are the result of a difficult battle against terrorism that started in this House before 11 September.
I would also like to stress what a good thing it has been to separate the debates on economic migration and asylum, which has helped us to clarify ideas, debates, and even approaches.
However, in my opinion, there is still a long way to go.
There are too many bad points and the most worrying of these in my opinion is the disorder caused by the hastiness and lack of agreement in the Council in areas such as the family reunification of immigrants, minimum standards on the asylum process, conditions for the reception of asylum seekers - to give but a few examples - where our work is sometimes ineffective due to the fact we have to chop and change what is carried out by the Council, which shows that the method with which we have to work is not ideal by any means and needs to be amended.
Mr President, Commissioner, as the last Justice and Home Affairs Council demonstrated, the system for taking unanimous decisions on matters of justice and home affairs has come to the end of its cycle.
If the Berlusconi Government manages, even for a short time, to block the decision on the European arrest warrant, can you imagine what will happen when the Union of the 15 becomes a Union of 30 if we continue to insist on an intergovernmental rather than a Community method for taking decisions?
A propos, my congratulations to the Belgian Presidency on the battle which it won in Rome yesterday.
The Council is clearly unwilling to make any fundamental reforms on the basis the commitments made in Tampere, despite the assiduous efforts of Commissioner Vitorino and the political will demonstrated by the European Parliament.
The only sector in which the Council has evinced any particular interest or enthusiasm is in the fight against terrorism, under pressure from and at the suggestion of the United States which, I am afraid, is trying to export and impose its system of justice on Europe, a system which clashes with European customs and values.
How can we extradite European citizens to the USA when the United States cannot guarantee that it will not impose the death penalty?
I am afraid, Commissioner, that the alliance with the USA is becoming more and more dangerous for the European Union.
The fact that strict rules are being promoted within an already strict framework is understandably causing concern among citizens, who fear that the fundamental liberties and human rights which they have fought long and sacrificed much for will be restricted.
The end clearly does not justify the means.
For the rest, half way through the five-year period set by the Amsterdam summit for creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, we are seriously behind schedule, for example in formulating a common immigration and asylum policy.
Finally, I wonder, what has happened to European sensitivity and our humanitarian values, when we are incapable of resolving the drama of refugees and immigrants despite witnessing daily tragedies such as the recent suffocation of eight immigrants in southern Ireland?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a little more than two years have elapsed since Tampere and the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
It is important to point out that major progress has been made but that, on the other hand, there are still many obstacles to be overcome.
The Union is proud, and rightly so, of its constant defence of respect for human rights in the world and within the Community.
The recently proclaimed Charter of Fundamental Rights reinforced our commitment in this regard and the area of freedom, security and justice only makes sense if all three of these elements are taken together and if no one of them prejudices any other.
The tragic events of September 11 and the intensified attention to safety measures cannot detract from this fundamental approach.
Since it is necessary to meet citizens' expectations in terms of fighting terrorism, special care must be taken not to fall into excesses or exaggeration, that is to say, 'everything for security' .
The Member States' commitment to building an area of freedom, security and justice was once again reaffirmed at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council.
It is vital that within this area citizens may enjoy the right to express themselves, demonstrate and meet freely and peacefully, provided that they do so in a way which does not constitute a threat, either to their own safety or to the safety of other citizens and property.
Here too, we must not exaggerate.
Any individual or group of people wishing to take part in legitimate demonstrations should not be blocked at the borders, that is, they cannot be denied the right to cross frontiers, i.e. they cannot be denied freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right granted to all citizens of the Union by the Treaty.
Because security is merely an instrument to ensure freedom.
Security loses its meaning when it prejudices freedom.
Security without freedom is tyranny.
In this festive season, my best wishes to Commissioner AntÃ³nio Vitorino for the continuation of his excellent work.
Mr President, as this is a debate which deals with various topics, I would firstly like to say that I completely agree with all that Mr Watson said in relation to his report.
It appears to me that Parliament is going to make a worthwhile contribution today in confronting a violent situation in the streets of Europe which is a worry to us all.
With regard to the advances made in the area of freedom, security and justice, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission on what they were able to achieve yesterday, especially with regard to the European arrest warrant, and I would also like to congratulate the Council for a very particular reason, for the sincerity of the report from the Belgian Presidency with regard to the progress made.
Just as the Council does in its report, I would like to express my concern at the lack of progress made in the area of common asylum policy, and even more so in the area of common immigration policy.
Not only is there no European policy but, as we have seen recently, there are quite a few governments who are developing their own new national policies, and, what is inexcusable in some cases, justifying these decisions citing Europe as the underlying cause.
I hope that in Laeken we can make progress, however small, and make a new commitment in accordance with what the Commission said in its two communications on asylum and on immigration.
On the other hand, I think that the agreement reached on the mutual recognition of judicial decisions, the so-called European arrest warrant, is very important.
This seems to me to be a giant step forward, of course, in the fight against terrorism, but also in the fight against money laundering, in the fight against corruption, in the fight against human trafficking, including of women for sexual exploitation, and in the fight against organised crime.
To me, this seems important, but it also seems that we should take some time to think and it is this that, thirdly, I would like to ask the Council: I think that in Laeken you should take into account not only the advances made in the agenda but also how these have been achieved and which problems must be dealt with.
It seems to me that the unanimity and the lack of real power of this Parliament do not help.
We are living in a world of paradoxes.
A few days ago, in a manner of speaking, we said that Bin Laden had provided the impetus for implementing methods for fighting terrorism that the Commission had been planning and that Parliament had requested some time ago.
Paradoxically, it was also the spectacle made by Mr Berlusconi' s government that brought the debate on the European arrest warrant onto the front page of the papers.
I would sincerely have preferred for this debate to have taken place in Parliament, for there to have been a public debate and for you to have accepted it.
I would like to tell you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that I am pleased that you appreciate the institutional loyalty of this Parliament.
I would just like it if you could, in return for this, display a little more institutional loyalty in the analysis of our texts, in the inclusion of some of our positive ideas in your documents and I think that this would help in strengthening the positive nature of the Commission/Parliament/Council work cycle.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be relatively brief.
I only have four objections: one about the past, one about yesterday, in a manner of speaking, one about tomorrow, although I really mean the day after tomorrow, and one about the future.
Let me start with the past.
I think that the concept of creating a European area of freedom, security and justice first saw the light of day about 25 years ago.
I think that we have taken a number of essential steps in the right direction without crowing about it, but also without achieving the results we want to achieve.
We did not - and I would like to say this here in the European Parliament - have to organise a witch-hunt or use Gestapo-style practices.
On the contrary, anyone who has read the Watson report and the advice from the European Parliament and who knows the position of the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and that of the Commission, knows that we do not use such methods.
However, yesterday - and I am now thinking back to Tampere 1999 when we took the decision to put a series of recommendations to the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs - I discovered that since then we have in fact been correctly following the three paths that were delineated there to create this area, namely those of harmonisation, mutual cooperation and the creation of players.
Tomorrow, and by that I mean the day after tomorrow, I hope that at the Laeken Summit we will give new impetus to the Amsterdam resolutions and the Tampere recommendations that have not yet been implemented.
I am saying this here with all the more conviction because I believe that there are two areas to which attention absolutely must be paid: the fight against trafficking in human beings and the fight against the sexual and economic exploitation of children.
And finally to the future.
I have often heard people say that we would have to choose between freedom and security, but I do not think that is necessary.
Justice and security are two instruments that are necessary in order to guarantee freedoms.
A pertinent comment that I often hear, and one that we cannot ignore, is that we will have to ask ourselves about institutional decision-making and more specifically whether unanimity should be maintained in the third pillar.
These are a number of objections that I wanted to put to the European Parliament at the end of this debate.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you very briefly, in reply to a question put during the debate, that the American President wrote a letter to the Belgian Prime Minister and to the President of the European Commission pointing to a number of areas in which the United States of America considered that there was a need to deepen cooperative relations with the European Union in the fight against terrorism.
Prime Minister Verhofstadt and President Prodi replied to that letter on 28 November.
That is the first point I want to clarify.
There is no private or special correspondence between the President of the European Commission and the American President.
There was an exchange of letters between the American President and the European Union, represented by both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission.
On the substantive questions, let me tell you quite frankly that the truth is that we had already taken decisions on most of the aspects referred to by President Bush, during the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting of 20 September; these decisions were in fact supported by the Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Brussels on 21 September.
Looking to the future, I believe that there are some difficult areas in the context of cooperation with the United States; we must not conceal that fact.
Incidentally I have always said this and I said it again to Mr Colin Powell, the American Secretary of State, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting last week.
Of course we supported and still support the agreement signed between Europol and the American police agencies on cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The agreement does not cover possible exchanges of personal data because we realise that this is a sensitive area in which the Europeans and Americans apply different standards. So this area will have to be approached separately as a specific task, which we will indeed do as soon as possible.
Secondly, there is one rather important area of cooperation, namely judicial assistance; as soon as Eurojust is established definitively, we will have an important tool in our hands for mutual judicial assistance with third countries.
Here again, however, we will have to clarify the rules on exchanges of personal data within the framework of mutual judicial assistance involving third countries.
Thirdly, on the subject of extradition, I agree with what Mr Watson said about the internal imbalance of the US Patriot Act as regards the legal status of US citizens vis-Ã -vis other citizens, including Europeans.
That is no doubt an area we will have to look at together with our American friends.
I also had occasion to say that Europe has not taken any exceptional measures to combat terrorism.
We have not derogated from the Charter of Fundamental Rights; we have not introduced any exceptional measures to combat terrorism, so I do not think it is fair to criticise Europe for being in the process of adopting measures it is not in fact adopting.
All the measures that have been taken to combat terrorism and that are now in force are measures based on the existing legislative framework or are measures, such as the European arrest warrant or the framework decision on terrorism, which were planned well before 11 September. Furthermore, in the case of the European arrest warrant, there is no doubt at all: we were asked to introduce it by the Heads of State and Government in October 1999 to replace extradition.
All those who keep on trying to interpret these measures as emergency measures are wrong: no, Europe did not react to the terrorist threat by departing from its fundamental principles or taking emergency measures.
It reacted by taking measures that were no doubt introduced in an exceptional climate, but that are measures we had been asked to take and that had been planned a long time ago.
Moreover, on the question of extradition, let me repeat to the European Parliament that the Commission has always said that we have never changed our position on the death penalty and that we have said quite plainly that our position in this dialogue did not allow for any possibility of extradition to Member States that apply the death penalty.
Having said that, I will certainly read the resolution the European Parliament is about to adopt very closely and reflect carefully on the implications of your recommendation.
I do not agree with Mr Di Lello, for, in my view, if there are guarantees that the death penalty will not be applied that is sufficient to guarantee respect for the fundamental values.
This needs to be said very plainly.
Finally, Mr President, I want to tell you that I hope the Laeken European Council will enable us to give fresh impetus to the major task of establishing the area of freedom, security and justice, in the field of asylum and immigration as in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation, by accepting the gradual and pragmatic approach we are taking.
I have no illusions, however.
When it comes to turning Europe into an area of freedom, security and justice, we are looking at the very heart of European political cooperation. We know, from our 50 years of experience, that this political integration is never easy.
That said, we shall persevere because I believe that our citizens expect us to find a political response to the needs of European integration.
That is why I am so excited to be taking part, at your side, in this project for an area of freedom, security and justice.
Mr President, I should like to say to Mr Tajani, who has accused my Group of criticising and being against his government and Italy, that only the first part of what he said is true and that the confusion between criticism of the government and criticism of the country, nation or its people is the first step on a very dangerous path, which in Europe we all know very well.
(Applause from the left)
I inform you that I have received two motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote on the reports will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The vote on the motions for resolutions will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.20 a.m. and resumed at 11.30 a.m.)
Mr President, I wish to denounce the unacceptable behaviour of Mr Schmid, who was acting President this morning, who during the debate allowed some left-wing Members to make really personal attacks on Members of the Italian centre-right and in particular the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, as well as involving President Fontaine by accusing her somehow of blocking in an evidently improper manner the request to waive Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity.
I believe and we believe it is unacceptable that Members from other countries should attack the sovereignty of the Italian Government and the democratic choices of its people.
If this unfortunate habit and this constant lowering of tone are not stopped, next session we shall make sure we bring to this House' s attention all the examples, public and private, of European party leaders who, in our view, damage Europe' s image.
Mr President, I want to appeal to the Rules of Procedure, with regard to Rule 116.
This morning, during the debate on the Watson report - a particularly heated debate - in the course of the speech by Mr Schulz, who had attacked the Italian Prime Minister, the President of Parliament and certain Italian Members, there was an interruption from the public, who loudly applauded what Mr Schulz said.
I appealed to the acting President - I did not argue with Mr Schulz, naturally - and asked him to make the members of the public present in the House remain silent.
I recall that Rule 116 says: 'Members of the public admitted to the galleries shall remain seated and keep silent.
Any person expressing approval or disapproval shall immediately be ejected by the ushers.'
When I turned to President Schmid I was given the following answer: 'You are right, but I cannot tie the hands of those present in the House.'
I believe the acting President contravened the Rules of Procedure.
I believe the Rules of Procedure should be obeyed to the letter: this applies to the left, the centre and the right; it applies to everybody, because it is the Rules of Procedure that dictate civilised coexistence in this House.
This is Parliament, not the Strasbourg stadium!
Mr President, on Monday evening I asked Mrs Fontaine to make the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi available to all Members.
Mrs Fontaine replied that it would be done.
The next day, during the meeting of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission representative expressed surprise that Members had not seen Mr Prodi' s letter of reply to Mr Bush.
These letters have still not been made public.
In plenary this morning, Mr Vitorino acknowledged that this exchange of letters was not private and that Mr Prodi had replied in the name of Parliament as a whole.
Before the highly important vote we will soon be holding on relations between Europe and the United States, I would urgently ask for the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi to be made available to all Members.
Mr Krivine, I am informed that Mrs Fontaine has not received a copy of this letter.
If one arrives before the end of the day, a copy will, of course, be sent to all Members.
Mr President, personal reference to me having been made for a second time, I am unfortunately obliged to comment on it, and I do so referring not to Mrs Angelilli's assertions, but to what has just been said by Mr Tajani.
Mr Tajani is right to say that the Rules of Procedure do not permit manifestations of approval from the galleries, but we have to recall what happened.
Mr Tajani had made several interjections during my speech, whereupon I remarked that I could better understand his behaviour now that I could see him, or have a better understanding of why the citizens of Rome did not elect him mayor.
Vigorous applause then broke out in the galleries.
"Vox populi, vox dei" - even if the Rules of Procedure make no provision for that.
(Vigorous applause)
Mr Schulz, allow me to comment that appealing to this saying is not at all appropriate in this House because, if vox populi were the voice of the galleries, we could also do without debating, speaking and voting.
Mr President, I would like to clarify just two things.
The first is that, while chairing the sitting, I heard applause, but was not sure that it came from the gallery.
Secondly, when the honourable gentleman spoke up, I told him that he was in the right and also pointed out that I could do nothing about the gallery after the event, but it was made clear that applause is not permitted.
That is what has to be done under the Rules of Procedure.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Vote
Owing to financial interests, I shall abstain from voting on this report and the following four.
Mr President, although strictly speaking Rule 9 does not provide for this, I would like to declare an interest in relation to the four reports on the Telecom package.
Mr President, the Commission has passed its opinion on the amendments to the Sittings Directorate, and this is widely known by Parliament.
In addition to that, I wish to reply to the rapporteur's question.
If this directive is adopted as now proposed, the Commission will publish the relevant MHP multimedia home-platform standards in the list of standards published in the Official Journal of the European Communities under Article 16 of the Framework Directive.
According to this directive, Member States have to encourage the implementation of the standards contained in the list.
One year after the date of application of these directives, the Commission will examine whether interoperability and freedom of choice for users have been adequately achieved in the Member States.
If that is not the case, the Commission can propose making implementation of relevant European standards mandatory.
The directive requires the Commission to carry out a public consultation on such a proposal.
Following the public consultation, the proposal would be submitted to a regulatory committee procedure requiring support from a qualified majority of Member States before being adopted as a formal Commission decision.
I should like to remind Members that there are links between amendments that may be adopted or rejected and amendments that may lapse, and between the Paasilinna report and other reports in the whole telecommunications package, and therefore we must be rather careful.
Mr President, I understand the need to maintain the integrity of the telecoms package, but I understand there have been some final changes to the declaration the Commission has issued on 'must carry' rules.
I would like to know whether this text genuinely reflects Parliament's views, particularly the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and whether the Commission would be kind enough to read out that text so that we can see what we are agreeing to vote on.
Mr President, if you had given me the floor first, as rapporteur, I would have been able to cover the point raised by Mrs McCarthy.
Could I just formally ask you for a separate vote on Amendments Nos 2, 11, 23 and 24?
I have been asked to do this as a formality, even though it is included in colleagues' voting lists.
Could I also say to colleagues that this is part of the compromise package we discussed.
I want to make it clear in your voting list, colleagues, that the first part of Amendment No 15 is part of the compromise text and I am recommending you vote against the second part.
My Amendment No 36 is also part of the compromise text, and for clarity for colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee, this is the amendment you voted on in committee with just the addition of the word 'television' after 'digital interactive'.
That was a compromise.
I agreed with the Council to clarify the wording - there have been no other changes.
Can I also make it absolutely clear that Amendment No 11 is also a compromise text and that is shown at the bottom of your voting list.
I turn now to the points quite rightly raised by my shadow rapporteur, Mrs McCarthy, on the question of 'must carry' obligations.
This is an issue that many colleagues are concerned about and reflects Article 31 of the proposal.
I am recommending that you vote against the committee amendment as part of the compromise but I would ask you, Mr President, to give the floor to Mr Liikanen.
He has prepared a statement clarifying the access provisions for public service broadcasters in the whole electronic communication package.
That access provision is the key concern of colleagues.
So, can I ask you to give Mr Liikanen the floor?
Mr Harbour, if I had seen you before Mrs McCarthy, I would have given you the floor before her.
I could not have foreseen that she would speak first.
In the light of Parliament's concern over the extension of 'must carry' obligations to conditional access and other associated facilities, the Commission wishes to make the following statement.
First, the provision of Article 6 of the access and interconnection directive guarantees all broadcasters access to conditional access systems on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.
Under Article 5(1)(b) of the access and interconnection directive, Member States may impose obligations to provide such access on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, on other associated facilities, in particular application programme interfaces (APIs) and electronic programming guides (EPGs).
Second, the Commission will monitor the application of these provisions at Member State level, including 'must carry' obligations, taking into account any problems that public service or any other specified broadcasters may have in gaining access to satellite and other broadcast networks.
The possibility of guidelines for Member States could be considered.
Third, the free movement of television broadcasting services in the Union is covered by the 'television without frontiers' directive.
In its forthcoming review of this directive, the Commission will assess inter alia the impact of technological and market developments on the production and distribution of European audiovisual networks.
In conclusion, I have noted the importance the European Parliament attaches to the promotion of multicultural and multilingual Europe, also in this context.
Mr President, if I heard the Commissioner correctly he said the possibility of guidelines 'could' be considered.
Did I mishear that?
The House needs to know whether they 'will' be considered.
Commissioner Liikanen spoke in your language, Mr Perry, so I think it is quite clear!
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to repeat this part?
Mr President, please permit me to address a question to the Commission before the vote is taken.
The text that the Commission originally submitted for a resolution envisaged the formation of an expert group on radio spectrum policy to continually discuss radio spectrum matters.
The European Parliament was to be involved in these discussions.
Legal and institutional considerations make it impossible to embed the founding of this group in the Frequency Decision, but I would ask the Commission whether they are holding to their original intention and establishing such a group by a Commission decision, that is to say on a voluntary basis.
If so, will Parliament be involved in the work of this Group?
I turn to the Commission again for its opinion on the amendments.
Mr President, as the EPP shadow rapporteur I should like to ask if your secretarial office is in possession of an erratum regarding point 5.5, which the translation office has circulated but which, oddly enough, does not yet appear in the text distributed so far: it is a note made some time ago regarding a very serious translation error which falsifies the rapporteur' s original text.
In point 5, fourth line, the rapporteur wrote: 'The use of guns must be absolutely avoided.'
I repeat, the rapporteur' s text says: 'The use of guns must be absolutely avoided' , and the translation is: 'The use of guns must be absolutely forbidden.'
There is a substantial difference there, apart from the fact that Parliament can, I believe, neither consent to nor forbid the use of guns by any police force in this Community.
In any case, the translation is evidently wrong.
I should like to check whether you are in possession of this corrigendum before voting - irrespective, therefore, of the result of the vote.
Mr Santini, at the beginning of the vote on the Watson report I had already pointed out that there was a corrigendum to the Italian version.
A further check will, of course, be made on the basis of your remarks.
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Report (A5-0414/2001) by Mrs Hazan, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Council report on European Union priorities and policy objectives for external relations in the field of justice and home affairs [7653/2000 - C5-0102/2001 - 2001/2051(COS)]
(Parliament adopted the resolution)EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Jackson report (A5-0383/2001)
. I voted against the Jackson report on Codex Alimentarius because I am heartily sick of the gross intrusion into the European Parliament e-mail system of mass mailing of lobby letters.
It has been totally counterproductive and every effort will be made in future to prevent similar intrusions.
Dary report (A5-0443/2001)
For more than thirty years, the European Union has worked hard to construct its special partnership agreement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific States.
It was within this policy of openness and solidarity that the common organisation of the market in bananas was established to guarantee access to the European market for a certain percentage of the bananas produced by ACP countries, which include some of the poorest countries in the world.
This measure was opposed from the outset by the major, multinational banana companies, which are very competitive, but this often entails exploitation verging on slavery!
Owing to political pressure, economic sanctions, compromises and concessions, the entire quantity protection system will be abolished from 2006 and will be replaced by a protection system based solely on tariffs. As yet, no one knows how effective this will be in protecting the interests of the traditional ACP banana producers.
The agreement reached in April 2001 did of course end the trade war that had poisoned our relationship with the United States for almost ten years. But some of the measures genuinely are a bitter pill for the ACP countries to swallow.
These include the abolition, in 2006, of quota protection guaranteeing traditional producers access to the European market and a 100 000-tonne reduction in the guaranteed production quantity from January 2002. In addition, they are affected by the deficiencies and delays of the financial and technical assistance measures established to help ACP producers adapt to the new market conditions.
They are still waiting to receive their payments.
Michel Dary' s report, that we will reach a decision on today, proposes that we offer the ACP countries a number of safety nets to be used during the transition period, before they step out into the unknown when the common organisation of the market in bananas ceases to exist.
(Speech shortened pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
Ever since 1993, the issue of bananas has been at the heart of trade relations between the European Union and the United States.
Some have even gone so far as to say that it has poisoned transatlantic relations and that this conflict should be resolved as quickly as possible.
I would even venture to say that it should be resolved at any cost.
Those in positions of power, like Louis Vuitton, HermÃšs and Gucci have had enough!
So much so that people all over the world from the West Indies to Brussels and Strasbourg, some individuals have decided to fight back rather than capitulate.
But who in Parliament can fail to recognise that by giving in to the diktat of the United States, in the guise of the WTO, the European Union is supporting future unemployment? At some point in the long term, 35 000 people in the Canary Islands will be made unemployed, and 30 000 in the West Indies.
Who can fail to recognise that by progressively giving in on this issue, the European Union is disregarding its social model, which it is so keen to export throughout the world?
Finally, who can fail to recognise that by giving in now on this issue, in the future we will inevitably have to give in on sugar, and not just on sugar cane but also on sugar beet? Soon we will have to write off our own agricultural model.
Mr Dary has not avoided these various issues and I think that this Parliament should be proud of having voted in favour of his report today.
Inspired by the strength of our democratic legitimacy, we have chosen the path of resistance, in the face of the intransigence of the European Commission.
Our request for 'cyclone' licences to be available when crops are destroyed and, particularly, our demand for a transition period prior to the start of a purely tariff-based system in 2006 illustrate our opposition perfectly.
This is why I naturally voted in favour of the report by Mr Dary. Overall, I felt it was pertinent to the issues involved, despite having some reservations, which, as I explained to the rapporteur, relate to the distribution within quota C between Caribbean and African producers.
Given Africa' s trade links, in which France has been pivotal for historic reasons, I fear that this change will represent a further blow for the European producers of Guadeloupe and Martinique.
Paasilinna report (A5-0435/2001)
Mr President, Mr Paasilinna' s framework directive refers in general to all rules concerning the creation, maintenance, development and improvement of citizens' communications networks that are integrated together, that is, they provide for the use of televisions, computers and telephones.
I voted for this report with pensioners and the elderly in mind, Mr President.
What have the elderly and pensioners to do with this document?
Well, they are the ones who spend most time in front of the television and so, as end-users of these technological advances, they should be taken into consideration.
Unfortunately, they are not taken into consideration enough in this document.
Brunetta report (A5-0434/2001)
Mr Brunetta' s report, Mr President, also refers to telecommunications, and particularly access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities.
Going back to what I said in the last explanation of vote, although this is a document that I approve of in its entirety, here too, unfortunately, I have noticed something missing: there is no provision to allow access to these means of electronic communication - i.e. television, the Internet, mobile telephones - at rates suited to those who are elderly or pensioners, receive modest pensions and should be entitled to have access to these means of electronic communication without any further financial burden, and even with state support.
Niebler report (A5-0433/2001)
The Niebler report, as you have said, Mr President, refers to authorisations for electronic communications service networks.
As the representative of the Pensioners' Party, I voted for it, but I should like - and this is something lacking in this document - exemption from payment of various fees, charges and rates when authorisation is granted for new television service and network players to enter the market.
In this document there is nothing to help those who propose to use these means of communication to give information on employment rights, pension rights or social matters of interest to all citizens, particularly the elderly.
Harbour report (A5-0438/2001)
Mr President, Mr Harbour' s document - another directive on telecommunications, on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services - seeks amongst other things to obtain the greatest possible benefit for consumers.
If, then, what I said in the previous explanation of vote is true, that consumers are for the most part the elderly and pensioners, that means that it should seek the greatest possible benefit for the elderly and pensioners.
That is precisely what many pensioners asked me when once again they went with me to the airport on Sunday afternoon, when I was catching the plane to Strasbourg.
They asked me to tell Parliament, with regard to these documents, that they would like there to be much more on television about their problems and their desires.
Can I say that we fully understand the wish of the Commission and Council to ensure the success of the telecom package in advance of the Laeken Summit.
It is vital to achieve the Lisbon targets, but as the shadow PSE rapporteur, I wish to complain about the procedure.
I also object to the deals which have been struck at the last minute behind closed doors resulting in a compromise package which seriously weakens the provisions for must-carry services and for people with special needs and disabilities.
These were approved unanimously in the Legal Affairs Committee.
It was of course disappointing that the British Conservative rapporteur informed me of his decision to abandon these important provisions for consumers and users in order to achieve political expediency.
My delegation or the Labour MEPs voted in favour to maintain the committee's positions on these important provisions.
Can we remind perhaps the Commission and Council that we are co-legislators, not co-drafters of declarations which have no legal force and rely on the Commission's goodwill to deliver on must-carry.
We will, of course, monitor the Commission's progress to deliver on these provisions.
I have to say that today was a victory for Laeken, for the Commission and Council on the telecoms package, but it was not a victory for democracy in this House.
I would first of all like to remind you of the background to this report. To begin with it was allocated to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, like other reports on the telecoms package.
At that time I was appointed rapporteur. Then the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market declared that it was the responsible committee and the report was handed over to Malcolm Harbour, a British Member of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I remained the draftsman of the opinion, but the opinion I expressed had little influence in the discussions!
This is a terrible shame, especially when the issue is the protection of universal service in such an important sector which is undergoing such important changes.
The report adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs last November makes astonishing reading. The measures relating to universal service have been reduced to a disappointing level and the report focuses mainly on consumer protection.
As I said in my report of the opinion, if universal service includes, within the definition of its component services, the same kind of criteria that are usually used to assess services provided for consumers (affordable prices, availability, delivery timetables and quality), its raison d' Ãªtre has different types of objectives if we look at the issue for the point of view of regional policy, social policy (preventing the poorest people from being excluded) or public safety policy.
I would like to stress the importance for democracy of the ability to access new communication networks.
New technologies make it possible for people to speak out, to participate in democratic debate and to influence decisions.
Technology can also be used to bring government closer to the people.
Local democracy can benefit greatly from the interactive aspect of online local public services.
Public services can be given a new lease of life through these new technologies, if the means are made available to them, and of course if they have the will to do so.
Lastly, Internet access is essential to the creation of a knowledge-based information society.
The committee' s proposal needs to be improved in order to meet these challenges. This is what I attempted to do in my amendments, all which were rejected by Mr Harbour.
Today we have voted on a report that proposes some interesting changes concerning the protection of consumers, particularly disabled consumers, and the 'must carry' principle, but which, regrettably, cannot claim to provide universal service in this sector!
Niebler report (A5-0432/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Niebler' s report on the radio spectrum in the European Community and its distribution, just as I voted for all the measures on telecommunications.
In my opinion, however, a quota should have been reserved for Europe of the frequencies available for the electromagnetic emissions with which the electronic messages are sent which are then converted into pictures on our televisions and computers and into signals in fixed or mobile telephones.
Europe must take the lead in the future, and it will only be able to do so if frequencies are available for Europe as such and not just for the national States.
Trakatellis report (A5-0420/2001)
Mr President, EUR 280 million is being appropriated to public health care.
Do not worry, I am not about to suggest you become a surgeon - although, for all I know, you might be dreaming of becoming a surgeon. I would just like to say that, with regard to this Community action programme, that I hope that the resources of all 15 Member States of the Union will be combined to fund a single European programme which, in addition to the funds appropriated by us, will also benefit from the funds that the individual national States make available to it from their national budgets.
In particular, however, I call for a reduction in the working hours of those who work in toxic environments and, as a result, suffer from occupational illnesses, for this is one of the causes of the high public health costs, not just in terms of human lives but in financial terms as well.
The programme of Community action in the field of public health is an important element of the work towards improved public health in Europe.
Public health is an issue close to the heart of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and a precondition for a dignified and decent life.
We therefore support the Commission' s proposal and the amendments proposed by Parliament in its first reading.
However, it is our view that the amendments proposed by Parliament in its second reading would only lead to the concept of public health being undermined, to a breach of Article 152 of the Treaty and to encroachment upon Member States' self-determination in the area of health care.
We have therefore chosen to vote against all the amendments, with the exception of Amendment 1 on respect for the principle of subsidiarity in the area of public health and Amendment 60 on reduced resistance to antibiotics.
. (NL) Without democratic regulation by the state, health becomes a commodity.
This commodity is available to anyone who is rich and powerful but not to anyone who is poor and powerless.
We see that the average life expectancy of disadvantaged population groups is shorter than that of privileged groups.
There is constant pressure to replace income-dependent insurance premiums with a premium that is the same for everyone regardless of their income.
Commercial companies offer special care to anyone who can and will pay for it.
Hospitals are going into the commercial market; people with the most money can queue-jump and loss-making treatments are being scrapped.
Waiting lists are being created, people are being referred to distant hospitals in other Member States, and the number of unnecessary deaths is increasing.
To combat this trend, it is important for governments to provide good healthcare that is accessible to everyone.
A European programme of Community action in the field of public health can contribute to this.
However, it is necessary that the amendments rejected after the first reading get a comfortable majority today, so that we can clearly establish that health is not a commodity and is not subject to financial compromises, and that there is a great deal to be improved in the area of healthcare in many Member States, which has been neglected for the past twelve years.
With regard to this programme, I have voted against the proposal to 'develop a specific action to promote, by means of public awareness/information campaigns, an improved diet and eating habits which are better suited to the needs of the human body' at European level.
The European Union must concentrate on its main tasks - promoting peace and democracy, human rights, free trade and initiatives for improving the environment.
This is the only way for our cooperative venture to win public support and understanding and gain legitimacy among our citizens.
Otherwise, the EU project will still principally be seen as centralising decision-making among only a few people.
This weekend will see discussions on the outline of future EU legislation/new instruments or treaties at the European Council at the Royal Palace of Laeken in Brussels.
Here, it is more important than ever for the European Parliament to show the political maturity and discipline required not to demand new policy measures at European level, but instead to rally around the central joint undertakings.
It is vital that the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam, is actually applied.
A body wholly independent of the EU institutions, the European Court of Justice, should be given the authority to monitor adherence to and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, in order to ensure that more powers are not transferred to European level.
This certainly does not include the centralised implementation of a uniform Europe-wide campaign for 'an improved diet and eating habits' involving all the various cultures, eating habits and tastes that characterise the 370 million citizens of the EU Member States.
Let taste, culture and lifestyle remain different for Greeks, Spaniards, Swedes, British and Germans.
Such diversity is a great asset.
Paulsen report (A5-0408/2001)
Could I express surprise that the compromise package negotiated by the three largest groups has been rejected by the Council?
We would have preferred to have voted on the compromise amendments.
The compromise on the two contentious issues, namely time allowed for setting limits and the right to return contaminated feed to the country of origin with the consent of that country's government, was realistic and workable.
I wish to put on the record the position of the ED wing of the EPP that the Council was crazy to reject the package that was on the table.
If it thinks it can get a better deal in conciliation, then it has another think coming!
Incidentally, the compromise was the best deal for the Italian pensioners as well.
. The implementation of key provisions of the EU White Paper on Food Safety is of paramount importance if we are to restore confidence in the food chain.
The inclusion of undesirable ingredients by feed manufacturers in animal feed was responsible for BSE and the Dioxin scare.
It is to the credit of this Parliament and the other EU institutions that measures were quickly put in place to deal with the crisis and to agree long-.term measures to prevent any re-occurrence.
Today' s debate is a further positive step on this important road ensuring that animal feed available to farmers is of the highest quality.
Not for the first time do I want to put on the record that in all of this sorry debacle, farmers were the innocent victims of circumstances which were beyond their control.
It is also important to say that farmers welcome the controls concerning animal food production.
It is to be regretted that some people used the debate on food safety to undermine the profession of farming and the role of farmers as guarantors of a quality food supply for citizens.
We need to be careful as to how we deal with comments concerning food.
The Dioxin and BSE debates failed to get across the strong message that the quality of European food is the best in the world, and consumers get both quality and value for money.
Any exceptions to this are condemned outright by European farmers.
Recent reports concerning the future of CAP are certainly worrying.
If we are serious about the European model based on family farming, then we must ensure that those who operate within that framework are all guaranteed a decent living.
Lange report (A5-0406/2001)
This document we have just adopted regulates pollutant emissions, particularly from motorcycles.
Mr President, I am sure that you can hear now the deafening noise caused by large numbers of motorcyclists riding through the streets near Parliament.
The noise is unbearable and, most importantly, the pollution is not odourless: quite the opposite, it often stinks.
It is not the effect on our noses which is important but rather the fact that harmful substances are released into the atmosphere.
Would you not agree, Mr President, if you were a policemen trying to enforce these directives we have adopted, that the motorcycles of those who produce so much noise and pollution while using them should be seized without delay?
I would have voted for the motion much more willingly if the directive had included these measures.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on the Directive on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles.
We believe that the recommendation has intrinsic environmental value.
However, in this explanation of vote, we wish to state that we do not agree with Mr Lange' s desire for a binding emission limit for 2006.
We believe that the limit should be voluntary until there are improved grounds for a new limit to be set.
If the limit were to be established now, there would be a risk of emissions from future motorcycles becoming higher than necessary.
We believe Mr Lange' s proposal to use the test cycle for cars is inappropriate as motorcycles are not driven in the same way as cars.
They accelerate in a different way and are usually driven at higher speeds.
Instead, we should wait for the new test cycle currently under development for motorcycles and, until then, have voluntary emission limits.
Turchi report (A5-0439/2001)
Mr President, before I tell you why I voted for the Turchi report, which is on the granting of Community financial assistance in the field of Trans-European Networks, that is to the transport, energy and telecommunications sector, I would like to thank Mr Goodwill, who has joined me in protecting the interests of the pensioner citizens of the whole of Europe, not just Italian pensioners, that is.
We are back to televisions and television programmes - this certainly is the day for telecommunications!
I voted for the motion but I hope that, when we vote on this document in future, in the coming years, economic support will be laid down for television stations which broadcast, in one of our States, programmes made in other States of the European Union.
We have to get to know each other, Mr President - Italians, British, French, Finnish and so forth - and what better way to do so than to watch programmes made in another State, translated into our own languages of course?
I fully agree with the conclusions reached by Mr Turchi.
I would reiterate the points made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism with regard to the lack of information on financing provided by national, regional and local bodies and by the private sector for the completion of TEN projects, since 95% of the financing still comes from outside the EU. There is also a lack of information on specific investment in modes of transport via EIB loans, the financial instruments for third countries, other public and private programmes and the Structural Funds themselves that is broken down by transport mode.
Indeed, the Commission only provided information broken down by transport mode for budget heading B5-0700.
We feel we should also point out that, in future, the Commission should attach to the report a clear, simple table containing dependable, transparent data which can not just be used to monitor the correct use of the amounts already made over but will also improve the scope for planning.
This is a monitoring procedure which the Commission' s report reserved exclusively for the 14 priority projects established at Essen which, as we know, are not the only ones on the list.
Finally, I feel I must draw the Commission' s attention to the need to address properly, once again, the issue of Corridor 8 - which does not even feature in the White Paper - and peripheral regions, which are isolated even more by the excessive focus on Trans-European railway lines and the neglect of the air transport crisis.
Watson report (A5-0396/2001)
I voted against this report, Mr President, because it should have been more vehement in its condemnation of demonstrations. Demonstrations are legitimate in themselves as a means of displaying one' s opposition to a policy - where this is the case - but they must be always and exclusively peaceful.
I myself, Mr President, have demonstrated many times against government decisions with which I did not agree.
What method did I use?
I chained myself to the furniture in the Bergamo municipal council building, I chained myself to the furniture in the Bergamo provincial council building and I chained myself to the furniture in the Lombardy regional council building in Italy.
Who knows, maybe one day in the next two and a half years, I will chain myself to your Presidential bench, Mr President.
In any case, this is a peaceful means of protest; it does not involve arms or violence, unlike the protests which, I am sad to say, have been taking place for some time now throughout the world, which I condemn, which the Pensioners' Party condemns and which everybody here condemns.
Should you decide to act on that deplorable idea, you will be freed from your chains, if necessary against your will!
. (EL) I worry that the European Union is on a slippery slope, with the recent plethora of measures reducing civil liberties.
Unfortunately, Europe is to acquire an arrest warrant before it acquires a constitution.
This being the case, the EU-USA extradition agreement as part of the fight against terrorism is particularly worrying.
Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted by the European Union Council in Nice in France on 7 December 2000 does not allow anyone to be sentenced to death.
This being so, it is unthinkable to cooperate on extradition to the USA, which has the death penalty and where the conditions for a fair trial do not apply following the courts martial or the detention of hundreds of immigrants with no judicial guarantees.
Even if people are only extradited to the USA if the USA promises that "the death penalty will not be applied", the death penalty may be imposed by the court without being enforced.
In this way, with this agreement with the USA on criminal matters, the European Union is reintroducing the death penalty through the back door.
And that is a huge step backwards.
Finally, I should point out that the USA is applying the death penalty en masse in Afghanistan without even any judgements from their own courts.
This was confirmed both by Defence Secretary Rumsfeld yesterday when he said that we would kill Al Qaeda and in its use of the 15000 pound daisy cutter bomb, which is the most powerful non-nuclear bomb of mass destruction.
Dismantling the Taliban and Al Qaeda and punishing those responsible for the crime perpetrated on 11 September in order to set an example is one thing and the mass murder of all its members and supporters, which not even the Nazis suffered, is another.
It is Europe's duty to react.
. (EL)In its own initiative report entitled "Security at meetings of the European Council and other comparable events", the European Parliament committee wrongly named the "Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights...", has forged another link in the heavy chain which the ruling class intends to use to stem the swollen tide of resistance and opposition to its policies.
The rapporteur, Mr Watson, suggests how we can become peaceful and legitimate demonstrators, the first requirement being to work together peacefully and avoid any manifestation of violence.
Ãhe question is, who is guilty of violence and terrorism?
In Nice, Gothenburg and, even more so in Genoa, violence was indeed perpetrated, except that the perpetrators were the police and state forces.
And, more to the point, in both Gothenburg and Genoa, the target of police violence was clearly not the few hot-blooded demonstrators, but the huge crowd of "peaceful" demonstrators.
Then we read that organisers of demonstrations should avoid cooperating with people suspected of carrying out acts of violence.
It is easy to conclude that, if they do not, they run the risk under the forthcoming terrorism law of being sentenced as terrorists for the crime of supporting terrorist action.
Our response is that protecting demonstrations from extremist elements, who are often agents provocateurs, is a matter for the mass grass-roots movement itself.
According to the report, if we want to cross the borders of our country and take part in an international demonstration, we must earn the authorities' trust by convincing them that we intend to demonstrate peacefully in a legitimate demonstration.
We are extremely worried that soon we will be asked for credentials or to sign a statement.
It also suggests that we need to agree on a common definition of "dangerous person and dangerous behaviour" for all the Member States.
This proposal refers to articles about two new black lists which Europol is planning to publish, one for "troublemaking" demonstrators and one for foreigners.
This being so, the report's recommendation that there should be no black lists or new databases is pure hypocrisy.
As far as police violence is concerned, the only thing the report has to say is that a disproportionate use of force should be avoided and it sits firmly on the fence as regards the conduct of the demonstrators and that of the police forces.
In fact, especially in Genoa, the demonstrators faced unprecedented violence on the part of the police, with illegal charges, hundreds of illegal arrests, dozens of injured and the cold-blooded murder of a young man.
It is no coincidence that the UN Commission against Torture has called for a report on events in Diaz and Bozaneto jail in Genoa.
Obviously, the political mouthpieces of the European monopolies know full well that their anti-grass roots policy is going to come up against more and more grass-roots opposition, which is why they are attempting to use repressive measures to terrorise and restrain popular unrest.
However, history has shown that this sort of action always brings in the opposite results.
The reasons behind the grass-roots movement are increasing social inequality and the attack on fundamental social rights.
The longer these reasons apply, the more mass grass-roots resistance and opposition will grow.
It is for these reasons that the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the Watson report.
Hazan report (A5-0414/2001)
Mr President, thank you for your response to my explanation of vote on chaining myself to the President' s bench.
I remember, on one occasion, I could not release myself from the chains because I had unwisely thrown the key out of the window, but your comment makes the idea of carrying out such a peaceful form of protest and there being such a peaceful likely conclusion to it more feasible, more probable and more pleasant.
As regards the Hazan report, which I voted for, I have to say that I particularly welcome the intention it expresses to combat the intolerable level of corruption which persists in all the States of our Europe, but also - and, I would say, in particular, regrettably, in the candidate countries.
Genuine progress must be made when the chapters are closed with these candidate countries.
That concludes voting time.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Middle East
The next item is the joint debate on the statements made by the Council and the Commission concerning the situation in the Middle East and on the proposal for a recommendation (B5-0747/2001) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the crisis in the Middle East and the role of the European Union in the region.
Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, you have the floor.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of December, we once again witnessed a tragic series of events in the Middle East. As time passes, there is a growing risk that the situation could spiral out of control.
The prospect of a serious political dialogue is becoming an increasingly distant possibility. Dialogue however is the only way forward; there is no other credible option.
The various parties appear to lack the confidence and the political will needed to end this crisis, so opening the way for violence and extremism.
It is now more important than ever that the parties concerned are offered help in reaching a different way of thinking.
However, the recent active re-engagement of the United States in the Middle East lead to the expectation of progress towards the resumption of talks.
Unfortunately, the terrible events of recent days have made this work much more difficult.
Nevertheless, the United States, the European Union and the other players most directly concerned have no other choice than to reiterate the firm intention of the international community to prevent extremism and terrorism from undermining diplomatic efforts.
Although the situation in the Middle East is extremely serious, the European Union must not give in.
Both the Israeli and the Palestinian people have the right to live in peace and security.
The Members States of the European Union must therefore work indefatigably towards reconciliation.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is therefore the reason why Mr Shimon Peres and Mr Navril Shaath were each invited to meet the Foreign Ministers separately within the framework of the General Affairs Council of 10 December.
By inviting them, the European Union once again wanted to express its intention to relaunch and continue the political process, and it has therefore used this additional opportunity to prepare the ground for a return to the negotiating table.
In short, it is of prime importance that the European Union once again focuses on the essential need for a political perspective in order to lend weight to the current security negotiations.
The European Union published a declaration after the General Affairs Council of 10 December which was mentioned earlier.
At this juncture, I would like to very briefly repeat the most important elements of this, but at the same time I would like to point out that the text was not shown to either Mr Peres or Mr Shaath before publication.
In this declaration, the European Union clearly sets out the obligations to which it expects both parties to adhere straight away.
With regard to the Palestinian authorities: most importantly, the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, including the arrest and prosecution of all suspects and a public call in Arabic to cease the armed Intifada.
With regard to the Israeli government: the withdrawal of its troops and the cessation of all summary executions, the reversal of the area closures and all the restrictions imposed on the Palestinian people, and finally a freeze on the building of new settlements.
(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this wording clearly demonstrates that the European Union always holds a middle position, siding with neither party. Other external players should follow this example.
The wording also clearly explains the conditions necessary for restoring a basic trust between the parties, and also the conditions needed for a genuine peace process.
The European Union is aware of the complex nature of the undertakings that it is calling for the parties to agree to, especially given the current situation on the ground.
However, these requirements have been established on the basis of a rational assessment of the present differences between the parties, and of the ways of overcoming these in the context of a peace process.
The High Representative Mr Solana has undertaken another visit to the region on a mandate from the General Affairs Council.
He will report back on his mission at the European Council at Laeken.
On this basis, it is thus up to the European Union to continue its work to find the most effective ways of bringing the parties to engage fully in the search for a just and lasting peace.
In the meantime, we remain convinced that the implementation of the Tenet ceasefire plan and Mitchell Committee recommendations is the only way to re-establish a political process in the short term.
The plan and recommendations should be implemented without prerequisites or conditions which extremists only use for their own ends. We must not allow extremists to prevent the resumption of negotiations.
As far as the European Union is concerned, the basis for political negotiations is well known. These are Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the terms of reference of the Madrid Conference, including the principle of exchanging land for peace and the Oslo Accords.
Lastly, the political negotiations have two objectives.
Firstly, the irrevocable right of Israel to exist in peace and security, within its internationally accepted borders, should be fully recognised and reaffirmed. Secondly, a viable and democratic Palestinian state should be established, and the occupation of Palestinian territories should cease.
The European Union also continues to believe that establishing an impartial monitoring body would be in the best interests of both parties. This could help them to overcome the distrust and obstacles encountered in trying to achieve a definitive settlement.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I know that I do not have to explain that the situation is and remains very serious. I know I do not have to explain how important it is that we remain vigilant and ready to act.
Along with the United States and other interested parties, we need to continue to evaluate the potential options, including the possibility that the situation will deteriorate.
The European Union has more than proved its interest and active commitment to seek political solutions, especially in the last few months.
Of course, the parties themselves bear the principal responsibility, but it is important that the international community reaffirms its willingness to help them back onto the path to peace.
(Applause)
Madam President, over the last couple of years I have had the opportunity - perhaps I should say that alas I have had the opportunity - of making all too many statements to this Parliament on the situation in the Middle East.
It is with regret that I note a dramatic deterioration of the situation in the region despite the tremendous efforts of the international community, in particular the United Nations, the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union.
I am dismayed by the fact that more than 1 000 people, Palestinians, Israelis - among them, as we heard this morning, many women and children - have died since September last year.
I am also dismayed at the fact that we have seen the withering away of the aspirations and the hopes that Israelis and Palestinians have pursued since the peace process began ten years ago.
We need to focus our efforts on how to prevent the death of the peace process itself.
Much of what has been achieved with the help of the international community is now at risk.
We want to see two states living side by side, peaceful and prosperous. Today, that prospect seems all too distant.
The number of deaths keeps increasing and so, less importantly, does the record in physical and economic damage.
The World Bank has estimated that the Palestinian economy has suffered losses of between USD 155 million and 165 million in physical damage and USD 2.4 billion of gross national income since September last year.
The number of Palestinians living below the poverty line on less that USD 2 per day will have risen from 600 000 to between 1.2 million and 1.5 million by the end of 2001.
Even worse, the World Bank projects more than 50% of the population may fall below the poverty line by the end of this year.
The economic decline and the non-transfer of taxes owed to the Palestinian Authority by Israel have caused a fall in Palestinian revenues from a monthly average of USD 91 million to USD 22 million.
Palestinians lost more than 100 000 jobs in Israel and about 66 000 jobs in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a result of Israel's closure policy.
But the Israeli economy is also suffering, which is not surprising when one considers the extent of economic interchange that was taking place before the current Intifada.
According to recent forecasts, the year 2001 is going to be one of the worst years since the 1950s for the Israeli economy.
This is mainly caused by the global economic slowdown but also by the current political security crisis.
Preliminary figures indicate that one in five Israelis live below the poverty line, absolute numbers are up by 10% compared to last year and the rate of unemployment stood at 9.3% in the third quarter.
What is the European Union's stance, given this dramatic undermining of political and economic stability in the Middle East?
We understand Israel's longing for security.
We respect the fact that it is the Israeli Government's duty to try to provide safety for its citizens and we also understand Palestinian frustration over the continuous military occupation and the remorseless spread of settlements.
On Monday, as the Minister has just pointed out, the General Affairs Council discussed these issues with Shimon Peres and Nabil Sha'ath.
As ever, they were extremely eloquent in what they said.
The Council's declaration reaffirms Israel's irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognised borders and the need for the establishment of a viable and democratic Palestinian state and an end to the occupation of the Palestinian territories.
The way chosen by people like the late Prime Minister Rabin was to find a negotiated solution leading to two states with the 1967 line roughly as their shared border, Jerusalem as capital of both, and a solution to the refugee issue acceptable to both Israelis and Palestinians.
Unfortunately forces on both the Palestinian and Israeli sides have been working against this goal.
They have set out quite deliberately to destroy the achievements of the Oslo process.
It is our collective duty to try to stop them doing so.
The only way of returning to meaningful negotiations is to embark once and for all on the path laid out in the Mitchell report.
The Council on Monday strongly encouraged the parties to take the first steps to end this devastating and self-fuelling cycle of violence that we have seen over the last 14 months.
I confirm our strong call for the parties to implement the Mitchell report without delay.
It is crucial to apprehend extremists and continue fighting those terrorist groups opposed to the peace process, as the Minister said.
The Union must continue to press the Palestinian Authority to take concrete steps to arrest and bring to justice those who commit terrorist acts.
This is why the Council on Monday called clearly for the dismantling of the terrorist networks of Hamas and Jihad.
And it is equally crucial that Israel withdraws its military forces, ends the extra-judicial killings, and ends the closures and restrictions on Palestinian people, particularly the senseless bombing of property and infrastructure.
It is difficult to see how the destruction of the Gaza airport, the destruction of an EU-funded forensic laboratory and the destruction of vast areas of arable land can help fight terrorism or increase Israel' s security.
I would strongly argue the opposite.
In the World Bank report, they state 'that the main proximate cause of the recession is closure'.
Removing, or significantly easing closure is the most important requirement if further decline is to be arrested and economic pressure removed from the Palestinian population.
Continued economic hardship will make people easier prey for extremists.
We need to persuade Israel that its security will be increased, not hampered, by allowing the Palestinian economy to develop so as to give people a reason to hope for a better future.
Where in history is there an example of poverty and economic decline leading to greater security and political moderation?
Let me add to this an argument put by Henry Siegman - a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a distinguished expert on the Middle East - in the article in the International Herald Tribune today, which I strongly recommend to all Members of this House.
Mr Siegman wrote as follows: 'policies which reinforce the despair of Palestinians by killing their hope for an end to the occupation will inevitably fuel escalating violence'.
We must not allow ten years of political and financial investment to be wasted.
The European Union has contributed more than EUR 3 billion to the West Bank and Gaza Strip since 1994.
Some may say unfairly that the European Union is only a payer and not a player.
I have heard that remark in this Chamber.
But what we have done is to provide some grounds for hope - and in recent months to prevent further economic misery and to keep the Palestinian Authority barely alive and in place by providing EUR 108 million in budgetary aid over the last 14 months.
Some people have criticised us for that, although members of the Israeli Government have explicitly supported these efforts in the past.
We have worked to maintain the only viable partner in peace that Israel can find and we should continue to support the Palestinian Authority, especially in its fight against terrorism.
Although the Palestinian Authority has made mistakes and must correct them, the Palestinian Authority is the only structure that can provide stability in the Palestinian territories.
It is the provider of necessary basic services and in the end the guarantor for a minimum of security for both the Palestinians and the Israelis.
If the Palestinian Authority is disabled, we will face a situation of anarchy where Hamas and Jihad will no doubt gather increasing support and local extremist committees will compete in an escalation of violence.
It is utterly absurd to suggest that by doing this we are funding terrorists.
Our funding actually helps to strengthen the secular administration against the real terrorist organisations.
We have put a considerable number of safeguards in place that allow us to monitor the use of our funds.
The most important of these is the regular checking and reporting by the International Monetary Fund on the austerity budget agreed by the Palestinian Authority.
I want to make this point very strongly.
The European Union has done more than anyone else to promote elections, the fight against corruption, and the rule of law in the Palestinian territories.
There is much further to go.
But how do we best promote decency, moderation and pluralism?
By allowing public services in the Palestinian territories to collapse or by trying to keep them going against the odds and by trying to promote reform?
The alternative to the Palestinian Authority is Palestinian anarchy.
However long and difficult the road, we should remain committed to supporting moderates, whoever they are and while - thank God - they still exist, on both sides of this tragic feud.
Some commentators have referred to the problems in the Middle East as one of the root causes of terrorism - or they have pointed out that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been and is abused as a cheap excuse for violence or as a wicked justification for committing evil criminal acts.
The international community needs to take action now to help resolve this potentially explosive situation.
The risk of wider regional spillover is very real and we must use every means to prevent a return to the time when the Palestinian cause was pursued largely through terrorism.
One final point.
Today the focus is mainly on Afghanistan.
But increasingly it will shift to the Middle East.
If we are to solve the problems there, it is no good dwelling in the past, exchanging half-truths, casting blame, arguing about what Mr Arafat should have done at Camp David or what Mr Sharon should not have done on the Holy Mount.
What is past is past.
Peace will only come if there is a real and brave and lasting commitment to achieving it, looking ahead to a brighter future, ignoring those who try to derail the whole process through terrorist acts of violence and by disproportionate military responses.
That is the way progress was made in the past, for example by Mr Rabin.
It must be the path that we Europeans advocate for the future.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I must say that these two speeches and also the Council's decision this week demonstrate how seriously we have to approach this problem, and that the European Union, both in the observations that have been made here, and also in this resolution, has sent a clear signal as to what is to be supported.
We in Parliament would like our recommendation to contribute to the European Union's ability to be an intermediary in this region, finding an opportunity to achieve a peaceful solution.
If I might put it in cautious terms, we will assuredly be able to achieve a balanced text within the framework of the resolution, that is, during tomorrow's procedure.
There is no need for me to analyse the situation now, and I wish to support what Chris Patten said - that there is no point whatever in looking for questions of guilt among the issues currently facing us.
What we do know is that the situation has got worse since Arafat refused to give way at Camp David and Sharon went to the Temple Mount. Moreover, 11 September did not contribute to a more reflective mood.
Instead, things have worsened since then, and what is now at stake is the breaking of the cycle of violence.
There comes a point where it no longer makes sense to ask who is guilty and who innocent, because the cycle of violence no longer has a discernible beginning or end.
As Europeans, we not only have a great interest in peace being genuinely established in this region, but it is in our most fundamental interest, as the whole issue of the Mediterranean and the issue of terrorism defy solution unless the conflict in the Middle East is resolved.
I am not saying that the Middle East conflict is at the root of these issues, but it serves as an excuse for many of the things that cause us grave concern, and it is for this reason that the resolution of this problem in our neighbourhood is in our own fundamental interest.
Having, as Chris Patten rightly said, given this amount of financial help to date, we therefore want to take this situation as our starting point in joining the United States in playing an active political role in this region.
It is clear that we are working with two basic presuppositions.
As far as the first is concerned, it is absolutely clear that Israel's citizens must be able to live within frontiers that are secure and recognised.
That is an absolute requirement. It is not even up for discussion, as Israelis have a right to it for reasons which I, as a German, do not need to justify in detail, and which are obvious.
The second point is that the Palestinian people, too, must be able to look forward to a state of their own in which they can shape their own future.
What this means is that we must make an attempt at progressive removal of the factors that work against this.
Settlements and occupation do not help the Palestinians to develop in an appropriate way.
Terrorism on the part of the Palestinians does not contribute to a feeling of security in Israel and to Israeli withdrawal.
I do think we can now clearly see that Arafat is, for this reason, in a position to act against Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
It would, then, have made sense for him to do so at an earlier stage, but if it is to be done now, that should be enough, and combating them with all vigour should be seen as a precondition, just as much as Israel' s refraining from hampering subsequent development by riddling the infrastructure in Palestine with bullet holes.
It must, though, be clear to us in exactly the same way that the return of the refugees must not be used as a means towards imperilling the existence of the State of Israel.
The Arab states must also see that keeping people in camps is not the right way either.
With our financial support, the whole of the Arab world must help young people to come out of the camps and to have enough of a chance to grow up.
The Council and the Commission are well aware that Parliament is ready to contribute financially, too, to significant solutions, if it would help to achieve peaceful development.
We believe that our position on the guaranteeing of human rights must be seen in the right context, both by the Palestinian Authority and in the State of Israel.
We have seen three winners of the Sakharov Prize here today - a Muslim, a Jewish woman and a Christian, thus representing the three monotheistic religions.
This, I believe, is where the starting point is to be found.
These three religions, which have so overwhelmingly given the world its shape over the past millennia, must find in themselves the strength to achieve a peaceful solution in that centre which was their source, so that people adhering to these three faiths may be able to live together in the city that is holy to them all, Jerusalem.
I believe that this is what our actions must accomplish.
I believe this to be one of the tasks for us in our day, perhaps the central one.
Madam President, from the start of this legislature, the European Parliament, through its various bodies, has been working extremely hard to achieve peace in this region, making its contribution, of both a political and an economic nature, through the Union budgets.
As Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Israel, it has been a privilege to share initiatives and trips with Mrs Morgantini, the Chairperson of the Delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council.
Although we have certainly not always shared the same point of view, I am convinced that we have always shared the same good intentions.
We have travelled together with Mrs Fontaine, the President of this House, and last Monday, as has already been mentioned, we received Mr Avram Burg, President of the Israeli Parliament and Mr Abu Ala, President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
We had lunch with this year' s winners of the Sakharov prize this very afternoon - as Mr Brok has just mentioned - a prize whose award is intended to symbolise and be understood as an expression of the European Parliament' s good intentions.
We are now participating in this debate on a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy.
I think that, right now, for the first time, we are facing a situation where no reason can be found to be optimistic and for this very reason, I think that the Council recommendation is most appropriate and useful, above all in its final version which the Groups agreed on this morning and which I am sure we will vote for, because the only thing left is intercession, even international intervention, without which we would probably be facing a situation of all-out war.
Faced with today' s tragic circumstances, which are worsened by the international crisis, I firmly believe that the various parliamentary Groups should put our party political differences to one side, which would make our contribution, and that of the representatives of the European Union in this region, all the more effective.
The situation we are experiencing is not akin to some kind of movie with good guys and bad guys and for this reason, and to maintain credibility, we need to call on the Israeli Government to stop its bombings, and the Palestinian Authority to prosecute without exception those extremists who are at the root of this terrorism which, under no circumstances, can be justified.
At times such as these, political leaders cannot withdraw. They must stand up, for example, against the hatred of Israeli youth who call on the streets for the bombing of the Palestinian people in response to the terrorist attacks, and also stand up against this horrendous image of Palestinian children who gleefully celebrate the death of numerous innocent Israeli citizens in Jerusalem or Haifa.
What exactly is being taught to these youngsters in schools?
And if the current Israeli and Palestinian leaders are not capable of putting a stop to this, I am sure that sooner or later their peoples will punish them with their contempt.
Madam President, whilst we are talking here today in this House, in the Middle East, Israeli tanks are once again occupying the supposedly autonomous Palestinian territories.
The Israeli army continues to carry out extrajudicial executions and its planes are still bombing Palestinian police - not army - headquarters, a police force that has no freedom of movement but which has been asked to dismantle terrorist networks and to detain all suspects.
I am not ignoring the fact that the Council, and especially the High Representative, Mr Javier Solana, are redoubling their efforts to achieve some kind of tangible result.
I wonder whether the declaration made by the Council last Monday will contribute to this in any way.
In any case, I would like to refer to this declaration.
In it, the Union, as is well known, insists, in the following order: firstly, that the Palestinian Authority dismantle the terrorist networks, detain all suspects and make a public call for the end of the Intifada.
Next, in second place, that the Israeli Government withdraw its armed forces, put an end to the extrajudicial executions and also to the blockades and restrictions that oppress the Palestinian people, and that they put an end to the building of settlements.
I applaud this declaration, like Prime Minister Sharon, who stated that this is the first time such a demand in the fight against terrorism has been addressed in such a clear and unambiguous fashion to Arafat by the Union.
Obviously, Sharon' s satisfaction refers solely to the EU' s demands to the Palestinian Authority.
There was no declaration from Sharon on the Council' s demand that Israel end its violence.
The Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shimon Peres, also liked the declaration.
He said that he thought it was 'a responsible European stance' , which was a more positive statement than that given by Sharon, but he went on to state that the Israeli military action is necessary.
He states that this action - which the EU calls for an end to - is necessary to prevent attacks being made on Israeli citizens, and added that 'it is very easy to give advice to countries whose problems are very different from your own' .
It appears that the EU' s attitude is responsible if it gives advice to the Palestinian Authority, but this is not the case if it tries to advise the Israeli Government.
In my humble opinion, it is probably this type of statement that prompted Louis Michel to say that the EU did not have Israel' s interests in mind when it made such a declaration.
I am aware of this, but the question remains that there continues to be a situation where there is an occupier and the occupied, and the occupier wants to continue playing the game by its own rules, whilst the second - the occupied - is asking for a straightforward end to the occupation, and, with this, peace.
The Council is also aware of this, and it has always hoped to have, like this Parliament, greater influence in the peace process.
I think that it also knows that this cannot simply be requested, it has to be worked for and achieved.
Finally, I would like to say that I expect - and I am sure of this - that this recent mission led by the High Representative and the possible decisions to be made at Laeken will take us in this direction.
Madam President, I think it would be difficult for myself and the other speakers to find words more appropriate or of more use than those used today by the winners of the Sakharov prize, especially Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi.
But we must go on.
Let us follow their example.
I think that the Groups should congratulate ourselves on the agreement reached with regard to the recommendation, but it should be of concern to us that, even though we are not part of the conflict, it should have cost us more than what is reasonable to reach it.
During the discussion, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party attempted to give priority to both the agreement and a balanced position.
However, I think there can be no doubt that our greatest demand is to be efficient, given that our purpose here is not to be conflict analysts, but to be politicians with responsibilities within the framework of the European Union.
From this point of view, I think that the clear position that has been taken with regard to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government is logical and in line with the position of the Council.
However, while insisting on this required level of efficiency, I would like to associate myself with the opinions already expressed by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Commissioner Patten, that there is much need for international action, that the conflict must stop and that the basic approach well established by the Mitchell report must be followed.
In this respect, I would say that it is not sufficient to remain observers and apply pressure.
In a conflict there needs to be strong advocates.
The European Union, the United States, and, obviously, the UN and Russia, are all strong advocates, and it would be difficult to name another moment in history when it has been possible for them to act together in a such an efficient and balanced way.
However, I believe, without a doubt, that this should be our priority: to be able to act as forceful and powerful advocates, if this is a possibility for all of those involved, for the gravity of this conflict requires this.
Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, it is a somewhat peculiar experience to be talking about the Middle East here a few hours after the impressive and emotional presentation of the Sakharov Prize to Mrs Peled and Mr Ghazzawi.
But it is just that - the existence of wise people on both sides of the line who have managed to remain tolerant under tragic personal circumstances - it is precisely the existence of people of this kind that makes it meaningful and necessary for us to continue to search for a solution to a problem that at first glance seems so hopeless.
It is to the cynics in this room, and particularly those outside Parliament, that I say: yes, the European Union has its own special role to play.
We will not succeed without the Americans, but neither will we succeed with the Americans alone.
What does that mean from my point of view?
It means that the European Union must be critical of both sides; critical towards Israel with regard to her reoccupation of Palestinian areas, the erection of blockades and extrajudicial executions.
On the other hand, however - and let there be no misunderstanding on this point - critical of the Palestinian authorities who could have done more and must do more in the future to combat terrorist attacks and dismantle networks.
However, whilst we wish to keep a balance, let us not forget that this is not a struggle between two equal parties.
It is the State of Israel that bears prime responsibility for the current conflicts and their resolution.
This means that we must exert as much pressure as possible on Israel to find a solution.
This means exerting pressure in order to prevent them from finding ways out and excuses for not starting negotiations when they could in fact be taking place.
This also means exerting pressure on Israel to distance herself from the kind of thinking which, for example, equates Arafat with Bin Laden.
This is a highly dangerous comparison which will only serve to make it extremely difficult for a solution to be found.
We also owe it to the winners of the Sakharov Prize to do all we can to keep their hope alive.
Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, I had just returned from a memorable trip to the Palestinian territories and Israel when I heard the news of the terrible carnage in Jerusalem, followed by a second attack in Haifa.
I was horrified by these deliberate and cruel acts of murder and I immediately expressed my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims.
I stressed that no cause can in any way justify the killing of innocent people.
Those responsible must be arrested, tried and punished.
You do not have to be a genius to understand that these latest crimes are disastrous for the Palestinian Authority.
During my visit to the region I was able to appreciate the difficulty in containing the exasperation of the people, especially those living in the refugee camps, in the face of the daily violent attacks by the occupying forces, and especially after the irresponsible assassinations of the long-established leaders of the fundamentalist groups.
I thought to myself, if the Israeli Government has decided to take revenge for the victims of attacks in its own way, the Palestinian Authority' s remaining small margin for manoeuvre will be greatly reduced.
It would then become almost impossible to break the terrible vicious circle of humiliations, attacks, reprisals and revenge which the conflict has been in since the election of Ariel Sharon.
Now this has all come true, and how terribly!
Israel has wreaked revenge on the fundamentalists in a barrage of fire targeting Arafat.
The Palestinian police force, charged with arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists, has itself been bombarded.
International Human Rights Day was marked in Hebron by the intolerable image of two children aged three and 13 blown apart by an Israeli missile that missed its suspect target.
Who can now doubt Ariel Sharon' s desire to destroy the Palestinian Authority and all that remains of the Oslo process?
What is Europe saying in the face of the very real danger of the total annihilation of the Palestinian nation and the overwhelming tidal wave of the fundamentalist reaction that would follow?
Do we condemn Sharon' s policy of adopting the worst possible line?
Are we encouraging those courageous people in Israel who are calling for the resumption of negotiations?
Are we congratulating the Palestinian Authority on its first arrests of fundamentalist activists, at some risk?
Do we deplore the death of Palestinian civilians as much as we deplore the death of Israeli civilians?
Do we at least repeat our long-standing call for international observers to be sent to the region?
However unbelievable it may seem, none of the points I have mentioned appear in the European Union' s press release.
On the contrary, the European Union has sent a message to the Palestinian Authority, whilst the press has highlighted the unprecedented severity of its tone.
Now the only hope rests on strong political intervention from the international community. At this time, it would be a tragedy if Europe were to turn a blind eye to the situation, and do nothing to stop George Bush from giving the green light to Ariel Sharon.
I think of the men and women of Israel and Palestine, who, like our Sakharov prize-winners Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, are counting on us to support their resistance, their hopes and their work towards a just peace.
Their struggle must remind us of our responsibilities.
Madam President, the day before yesterday the Council took a very clear position on the escalation of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
The fact is that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States are placing political responsibility for the ongoing Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli citizens where it belongs: with the Palestinian Authority.
Because of this, they demanded three things of the Palestinian Authority: the dismantling of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks, the arrest and prosecution of all persons suspected of terrorist activities, and a public announcement in Arabic of the end of the Intifada, the Palestinian uprising.
Regrettably enough, I cannot consistently trace the Council' s political clarity with regard to Palestinian terrorism back to the recommendations of this Parliament.
I am therefore standing by my Amendment No 6 even after the coordinators' consultation this morning. The linking of support for the Palestinian Authority with the demands of the Council.
This amendment meshes with the spirit of the compromises that resulted from this consultation.
I therefore ask my colleagues to support this vote by roll call.
Madam President, if this Parliament does not clearly follow the same political line as the Council with regard to the insidious spread of Palestinian terror, the evil forces of 11 September will capitalise on this, because they are really not interested in what the European Parliament expressly states in this recommendation: a safe Jewish state in the Middle East.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are continuing to conduct an anti-Israeli campaign in the style of Picasso' s Guernica, with children' s bodies, usually, elsewhere, the victims of the US, here victims of the Israelis.
Commissioner Patten and we ourselves, with this draft motion, are rushing to provide the Palestinians, at last, with what they need, with what the Palestinian men and women - the Arabs, moreover, in general - and the victims of the dictatorships in the Arab world are certainly demanding.
We are making promises to Mr Arafat and we are agreeing to fight, but for what?
To give them rights?
To give them what all the human rights declarations in the world, including the European declarations, fail to recognise as an individual right?
So you want to give them a national State.
This is precisely what they need: another Syrian or Yemeni national State, a State of whatever kind; they need a national State.
Commissioner Patten, maybe this is what we need in Italy too to solve our problems; maybe this is what you need in Great Britain to solve yours, would you not say?
The illusion of possible national independence affects Israel too.
You wanted a Yugoslav national entity which would be neutral towards both parties.
Our pleas for democracy and Europe went unheeded.
Do not take sides. Be good Samaritans.
Mrs Morgantini is probably all set to call upon the Israeli soldiers to desert, as, on Italian television broadcast throughout the world, she urged the US and British soldiers to desert in the Afghanistan war.
You are the just like the pacifists and communists of 1938 who supported nazism and urged the allies and the French to desert in that war.
Well then, if this is what you are going to continue to propose, I feel that it is our duty to point out that the Palestinians and all the citizens in the world - but the Palestinians, in particular - have the right to say "no" , as do we on their behalf, to this illusion.
If there were three States - Jordan, Palestine and Israel - the State of Jordan would go immediately, and there would immediately be attempts to use Palestine to eliminate this oasis of democracy between Israel and Palestine representing a third of the democracy in the Middle East.
An emphatic 'no' to this document, which places a condition on continuing our cooperation with Israel and places no condition on our supporting Yasser Arafat.
Well then: this Europe, this Palestine and this Arab world are, quite frankly, not ours.
We will vote accordingly.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, this morning we have all been moved by the testimony of Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who made this Chamber echo to the cries of child victims and the voices of mothers in mourning for them. Because these women have given life, they are now working to prevent further deaths as men continue the senseless killing.
We have also listened to Mr Ghazzawi' s appeal for the dream of peace. Our founding fathers shared this dream and it remains the cornerstone of the European Union.
In listening to Mrs Peled-Elhanan and Mr Ghazzawi, painful memories of past events in the Balkans came back to me. Political and military leaders ignored the fact that the majority of their people wanted peace.
They fought from intransigent positions, the result of their deep-rooted distrust of their enemies.
In order to allay this distrust, the international community had to take resolute action.
This led to the signing of the Dayton agreement, which eventually led to a lasting cease-fire, guaranteed by the deployment of troops. This force has not yet achieved its aim, but Mr Wurtz, it has succeeded in finally breaking the vicious circle of fear, violence and hate.
I think that the international community must today display the same resolve and commitment in response to the desire for peace of the majority of Israelis and Palestinians.
The European Union should lead this action.
I therefore welcome the statement made by the Council the day before yesterday explaining the impartial position of the European Union. The statement was remarkably strong and no less remarkably concise.
Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I am delighted to hear the European Union express its determination not to give in to a slide towards increasingly indiscriminate violence.
In the same spirit, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has worked on the recommendation drawn up by our chairman Elmar Brok. This will be submitted to our fellow members for approval.
I hope that Israeli and Palestinian political and military leaders will finally understand that we are only aiming to help them restart the peace process. They have already agreed on the basis of this peace process, but they do not want to implement it because both sides mistrust each other.
We implore them at least to trust the international community to guarantee the implementation of the peace process with the utmost impartiality. We can and must undertake to do this.
Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, eight years after the Oslo accords and 15 months after the start of the second Intifada, the situation in the Middle East in December 2001 is disastrous.
Mr Sharon has not been able to keep his electoral promises regarding improving the security of Israel and its population.
The leader of the Palestinian Authority is weakened, surrounded and besieged in territories which are autonomous in name only.
The Palestinian civilians are more subjugated than ever before and do not have any future prospects.
The international community wants peace.
It is now working towards an intermediary objective, but this is unattainable.
The objective is the plan named after the American Senator Mr Mitchell. The Mitchell Plan is well intentioned in that its primary aim is to put an end to the killing.
It is however misconceived. Every mini-agreement is reached on such a restricted basis that they remain at the mercy of the next suicide attack and then have to be re-established all over again.
Even supposing that the preconditions required by Mr Sharon are satisfied, and even supposing that the Mitchell Plan is implemented in full and with great difficulty, this will in no way address the fundamental causes of the conflict. Nor will the deep-seated personal hatred of Mr Sharon for Mr Arafat disappear as if by magic.
The fundamental causes of the conflict are to be found in the continuing occupation of the Palestinian and Syrian territories seized by Israel during the 1967 war. According to the winner of the Sakharov prize, Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who spoke to us this morning, this occupation is cruel.
Only when the army of occupation has withdrawn from all of these territories, including East Jerusalem, as the United Nations' resolutions demand, will the conditions for a stable and lasting peace be created.
This is why the European Union should speak out in support of an immediate and definitive agreement to establish secure and internationally recognised borders. These would be protected if necessary by an international force for an interim period.
With the support of the European Union, all the countries of the region would then be able to embark upon the reconciliation and reconstruction process from new foundations.
Israel should withdraw to its 1967 international borders, and the Arab world must give its formal and binding recognition of these.
This is the overall objective that the Council should pursue determinedly on the world stage.
If we act in this way on the issue of Middle East, we will fulfil the role everyone wants us to take on.
What is required today is not an equidistant role but a fair role.
Madam President, the war in the Middle East has been going on for over a year now. The Intifada and the Israeli reprisals continue, and the number of dead on both sides is growing.
We feel impotent, concerned and extremely angry. The extent of our anger is a measure of the hope we felt last year when the Middle East was within a whisker of a peace agreement.
We can blame Ariel Sharon for his policy of 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' .
However Mr Sharon was not in power when Ehud Barak, Shlomo Ben Ami and Bill Clinton tried to persuade Yasser Arafat to sign a peace agreement which would have been historic.
That said, the past is the past, as Commissioner Patten so rightly said.
We still want to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel, to paraphrase the words of the Belgian Presidency of the European Union.
We want to believe that the unprecedented appeal the European Union sent on Monday will be noted. Contrary to what was previously said in the House, this appeal was sent to both parties.
It presents Israel with her responsibilities, but for the first time the European Union makes an equally clear appeal to Mr Arafat to dismantle the Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorist networks.
There may be light in that yesterday Israel recognised that the Palestinian Authority had, for the first time, begun to take serious action to combat fundamentalists.
There is also light in that Mr Arafat has admitted, quite objectively, that the European Union' s appeal is fair.
At lunchtime today, the Israeli Nurit Peled-Elhanan, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2001, expressed the hope that the voices of the mothers of the Middle East would drown out the voices of those calling for arms.
We also hope and want to believe that European Union' s voice will ring out loud and clear and help re-establish a spirit of hope.
Madam President, I am becoming more and more inclined just to stand back and watch us and watch you in silence.
I am tired, so tired of these repeated debates where it is so difficult to make progress: it would, however, be a silence in which you could hear the muffled voices of those who have been killed, who are calling for peace and justice, as Izzat Ghazzawi and Nurit Peled said this morning; it would be a silence which tells the consciences of all men and women that there can only be peace in Palestine and Israel if the Palestinian people is allowed to exercise the right to live in its own State, existing alongside the State of Israel, in mutual security.
We must make this peace possible and not just by providing economic aid.
We see it every day.
What we build and our citizens pay for is destroyed by shells and bulldozers: from the airport to the port; even the anti-terrorism laboratory was destroyed the day before yesterday.
I support the positions of Commissioner Patten and the Minister, but there can be no economic development if there is no release from Israeli military occupation.
Europe is resolutely taking this line.
A decision must be taken, even a unilateral decision, to establish international protection for the civilian population.
There is no equality between occupied and occupier.
We must take a balanced approach but not be afraid to make political choices.
For peace to be achieved we need clear measures, for our benefit and for the benefit of both Israelis and Palestinians.
Madam President, my group is deeply shocked by the violence that has once again flared up in the Middle East.
The people of Israel live in grief, fear and anger, but they at least have political freedom, elections, economic development and the hope of a better future.
It is in Israel' s interest that the Palestinians also have hope for the future.
People who have hope have something to lose.
Without hope, there will never be the willingness to enter into compromises.
How can people be expected to hope as long as settlements are being built in their back yards, as long as collective punishments are being meted out for the outrages of the few, and as long as Europe does not take a stand against the gross violations of international law?
It is a delusion that more force and more suppression will make the Palestinians more compliant.
There should be an international peace-keeping force monitoring the implementation of the Mitchell Agreement so that a start can be made with the immediate withdrawal from occupied territories and the immediate dismantling of all settlements.
Finally, I would like to ask the Commission a question.
European projects have been destroyed in Israeli attacks; Commissioner Patten himself has already mentioned the forensic laboratory.
How extensive is the damage, and can Commissioner Patten promise that the Commission will recover the loss from Israel?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not really have much to add to what has been said during this debate, except to emphasise that the decisions of the Council, also in the light of what Commissioner Patten has said, are entirely focused on the future, and therefore contain a number of urgent reminders in respect of the two main parties involved, that is to say Israel on the one hand and the Palestinian Authority on the other, and are not intended to be a balanced and reasonable way of commemorating, mourning, and perhaps honouring the victims on both sides.
The violence is terrible.
So indeed is the spiral of violence.
It seemed to us that an urgent call to action was required and that this urgent call needed to be addressed both to the Palestinian Authority and to Israel.
However, the operative part of the conclusions contains a plea for an early meeting at which the European Union, the United States, Russia, the Palestinian Authority and Israel sit down at the table to try to find a way out of the spiral of violence and extremism.
That is our most fervent hope.
I do not think that it is helpful to try to accuse the Council of favouring one side over the other.
That is not the case.
We are in favour of peace, and we are trying to do our level best to achieve it.
That is what this presidency is doing; the next one will undoubtedly also be doing so, and we can definitely use all your support.
Mr President, I will first of all respond to the characteristically direct question from Mrs van der Laan.
We have done a calculation of the damage so far to our projects.
There are nine projects in all which have been damaged in one way or another.
The very approximate loss estimation is EUR 2.289 million with, for example, EUR 60 000 also lost with the bombing of the forensic laboratory which we had provided.
There was also some support from the Israeli Government to try to help the Palestinian security forces.
Those figures are extremely approximate.
If you think of the investment that has gone from Europe to the West Bank and Gaza over the years to try to establish decent services, to try to help in the creation of a potential viable state, the loss is incalculable.
That is the chartered accountant's balance sheet so far and I hope it does not get any worse.
Perhaps I can just add one or two points in relation to the debate.
The honourable Member, Mr Poos, who does not use words lightly - he knows about these matters very well - described the situation as catastrophic and that is not too strong a word.
My honourable and gallant friend General Morillon reminded us of the consequences in the Balkans of intransigence.
Mr Lagendijk and Mrs Morgantini and others spoke about the moving speeches that we had heard this morning about the sacrifice of the next generation because the present generation cannot find a way of living peacefully together.
I suppose that when people can behave with that extraordinary resilience and courage and moderation, there is still some hope for the region.
My friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr Brok, has said that the aim was that the three great religions that we saw represented here this morning should be able to live one day in the holy city in peace together which, in the words of an English poet, is "a consummation devoutly to be wished".
I would just say one thing to Mr Belder - and I say it very gently and not critically because people are entitled to their own passions - and that is that I am not sure I share his view of balance.
I will tell you what my idea of balance is.
On Monday of this week a number of Palestinian and Israeli parliamentarians and intellectuals met at the Qalandia checkpoint to emphasise "the urgent need to continue dialogue between the two sides", even when this is the only venue where it is possible to do so.
They argued that these meetings are especially important in the light of the escalation of violence through the past week which they said is threatening to drag their whole region into war.
If an immediate halt to the current cycle of violence is not achieved, the situation may spiral out of control, perhaps with irreversible consequences.
A group, including Yossi Beilin, the former Minister for Justice and one of the architects of the Oslo process, and Yasser Abed Rabbo, the Minister of Information and Culture in Palestine, argued that ending the current crisis entails the immediate abandonment of violence as a political tool and the unconditional implementation of the Tenet work plan and Mitchell report.
This requires immediate steps, including prevention and punishment of terrorist acts, the lifting of the closure on and withdrawal from the Palestinian areas and putting a stop to the policy of assassinations.
Settlement activity - they argued - is not compatible with an honest move to de-escalation and the pursuit of peace.
It must be halted.
Incitement in all its forms, both official and unofficial, cannot coexist with rebuilding a climate of trust and non-violence.
It must be ended.
We clearly state that under no circumstances should the Palestinian Authority or its presidency be harmed or targeted if a way out of this crisis is to be found.
I will tell you what I believe the European Union should be doing.
As long as there are any moderates on the two sides - in Israel and the Palestinian Authority - we should be there supporting them, supporting their courage, toleration and decency.
That is a balanced European Union policy.
I would say "Hosanna", in suitably biblical form, to all the sentiments expressed in that joint statement.
I pray to God that in three, six or nine months' time there are still some moderates left with the bravery and courage to offer a better prospect for the future of the region.
Many thanks, Commissioner, for your very moving appeal in this difficult situation.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Mr President, I would like to send my greetings to a group of young people, who have not only the modest merit of coming from a town - Pontremoli, in the Lunigiana region - which is particularly dear to my heart and of which I am Mayor, but who I see as representative of the many young people who are looking to Europe.
They have had their eighteenth birthdays this year, 2001, which is the year which has seen the most extreme world violence, but it is also the year in which many of the world' s young people have gained the ability to exercise their full rights and responsibilities in coming of age.
I hope that this mediation operation, this firm moral message from Europe, will be a constructive witness for peace in the future for the young people of Europe and all the young people of the world.
Mr Mayor, that may well not have been quite on the agenda, but there is a saying from the Bible, to the effect that the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.
In that sense, I too can to some extent understand your intervention.
Access to documents as implemented by Council and Commission
The next items on the agenda are the declarations by the Council and the Commission on access to documents as implemented by Council and Commission.
Whereas Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, the Minister, had earlier spoken at the end of a debate, she now has the opportunity and the pleasure of speaking on this subject at the beginning of this one, and we have the honour of hearing her.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the presidency of the Council gave you a commitment, through my good offices, to take the necessary provisions to keep to the deadline of 3 December 2001 for the implementation of the European Parliament and Council regulation of 30 May 2001 concerning public access to the documents of the European Parliament, Council and the Commission.
I am pleased to announce that the Council has kept to this deadline. It took the decision to modify its own internal regulations on 29 November this year.
This decision was published in the Official Journal of 30 November and came into force on 3 December, that is to say the same day when the regulation I referred to came into effect. It brings the provisions of the internal acts of the Council on access to documents together into a single instrument.
It also contains new provisions on the implementation of the regulation. In accordance with Article 2 of the decision, certain other acts have been repealed.
These are as follows. Firstly, the Council decision of 20 December 1993 on public access to Council documents, last modified by a decision of 14 August 2000.
Secondly, a Council decision of 6 December 1999 concerning improving information on Council work and the public register of Council documents. Lastly, the Council decision of 9 April this year on the public communication of certain categories of Council documents.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process concerning the right to access to documents that started with the Treaty of Amsterdam is being cast in a legal framework in this way.
However, a number of further provisions still need to be established.
The discussions amongst the institutions about the establishment of an interinstitutional committee that will examine what the best practices are, handle any disputes and discuss future developments relating to public access to documents in accordance with Article 15 of the regulation, are still ongoing.
The Council is of the opinion that this committee must be put together at the level of the secretaries-general of the three institutions concerned, and it must be able to submit questions of a general or political nature or relating to matters of principle to the chairmen of the three institutions.
As a result of the recent informal political trialogue between the Presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 28 November, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, formulated an interesting proposal as a solution to the problem of the level of representation within this interinstitutional committee.
Her proposal was to allow this committee to meet at secretary-general level by way of an authorisation - par dÃ©lÃ©gation in French - from their political bosses.
I find this concept very interesting, and I told my fellow Presidents of Parliament and the Commission at the time that I would put this idea to the Council bodies for evaluation.
May I just explain what it is about, because this discussion between the Council and Parliament on the matter of the level at which discussions should take place seems rather parochial.
The Council is worried that the presidents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission would have to act as a kind of appeal court, as it were, if it were to be decided at Secretary-General level that access to a document cannot be granted.
We believe that this is not the kind of role that these presidents should play.
They must not become a kind of appeal court; on the contrary, they must focus on broad issues, general questions, principles and the like.
And that is what concerns us.
It is not about the fact that the Council does not want this interinstitutional committee; it is about making sure that we do not create a court of appeal that is approached quasi-systematically, because we do not think that that will be to anyone' s benefit.
There are other bodies that can be enlisted for this purpose, and this is therefore at the heart of the discussion.
I thought that the suggestion by Mrs de Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, offered a way out.
For if the secretaries-general of the three institutions meet on the basis of an authority from their presidents, they will then have a mandate and in specific cases will then have to take decisions themselves concerning access to a document.
I am telling you this to clearly explain where the problem lies as far as the Council is concerned.
I hope that my fellow Council members will also find Mrs de Palacio' s procedure positive and that we will be able to solve the problem in this way and get the interinstitutional committee off the ground.
I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that Article 11, Paragraph 2 of the Regulation gives 3 June 2002 as the last date by which the document registers must be operational.
How far have we got in this regard?
As you know, the Council' s document register has been available to the public since 1 January 1999.
This register contains all the documents that have been put before the Council or the preparatory bodies and which either serve as the basis for consultations, or have a definite influence on the decision-making process, or give an indication of the situation in certain files.
In November of this year, this register contained references to more than 250 000 Council documents in all our official languages, and it provides access to the contents of more than 50 000 documents.
The register therefore seems to be an effective and reliable instrument with which the institutions' documents can be identified and queried.
Since the register has been operational, there has understandably been a significant increase in the demand for documents, most of which have in fact been available in the register.
The number of consultations of the register is continuing to increase.
In 1999, more than 70 000 hits resulting in about 600 000 requests were registered - and by this we mean screens consulted or clicked on.
In 2000 the number of hits and requests increased to 160 000 and 1 260 000 respectively.
This trend is continuing, and we have already had 130 000 visits and more than 1 million screens consulted in the first six months of 2001.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as regards measures to ensure the public is made aware of the rights they have under the regulation, the three institutions concerned are at present examining the various, specific measures to be taken, such as jointly drawing up a practical guide for citizens.
In accordance with Article 9(7) of the regulation, the Commission and the Council must inform Parliament of sensitive documents.
In this regard, the Council remains ready to conclude negotiations with Parliament on an inter-institutional agreement on common security and defence policy. This could be followed by other agreements, particularly on justice and home affairs.
However, given this situation, Parliament should re-examine its position on its application to annul the Council security regulation. It should also adopt measures on the protection of documents classified as sensitive, in compliance with its own Rules of Procedure as recently modified.
This would provide some assurance that these sensitive documents would be kept confidential within Parliament.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month I came here to witness Parliament' s adoption of the report by Mrs Maij-Weggen on amending Parliament' s Rules of Procedure regarding public access to the documents of the three institutions.
This brought to an end some quite considerable work by Mrs Maij-Weggen, and also, if I may say so, by Mr Cashman.
A week ago, and a few days after the Council, the Commission adopted a decision amending its own Rules of Procedure.
Prior to this, on 28 November, we held a discussion to ensure the regulation is applied with the greatest transparency.
It is true that we needed a few extra days for this.
This is why the definitive decision of the Commission was only taken on 5 December.
This prompted a number of questions, and your President raised the issue with us.
I would like to reassure you in no uncertain terms that, in practice, these few days of delay had no repercussions for citizens. The Commission has in fact been implementing the regulation of 30 May since 3 December.
Accordingly, we have a central point of access to the Secretariat-General of the Commission.
We have a postal address, an e-mail address and a fax number available for people to use. It is also possible to consult the Commission' s website.
In addition, there is the new access guide produced by ourselves, which you have discussed, Minister. This will be available on the website from next week.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, as far as we are concerned, all the practical measures necessary for the implementation of the regulation are in place. In fact, the Commission services have already started processing applications to access the new database established in accordance with the regulation.
Article 18 of the regulation provides not only for the amendment of the Rules of Procedure, but also for the amendment of other existing provisions.
Therefore, the appropriate services of the Commission have checked whether the 1983 regulation on opening historical archives to the public was in accordance with the regulation on access to documents.
Some changes were needed. The Commission will shortly put to the Council and Parliament a proposal to change the regulation on historical archives.
The third consideration also concerns Article 18 of the regulation of 30 May. The Commission' s services have drawn up a list of the rules which are to be found throughout Community law which concern access to documents or information within existing Community legislation.
This work has allowed us to identify almost fifty provisions that the Commission will examine in the light of the new regulation.
All provisions that do not comply with the new rules on access to documents will either be modified or repealed.
The fourth point I wanted to make today concerns how the regulation can be applied to agencies.
Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Cashman, I understand that this is one of your concerns, which you have rightly raised. The matter is included in the joint declaration adopted along with the regulation.
Work is under way on this issue too.
Since adopting the new regulation, the Commission has provided the agencies with information on it and had invited them to re-examine their own rules on access in the light of the regulation.
The existing instruments of incorporation of the agencies will be modified.
An additional clause will be included in the instruments of incorporation of new agencies.
