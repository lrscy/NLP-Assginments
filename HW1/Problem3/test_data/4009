Now we say that Gaddafi, who brought down a Pan American aeroplane and killed dozens of people, is our friend because he has changed policy; at the same time, however, we hound Castro, who has not brought down any aeroplanes.
We say that the dictator in Pakistan is good because he is our friend, but we say that another dictator is bad and we wage war on him.
We therefore need to look at how honest we are on the subject of terrorism.
We need to look at what is happening.
We need to keep our ears open, because as long as we keep taking aspirins, we shall continue to have a headache.
We need to look at what is causing the headache.
So we need to open our eyes and stop this one-sided policy.
We need to give more incentives, more opportunities to these nations in order to reduce fundamentalism, in order to reduce terrorism.
That is the solution.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the short space of time that has been allocated to me, I should like to say three things about matters of fundamental importance.
Firstly, surely it is a crying shame that to date, it is still so awkward and such an uphill struggle to achieve concrete cooperation and exchange of information on combating terrorism, not only between one Member State and another, but also between the European Member States and the other countries of the free west.
Well-informed eurosceptic though I am, I do believe there cannot, in that area at least, be enough cooperation.
The fact is that the safety of our citizens is at stake.
We now know that the 11 September attacks were, at least in part, planned in Hamburg.
We know that following the Madrid bomb attack, terrorist cells have been exposed across the whole of Europe.
It is evident that terrorism transcends national borders, and so, then, should the fight against it.
Secondly, this is no time for a failure of nerve; we have to call a spade a spade.
Terrorism in Europe has become almost exclusively Islamic.
American experts are warning us today about the return from Iraq, and other troublespots, of Islamic militants who have, over there, become more radical and have learnt terrorist techniques.
Intolerant Islam is on the march in Europe, and is very much a breeding ground for terrorism.
Not every Muslim is a terrorist but nearly every terrorist is a Muslim.
Thirdly, I would also draw your attention to the fact that for many years now, European aid for the Palestinians is being used, not only to allow Mrs Arafat to lead a life of luxury in Paris, but also to fund terrorism in Israel.
We cannot combat terrorism in Europe while funding it in Israel.
If the use of funds in Palestine does not become clearer and more transparent, the supply of them should be suspended.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have heard a great many useful views and proposals from the rapporteurs today and I congratulate both them and Vice-President Frattini for the programmes which he has put forward for combating terrorism.
Terrorism is an abstract term but it has a specific political bedrock.
Terrorists are specific persons who exist but, at the same time, they are invisible and unseen.
Consequently, the global strategy against terrorism will only succeed either when we have wiped all â and I mean all â terrorists out, or if the political support on which terrorism is based disappears.
The first is impossible.
It is possible to achieve the second.
As a tactic of war or political tactic, terrorism is the most abominable of phenomena.
Inhumane terrorist action cannot be legitimised or justified in any way or for any reason.
However, those who practise barbaric terrorist methods cite some special religious and/or occasionally social cause and they have moral and political support from a number of societies.
It is to these societies that we need to turn.
The European Union is in a position to penetrate these societies and act as a catalyst.
In the case both of the Arabs and in other cases, Europe is not seen as the great big devil or as the people's enemy.
This is precisely where we need to allocate roles between the European Union and the United States, Russia and other countries involved.
Together with the condemnatory chatter of the European Union and the escalation of legislative and other measures against terrorism, we need to develop our own communication strategy with the moderate elements in these societies.
I am sure that, with this strategy, the European Union will be able to pull the rug out from under the terrorists' feet.
That is the only way that terrorism will disappear rather than diminish, and it is in this direction that the European Union, the Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission must turn as one.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank all the rapporteurs for the work that has gone into producing the reports that we are discussing today, which repeatedly stress the fact that upholding and promoting human rights is the most important and best strategy for preventing and fighting terror.
Commissioner Frattini has indicated that counter-terrorism should, in fact, entail a reinforcement of human rights, and I could not agree more.
Upholding and promoting such important values as democracy, freedom, pluralism and human dignity is crucial in the fight against terrorism.
It is beyond dispute that in order to make this really happen, we will need to fundamentally reconsider large sections of our policy, particularly external policy.
The radicalisation and polarisation that so often both go towards producing terrorism and result from it are at least as great a threat to the European Union as terrorism itself.
We politicians must be acutely aware of this and try to keep a cool head at all times.
Rather than stir up fear unnecessarily, we must be realistic and avoid getting drawn into the hysteria that only fuels the tensions on which terrorism feeds.
In any case, we must not fall into the trap of going along with the bizarre arguments to which terrorists resort in order to justify their disgraceful actions.
We must take measures which truly enhance the freedom of all citizens and keep well away from measures that only appear to enhance security.
In that connection, two of the measures discussed at this forum deserve more attention, in my opinion.
First of all, the idea of penalising terrorism at the International Criminal Court.
I wonder what specific problem that would solve.
Must we really treat terrorists as we do ex-dictators like Milosevic?
I know this much; the man who murdered Theo van Gogh, a well-known film maker and much-talked about columnist and opinion maker from my country, the Netherlands, would love to be able to use the platform that such a case would afford him.
I am therefore emphatically opposed to that idea.
Then there is the storage of communications traffic data, an example of a measure that leads only to false security, if ever there was one.
I shall not elaborate on it any further, since much has already been said about this.
It is disproportionate, it restricts our freedom and I think it is this very freedom that we have to promote in the European Union.
There are risks involved; you can introduce all kinds of restrictions with regard to accessibility to information of that kind, but let us face it, anything that is available on the Internet is universally accessible, no matter how well protected it is, so the risks involved probably outweigh the benefits.
I do not think we should go ahead with this.
Instead, as the Internet is indeed developing into by far the best means of communication for people who want to find out about terrorists and recruit them for others, we should get our security services to specialise in Internet participation, in reading and chatting on the Internet, in other words, to actively monitor what happens in that medium.
That would make a real difference
To find out afterwards which websites a person has visited after they have carried out a bomb attack does not strike me as being the best strategy.
We must prevent those bomb attacks from being carried out in the first place.
I think that such a measure â the legal basis of which has been discussed here several times and moreover, the way in which this decision has been taken is a blatant violation of democracy â undermines confidence in European democracy, the risks of which have recently made themselves felt in a painful manner.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my regret at the French and the Dutch ânoâ to the Constitution, because the EU will now have to fight terrorism with one hand tied behind its back.
The citizens have given a very clear signal in the debate on the referenda.
I would, therefore, call on the Council to work in the spirit of the Constitution, and that means respecting three key principles.
The first is democratic control. That means that the Council should not ignore and sideline the European Parliament, but should take its recommendations on board, even if it is not yet obliged to.
The other two aspects mentioned by many colleagues are proportionality and effectiveness. Again, in these areas, the Council should think twice about certain measures.
Its own report on the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism shows that there are considerable gaps in implementation.
Before adopting new measures we should be looking at implementation.
In the case of the peer review, for example, only ten out of twenty-five countries have so far submitted their implementation reports!
How can we take new steps if we do not even know if the old ones work?
I now turn to three specific issues.
Firstly, data retention.
A lot has already been said and again I would call on the Council to act in the spirit of the Constitution and not ignore the European Parliament.
It should also not ignore the signals given by many countries â the example of the United States has already been mentioned.
But I would add to those examples the case of the Dutch Parliament, which wanted to adopt a similar data retention measure.
However, once it found out how that would work â or, rather, not work â in practice, the Dutch Parliament reconsidered it, because it realised that the data retention proposal was simply not workable.
The Council should not ignore this.
It is regrettable that the Council is not present on this occasion.
With passenger name records, there have also been several incidents.
We were promised an evaluation a year after this entered into force.
I should like to know from the Commission when we can expect the evaluation.
Thirdly, we would like to know more about the SitCen, the Situation Centre.
What exactly is it doing, what kind of information does it deal with and will it report to the European Parliament?
Finally, I ask the European Parliament to show its colours.
We have talked a lot today about the protection of personal data and fundamental rights.
I call on this Parliament to adopt not only all the reports on antiterrorism measures but also the Moraes report on anti-discrimination policies and minority rights, because fundamental rights are for all citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as I see it, the challenge we face is to fight terrorism effectively while fully respecting human rights and basic freedoms. As has already been said, we have our hands tied because of the ânoâ vote here in France, and there is also another major problem or handicap: there is no international definition of terrorism.
That means that no possible legal remedy exists, and there is no legal certainty, no guarantee and no protection.
I therefore believe that the European Union should strive towards a properly recognised definition, both for itself and at international level.
MrÂ Van Hecke proposed a simple definition: for terrorist, read Muslim.
President Putin has another definition: terrorist means Chechen.
The Chinese have other definitions.
I believe that these incredibly broad, abusive and arbitrary definitions of terrorism mean that we are losing our ability to act effectively in the fight against terrorism.
I accordingly believe that we, that is to say the European Union, should make a significant effort, as quickly as possible â at the next UN General Assembly, for example â to secure a definition of terrorism, which is vital and which will also facilitate genuine cooperation between states, at European level and also at world level.
Â Â  MrÂ President, allow me to remind the House of the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, one of the fathers of the American Constitution, who said that âThose who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safetyâ.
Since the criminal atrocities in Madrid, we have known that Europe is now a direct target area for international terrorism.
There can be no doubt that this fact must be taken into account in the formulation of public policy.
Every form of terrorism is a crime that threatens the very foundations of our democracy, and these crimes must be combated and must have consequences that befit their gravity.
They must, however, be combated with appropriate instruments and not at the cost of freedom.
It goes without saying that our national investigating authorities must cooperate more closely.
At the same time, we must not create a situation in which data and information are collected, linked and exchanged ever more indiscriminately until the transparent citizen emerges at some time in the near future.
We must not go down the path towards an Orwellian Big Brother state.
Peopleâs fundamental rights must not be put on the line.
We need a targeted policy involving, on the one hand, zero tolerance of terrorism in any shape or form and, on the other hand, a sharp focus on the aim of eradicating the various causes of terrorism.
This is the only way of ultimately cutting off its supply line.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, terrorism is not a new phenomenon, but the tragic events of recent years have demonstrated its destructive power.
The fight against terrorism is one of the biggest challenges that we face in the 21st century.
I commend all of the rapporteurs for their efforts and their work on this dossier.
It does not matter how terrorism occurs, where it occurs, who the perpetrators are, the justifications they put forward or the causes they fight for.
All terrorist acts, methods or practices are politically and morally unjustifiable, and must be unequivocally condemned and staunchly combated.
The tragic events of 11Â March in Madrid led the Union to question the effectiveness of its instruments and policies, and illustrated the urgent need for a fresh, dynamic, systematic and effective approach.
It was in this context that the post of EU coordinator in the fight against terrorism was created, and I should like to welcome Mr De Vries, who is in the House today.
I support a clear strategy in the fight against terrorism aimed at striking a balance between collective security and individual freedom.
This involves, firstly, stepping up the EUâs prevention strategy, preparedness and ability to respond.
There has been a significant increase in sources of financing.
The warning system relating to the trade in goods and the provision of services must be improved, in order to provide better monitoring of suspected movements, without disrupting the normal dynamics of the market.
At the same, public and private institutions, particularly in the banking sector, must work together more closely.
Thirdly, there must be increased capacity in the area of information, including the essential improvement in the exchange of information with Europol, prevention and consequence management and critical infrastructure protection in the fight against terrorism, which entails drawing up more stringent rules on security and showing solidarity with any Member State that falls victim to a terrorist attack.
Lastly, I turn to the extremely important question of solidarity with the victims of terrorism.
When innocent people are murdered, abducted or tortured, or subjected to extortion, blackmail or threats, they are not the only ones who suffer; all of their family Members, their friends and their community as a whole suffer with them.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, terrorism is a deadly disease that became a global epidemic at the turn of this century.
We are now living in a world of two extremes, and by this I mean not only a world of poverty and wealth, but also a world of good and evil.
The good is represented by public security, and the evil byÂ terrorism.
We have learned to carry out scientific research into terrorism, to identify its different forms and to look in detail at its causes.
We have also grown accustomed to referring to state terrorism, individual terrorism, global terrorism, local terrorism and fundamentalism.
Nevertheless, the simple truth is that there is only one kind of terrorism, namely when one person perpetrates inconceivable evil against another.
One of the European Unionâs basic duties, and one which is enshrined in ArticleÂ 29 of the Treaty of Maastricht, is to provide its citizens with a high level of safety.
The questions we should be asking ourselves are whether it is succeeding in doing so, and whether our citizens feel safe.
The likely answer to the second of these questions is that they do not always feel safe, because we are all aware of what happened on 11Â March in Madrid, and of a great many similar incidents.
Criminals exploit the benefits of integrationÂ by moving about freely within the EU, where there are no internal borders.
They frequently go unpunished, since the EU has 25 different legal and penal systems.
In order to stop this happening, the EU must develop new and more effective instruments.
The anti-terrorist package under debate today is intended to help us to do just that.
I am glad to see that as well as anti-terror proposals, the package also calls urgently for human rights to be protected.
Consideration is given to all previous regulations and measures, from TREVI in 1975 to the Hague Programme, via Vienna, Tampere and the action plan adopted following 11Â SeptemberÂ 2001.
These measures have resulted in the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the establishment of Eurojust and the appointment of an EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator.
If we wish to achieve results, however, the EU must do more than merely making constant and systematic improvements to the instruments it uses in the fight against terrorism.
New measures that involve closer cooperation are needed in order to find a solution to what is known as megaterrorism, or in other words terrorism using weapons of mass destruction.
We must move faster than terrorists and anticipate their actions, rather than waiting for attacks and then dealing with their impact.
We must take speedier and more effective action, and terrorists must be aware of this and feel its effects.
Closer cooperation at international level will be needed, together with implementation of the provisions of ArticleÂ 43 of the European Constitution, or in other words of the solidarity clause that is of such significance for us.
Finally, I should like to say that as a Pole, I am extremely proud that it is Poland that has been entrusted with the task of protecting the EUâs external borders.
By doing so, we will be able to make our own contribution to the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the fight against terrorism it is important both to combine forces at national level and at the same time enhance cooperation between the institutions of the Union.
It is not enough to react to terrorism with the police and intelligence services working closely together, although they are, of course, crucially important.
The fight against terrorism is fundamentally linked to measures that already help to reduce our societyâs vulnerability.
An example might be ensuring the security of industrial activity and effective cooperation and exchange of information in the emergency services.
Acts of terror are tragic and, as their name suggests, they are designed to spread fear and panic.
For that reason, European societies have to be made stronger from within, in terms of their structures and culture in relation to action, and become societies where there is less potential for terrorism.
Administrative transparency and the awareness of citizens of their environment, including its risks, are of central importance.
We must also be able to act correctly and effectively in emergency situations.
The vulnerability of the infrastructure needs to be lessened through determined action, and the exchange of information within the administrative sectors regarding evident risks needs to be increased.
It is vitally important that research in the EU is developed in the appropriate manner to support the fight against terrorism.
We must ensure that the Unionâs research efforts in the area of internal and external security are sufficiently in dialogue with one another.
Effective counter-terrorism measures can only be successful when they combine the best European expertise, research into the defence and the emergency service sectors, and other security-related research.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Council decisions and the reports which we are debating today are endeavouring, on the pretext of combating terrorism, to achieve, firstly, the creation and application of a more autocratic institutional framework and the creation and strengthening of new repressive mechanisms, monitoring systems etc., the real objective of which is not the fight against this terrorism you are talking about, but the rising grass-roots movement and the peoples' fight against the new imperialist order.
Secondly, they are endeavouring, by adopting preventive war against terrorism, to prepare the people to accept new interventions and wars.
It is telling that not one report denounces â on the contrary they exonerate â the state terrorist action of the United States and other countries in Afghanistan and Iraq, Israeli terrorism in Palestine etc. In truth, we ask you: is the slaughter of 100Â 000 civilians in Fallujah in one week by the American militia terrorism or is it not?
Finally, the Council's decision last November and the Oreja report introduce the position that radical movements or extreme ideologies are a source of terrorism and this means that social movements and grass-roots rights qualify as terrorism.
What we note is that you are frightened of the rising grass-roots fights which have emerged ...
Â Â  â Mr President, the commitment by all of us to combat all forms of terrorism is non-negotiable and constant and is also one of the priorities of the Hague programme.
However, in order for terrorism to be prevented and combated effectively, there needs to be systematic cooperation between the Member States at legislative level and the level of information exchange, in blocking financing and in protecting international transport.
Finally, there needs to be a detailed and ceaseless preventive policy and the European Union now needs to act proactively and not simply react to tragic incidents.
The first weapon against terrorism is information.
As terrorism is now an international phenomenon and operates on an international scale, we need collection and exchange of information at international level and better assessment of threats, taking account always of the need to respect privacy and to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms which are elements of our civilisation.
The reports by all the rapporteurs, through various points of view, converge in common findings with which I fully agree.
However, I believe that the existence of numerous texts, not only of these eight reports being debated today, but of all the others which have been adopted from time to time, is creating the risk of confusion and inefficacy.
I should like to propose to the Commissioner here present, Mr Frattini, that the competent Commission services proceed to codify all the relevant texts.
I am certain that this would also result in the simplification and systemisation of and in cohesion between the texts.
Otherwise there is confusion and confusion must be avoided.
Confusion does not create the preconditions for the proper combating of terrorism.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I really only wish to refer to one point, which relates to the announcement at the very end of your speech, Commissioner, that you intend to conduct two simulations in the near future.
May I ask you to inform Parliament of these in good time, because it is very important that we should cooperate in this matter.
Together with my honourable colleague Jerzy Buzek, I myself took part in a simulation exercise in Washington on 14Â January.
That was Exercise Atlantic Storm, which was devoted to bioterrorism.
We then discussed the subject again in the framework of the New Defence Agenda in Brussels on 25Â April.
We identified three main points, which we simply must spend more time discussing.
The first point was our realisation that cooperation must become far more intensive than we are used to at the present time.
This relates both to cooperation among the Member States and to Europeâs cooperation with the United States and with other relevant countries that ought to be involved.
This cooperation is extremely important, but at the present time it is still very sporadic in some cases.
It is not conducted systematically either, nor does its methodology give us any real cause for satisfaction with the present system.
It is not reliable, nor is it transparent, either in general terms or in relation to Parliament, and transparency is crucial if the defects of the system are to be identified and corrected.
That is one point.
The second inadequacy is in the field of prevention.
With specific reference to bioterrorism, I should like to ask you how far we have actually progressed to date on prevention with regard to vaccines.
In our simulation in Washington, we established that the availability of vaccines varies considerably between Member States of the EU.
This will be a source of conflicts, Commissioner, in the event of an attack, which we hope will not happen.
I should like to ask you to comment again on that point.
The last point I wish to mention relates to an entirely different aspect of this issue.
In our debates we should always take great care to distinguish between Islamic fundamentalists and Islam in general.
That would contribute greatly to our political discussion.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin with a personal remark addressed to Commissioner Frattini.
I should like to thank him for his work, as the Foreign Minister of Italy, in the Constitutional IGC during the second half of 2003. At that time I was a civil servant in the Finnish delegation.
He did an excellent job, not least in communitarising justice and home affairs, and that is why I hope we will get this Constitution through.
I have five very brief points.
Firstly, there is a very close balance between individual liberty and security and we have to be very careful when we deal with it in relation to terrorism.
That is why I reject the initiative on retention of data and support the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
My second point is that the fight against terrorism is really an area where the European Union has value added; it is an area where the Member States cannot and will not be able to operate alone.
My third point is that it is also an area where action is demanded.
If we look at any Eurobarometer opinion polls, we see that this is an area where the European Union can work quite well.
My fourth point is that this could also be our next success story, but it all depends on whether we are able to implement it.
That is why I call upon the Commission to push very hard both for the Tampere Agenda and now The Hague Agenda and get the Member States to implement measures to continue the fight against terrorism.
My final and fifth point concerns the Constitution. Article 43 of the Constitution is a key article.
It is the one that deals with solidarity.
If one Member State is faced with a terrorist attack, all the other Member States are required to help out.
That solidarity clause, though not yet implemented, worked rather well in the face of the Madrid attacks.
I would really like the Member States and the Commission to stick to that principle.
Â Â  Â Â Â I wish to address my remarks to CommissionerÂ Frattini, who gave a very good introduction to this debate.
His approach to the matter is entirely correct, but it has one fatal flaw.
I refer to the fact that the preparations he outlined are for a war that has already taken place.
What is needed above all else in the war against terrorism is imagination, and indeed great feats of imagination, because terrorists are certainly not lacking in the latter.
I should like to give the Commissioner a few pointers on how to be more imaginative.
I would like him to answer the following questions.
If a passenger on board an aeroplane were found to be suffering from an infectious disease, for example smallpox or any other disease, where would the aeroplane land?
Have any airports in the Member States been designated for such purposes?
What procedures are followed if a pathogen is found that is capable of human-to-human transmission?
What procedures are followed if a pathogen is found that is not capable of human-to-human transmission?
When asking these and similar questions, we must remember that this is a conflict of the future.
Bioterrorism is a weapon that requires us to use our imagination. I am counting on the EU to play an organisational role in consolidating the efforts of states and nations.
The second and final point I should like to make is that the Members of this House have been very vocal in condemning terrorism during todayâs debate.
I wonder what name should be given to an institution that makes it technically possible for a television channel owned by a Middle Eastern terrorist organisation to broadcast.
Can such an institution be said to support terrorism or not?
We must ask ourselves whether financial and media bodies are not in fact playing a background role and creating the conditions that make it possible for terrorism to spread, and indeed to spread rapidly.
While all this is going on, Parliament is happy to sit back and condemn terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, terrorism threatens all of us.
The United Kingdom has had to deal with the Irish Republican terrorism of SinnÂ FÃ©in/IRA for over three decades and as they say themselves, they have not gone away, you know.
We need to be steadfast in the face of terrorism.
Weakness and equivocation merely strengthen those who seek to undermine democracy.
We also need clarity, however, on understanding the threat we face and the best measures to deal with that threat.
For this reason we welcome the proposals to improve information-sharing between relevant authorities, which are foreseen under Mr Duquesne's report.
As we have seen, Member States cooperating on a bilateral basis, without being hamstrung by needlessly heavy institutional constraints, have produced results.
Joint investigation teams, on which I had the honour of being rapporteur in the previous Parliament, have been working well in this area, as referred to in the DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez report.
Such flexible, targeted, measured and appropriate responses are good examples of what can be achieved.
But we also need to be aware of the nature of the threat that we are dealing with.
The IRA is different from ETA, which is different from al-Qa'ida, but they are all evil and must be faced down and eliminated.
Being unclear helps no one and I simply do not understand why some in this House do not want the use of the term "fundamental Islamist organisations" to describe al-Qa'ida and their ilk.
Similarly, we also welcome the call, in the Borghezio report, to look at the question of those charities which are little more than front organisations for fund-raising for terrorism.
It is deplorable that the Council has not seen fit to designate Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation.
But above all else, we need to work together, exchanging information, assisting each other to deal with these ongoing threats, the undoubted threats to our freedom and to our democracy.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that terrorism nowadays is a reality which we cannot, unfortunately, avoid.
From a marginal phenomenon in the 1970's which restricted itself for the most part to within the framework of a state and to specific objectives, it has, unfortunately, developed over recent years into attacks which leave a great many dead and use advanced technological means.
The cause of this rise is the perpetuation of unresolved political and social problems.
The international community has failed to prove its unshaken intention to set peaceful cohabitation processes in motion in specific areas of conflict caused by religious, political and ethnic differences.
Terrorism revived where the organised international community, or a part of it, unilaterally endeavoured to impose solutions through violence, which resulted in the creation of new, more violent conflicts.
We all know that violence does not only not stop violence, but also strengthens it.
As long as the Palestinian question, for example, remains unresolved, terrorism will spread, feeding the extremism which is in fact the basic cause of terrorism.
However, terrorism cannot be combated through judicial and policing measures alone.
The integrated crisis management systems, the monitoring and computer processing of suspicious information, the fight against financing for terrorism, the effective exchange of information or the approval of a common definition for terrorism are preventive and repressive mechanisms.
They do not get to the root of the evil.
The debate and vote today in the European Parliament on the eight reports which aim to combat it are important.
Nonetheless, we all know that they are not enough.
We are not in a position with such measures to make terrorism disappear.
The final resolution of this scourge must be sought over and above coordinated preventive and repressive action by the Community.
The solution lies in achieving conditions of world peace, equality and prosperity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Frattini and MrÂ deÂ Vries, I would firstly congratulate the rapporteurs on their improvements to the Councilâs anti-terrorist proposals which are indeed designed to make the fight against terrorism more effective in a number of excellent ways.
The balance between freedoms and rights must, however, be maintained and our democratic European system improved.
At present, a car almost has better rights than a human being, for a car can have financial legislation removed by the European Parliament and the EC Court of Justice.
These issues highlight the need for a new Constitution that will better enable us to combat crime and terrorism.
The issue of data storage splendidly illustrates the way in which the pillar system has come to the end of the road.
We need a new treaty through which privacy can be protected and disproportionate measures and duties opposed.
Data protection is needed in all legislation and not, as now, only in a part of it.
MrsÂ Niebler offered a constructive explanation of the European Parliamentâs criticisms in this area, and I agree with what she said.
We have not seen any evidence of the need for the proposed measures in the area of data retention.
The Council has acted provocatively and decided to implement legislation opposed by the European Parliament.
Such action weakens our democracy.
That is not what we need right now.
We need to move in the opposite direction.
We need strengthened democracy and more vigorous action by the Council, and I hope that, in future, the Council will listen to the European Parliament to a much greater degree than it has done so far.
Â Â  Mr President, I noticed that Mr Kirkhope did not describe the IRA, and nor indeed did Mr Allister, as a fundamentalist Roman Catholic organisation, and they were quite right not do so.
I think it would be a grave error to start labelling organisations here as one religion or another.
What they all share is a desire to achieve political ends through anti-democratic efforts.
That is the basic definition in my view of terrorism: using violence in an anti-democratic way to achieve a political objective.
I would remind Mr Kirkhope and others that the experience in Northern Ireland and everywhere else is that by labelling sections of society you actually increase alienation and you drive recruitment to the organisations that are engaged in terrorism.
We must respond to terrorism politically, economically and socially.
Of course we have to defend our democratic way of life when it is threatened by violence, but we have to do so in a way that does not deny or reduce basic human rights, not only for society in general, but for those sections of society which are alienated from society at large.
We must engage with all of our citizens and seek to integrate them.
We must seek to ensure that they achieve in life what they set out to achieve, and not be alienated from us.
It is extremely important therefore that the measures we are proposing here today are proportionate and justified, and are effective, not only in dealing with terrorism, but also in seeking to ensure that terrorism cannot thrive.
We must therefore do more than simply put security measures in place.
My final point is in relation to bioterrorism.
Could I ask those who seek to heighten fears about bioterrorism to recognise the reality of terrorism.
The preferred weapons of terrorism are a few ounces of semtex in a holdall, a motor car, semi-automatic rifles and handguns-look at the experience of terrorism anywhere in the world-these are the weapons that are in use.
It is not sarin gas which creates the spectacular death and destruction which the terrorists need for the 6 o'clock news.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to express my enthusiastic support for Mr Alvaro's report.
It would be an act of folly if the proposed data retention scheme went through in its current form.
Cybercrime is a real plague, threatening to compromise the stability and security of our information systems.
It needs to be targeted with meaningful controls.
However, burdening telecommunications companies and Internet service providers with the cost of storing all data they process for one year is a poorly considered response, a shot in the dark.
Regardless of whether those transactions and communications go on record, the true criminal, one who is committed to avoiding easy detection, will know how to cover his tracks.
In any case, given the volume of data that would have to be retained, particularly Internet data, it is unlikely that the comprehensive analysis of the data would ever be carried out in time to be of any use.
We have seen clear indications that it was not for lack of data that US security agencies missed important clues in the lead up to the 11 September attacks, but rather that they lacked manpower to transcribe, translate and analyse the material.
Some have argued that the cost of data retention should be borne by governments, not companies.
Either way it is a waste of money.
Aside from the negative financial consequences, the system would infringe individual privacy, as many colleagues have agreed.
The European Convention on Human Rights gives us clear guidelines, enforced by the European Court of Justice, on when this data can be stored.
The proposed blanket scheme does not give any proper criteria that would meet the Convention on Human Rights.
I call upon my colleagues to follow Mr Alvaro in bringing this proposal to a swift and complete end.
Elsewhere, terrorism proposals have been in line with proportionality, but not in Mr Alvaroâs report.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to focus attention on one detail which is often forgotten when terrorism is being spoken about.
Terrorists finance their activity by traditional means, and with conventional crimes.
That is why normal police work is also important in the fight against terrorism.
Traditional police work is still faltering at European level.
Europol has not become an authority that operates throughout the entire membership area, which its name implies.
It is still an agency without proper resources or effective authority.
National police forces keep information from the authorities in other countries with the result that there is still no genuine trust between Member States.
Exchange of information and increased levels of trust would also boost transparency, which is what has been called for in this debate.
A competent Europol cannot emerge in the current climate.
That, however, is what is needed to safeguard other forms of European cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to speak specifically about the oral question from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, which concerns bioterrorism.
With the anthrax incidents in America, the attacks on the Japanese underground and the chemical attacks on the Kurds, we know that we are vulnerable if we do not take precautions against such bioterrorism.
In 2004, the United States and the European Union agreed to take constructive joint steps to improve our capabilities in this regard.
The Americans made a start with Project BioShield, and we want to know what the European Union is doing.
In February, the Worldwide Security Conference said that Europe was woefully unprepared for terrorist attacks.
In 2001, Europe began to take steps to make sure that it was prepared.
Its aims were to set up a mechanism for information exchange, to develop an EU-wide system for the detection, identification and diagnosis of chemical agents, to build up a stock of medicines and vaccinations, to establish a database of healthcare specialists and to provide guidance for health authorities on how to respond and how to liaise with international bodies.
But so far, not so good, because, as far as surveillance is concerned, we have established an early-warning system to detect airborne chemical agents, but its usefulness is limited, since it only operates for certain substances and would not guard against the contamination of water or food supplies.
We have no EU-wide stock of vaccines, and in most countries our quarantine laws are outdated.
The European Union has also established the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to, amongst other things, âdefend Europe against bioterrorismâ.
It is crucial for the centre to be enhanced and made effective.
The current stories about budget cuts for the centre are not acceptable and I hope that a strong message will be sent to the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this debate illustrates that Parliament is aware of the serious threat posed by terrorism and is determined to take strong action to combat it.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteurs.
There is a threat to our society, to our way of life, to our freedom, and we will only combat that threat if there is full cooperation at both European and international levels, and if we have a coherent policy rather than a mere list of initiatives, as both the Commissioner and Mr Oreja have both rightly pointed out.
On the other hand, those who favour a strategy whereby we pretend that we are not targets are fooling themselves, and are doing so on two counts.
Firstly, because that attitude feeds into the very essence of terrorism, namely that by instilling fear, it prevents us from living our lives, and secondly because it is only one way of affording us practical protection from a violent and very real threat.
Yet whilst we know about the danger and wish to take action, we are also aware that much remains to be done.
Such is the case with bioterrorism, which was referred to a moment ago and which now represents a danger that we must learn to deal with and that we are still clearly ill-prepared to address.
These weapons are inexpensive, small, easy to get hold of and have an enormous capacity for destruction, quite apart from the fact that merely simulating the use of such weapons is enough to cause widespread panic.
Europe must therefore respond to the various requirements, be it via the Member States or by means of specific Community programmes.
Stocks of medicines and vaccines must be kept, detection systems and rapid early warning systems must be improved, civil protection mechanisms such as national emergency plans must be stepped up, and a great deal of information must be made available.
Furthermore, these are the concerns that the Commission has also expressed.
It must not be forgotten, however, that the EU has made undertakings and it is now time to turn plans into action, and in the context of our international obligations, especially those taken on by the United States in the field of combating bioterrorism, which are being developed on the other side of the Atlantic in the form of Project BioShield.
I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that terrorism, and bioterrorism in particular, cuts across borders.
The fight against it must also, therefore, cut across borders.
Â Â  Mr President, in many of our countries terrorist organisations continue to recruit, train, raise funds, gather information and, indeed, carry out acts of terrorism.
On another level, there are still those who aim to inflict mass destruction on our democracies.
The battle against these organisations is a continuous one and it is right that this should not be in the public gaze.
It is our duty as politicians to ensure that our police, security and intelligence services are given every possible means and support for their difficult and often dangerous work, with proper safeguards for the liberties of our law-abiding citizens.
It is also our duty to be single-minded in our condemnation of terrorism.
Too often there are those who seek to apologise for or justify terrorism and abuse the human rights, civil liberties or anti-discrimination arguments in order to provide protection or legitimacy for terrorists whose causes they happen to favour.
Our own governments send out confusing signals when they are seen to deal and compromise with terrorists and even sacrifice the reputation of our security forces and individual officers in order to ingratiate themselves with organisations such as the Provisional IRA in the United Kingdom.
The so-called Tamil Tigers â the LTTE â continue to raise funds for their activities in the United Kingdom and in other European countries.
Hizbollah, a terrorist group estimated to have been involved in 80% of the terrorist attacks against Israel, still does not feature on the EU list of proscribed organisations.
It is right that there should be fresh measures in our counter-terrorist inventory in order to deal with an ever-changing threat and that these measures should be part of a seamless strategy.
However, unless we are prepared to fight the terrorists politically and with genuine resolve, then the practical measures will come to nothing.
In the United Kingdom we have highly professional and experienced security services, but their efforts are undermined by a failure on the part of government to take the most basic steps.
In a report last month on the functioning of terrorist legislation in the UK, Lord Carlisle said that in some ports there was effectively no security regarding incomers.
First of all, we need to get it right in our own countries.
The EU should be involved only where there is some genuine, proven added value and not as a means of extending the competence of EU institutions into yet more areas of activity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, terrorism constitutes an extremely grave danger.
That is also the reason why we are dealing with it today and why we have no fewer than seven reports on the subject before us.
It is a problem that can only be solved jointly, together with the various governments in Europe.
During this debate, the thought frequently crossed my mind that one or other of the referenda in France and the Netherlands might have had a different outcome if some voters had been more aware of the problems that concern us, if it could have been made clear that such problems are simply impossible to solve unless Europe acts as one.
Perhaps the seven different reports and the numerous models are also an indication that we must focus on the essentials if we want people to understand this need for joint action and to consent to the pursuit of this approach.
It is not a matter of forever producing new proposals and new programmes â and thereby raising peopleâs hopes too â but rather of ensuring that people take note that what we are doing to combat terrorism is bearing fruit, that the EUâs Counter-Terrorism Coordinator is not only a public authority but is also working successfully with the Commission in the quest for greater efficiency, that Europol and Eurojust are becoming effective instruments and that democratic control is taking place.
It is absolutely imperative, as is stated in one of the reports, that we as a Parliament undertake to ensure that the instruments we introduce are subject to review during their lifetime.
Have they had an effect?
What effect have they had?
Are any specific measures dispensable?
Is it not perhaps more important to focus on essentials?
This brings me to the final point I feel it is important to make.
How trust can be squandered and how a key objective can be badly pursued are aptly illustrated by what we have on the table today under the heading of data retention, which is now being dealt with for the th time.
This is a case where action is being taken for its own sake, where people are being mollified with measures that may ultimately do nothing to enhance their security.
If that is so, it will not serve to persuade the public that Europe is important and beneficial and to make them accept the results of our work.
I should not like to be held responsible for the public perception of the European Union.
For the fifth or sixth time, I say that responsibility for this lies with the national governments, whose outburst of hyperactivity is designed to salve their consciences without actually achieving anything in terms of greater effectiveness.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would first like to thank the seven rapporteurs for their exemplary work, which clearly shows that an all-embracing approach needs to be adopted towards the fight against terrorism, an approach covering many fields.
I believe that these seven reports also demonstrate that Parliament attaches great importance to this issue of the fight against terrorism.
We are still feeling the enormous impact of the events of 11Â SeptemberÂ 2001 and the attack in Madrid on 11Â March 2004.
These cowardly attacks have affected all of us, both as European citizens and citizens of the world.
They were attacks on democracy and on the values we stand for, and that is why the fight against terrorism needs to be uncompromising, but at the same time a fight for democracy.
It would be wrong to defend democracy by undermining it.
Many of the speeches we have heard this morning have called for terrorism to be combated more effectively and for there to be a clear commitment to the fight against terrorism and terrorist networks, while stressing that this fight should not threaten our democratic rights and civil liberties.
We are faced with a constant balancing act here: we need to safeguard our rights and our freedoms while unremittingly confronting those who wish to put those same rights and freedoms at risk.
We are a long way from the Orwellian vision of an all-controlling state.
However, we need to be vigilant if we wish to avoid any drift in that direction.
Nor must we lose sight of the fact that terrorism exploits the full range of resources and new technologies and that it has become a global and globalised phenomenon, a network which makes use of the Internet just like any other globalised enterprise.
If we are to stand up to this threat and fight this phenomenon, we can no longer afford to deprive ourselves of tools such as data retention.
Nevertheless, it is important to respect private life in this context.
It is always a question of proportionality.
I agree with the concept of protecting private life that has been raised.
Having said that, we cannot forgo making use of certain technology if we are to remain effective in combating terrorism.
Europe needs to lead the way here.
It is noticeable that elsewhere there is a tendency not to take this protection of private life and individual rights seriously.
Europe must show that the war on terror and respect for our rights can go hand in hand, without the effectiveness of that war being sacrificed or weakened.
I have also paid heed to the criticisms aired about the European Union as regards coordination and exchanges of information.
Since the occurrence of these events, and in particular the attack in Madrid, there has been a great improvement in coordination, particularly thanks to MrÂ de Vries, who has been given a special remit to coordinate all the activities of the European Union and its Member States in the fight against terrorism.
I would like to thank him for his work and his commitment in this area.
I also noticed that some people are concerned that Europe is not prepared for other kinds of threat, even more terrible than those involved in the two attacks I have already mentioned.
There is bio-terrorism for example, a threat that is hard for us to grasp or imagine.
It is possible, however, and it is a threat that cannot just be brushed aside.
For that reason, we need to be prepared to deal with it.
I would also like to take this opportunity to reply to MrÂ Florenzâs question. He touched upon this very issue of the threat of bio-terrorism and that of nuclear terrorism.
It is clear that this type of terrorism, which includes chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear terrorism, represents a threat to peace and international security.
We know that terrorist networks have shown a keen interest in such substances and weapons and that, if they were able to lay their hands on such weapons of mass destruction, they would be in a position to inflict damage on an unprecedented scale and undermine the democratic foundations of our societies.
That is why this threat of biological, nuclear and chemical terrorism deserves to be given increased attention by the European Union.
Parallels have been drawn with US legislation in this field.
There is no doubt that Europe has a lot to learn from the United States, particularly as regards setting up special teams, stockpiling vaccines, carrying out research and development work on medical countermeasures, and so on.
Some similar initiatives have already been taken by the Member States, and the institutions of the European Union have already committed themselves to activities of this kind.
Accordingly, the Union now has an early warning system for all kinds of terrorist attacks, for which a central point called Argus will be created within the Commission.
The directive amending the directive on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use now entitles the Member States temporarily to permit the distribution of authorised medicinal products in the case of an attack involving the spread of pathogens, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation.
Anti-CBRN training for medical staff is being implemented.
Information on civil defence capacity and blood banks is being exchanged as part of civil defence arrangements.
Furthermore, wide-ranging research work is being carried out under the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Technological Development to enable a better response to acts of this kind.
The Councilâs strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is intended to prevent terrorists from gaining access to such weapons, and it is a matter for regret that the New York conference did not reach agreement on a common text, given that one aspect of the non-proliferation conference was the threat of terrorism in these areas.
As part of another remit, in this case following on from the declaration on the fight against terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004, on 2 December 2004 the Council and the Commission adopted the EU solidarity programme on the consequences of terrorist threats and attacks, which revised the CBRN programme and widened it to cover all forms of terrorism.
One of the fundamental principles of the EU strategy is that protection against the consequences of terrorist attacks is chiefly a matter for the Member States.
Nevertheless, the declaration on solidarity against terrorism adopted by the European Council on 25 March 2004 confirms that the institutions of the EU and the Member States firmly intend to mobilise all the instruments at their disposal to assist a Member State on its territory at the request of its political authorities.
In this respect, I feel bound to refer to the provision in the Constitution which strengthens the nature of solidarity, particularly in the case of terrorist attacks.
The CBRN programme, and its successor the solidarity programme, are multidisciplinary programmes involving political, technical, economic, diplomatic, military and legal resources.
This is rather difficult, but there it is ...
In the context of the present solidarity programme, EU action against CBRN terrorism is based on six strategic objectives, which I would like briefly to mention.
Threat analysis and assessment: several analyses of these threats have been carried out by Europol and the EUâs Joint Situation Centre, SITCEN.
Prevention and reduction of vulnerability: legislative measures have been taken to improve compliance with international biosafety and biosecurity standards.
Detection of CBRN attacks: the Commission has taken steps to extend and coordinate the Communityâs systems for detection, communication and information in connection with chemical and biological threats, as well as with human, animal and plant health.
Lastly, preparations to mitigate the impact of possible attacks: the Commission is assessing what capacity the Member States could make mutually available in terms of civil defence and as regards medical and pharmaceutical supplies.
It is drawing up regulations for treating illnesses associated with these substances.
For its part, the Council has created a database of military resources, as well as capacity relevant to protecting civilians against terrorist attacks, including CBRN attacks.
In the context of the European Security and Defence Policy aspects of the fight against terrorism, civil/military interoperability in the field of CBRN is in the process of being examined.
The Council is also carrying out work on an integrated crisis management system.
International cooperation obviously has a very important part to play here: it broadly addresses the same objectives as the solidarity programme, that is to say the pooling of epidemiological information on cross-border transmission of contagious diseases, and cooperation on emergency planning, laboratory detection technology, non-proliferation, mutual assistance and response coordination.
The United States is also taking part in this work.
Another dialogue will be initiated at the appropriate time.
We consider this international cooperation, particularly with the Americans, but also with all our other partners, to be extremely important in this context.
Before we proceed to the vote and before my colleague Vice-President Frattini takes the floor, let me just say this by way of conclusion: I believe that the European Union is engaged in a worldwide process of preparation for the fight against all forms of terrorism.
The war on terror, as I said at the beginning, and as your reports have clearly demonstrated, requires a global approach.
There is one issue that we particularly need to take to heart: we must prevent terrorist groups from recruiting within our own societies.
In fact it is such recruitment within our societies, especially amongst rootless young people who are poorly integrated into our own societies, that represents the greatest terrorist threat.
These young people to some extent represent a breeding ground for acts that are hard to imagine, acts which reflect a kind of despair.
This means that our strategy for combating terrorism needs to include a social aspect, an aspect covering the integration and treatment of these groups, particularly young people, who come from Islamic countries.
In this way we can win this battle here on our own territory within the European Union, and that is absolutely vital.
Â Â  At this point I have the pleasure of welcoming our former colleague, Mr Gijs de Vries, whom I wish all the strength he needs for his great task.
Welcome to the European Parliament, MrÂ deÂ Vries.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly cannot respond in a few minutes to all of the important speeches made during a debate lasting approximately three hours.
I would just like to make some very quick observations.
I believe that there is broad consensus on the fact that, in combating terrorism, we require measures at European level, actions linked in a comprehensive European strategy, and balanced measures, which are primarily focused on prevention, on cooperation â also at international level â and on respect for peopleâs fundamental rights, including, obviously and above all, the right to privacy, which is a point raised by many Members in this House.
There is a further principle that I believe must be highlighted, and that is that no one can be suspected of terrorism on the basis of ethnicity or religious belief, because that would genuinely mean the victory of terrorism, which relies on conflict between religions and civilisations.
Whilst it is necessary, therefore, to understand the deep roots of terrorism, there must be no doubt, however, about the fact that terrorism can never be justified.
We must know about the roots in order to eradicate them, but never to justify them.
There is a profound distinction between those two concepts.
In addition, we must devote our full attention to the measures decided upon at European level, that is to say, the action plan.
You are probably aware that many Member States have not yet implemented many measures set out in the action plan.
Right now, I can only mention two positive examples, those of Denmark and Hungary, two Member States that have, in contrast, implemented them all.
I believe that they can be held up as models to the other Member States of the European Union.
There is also a principle on which we are all agreed, and that is the solidarity principle.
Firstly, solidarity among the Member States â and on this point I fully agree with the President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ Schmit.
I believe that we must essentially introduce the principle enacted in the Constitutional Treaty, which makes provision for mutual solidarity among the Member States when one of them is attacked by terrorists.
Secondly, solidarity towards the victims of terrorism, which is another of the lines of action on which Europe will have to focus.
We have spoken at length about bioterrorism.
In the first instance, the European Commission can press for the continuation and strengthening of the actions undertaken.
It is making every effort to encourage the Member States to take all of the measures required for an appropriate level of preparedness in the event of a bioterrorist attack, and hopes to be able to rely on the full support of this House in persuading all of the Member States to act more incisively, by investing greater resources, because the threat of a bioterrorist attack cannot and must not find us unprepared.
We will inform Parliament about all of the measures that we have undertaken, including the simulations of terrorist attacks and the international cooperation actions that we are conducting.
To conclude, MrÂ President, I believe that the most powerful weapon against terrorism is the united action of the institutions, the Commission, Parliament, the Council, and civil society.
We have to explain to our citizens that it is only by means of the united action of the institutions and society that there can be a genuinely European response to the challenge of terrorists, which is a challenge faced by us all.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  I think that we had a very helpful and full debate just now on the need to use all the means at our disposal to combat terrorism, as long as our basic rights and freedoms are respected.
As I just said, it is vital to maintain that balance at all costs.
A number of countries want to set up a system to tackle the resources at the disposal of terrorists.
We know that terrorists are using all manner of possible technologies in an increasingly sophisticated way.
This initiative therefore deserves to be followed up and explored, because it would provide us with a more effective means of countering the use of such technology, particularly over the Internet.
Nevertheless, I must stress that the use of data retention must go hand in hand with respect for privacy and data protection.
A balance needs to be struck between security on the one hand and freedom on the other.
We must not, however, deprive ourselves out of hand of the use of means that in certain circumstances â and 11Â May 2004 comes to mind once again here â could mean that human lives are spared, perhaps dozens, hundreds or even thousands of lives.
Â Â  That therefore means that the Council wishes to adhere to its proposal.
Accordingly, in accordance with Rule 52(3) of the Rules of Procedure, the text is referred back to the committee responsible with the observations of the President of the Council.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to inform you that we have withdrawn AmendmentÂ 14 to recital Q.
Â Â  Mr President, recital C could be amended by the addition of a few simple words, as the first necessity is a clear definition of political terror and terrorism.
I see this as a logical remark, as nobody could say that is better not to have a definition or that it is not worth making the effort.
I would therefore ask you to support this amendment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wished to speak before the vote on this amendment, which in fact repeats the paragraph that has already been approved.
This Parliament has condemned preventative war twice over, which strikes me as being a positive sign.
Â Â  Amendment 1 has been put to the vote and has been adopted.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to propose, in agreement with Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, who is the author of this amendment, and being aware that the Socialist Group also has a similar oral amendment, that at the end, after the words âtrafficking in drugs, arms and human beingsâ, it should read: âand financing through extortion, including the so-called revolutionary taxâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I would simply like to say that we accept Baroness Ludford's amendment and we will not therefore present any other oral Amendment.
We believe that amendment to be perfect and we will support it.
Â Â  This amendment will therefore be inserted into Amendment 4, and that amendment, which has been modified twice, will be put to the vote.
Â Â  . The report by Mrs Laperrouze, together with the Commissionâs proposal, sets out priorities for the trans-European energy networks on the basis of the creation of a more open and competition-based internal energy market, one that is beholden to the principles of competition.
As we know, the privatisations in the sector were justified by the so-called Lisbon Strategy, to which we have always been opposed.
Occasional concerns with consumer protection and with the use of renewable energy are raised, yet those play second fiddle to the concerns of the market, or in other words, the interests of the large economic groups and the multinationals operating in the sector.
We are opposed to that objective.
In the meantime, of course, we speak of universal access to services and the obligation to provide public services, yet this only serves to underline the need to build and maintain energy infrastructure â as defined by the Commission, and based on opinions and plans drawn up by the Member States â so as to enable the internal market to operate efficiently, with due regard to the procedures for consulting the people affected, and without detracting from the strategic criteria and the above-mentioned criteria and obligations added by Parliament.
Despite all of this, the funding is still meagre.
Â Â  We recommend that the EU countries cooperate on cross-border issues on which EU cooperation can add value in relation to what can be achieved within existing international cooperation structures.
We have chosen to vote in favour of the overall report on trans-European energy networks, because this is an important cross-border European issue.
We support those amendments that open the way for limited top-down government.
We welcome the idea of using the EUâs existing structural funds to finance the costs involved in this type of cooperation.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Laperrouze on the important and timely report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decisions No 96/391/EC and No 1229/2003/EC.
I support this report, especially in that it proposes common rules for the European gas and electricity market, in which the environment is an ever-present factor and the safety of the electricity supply is guaranteed in each of the Member States, regions and territories.
Incorporating the new Member Statesâ energy networks into trans-European networks will undoubtedly facilitate the cohesion process in the enlarged EU.
Nonetheless, when new infrastructure is built, maintained or enhanced, the environmental impact must be taken into account and procedures must be followed for the prior notification and consultation of the people affected, as laid down in Community and national legislation.
The EUâs dependence on one single source of energy supply might have ramifications for its external policy and might restrict its role on the international stage.
It is therefore essential for technological development in European industry that new sources of alternative energy be developed.
Â Â  . Increasing energy efficiency is an important aim for many reasons.
This is why we support all reasonable efforts to ensure that energy is used efficiently.
The present Rothe report, however, only partly satisfies this requirement.
It proposes too much bureaucracy, too much centralism and questionable methods of increasing energy efficiency in Europe.
Despite all these misgivings, we shall approve the report at the first reading, because the benchmarking approach, which we favour, is included as an option.
We call on the Council and the Commission to embrace the benchmarking system in place of the uniform percentage targets and to proceed quickly to make the necessary preparations for the implementation of such a system so that there will be no need to apply uniform percentage targets, even for an introductory period.
If this line is not followed, we shall vote against these binding percentage targets at the second reading.
Â Â  . We naturally endorse the goals of greater energy end use efficiency and of renewable energy contributing 20% of overall energy consumption in the EU.
We accordingly support measures aimed at achieving this objective and therefore voted in favour of most of the rapporteurâs proposals.
It is interesting to see how Parliament deems the public sector capable of providing a lead in this area, and thus sets more ambitious goals for the sector.
We object, however, to the emphasis on liberalising the market in the area of energy efficiency, in particular domestic consumption, from JulyÂ 2007, as contained in a number of the rapporteurâs proposals.
We voted against those proposals.
Â Â  Increased energy efficiency is an important part of the strategy for achieving the Kyoto Protocolâs objectives.
We do not, however, believe that the EU should set detailed objectives in terms of energy savings or specify how these are to be achieved.
The EU can and should intervene in genuinely cross-border environmental issues, but it must not dictate energy policy objectives.
Our vote against the European Parliamentâs report does not imply support for the Commissionâs original proposal.
Â Â  . If we wish to make real energy savings â and this ought to be our wish â that swim against the tide of increased energy use, both in developing and developed countries, one of our main tasks will be to warn the citizens of the impact of excessive energy use.
Making people aware of the problems is the best way to involve them in the necessary solutions.
As such, the proposals put forward in this report, particularly those concerning awareness-raising, among both public and private users, of the benefits that can be derived from saving energy, will prove to be extremely useful.
Â Â  We are open to the idea of the EU countries creating a Web-based portal where the Member States make relevant environmental indicators available.
We take a critical view of those wordings that open the way for the EU to implement similar measures within other policy areas.
The rapporteur has not clearly specified which areas are in the running and to what degree.
We also take the view that the report provides too much detailed regulation and that the Member States are called upon to make data available within too many areas.
The basic geographical conditions vary from one Member State to another.
The same types of information and indicator are thus not relevant to all countries.
For the aforesaid reasons, we have chosen to vote against Parliamentâs report.
We believe that the Commissionâs proposal is less far-reaching and better worded than the report presented by Parliament.
Â Â  . Data sharing between Member States makes an important contribution towards building a widespread and strongly-rooted feeling of trust between all concerned, and is naturally useful in and of itself.
In this particular case, the data that can be obtained in this way is both cross-border in nature and can be used for cross-border purposes.
For this reason, namely the objective of sharing data, I am naturally in favour.
Â Â  The June List supports institutional competition and therefore regrets that the Commission has considered it necessary to regulate this market too.
At present, the legislation applies where reinsurance is written, meaning that the market players themselves choose which legislation is most appropriate.
It is not to citizens that the directive primarily offers protection.
Instead, it concerns regulations governing financial institutions and trade between companies (B2B).
These players carry out their own risk assessments on a daily basis and do not need further EU legislation.
Not being able to vote against the Commissionâs proposals, we therefore choose to abstain from voting.
Â Â  . As I did at the Committee stage, I supported today the compromise package as commended to us in the Skinner Report.
Financial services make a very substantial contribution to the economy of Scotland, and re-insurance, whether directly or indirectly, affect Scottish-based enterprises and consumers.
I welcome this proposal, which makes progress towards a Europe-wide system of re-insurance provision and regulation, as well as providing an opportunity to tackle the situation in the USA, where vast amounts of capital are tied up because of their collateral requirement leading to extra costs currently being passed on to consumers.
The rapporteur is to be congratulated for his work on this document.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of the report before us because it improves on the Commissionâs proposal, and indeed includes some of the proposals that we tabled.
It is true that, on certain issues, we could have gone further, especially with regard to the amounts generated by modulation and implementing them in support measures for the agriculture and forestry sectors, and with regard to the increase in support for farmers receiving the least aid.
If the Commission were at least to take this resolution on board, however, that would be a positive step.
Doubts remain as to including measures aimed at nature conservation and at the Natura 2000 network in the support programme for rural development, especially because there is no indication that doing so would prevent a reduction in the budget allotted to rural development.
The ongoing debate is not promising, and everything points to cuts taking place, thus leading to a policy that will fail to promote economic and social cohesion, jobs and social inclusion.
It is known that we are opposed to cofinancing and the liberalisation of the farming market, given that this is at variance with a policy of promoting a form of rural development in which the populations are settled and in which family farming and small and medium-sized holdings are supported, a policy based on respect for the diverse character of the different Member States of the EU.
Â Â  We are completely opposed to this report and believe that, in terms of its individual parts, it is quite absurd.
We absolutely cannot support the reportâs proposal to increase the appropriations in relation to the Commissionâs proposals.
We wonder why the Member States cannot manage to develop their rural areas themselves?
Or is the general intention behind the EAFRD based on a desire for others to foot the bill?
Reasons in terms of distribution policy as to why the rich countries should help the poor countries in the EU may be adduced but, in that case, the poor countries should decide for themselves how the aid is used.
Amendment 29 refers to the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
This proposal has now been defeated and can no longer be referred to.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, and the comments of the rapporteur, on the importance of ensuring a healthy rural economy.
Successful agriculture and forestry industries in Scotland are essential contributors to the viability of our many rural communities.
The geography of Scotland means that many of our rural areas are Less Favoured Areas which require specific support measures.
EU support can play an important part in assisting rural businesses to meet the many competitive challenges which they face.
I hope that the future budget of the EU will provide adequately for rural development programmes, and that the UK and Scottish Governments will enable the full potential benefits to be realised.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mrs Schierhuber on her timely report on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament must oppose attempts to reduce the amounts earmarked for rural development.
The intensity of the proposed aid for the outermost regions should be kept at current levels.
Â Â  . One of the most important aspects of the common agricultural policy, namely its financing, has yet to be decided upon.
I have therefore voted in favour of this report regardless of the outcome of the debate on the Financial Perspective.
European policy on this issue should in fact be more rural than merely agricultural, comprising a series of measures and axes that form a coherent policy for the rural world.
This is my view and the thrust of the view expressed in the report.
The financing of these policies should form part of the debate on the Financial Perspective, in which we shall have the opportunity to assess the necessary amounts.
For the time being, I shall merely express my support for a simplification model that seeks a coherent policy for a space that is diverse, yet sufficiently homogenous to be treated as a whole.
Â Â  Mr President, according to a study, governments have spent more than 191 billion dollars on the war on terrorism in 2005.
This expenditure is set to snowball over the next ten years.
Forty-four per cent of this amount has been spent by the United States on military and police operations, for example.
It remains somewhat questionable, however, whether the anti-terrorism strategy has been succeeding.
A prime example of this spurious success is Iraq, which has become a breeding ground for terrorism in the wake of the war.
We have hitherto confined ourselves to treating the symptoms instead of trying to root out this evil.
As a result, extremists have benefited from ignorance and misjudgement of Islam to recruit ever-increasing numbers of militants, many of whom are drawn from the lower strata of the Muslim population.
This is where we have to focus our efforts; we must adopt new ways of thinking and follow new paths.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of this report.
We wish to make it clear that we are, however, opposed to setting up a European register of convictions.
Â Â  The proposal presented by Sweden, Ireland, France and the United Kingdom on the retention of communications traffic data is aimed at improving cooperation in matters of criminal law.
We fully support that aim since it is important for the Member States and the Community to provide the crime prevention authorities with adequate tools for carrying out their work.
Sweden has had great success in fighting crime and clearing up serious individual crimes by using retained traffic communications data.
The same also applies to certain other Member States.
The need for, and reasonableness of, the draft framework decision has not, however, been sufficiently clarified by the four Member States.
It is therefore necessary for the four Member States and/or the Commission to come back with good examples of when the retention of communications traffic data has been very important to the prevention, investigation, detection and bringing to court of crimes and punishable offences, including terrorism.
It is also necessary for them clearly to show the reasonableness of, and need for, legislation in this area, given the possible consequences for privacy it would entail.
Â Â  The June List is in favour of increased cooperation between the Member States in combating terrorism and other serious cross-border crime.
These are, however, what are known as third pillar issues, concerning intergovernmental police and legal cooperation, and decisions concerning them have to be taken by the Member States in the Council and not by supranational EU institutions.
It is thus for the national parliaments, and not the European Parliament, to assess the results of negotiations and call for responsibility to be accepted.
The June List cannot therefore support Parliamentâs amendments, in spite of the fact that we would have supported the contents of several of them if we had been sitting in the Swedish Parliament.
Where report A6-0162/2005 is concerned, we support Swedenâs initiative in the Council concerning a Framework Decision on simplifying the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the EU.
Â Â  We support most aspects of MrÂ BÃ¶schâs report on the fight against fraud.
The fact that the variety of tax rates on tobacco in the EU Member States leads to problems involving cigarette smuggling is a known fact, mentioned in paragraphs 33 and 36.
We agree with these statements, but we are opposed to further reductions in tobacco taxes.
Reduced prices for tobacco increase consumption and have a harmful effect on public health.
We believe there are better ways of getting to grips with the problems of smuggling.
Nor can we support the view that customs authorities should be equipped with mobile units or that the EU agency for the external borders should also conduct customs investigations.
Â Â  . Despite the technical aspect that the rapporteur attempted to introduce into this report, the issue has a major political part to play in the unrestrictedly âopen and competition-based marketâ that is being sought.
In the approach to this issue, underlying political issues keep coming to the surface, resulting in issues that are â or can be â politically different being lumped together.
Protecting the Communitiesâ financial interests by ensuring that management is not wasteful and fraudulent belongs to one category, and combating fraud (albeit with a common zone on fraud within the âCommunitiesâ bodies), which comes in the form of various kinds of tax evasion, parallel and black markets and trafficking of various kinds, belongs to a quite different one.
Among the many important points raised in the report, I should like to highlight the fact that the Member States have been given new responsibilities, whilst having some of their previous responsibilities removed, by means of permanently disqualifying and dismissing public workers and hiring private firms to do some of this work.
As regards this important political issue, I should like to express my criticism of the âdelegation to private firms of missions of the European public serviceâ as stated in the report.
Â Â  Terrorism was once the weapon of the Communist revolutionary international.
It is now used by the Islamic revolutionary international, whose objective is the destruction of western civilisation and the establishment of Islamic republics throughout the world and particularly in Europe.
In fact, through mass Muslim immigration, our governments have imported the politico-religious civil war raging in North Africa and in the Middle East into Europe.
By means of terror â violent or not â Islamists want, on the one hand, to control the Muslim masses for the purposes of revolution and, on the other hand, to paralyse our nations.
The electoral defeat of the Aznar government in Spain, which was considered to be hostile to Islamists, just days after the attack carried out by Moroccan immigrants on 11Â March 2004, formed part of this strategy.
The same applies to the assassination of the Dutch film maker Theo Van Gogh.
Demands to wear the Muslim headscarf and to have halal menus in school canteens represent the early stages of this process of subversion.
Mass terrorism is the final stage of that process.
Until we have recognised the reality of this danger, Islamic terrorists will pursue their revolutionary jihad.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted against setting up a European Public Prosecutor's Office as proposed by MrsÂ DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡les in the report on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the EU anti-terrorism Action Plan.
The Moderate delegation believes that public prosecutorsâ offices should operate at national level.
Â Â  Prevention, preparation and response in connection with terrorist attacks are important and necessary measures.
That such work should lead to the EU having to define and implement a European political project does not, however, make sense.
The victims of terrorism can be supported in better ways than by setting up further EU authorities.
We are, moreover, opposed to exploiting terrorist acts and other tragic events to extend the power and influence of the EU institutions.
The June List has therefore voted against the report.
Â Â  . This report fails to tackle the underlying causes of terrorism, such as the serious deterioration in the worldâs situation, the spiral of violence fed by the militarisation of international relations, the attacks on the sovereignty of states and people â in other words, state terrorism â the exploitation caused by unbridled capitalism, the inhuman deterioration in social inequality and the millions of human beings living in abysmal conditions.
Under the pretext of the âfight against terrorismâ, it proposes to create and reinforce an entire information network, and to set up security organisations that are centralised at European level â imposing âsupranationalâ structures in order to bypass cooperation between sovereign countries â thereby promoting repressive measures that form part of broader strategies to perpetuate an unjust world order, based on the permanent use of force, of the arms race and of economic and financial domination.
Hence the unacceptable agreements between the EU and the United States concerning the exchange of personal data, the unacceptable criminalisation of organisations fighting for the fundamental rights of a people, such as the right to sovereignty and independence and the unacceptable attacks on sovereign countries.
Consequently, our group voted against.
Â Â  .â The package of eight reports being presented today to the European Parliament details the so-called EU strategy for combating terrorism, in the aim of strengthening the policy to serve big business against the rising grass-roots movement and the peoples' resistance to imperialism.
The Oreja report endeavours to substantiate the need to escalate this policy and pass to the stage of preventive action against terrorism, in line with the American imperialist doctrine of preventive war.
At the same time, it uses 'Islamic terrorism' to neatly introduce an expanded definition of terrorist action and terrorist groups, by which it of course means the movements and organisations which are contesting or fighting to overturn the present regime.
This report also makes an obvious effort to create a climate of disorientation of the workers by posing the question of 'terrorism' as the greatest danger, so that the proposed autocratic measures are accepted and there is grass-roots consent to the constitution of new repressive bodies and mechanisms.
The workers and peoples of Europe will react to the painful efforts of the EU to step up its repressive measures and mechanisms against the grass-roots movement with disobedience and insubordination at national level and by strengthening their fight and coordination to overturn them.
Â Â  . The Oreja report â A6-0166/2005 â on a proposal for a recommendation from the European Parliament to the Council on terrorist attacks: prevention, preparation and response(2005/2043(INI)), as part of the anti-terrorism package adopted in the European Parliament today, also pursues the aim of creating a legal area where the weapons with which war on terrorism is waged include mutual recognition of court judgments, police measures and exchanges of information between police forces and between intelligence services.
As a result, fundamental rights are liable to fall by the wayside.
This approach, in fact, has come under increasingly heavy criticism in the Member States since the establishment of the European arrest warrant, because the fairly harmless-sounding formula âmutual recognitionâ turns out, on closer inspection, to be a very potent instrument.
A personâs extradition to another Member State of the EU, for example, closes the door on the possibility of judicial review.
The most critical points of the Oreja report are:
- the aim of an âexchange of information between police forces and between intelligence servicesâ,
- the aim of an âexchange of information regarding suspected terrorists and their organisations with third countries and international organisationsâ, and
- the aim of encouraging âthe increasing specialisation of Europol and Eurojust in the fight against [...] terrorismâ.
Democratic control of prosecuting authorities, effective protection of personal data and the horizontal division of powers do not feature at all in this regime.
Â Â  .The report is fully harmonised with the endeavour to disorientate and terrify the peoples on the pretext of terrorism.
It adopts the relevant Commission communication calling on the Member States to prepare (including in cooperation with private security firms) lists of installations which are considered to be 'critical infrastructures' (private, government, public utility) in the following sectors: energy, communications, banks, healthcare, food, water, transport, public administration etc. The major industries â as owners and as associations, such as the Association of Greek Industries â are being upgraded as equal partners with the state in a sector which (on the face of it as least) comes solely with the jurisdiction of the state.
They will have access to all the information on possible risks of 'terrorist attacks' and will help to process the anti-terrorism strategy.
All this will be incorporated into a 'European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP), while for the collection and exchange of any information which will contribute towards the early warning system for crises and emergencies, another spy network (ARGUS) will be created.
The above measures, in conjunction with the European terrorism law, aim apart from anything else to create preconditions so that any form of fight used by the workers' and grass-roots movement in their struggle can be considered as terrorist action.
The rapporteur's endeavour to include risks from natural disasters and the references to respect for fundamental rights are an alibi for passing the new autocratic measures.
Â Â  The Moderate delegation has today voted against setting up a European register of criminal sentences.
For the same reason, we have voted against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . Terrorism, let there be no doubt, is the dictatorship of this century, and it should be fought unstintingly.
In recent years, events have led to a gradual awakening, which this debate shows has neither worn off nor lost its focus.
We know that there is a threat against our way of life, our society and the freedom we enjoy.
We are also aware that our greatest virtues â such as freedom, respect for the individual and solidarity â can lead to weaknesses in the fight against terrorism.
It is therefore essential that we strike a constant balance between what we must sacrifice and the elements that are indispensable to preserving our way of life.
In this context, in light of the progress that has been made, the widespread commitment, the difficulties encountered, the need for amendments and the warnings of the shortcomings that still exist, the debate on this and the other reports in the plenary session should be addressed from a similar perspective.
After all, there has been a clear sign here that there is awareness; awareness of the risk, awareness of the need for action to be taken and of what cannot and should not be demanded, even in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by responding to the last remark from the chair.
It may be that the adoption of my report by a two-thirds majority of the temporary committee has made a similar result appear likely in tomorrowâs vote, and this has possibly taken some of the heat out of the issue.
When, on 15Â September, the decision was taken to appoint it, the temporary committee was given a mandate to determine Parliamentâs negotiating position on the political challenges and budgetary means of the enlarged European Union.
After working on this for seven months, we present to you today our proposal on the negotiating position of the European Parliament.
The fact that the temporary committee was able to adopt the report by a two-thirds majority in spite of all the opposing views that exist on specific points was due entirely to the close cooperation and mutual trust with which its members fulfilled their mandate.
For this reason I should like to thank you first of all, MrÂ President, in your capacity as chairman of the temporary committee, and to express my special thanks to the coordinators and the highly dedicated Members who were responsible for drafting the opinions of their respective committees.
I thank all of you sincerely for our close and fruitful cooperation over these past months.
I should also like to add a special word of thanks to the staff of the Secretariat, every one of whom did fantastic work for us all.
Following our deliberations on 22 working papers, our discussions with 17 committees, which have given their opinions, and also our hearings with delegations from the national parliaments, to which I attach great importance, this report can make good our claim, as an institution, to have analysed and assessed the Commissionâs proposals most carefully and most intensively.
This means that the result we present to you today represents a robust, coherent and comprehensive solution.
Without Parliamentâs consent, there will be no Financial Perspective.
We want a solution, but we are not prepared to sell our soul for it.
We have endorsed the parts of the Commissionâs proposals that we considered to be right and proper, particularly with regard to the aims of more growth and employment as proclaimed in the Lisbon Strategy.
We have made cuts where appropriate without endangering the integration process.
We have set our own political priorities, and we do not intend to confine our discussion to mere number-crunching but to make the absolutely essential improvements to the basic conditions for annual budgeting by simplifying the programmes.
We have tried to walk the tightrope between synergy and subsidiarity without ever losing sight of our obligation to exercise budgetary discipline.
We have also, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, advocated synchronisation of the term of the Financial Perspective with Parliamentâs legislative term and the Commissionâs term of office.
We want to see a binding obligation to simplify programmes as well as reform of the Financial Regulation, and we insist that the new legislation on multiannual programmes must preserve the rights of Parliament in full and as a matter of course in every single area of activity, including areas such as foreign policy.
A solution on the expenditure side will only be feasible if it is accompanied by short-term and long-term solutions on the Unionâs own resources, corrective mechanisms designed to improve the internal balance of the budget.
If we nail our colours to the mast by calling for more research and development and for lifelong learning, the public will expect us to deliver these things.
If, at the same time, we proclaim our support for cohesion in full awareness of the current state of the debate within the Council, and if we are also compelled to acknowledge that the present debates in the Council on citizenship of the Union â on the protection of our citizens against internal dangers and on the protection of our external borders â and on the role of the EU as a global partner manifestly confront us with a problem of chronic underfunding of strategic policy areas, it becomes clear that this will be a subject on which we shall have to engage in some tough negotiating with the Council.
Given the prospect of this difficult debate and in the light of our experience with AgendaÂ 2000, we believe that a new instrument to provide reserves and flexibility on the basis of existing agreements is an absolutely essential agenda item for the forthcoming negotiations.
At the end of the day, we arrived at figures that boil down to 1.18% in commitment appropriations and 1.07% in payment appropriations.
I ask all of you to approve this report tomorrow in the form in which the temporary committee commends it to you.
This will strengthen our negotiating position. It would also give the Commission more scope to shape the difficult process of European integration.
The Financial Perspective should serve â if not entirely, at least to some extent â as an important demonstration of commitment to a more people-centred and forward-looking Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am very pleased to have this opportunity of addressing Parliament this afternoon before you vote on the resolution on the future Financial Perspectives.
In accordance with the budgetary powers devolved on Parliament by the Treaty, the Luxembourg Presidency gives top priority to maintaining an open and unreserved dialogue with Parliament in this field.
This is one of the most important questions facing the European Union at this present time.
It also comes at a time when the European Union simply must not fail.
I also want to express our gratitude for the work done by the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Union, which you chaired, Mr President.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
Your contribution to this complex and, to say the least, politically sensitive debate has been important in two respects.
Firstly, Parliament has shown realism and taken a consistent approach.
Secondly, with this report and this resolution you set as it were the main parameters for the negotiations that will follow those in the Council and which, in the end, will be just as decisive for the Financial Perspectives as those that take place in the European Council next week.
In any case, as the Presidency takes every opportunity to point out, this first round of negotiations in the Council is only a first round, and Parliamentâs agreement is also required if we are to have Financial Perspectives.
What is the state of negotiations in the Council?
Let me explain to you how we see the situation in the Council and how we intend preparing for the debates on this matter, especially at the European Council that will be held next week.
First of all, I would like to stress that the Presidency remains determined to reach an agreement at next weekâs European Council.
Nothing should be allowed to distract us from the important task of giving the European Union the resources it needs to accomplish the tasks that lie before it in the years ahead.
The conclusion of an agreement in June is the best way of sending a positive signal and the only way of determining the scale of those resources early enough so that the various instruments and legislative programmes can be adopted and implemented at the right time.
Today more than ever, the Union must show that it is still fully able to take decisions, that it is still capable of reaching compromises in a matter as crucial for its smooth operation as the Financial Perspectives and, hence, the budgetary policy for the years ahead.
You are familiar with the negotiating framework method that was successfully used during the last negotiations under the German Presidency and which enabled agreement to be reached in Berlin.
That framework allowed us to whittle down the number of possible solutions and to reach a final agreement.
The most recent version of this negotiating framework dates from the end of last week and will be examined by the foreign affairs ministers at the conclave to be held next Sunday evening.
At the same time, the European Council President is holding bilateral meetings with his opposite numbers at which they are examining each otherâs difficulties and trying to lay the foundations for a compromise that will be acceptable to all.
I would like to draw your attention to a number of aspects of this latest version of the negotiating framework.
I will also comment on a number of points made in your report and in the motion for a resolution on the Financial Perspectives.
First of all, even before the debates in Aprilâs General Affairs Council we clearly said that a number of cuts, which some find unfortunate and others inevitable, would be necessary in all fields if we were to strike a balance between highly divergent points of view as to the final overall level of expenditure.
That is incidentally not entirely at odds with the thinking in your Committee.
The latest version of the negotiating framework includes for the first time figures for each heading.
Overall, the total of EUR 870 billion at which we have arrived, that is around 1.06% of the European Unionâs gross national income, is close to the figures that have been discussed.
Although this total is less than the Commissionâs initial proposal, the figures for each heading nevertheless represent on average increases of between 5% and 18% annually compared to 2006.
No one can therefore doubt our determination to continue providing the resources necessary to move forward with the Unionâs policies.
It is also true that the very weak growth in national budgets, which must not be overlooked, inevitably has consequences for the European budget.
Secondly, the debates in Council have been concerned chiefly with heading 1 B, that is cohesion policy.
Contrary to what some people are saying, this heading has not been particularly targeted by the cuts.
We have not made this heading the adjustment variable of a minimalist budget package.
In fact, the Presidency agrees with Parliament that cohesion policy is the expression of the Unionâs internal solidarity.
The Presidency is therefore doing all it can to keep cuts in this field to a minimum.
Overall, the expenditure for this heading in the latest version of the negotiating framework represents 0.37% of the European Unionâs gross national income.
The Presidency has, however, proposed a number of changes to the mechanisms for allocating cohesion policy funds.
It has done so following discussions that generally revealed âÂ and not without difficulty, I have to sayÂ â a desire to give priority to funding the least prosperous regions and Member States.
The Presidency has therefore adopted an approach based on the principle of solidarity, ensuring that resources are directed to those most in need.
To do that, a slightly higher percentage of the âcohesionâ headingâs funds had to be allocated to convergence and the ceilings adjusted so that funds go where they are needed most.
I know that some countries and regions are not happy with this approach.
The Presidency is continuing to listen to them.
However, while adjustments are still possible âÂ and we are working on them day by dayÂ â our constraints are such that there is relatively little room for manoeuvre.
Thirdly, the Presidency is aware that the March European Council set ambitious targets for relaunching the Lisbon Strategy.
Those targets will require additional financial resources.
We are all committed to the objectives of competitiveness and employment.
We all want to develop research more in the Union.
We know, too, that the Union has to accompany the social and economic reforms we are obliged to undertake.
Employment remains a major priority for us all, as do education and vocational training.
It is true that the Presidency has cut the amounts proposed by the Commission, but the rate of growth by comparison with the present period remains considerable: 8% growth per year in real terms.
Hardly any national budget â and I do not know of one â makes such an additional effort.
The same is true of Heading 3 A, freedom, security and justice.
This objective is also a priority because it comes in response to the publicâs concerns in the matter.
In our latest proposal, it receives an annual real-terms increase of 18% compared to 2006, a rise of nearly 200% over seven years.
The rates of growth for external relations, especially for achieving the Unionâs global partnership objective, are still 5% in real terms and we have not included the EDF budget like you have.
Fourthly, the latest version of the negotiating framework goes into the question of resources in slightly more detail.
There is no doubt that the European Councilâs success will depend on agreement being reached on both expenditure and resources.
In its quest for a solution, the Presidency has taken as its starting point the Fontainebleau conclusions of 1984 âÂ I will not say Fontainebluff like Mr Juncker did.
So far as resources are concerned, negotiations will only succeed if a satisfactory solution is found to the United Kingdom rebate.
In this connection, the Presidency is proposing that in 2007 the amount of that countryâs rebate should be equal to its nominal average over the seven-year period immediately preceding the last enlargement and that it should then decline with effect from the following year.
I believe this is a fair proposal because we are all committed to the effort of solidarity that our Unionâs enlargement represents.
Also in line with the Fontainebleau conclusions, which raise the question of budgetary imbalances for other countries, the Presidency has further proposed that specific measures be introduced for three countries, namely Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, for the period 2007-2013.
These measures would consist of a reduction in the VAT call-up rate, which the Presidency has more generally proposed freezing at 0.3%.
It is clear that before a solution is reached on resources a number of other details still need to be examined, details which are not always minor and are often sensitive.
Nevertheless, the Presidency is convinced that this approach is the most realistic basis for an ultimate agreement, provided everyone has the will to succeed and shows sufficient political will.
These are the main elements of the latest proposal, which has been distributed to the Member States and will be examined in Luxembourg on Sunday.
It is the basis for an agreement in the Council.
It will then be up to the Council and Parliament to translate it into Financial Perspectives in an interinstitutional agreement.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin my remarks by congratulating the Temporary Committee, its chairman and its rapporteur on their outstanding work.
The accuracy and quality of analysis, coupled with the high quality of debate in the Temporary Committee are indicative of Parliamentâs desire to make a positive contribution to this extremely important debate on the Financial Perspective.
I feel that Parliamentâs commitment is crucial, because Europeâs political project is at stake.
The task now is to translate our political will into financial commitment and I am delighted to see Parliamentâs determination and resolve in assessing the resources the Union needs to accomplish its project.
I am similarly pleased to note that the resolution before Parliament has demonstrated that there is a great deal of convergence between the views of the Commission and Parliament.
The fact that the Commission and Parliament find themselves on the same wavelength does not come as any surprise to me.
We have opted to use the same method â that of defining our political project and our priority actions, then deciding on the resources and the appropriate budgetary instrument for these decisions to be put into practice.
I still believe that this is the most appropriate means of convincing European taxpayers that their money is being used properly.
Ladies and gentlemen, I share Parliamentâs conviction that we must all work in the spirit of the interinstitutional agreement that embodies the Financial Perspectives.
As the Presidency representative, whom I greet, has just pointed out, the agreement on the Financial Perspectives is not an agreement between the Member States in the European Council.
It is an agreement between our three institutions, which share responsibility for it and each of which has a crucial part in drawing it up.
This interinstitutional agreement is the expression of a partnership between the Council, Parliament and the Commission.
I believe the adoption of Parliamentâs position today and the institutional trilogue next Wednesday are key steps along the way to reaching an agreement.
And I believe it is very important that an agreement is reached soon.
Even if there are a number of differences, our respective thinking has brought our two institutions to conclusions that are in reality very close.
I recognise that the resolution Parliament is examining today is full and balanced.
I very much enjoyed discussing these issues with the Temporary Committee and I also appreciated the frequent contacts I had, even informally, with the President of Parliament.
I am pleased to find that these conclusions have met with a very broad consensus within the political and parliamentary groups.
I do not intend responding in detail.
I would simply like to underline one major political point at this stage.
Obviously, we share a common vision of the Union and of its financial resources as a means of action.
It will be crucial for us, the institutions, to maintain our alliance on the project until negotiations are concluded.
Given the divergent positions of the Member States, the negotiations which have begun will be very difficult, even if we have every confidence in the Luxembourg Presidencyâs ability.
However, despite the major obstacles I still believe it is both necessary and possible to conclude an agreement in the next few weeks.
It is necessary because the absence of an agreement would delay the implementation of policies and deprive the citizens of the policies they are waiting for.
Of course, the political atmosphere today is not necessarily favourable.
Uncertainty often undermines the willingness to compromise.
An agreement would, however, demonstrate to our fellow citizens that despite the serious difficulties we are experiencing today, Europe is capable of acting, that it has a project for the future and that it is capable of putting it into effect.
In other words, we must avoid prolonging a debate that reveals things that could divide us and concentrate on the things that bring us together.
We must also respond with action to those who think Europe could grind to a halt and fall into paralysis.
It may seem paradoxical, but I believe the difficulties we are experiencing are also an opportunity to restate our ambition for Europe collectively.
That is why I am saying that it is even more necessary now that we find a compromise in the next few weeks.
I am therefore convinced that this agreement is within our reach and that we must seize this opportunity to put Europe back on the rails.
Mr President, while Parliament is agreeing its position the negotiations in Council continue.
Today we have a meeting of Ecofin. On Sunday we have another ministerial conclave, in which I will be taking part.
I would like to say a few words on the latest proposals from the Luxembourg presidency.
I would like to begin by thanking the presidency for its energy and for the determination it has shown and brought to this matter.
It is fair to say that many dismissed any chance that this negotiation could make much progress, but the presidency has proved them wrong.
In this respect, I would like to stress the very good cooperation between the Commission and the presidency in the handling of this matter since January.
For me the crucial test must remain the ability of the proposals to deliver the political goals we have set.
We cannot fall into the trap of once again letting the gap widen between our political promises and the reality that follows.
In some areas the presidency has found a way forward.
On cohesion policy, for example, substantial savings are proposed, but the overall balance remains â a balance between the compelling imperative to commit new resources in the wake of enlargement and the need to respect the fact that the mission of the cohesion policy is to work across the whole Union.
On own resources, the presidency has shown its well-known pragmatism.
The proposal made includes the freezing and phased reduction of the UK rebate, and some compensation for Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, to take account of their excessive budgetary burdens.
For the sake of transparency and fairness, let me tell you that this is certainly not the ideal solution.
As you know, the Commission had proposed a different solution.
However, the conditions needed to make it viable have not been met and the solution envisaged by the presidency has the merit of preventing this issue from spiralling into real crisis in the coming years.
That is where we are.
I do not believe that we can afford to hold the Unionâs policies to ransom while we chase the illusion of a better arrangement.
We must accept that the presidency has found a balanced solution.
In other areas, however, I must say that, compared with the Commissionâs proposals, those put forward by the presidency are disappointing, and sometimes truly problematic.
If you look at the newer areas of policy â supporting competitiveness for growth and employment, making freedom security and justice more concrete, giving a new impetus to our external policies â these proposals will require the Union to make very real sacrifices.
This is not about numbers on the page. It is about concrete actions which the Union has agreed to take forward and which it will be enabled to realise.
To take the area of competitiveness for growth first, Heading 1A, we all know that this is mainly about investing in knowledge.
This effort will be diluted if not backed up by investment.
Of course, in the context of the overall picture, the increase proposed by the presidency â some 37% on average compared to 2006 â is not insignificant.
It would still allow investment in our future. But let us be honest with ourselves: it would not allow us to meet all of the goals that we have set.
Turning to other new policy areas, again the increase for freedom, security and justice looks generous on paper, with a proposal to double the 2006 levels.
However, judged against the policy needs set out in the aid action plan approved by the European Council, the shortfall suddenly looks to be a real problem.
Hard choices would have to be made if this proposal were accepted.
As for our external policies, there is a strong consensus that Europe needs to be a more effective and vigorous actor on the world stage.
But under these proposals we would have to scale down our ambitions drastically.
Do we cut back on pre-accession, on stabilisation in the Balkans, on neighbourhood policy, on humanitarian aid?
At a time when ministers are making a fresh commitment to increase official development aid by EUR 20 billion a year by 2010, frankly I find that troubling.
So, in those areas we run the risk of failing to fully deliver on our promises and previous commitments.
I take comfort in the position of Parliament as laid down in the draft resolution today.
I do not believe that it is impossible to maintain the balance proposed by the Commission, to respect the legacy of the foundation policies while giving a new reality to new policies.
I look forward to working closely with Parliament in the coming days and weeks with this goal in mind.
I know that you will agree with me that, if we succeed in reaching an agreement in the European Council next week and in concluding an interinstitutional agreement, we must face up to the consequences.
It may prove impossible to reach an agreement without trimming our ambitions.
Let me be clear, once again. We want a consensus for the next European Council.
We need it.
But at the same time we have to say no to a cut-price agreement that will mean a cut-down Europe and a cut-down project for the Europe of ambition and solidarity that we want.
We all need to keep that in mind at a time when we are so keen to try to find a new impetus for Europe.
As we approach the final stages of the financial perspective negotiations, as we prepare for an agreement that would show how committed we are to making Europe work, strong and positive collaboration between the European Parliament and the Commission is needed now more than ever.
Together we can make a difference for the benefit of the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Barroso.
It is good news that you are happy with the proposal of the temporary committee.
Thank you for your positive assessment.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, allow me to begin with some words of thanks to the Temporary Committee on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union and its rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, as well as to Catherine Guy-Quint in particular.
Why these thanks?
The first reason is a selfish one, because the proposals on Heading 4, which I am defending as the draftsman for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, recommend an increase of EUR four billion.
In fact, I scarcely dare to say that, because the said amount is actually in line with our vision of a strong foreign policy for the European Union.
My second reason to be grateful is the reportâs proposal that the initiative on democracy and human rights be invested with a clear specific programme to which non-governmental organisations would be able to subscribe independently of the governments of their home countries, and which would be under the exclusive control of Parliament.
My third, and by no means least, vote of thanks is for bringing the overall budget proposal to 1.18% for commitments and 1.7% for payments, which is close to the Prodi Commissionâs proposal.
We shall achieve neither a unified nor an enlarged Europe without allocating a certain volume of resources.
The recent elections and referenda are proof of this.
I am rarely in agreement with MrÂ Barroso, but I am on this occasion when I simply say to the Council that we have achieved an extraordinary feat of parliamentary democracy in overcoming our national differences, and I urge the Council to bear that in mind.
Â Â  . Mr President, a much-heard argument against the Constitution in the Netherlands was our excessive contribution to the European budget; why, indeed, should we be the largest net contributor, while four other Member States are richer than we are?
With this resolution, we are indicating that a solution must be found â and soon â to our unfair and unequal position.
We want a proportionate contribution for every country, not just for the Netherlands.
The Dutch ânoâ to the Constitution illustrates that things should be different in Europe: not less, but different.
This goes hand in hand with the budgetary restraint proposed by Mr BÃ¶ge, which we very much appreciate for that reason.
This also means that we consider the alternative proposed by the Group of the Greens as too expensive and too supra-European, but nor do I regard the 1% proposed by the six as a justifiable starting point.
It is not crucial whether the percentage is 1% or 1.07%; what matters is what the money is spent on and what the benefit is of regulating this at European level.
We do not want a more expensive Europe with more of the same, we want a different Europe, a shared and social Europe.
Currently, too many European funds are still being channelled to the relatively rich regions, agricultural subsidies account for nearly 45% of the budget, and â as I am sure you are familiar with our position in this respect â we waste EUR 200 million a day on meetings in Strasbourg.
We must free up more funds for a safer and more social Europe, more cofinancing of agricultural policy by the old Member States and the abolition of agricultural export subsides with immediate effect.
All of this can generate more funds for a safer and more social Europe.
There are currently insufficient funds available for many regions, educational exchanges, including for senior secondary vocational training, knowledge and employment, promotion funds for national plans to create new jobs in regions threatened with delocalisation, vital rural and nature management, border control, security in Europe and the fight against global poverty, which brings me to development cooperation.
The Commission has suggested lumping development aid, external policy and economic cooperation together, an idea to which Parliament is unanimously opposed; the report demands these to be split up.
We also demand that the Millennium objectives be given a central place explicitly at the heart of development policy.
Today, one in five people have no access to basic education and health care.
We want this to become a central concern in the policy.
The minimum amounts in the proposals are minimum amounts, 35% of which must be spent on basic education and basic health care.
If we made those choices, Europe would help make the world a safer place, and Europe could make the difference in terms of this social dimension, both in the EU and elsewhere.
That is what this House as a whole wants.
Â Â  . Mr President, like my honourable colleague MrÂ van den Berg, I shall begin by speaking on behalf of the Committee on International Trade then go on to speak as the first contributor from our group.
Let me say, on behalf of the committee, that we cannot but thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work and for the manner in which the deliberations were conducted within the Temporary Committee.
Our Committee on International Trade formulated a number of recommendations, which are, I would say, fiscally prudent and therefore all the more acceptable to our Committee.
I believe that one of the features of our resolution was its emphasis on the importance, in the framework of the WTO negotiations, of ensuring that the Union, through its budget, can render assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries in particular with a view to laying good foundations for these negotiations.
I do not suppose that this is one of the main points of the present discussion, but we nevertheless wish to underline it.
Now, as one of the speakers from my group â MrsÂ Buitenweg, our coordinator, will speak on behalf of the group later â I should like to say two things.
Firstly, the reason why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled an alternative resolution is that we felt that, in this game for three players or institutional triangle, the message conveyed by Parliament ought to reinforce that of the Commission and support the Commissionâs proposals and that, on some budget items, we should even signal a desire to go beyond the Commissionâs proposals while remaining within the limits authorised by the Treaties.
That is why â and we shall return to this point â we sought to accentuate a number of priorities, especially in the field of rural development and also in the domains of education and culture.
Secondly, I should also like to address a few words to the Council Presidency.
It is obviously inappropriate to bombard the Presidency, because we know the Presidency, and we know it is doing its level best, as they say.
The real targets for criticism are those countries â the members of the one-per-cent club â which want to have their cake and eat it, to put it colloquially.
From this point of view, we need an agreement, but an agreement at all costs is no solution. In spite of everything, the Commissionâs proposal and that of the Council still differ by EUR 150 billion over the seven-year period.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will have its first opportunity tomorrow to react to the uncertainty brought about by the outcome of the French and Dutch referenda.
MrÂ BÃ¶geâs report is a good report; it is balanced and in keeping with theÂ Prodi Commissionâs proposal.
It maintains an appropriate level of resources for the Union, ensures that regions lagging behind in development will continue to enjoy the support of the Union, aims to penalise no one on the grounds of enlargement, and relies on cohesion but also on competitiveness, by prioritising research and technological innovation.
Those are the arguments presented by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which MrÂ BÃ¶ge has taken into consideration in his report, and for which I thank him.
Aside from the improvements that can be made, however, it is important to consider the tangible and symbolic value of Parliamentâs approval of this text.
The positive signals are two-fold: reaching an agreement within the time limits set and, in particular, rejecting the drastic cut in resources demonstrate the will to not give in to the temptation of renationalisation.
This vote must resonate as a call to next weekâs European Council, in order that it reaches an agreement that is as close as possible to our position.
We do not believe that the Councilâs latest proposal is, however, heading in the right direction.
That is why, as PresidentÂ Barroso states â and I value his statement â a revival is needed, and that, MrÂ President, is the first crucial decision for such a revival of the Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to say that the proposal on which we shall vote tomorrow proposes the internal redeployment of EURÂ 200Â million from the trans-European energy networks to the Social Agenda, which is an essential factor in social inclusion, growth and competitiveness.
It should also be pointed out that the request to enhance the financial framework of the âProgressâ programme so as to pave the way for the effective implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Agenda represents a success for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
We now hope â and I repeat this request â that this desire to increase the appropriations does not fall on deaf ears in negotiations with the Council.
I should also like to mention, however, with some degree of concern, that social dialogue and the free movement of workers, specifically EURES, are not mentioned in this report.
I believe it is essential that the financial margin in line 1A should be able to bridge that gap.
Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this issue, however, and in light of Europeâs crucial role in questions of social justice and cohesion, I should like to express my concern at the way in which the Luxembourg Presidency has addressed questions relating to the statistical effect and should therefore like to âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, our environment and our natural resources are scarce assets, and we want to pass them on to our children, if at all possible enlarging them in the process.
Our budgetary resources are also a scarce asset, and so we must make strenuous efforts to achieve our environmental goals as effectively and efficiently is possible.
This is the spirit in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety drafted its opinion, and the rapporteur, in his usual courteous and cooperative manner, has incorporated our thoughts.
For that I am grateful to him.
These thoughts include not only the observation that European environmental policy has proved to be an effective means of preserving or even improving the environment, public health and peopleâs quality of life. That is the conservationist side of our approach.
Our thoughts also comprise the realisation and recognition that our environmental policy is also making a significant contribution to the achievement of the Lisbon goals, to job creation.
That is the innovative side of our approach, and its importance should not be underestimated. For this reason, I very much hope that all Members of this House will join us in our present and future pursuit of this strategic path.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all, may I beg leave to ask you to extend a return invitation to the Council and the Commission, to MrÂ Schmit and MrÂ Barroso, to conduct a trialogue with us here in this House.
The directly elected representatives of the European people should certainly play a leading role in such negotiations, which should be conducted with the public good in mind.
Secondly, let me stress that the Commission and the Council have set themselves the objective of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, the goals of which are growth and employment.
Growth means an increase in net incomes for everyone, whether students, employees or pensioners.
Growth means an increase in take-home pay at the end of the month.
How can we achieve that?
By creating more jobs, because more employment means, in turn, that more revenue will be available for redistribution.
This is what makes the Barroso Commission so very socially responsible, and Parliament is one hundred per cent behind its social aims.
I am therefore curious to discover whether the Council will be prepared, and will be bold enough, to increase the allocation of resources to the Lisbon Strategy, whether we shall see not only a doubling of the research budget but also signs of serious intent to implement it, efforts at making additional resources available as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, and efforts in the fields of telecommunications, infrastructure and other areas to ensure that higher net incomes are credited to peopleâs accounts at the end of the month.
We should also ensure that savings are made.
I thank the Council for setting a new standard in the European Union through the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
We should also aim to ensure that the average civil servantâs pay is based on the basic remuneration of MEPs.
There should also be consistency here between the Council and Parliament and, last but not least, between them and the Members of Parliament.
There should not be excessively wide disparities.
Yes, savings have to be made, but on the basis of clear objectives.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr BÃ¶ge has made imaginative use of the temporary committee formula and, for the second time, I congratulate him.
I have time to make one simple point.
We share the rapporteurâs dilemma that we cannot provide the resources that will improve the conditions and the lifestyle of our citizen body.
That will mean that in some areas for which my committee is responsible, we have a diminution of consumer protection and other issues, where we are effectively giving less and asking more.
Mr Barroso talked about a cut-price Europe and the implications of that destination if we get to it.
I hope that this is not going to be death by a thousand cuts.
I believe that we have to keep faith with our citizens and not add to the alienation which many of them feel and which they have expressed in recent weeks.
Â Â  . Both the current parliament and its predecessors have done a great deal to support the development of trans-European transport networks.
A smoothly functioning European infrastructure is one of the vital pillars of the Lisbon strategy and an important prerequisite for European economic, geographic and social cohesion.
Last year, 30 projects were selected â including the Marco Polo and Galileo programmes â that are to be given high priority and corresponding financial support by the Community.
These 30 priority investment programmes create a network encompassing and linking the fifteen old and ten new Member States; they put an end to bottlenecks, replace missing sections of infrastructure and pay special attention to trans-border sections, in other words, they make the system of European transport networks virtually complete.
In our experience, projects failed to get under way, or got under way only very slowly in past decades, due among other things to the reluctance of the Community to assist with funding.
Does the new Financial Perspective change this?
Indeed it does.
The proposed allocations in the framework of the new Financial Perspective enable average Community funding of 15% and, in addition, other innovative forms of financing have been formulated.
This will enable a new type of financing system to evolve, that is more effective than earlier systems and requires smaller contributions from Member States, for the first time in the history of TENs funding.
In fact, Community funding will act as a catalyst.
It is the unanimous view of the temporary committee that the funds allocated should be regarded as the minimum required.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Committee on Regional Development has, by a large majority, endorsed the Commissionâs financial estimates.
In my opinion, the European regional and cohesion policy is the European Unionâs most successful policy by far and the one with the most immediate public visibility.
In view of the manifest public detachment from European politics at this present time, we should focus on the continued pursuit of this successful policy through the seven-year multiannual programmes and support it with appropriate funding.
I warmly welcome the proposal made by the rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, that 0.41% of gross national income be guaranteed for the cohesion policy, and also that the 4% cap should remain in force.
We also support measures to deal with the special problem of regions subject to the statistical effect and border regions.
The entire House, of course, is well aware that we are operating with tax revenue.
This is why the Committee on Regional Development firmly supports the strict application of the N+2 rule and advocates its extension to the Cohesion Fund.
European tax revenue must be spent efficiently and not poured down black holes somewhere or other.
I might add that the Council should take note of the benefits that application of the N+2 rule brings.
At the same time, though, I should like to say to all those Members who are calling for more money, that the financial pressure on some Member States is extremely heavy.
This is another area where we need to set reasonable limits.
This is why the great majority of our committee supports the rapporteurâs view that in some areas the allocation of resources should be cut back or new scope be created for negotiation.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr BÃ¶ge on his balanced report.
Despite quite a few obstacles right across the agricultural sector, it is a very even-handed document.
It is European agriculture that makes the multi-annual budget possible, because it is the only sector that is dramatically tightening its belt.
We will be cutting our budget from 36% to 26%.
That appears to me to be a huge step forward for all other sectors in order for them to adopt European policy.
Two obstacles remain.
We have an agreement from Brussels that prescribes the permitted level of growth in that budget.
At the same time, I notice that no funds have been set aside for Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accession.
Now that European agriculture is cutting back so drastically, I cannot imagine how under the Brussels agreement, Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession can also be funded with those 26%.
In an extreme situation, it could mean that, since that agreement and the relevant cuts have to be borne by the 15 old Member States, a situation could arise in 2012 where farmers in the 15 old Member States receive 15% less premiums than the farmers in the new Member States.
Surely that cannot be the case.
By using partial cofinancing as a solution to this problem, Mr BÃ¶ge provides the option of fighting fire with fire, although this has been greeted by huge protests in Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture, for, first of all, the very tricky question remains of whether it is legally enforceable.
Secondly, we greatly value the common market and want to preserve it.
Whatever happens, cofinancing in compulsory expenditure must not lead to the renationalisation of agricultural policy.
I have one observation left to make with regard to the Council.
There is a great deal of talk about net payments.
Could I advise the Council to deduct the Member Statesâ own resources from their net payments?
That would amount to half of the net payments in my country, and that might well prove the answer to the problem.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, warm thanks to our rapporteur Mr BÃ¶ge, who has had the courage to set out unambiguous priorities in his draft report, one â and an explicit one â being in the sphere of education and training, which are key factors in growth, social integration and competitiveness.
Nor has he limited himself to sounding off on the subject, for he has added almost a billion euros to this draft Budget for the great educational programmes Erasmus and Leonardo and for youth exchanges.
Although Mr BÃ¶ge also put the case for an increase for culture, the amount of this falls lamentably short of the amount that is desirable as a matter of urgency.
Regrettable though this is in view of the frequent invocation of the soul of Europe, I would like, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, to ask the House to back these proposals tomorrow with a large majority.
Now that the Council has, in the referenda, been sent a clear signal from the public, I call upon it to get its priorities right by accepting what Parliament has proposed through its rapporteur and, in the European Budget, taking public participation particularly seriously, as well as education and culture.
Before the referenda, 72% of the public described themselves as inadequately or not at all informed.
It is for that reason that the Council must learn its lesson where the financial situation is concerned.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, MrÂ BÃ¶ge, and those who collaborated with him for the volume and high quality of their work and for the political vision that inspired their report.
As the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have no complaints.
Indeed, I am delighted to say that I fully endorse the line proposed by the BÃ¶ge report on the important domain of freedom, security and justice, which, in both budgetary and structural terms, is recognised and enshrined as one of the EUâs fundamental priorities.
I note with satisfaction that the BÃ¶ge report proposes â as I had requested, incidentally â that this area of activity be âringfencedâ, as it were, within Heading 3 by the creation of a separate subheading that would guarantee the funding required for its development.
I am also pleased to see that the report proposes an appreciable increase in the relevant budgetary appropriations, which will serve to intensify the fight against organised crime and against terrorism, to improve the system of controls at the EUâs external borders and to ensure that the common immigration and asylum policies are pursued effectively.
LastlyÂ âÂ and this is a purely personal point, MrÂ President, which I make as a Member elected in Wallonia â I wish to say very clearly, in words addressed to the Prime Minister of the Walloon region, Jean-Claude Van Cauwenberghe, that I wholeheartedly support the call made in paragraph 58 of the report for protection of the legitimate interests of the regions that have been subject to the statistical effect of enlargement.
This should save MrÂ Van Cauwenberghe the effort of issuing another blatantly untruthful statement.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which is responsible for the Constitution, has highlighted something that is by now no doubt obvious to everyone, namely that the European Unionâs direct communications with, and provision of information to, its citizens is a disaster â not only a disaster but also a communications black hole now threatening to swallow up the European Constitution.
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has pointed out that the development in Europe of an area of language and cross-border public participation in political life is necessary and indispensable to European democracy.
We have noted with regret the fact that one of the Commissionâs first actions was to cut back the funds for information about the Constitution, something that would make one weep if it were not so farcical.
The Temporary Committee and its rapporteur have taken on board the Committeeâs concern, albeit without allocating funds to deal with it.
There is no point in presenting the public with priorities if you do not set aside money for them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the Committee on Womenâs Rights regrets that the allocations proposed in the âProdi packageâ for social issues, equality and employment does not reflect any real increase over the previous financial framework, in spite of the fact that inequalities in the enlarged Europe have increased, that over 20Â million people are unemployed and that poverty and social exclusion now affects 70Â million people.
Suitable financing must therefore be made available for the âProgressâ programme, greater attention must be paid to the involvement of women in the various programmes and there must be a clear sharing of the actions relating to equality and anti-discrimination policies specifically geared towards promoting womenâs rights and involvement, by setting up programmes such as âEquality between Women and Men 2013â and new funding for the new European Gender Institute.
It should also be noted that equality between men and women must be included in all Community policies across the board and special attention should be given to âŠ
Â Â  . Mr President, we are grateful to the rapporteur for the provisional inclusion in his report of one of the most important recommendations made by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
It recommended that the highest political authority in a Member State be required, every year, to approve the budget and certify expenditure, both beforehand and afterwards.
That is important, for it is in the Member States that the key expenses are incurred.
In addition, we are all aware of the fact that the European Court of Auditors has, for the past ten years, declined to issue a positive Statement of Assurance.
The second important point that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to make is that, although we have a budget, every year we are well behind in terms of expenses.
These are known as Commitments Outstanding and we consider it therefore vital that the N + 2 rule should remain in place.
It is unacceptable for Member States to make advance payments and subsequently for the Commission to be at a loss as to how it can spend them.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, but I also wish to say, if I may, that I am very concerned that we have had access to a negotiating fund â offered to us, indeed, by the Luxembourg Presidency â which reduced Parliamentâs proposal by around EURÂ 100Â 000Â million.
This is a drastic reduction that might scupper completely the very basis of defending natural sea resources.
We must not lose sight of the fact that in this area of the sea we now have to finance external fisheries agreements and to comply with the OSPAR Convention, to which the EU is a signatory, which designates new areas of protection in the ocean.
There are new proposals to set up satellite mechanisms to monitor fisheries, and these are extremely costly; there are proposals to convert large sections of the fisheries sector; and there is also the enlargement.
With all of this to contend with, this proposal strikes the Committee on Fisheries as a meagre one that falls well short of meeting what we see as genuine needs.
We also note that there is a great danger that the Council will decide to cut this proposal altogether.
This is something that worries us greatly and I should like to implore the Council to take our genuine needs on board.
I should also like to urge you, Mr Barroso, to maintain the position that you have held thus far of doggedly defending your Commission proposal, because this is what will defend Europe, defend our interests and defend the sea ...
Â Â  . Mr President, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats shares the aims adopted by our Temporary Committee on the basis of the proposals submitted by its rapporteur, Reimer BÃ¶ge, to whom I wish to pay tribute on behalf of our group.
Thanks to him, Parliamentâs position will be ready on schedule.
The strong message that emerges from this report is that the Union cannot be enlarged and enhanced without increasing its budget.
President Barroso has reminded us of that fact.
In our view, the first key requirement is to fund the policies covered by the Lisbon agenda: the trans-European networks, research, university exchanges and the knowledge-based economy.
Another key requirement is solidarity: the scrupulous practice of solidarity with our new partners and solidarity throughout Europe with all those who are victims of industrial restructuring or of difficulties arising from geographical factors.
As far as the funding of the common agricultural policy is concerned, the commitments made to farmers for the period up to 2013 must be honoured.
If it emerged, however, that needs outweighed these resources, they would have to be topped up by the Member States.
With or without the Constitutional Treaty, the Council and Parliament have forcibly expressed their common desire to see the economic union transform itself gradually into a genuine political union.
Our priorities in this context are the war on terrorism and serious crime and the new neighbourhood policy.
MrÂ President, we are well aware that the overall needs identified by our Temporary Committee fall short of the ambitions of our Parliament.
Sadly, it is not possible to go any further today without radically reforming the own-resources system.
It is the wish of our Committee on Budgets to work on this objective in close liaison with the national parliaments.
We firmly believe that it will be possible to find together the consensus solutions without which the Union will remain permanently unable to finance its political ambitions.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, first of all, may I, in turn, thank ReimerÂ BÃ¶ge and the whole team who, under your chairmanship, have worked hard to ensure that Parliament has a position worthy of its status as a branch of the budgetary authority.
In this capacity, we sought to formulate proposals designed to bring about economic recovery and intensify European solidarity while preserving the essential building blocks that are already part of the European edifice.
Conscious of the difficulties experienced by some Member States, we had to produce a transitional Financial Perspective.
