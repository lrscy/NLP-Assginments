Nowadays, transparency means publication on the Internet.
We are talking about the creation of a general Internet platform with links and references by the Commission.
It is up to Member States to make the information comprehensible by means of the relevant explanations.
Member States are permitted to publish the information at regional level, too, if they consider this appropriate.
Different databases must be linked.
In the Council, the issue of who publishes the information was very controversial.
The financial management is mixed, so the Member States have clear responsibility - including under Article 53b of the budgetary decision.
In addition, publication by the Commission would give rise to problems of legal protection, as persons affected by incorrect publication would have to go straight to the European Court of First Instance.
This is neither citizen friendly nor particularly transparent.
The Commission proposal is simpler, more transparent, less cumbersome to administer and more citizen friendly, and therefore has my support.
It is in line with the provisions in all the other fields (the Structural Funds and the rules applying hitherto to the second pillar).
As the publication of the information is to be seen in the context of budgetary control, my report proposes a (moderate) flat-rate fine for cases of failure to publish information.
On the subject of penal reductions in funding, I would say that I am broadly in favour, but there are some points where I should like to see greater regard for the principle of proportionality.
In the Committee on Budgetary Control, my fellow Member Mr Mulder made proposals concerning the budgetary dimension of the dossier, which I can wholeheartedly endorse.
In the Opinion of the Committee on Budgets, the committee expressed its views on the transparency aspects, and these largely correspond with my proposals.
Ladies and gentlemen, and particularly members of the Council, this report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I hope for a large majority in tomorrow's vote, too.
I implore the Council and the Commission to take this vote by the representatives of the European people seriously.
There will also no doubt be a correlation between this report and the way all those involved deal with it, and the expected Health Check.
We will undoubtedly return to this subject when we deal with the Health Check.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I am much obliged to my colleague Mr Chatzimarkakis, who has presented a report that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can endorse in all respects.
It is a legitimate question, however, whether this regulation was even necessary.
It will provoke intense covetous discussion, as it is difficult to explain the context to citizens.
Therefore, I think it a good thing that farming businesses are to be given an explanation of the reasons for the payments when details of these are published.
Our farmers do indeed make a valuable contribution to our society, supplying us with food day by day, taking care of our cultural landscape and making a large contribution to the functioning of rural areas.
Transparency cannot be a one-way street, however - it has to apply to both sides.
For this reason, my group supports the report's call to make users sign on or register when using the information.
As my colleague has just mentioned, it is also important that this directive does not invalidate data protection provisions, particularly those of Member States.
In the interests of equal treatment, however, I would ask the Commission to present a regulation ensuring transparency also in non-governmental organisations, for example.
I am convinced that more EU funds are being channelled into shady projects in the case of NGOs than is happening in the agricultural sector.
This report gives us the opportunity to show the public why taxpayers' money is being spent on agriculture.
Using the report appropriately will facilitate success in demonstrating to the public the great importance of European agriculture, in which case this Transparency Directive will have served its purpose.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, concerning the first objective of this Regulation, which is to comply with the obligation to publish information on the beneficiaries of Community funds, I think it is quite right that we should finally know who receives what from the CAP.
This is a long-awaited measure, though it is not a question of stigmatising farmers but of creating transparency in finance, which concerns us all as taxpayers and consumers, and over which we have a right of information.
I even think that this publication could be utterly beneficial and improve citizens' opinion of farmers and the payments they receive for services to the community in terms of supplying quality food that meets high production standards and in terms of maintaining the land and the countryside, for example.
The publication of an explanatory statement for the payments made and the farm income, as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is requesting, will also be very useful.
I fully agree with the practical procedures for publication, defined in the report by our fellow Member, Mr Chatzimarkakis, which consist in setting up a European Internet platform linked to the Member States' Internet platforms on which the names of regional aid beneficiaries and where they live are put online.
In the case of public limited companies or private limited companies, the names of the investors and members of the management board must also be known.
I also support the evaluation reports requested of the European Commission in the years following the implementation of this regulation, which will be very useful, the assessment of the benefit of the centralised publication of information by the Commission, and the evaluation of the distribution of the funds, possibly accompanied by legislative proposals to achieve a more objective distribution of funds in the first and second pillars.
On the other hand, as regards the methods for accessing these data, I do not agree at all with the proposals for confidentiality or a barrier to entry which, in my view, would completely diminish the transparency effect of this regulation.
If transparency is being introduced, particularly regarding public funds, I feel that everyone should be able to access the information, without restrictions.
In practice, because the data are first published by each Member State then taken up at EU level, it also seems almost impossible to introduce a registration system, and in any case thirteen Member States have already made these data public without any restriction.
I therefore ask you to reject, wholly or in part, amendments 4, 20, 21 and 23, which require registration of the identity and motivations of the users of the public data.
As regards the second objective - the tool to reduce or suspend agricultural payments when certain key elements of a national system of control fail or are ineffective - I think this is a useful means of taking action for the European Commission.
But obviously it must be used in proportion to the nature, duration and seriousness of the offences.
In the same way, the reduction percentage is cut if the Member State has gone some way towards remedying the shortcomings and increased if it has not applied the recommendations previously made.
I also hope that the requirement will be retained for Member States to inform the Commission on the way they have decided or plan to reuse the cancelled funds following irregularities.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work.
This regulation will have positive outcomes, in that it will ensure greater transparency and accountability.
This is needed because that should be a requirement in itself for all European funding, but also because it will help to dispel some of the exaggerated myths that abound about the CAP.
Indeed, Court of Auditors reports tell us that in recent times the checks on agricultural expenditure have greatly improved.
This needs to be brought to the attention of the general public.
I agree with the rapporteur's suggestion that there should be a similar requirement for structural funds.
It should not only apply to the CAP.
This transparency initiative should relate to other areas.
As we await the so-called 'health check' on the CAP, it is important that we deal with this issue now, to get it out of the way, as it were.
The CAP often comes in for bad press but very often these comments focus only on negative aspects and totally ignore the hugely positive benefits which consumers have gained from the CAP.
Since the introduction of the CAP, food price inflation is way below overall inflation.
The CAP has delivered cheaper food for EU citizens, but the CAP has also delivered safe food and traceable food.
The phrase 'from farm to fork' means just that.
The CAP is improving our environment and animal welfare continues to improve.
Furthermore, the CAP has ensured food security for the EU.
Many people deride the idea of food security as if such an idea belongs to the dark ages.
The world has enough food to feed itself.
For how long?
A week maybe.
Just consider the pressure that will come about when we really begin to grow fuel as opposed to food.
Just consider the pressure that will come about when emerging economies like India and China compete with the EU for food and for fuel grown instead of food.
Then we will look to the EU and the CAP for food security.
The CAP, like any policy, has its problems, but it has delivered for EU citizens and this regulation will ensure that it continues to deliver in an open and transparent way.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I entirely support both Mr Jorgo Chatzimarkakis's report and the draft regulation itself.
This is an important step in the right direction; we are introducing greater transparency in accountability relating to European Union expenditure.
The most valuable provision of all is the one that makes it possible to publish, or rather makes it a duty to publish, information on who made use of these funds and in what context, as part of the Common Agricultural Policy.
Public opinion has been demanding this information for some time, and so has the press, so it is a very good thing that this particular principle has been introduced.
Anyone who has benefitted from public aid should not be ashamed of information to the effect that he has received such aid; and farmers in particular have no reason to be ashamed of it, because after all the aid is clearly due to them and is for the good of the whole of society.
The regulation is aimed at exerting stronger control over EU expenditure, and a very good thing too.
I would like to take this opportunity to say two sentences about a problem that cropped up when the Committee on Budgetary Control visited Poland, at the beginning of October.
The problem relates to the detection of irregularities by national control agencies.
This is a solution that would enable us to avoid the consequences of restrictions on expenditure in a situation where irregularities are detected by a national control agency.
It is about these agencies cooperating properly with the European Court of Auditors, and them being motivated to identify such irregularities without consequences for their own country.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, transparency is necessary in agriculture.
Mr DeÃ said that money is going into shady projects.
It is true that we want to expose this, too, through such transparency, but perhaps he will also agree with me that not much money is finding its way into European agriculture and Europe's rural areas; some of it is flowing into the wrong channels.
Billions of euro have been earmarked for farmers in the budgets of past years but have failed to reach farmers.
All the export subsidies in favour of farmers, the EU's whole practice of intervention involving storage - these have swallowed up billions of euro but have not helped farmers.
At best - as Mrs Harkin from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe said - it has kept prices down by means of downward stabilisation of the market, which is a kind of brake on inflation.
Naturally, it is the general aim to keep prices stable, but it cannot be in the interests of farmers to be the nation's or Europe's lackey in order to ensure this.
The rapporteur was right when he talked of the need for a frame of reference: publication alone is not enough.
I should like to give a frame of reference: even after the reform of the CAP, at a rate of EUR 300 per hectare, a rationalised business where one worker takes care of 400 hectares - that is, the highest level of rationalisation - receives approximately EUR 120 000 per worker.
80% of farmers do not even receive a tenth of this.
Therefore, we also need to explain what happens to this money.
This frame of reference must be created by politicians - it will not automatically come with publication.
When the Commission states in its proposal that these payments may have to be graduated, that modulation into the second pillar must be introduced - as here the funds produce better results in terms of workers, the environment - then this is a foretaste of what lies ahead, namely the discussion following the publication of this information.
And then we shall have to give politics free rein once more.
However, the figures must first be allowed to speak, they must be published, and we must be patient, and if they prove incorrect, the policy will have to be changed so as to put them right.
Many thanks for your report - we shall be supporting it.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Many thanks, Mr President.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work.
European taxpayers want to know how their taxes are spent.
Publishing the names of those receiving agricultural subsidies is absolutely necessary in the interests of a transparent European policy, particularly given the enormous proportion of the EU budget represented by these subsidies.
More importantly still, however, this publication can be the start of a very necessary, genuinely thorough reform of the common agricultural policy.
When subsidies were made public in the Netherlands in 2005, we realised that a disproportionate share was going to a small, wealthy group.
We are providing large subsidies to multinationals and large landowners whilst thousands of ordinary farmers can scarcely get by.
To begin with, there must be a cap on the subsidies that one person or business can receive - and not EUR 300 000, as Commissioner Fischer Boel recently proposed.
I would suggest no more than an average annual salary.
After all, most subsidies are intended to supplement income.
Member States failing to ensure the correct transparency should receive less EU funds as a penalty.
It is also important that, where Member States have poorly functioning control mechanisms, this be made known so that farmers and the organisations representing their interests are able to call those authorities to account if they suffer damage as a result.
Of course, this should be only the beginning of a whole series of transparency initiatives by Parliament.
The distribution of the Structural Funds should also be made public.
I hope for the broadest possible support from Parliament for this report, as it would make our primary supervisory function, in particular, so much easier.
A transparent agricultural policy is the first step towards a fair agricultural policy.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr President.
I, like my voters, think that the EU is too closed and bureaucratic.
I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal, which seeks greater openness and transparency in the institutions' expenditure.
Support for agriculture is a debatable issue.
It is therefore important for the citizens to be allowed to see who their taxes are going to and how much.
It is regrettable that the committee's amendments run counter the EU's role as a transparent institution.
The committee's demand for registration in order to have access to information is a serious infringement of privacy for all citizens, whether they are a farmer, a journalist or a pre-school teacher.
Permitting registration of citizens who wish to consult public documents is a development we do not want to see in the EU.
I therefore urge all members to vote against Amendments 4 and 23 from the committee.
Thank you.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Chatzimarkakis, we are short of cereals, we are short of milk, the price of maize and butter are soaring, and what are we doing?
We are discussing putting premiums per cow, per ewe or per hectare on the Internet and, while the world is about to go hungry, like teenagers we are playing at organising farming and financial emails on the Internet.
Of course, there are good reasons: transparency, the right to find out and control what is being done with the billions being paid to farmers.
However, in a democracy, control is exercised by Parliament in the Chamber, and not by surfers on the Web.
Also, if transparency applies to agricultural credits, why not also, in a spirit of populism, have transparency over the pay of the EU's senior officials?
If we are putting premiums for dairy cows online, why not also put the premiums being milked by senior officials online too?
That is the first injustice.
There is a second.
Small farmers will be transparent, but large commercial agricultural companies will not be.
That is because the real objective of this regulation is not transparency.
It is a diabolical machine of war, which has two hidden aims.
The first is to divide farmers into large and small and destroy their unity in the trade unions.
The next, and most important, is to stir up public opinion against farmers through the press, particularly the British press which will highlight the premiums received by Prince Charles and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, by the trade union leaders, the large farmers, and perhaps even the husband of Mrs Fischer Boel, who is a pig farmer.
Using these few examples of large landowners fed on hormones from Brussels, public opinion will be made to believe that farmers get a huge boost, particularly because the public does not know that farmers are paid against their will because they are banned from producing.
They are forced to leave land fallow.
Once public opinion against farmers - paid not to produce because of decoupling - has become white hot, in 2013, at no political or electoral risk, it will be possible to remove the aid and recover about EUR 20 billion to finance other non-agricultural activities.
In the guise of democratic transparency, this regulation is a moral ignominy that is using the odious motivations of envy and jealousy to serve the Commission's strategic plot since the 1980s: to do away with agricultural exports as part of a major worldwide agreement.
Agriculture for the southern hemisphere, and financial, banking and energy services for the northern hemisphere.
That is the truth about this regulation!
Mr President, it can be a fine line between transparency and infringement of privacy.
Many farmers - in my view, quite rightly - will resent the details of their single farm payment being posted over the internet because of the distorted perception of free hand-outs which it creates.
The reality, of course, is that for most the single farm payment is in fact subsidising our cheap food policy.
Take the beef sector.
A task-force report in my constituency demonstrates that in that small area beef producers are losing EUR 260 million per annum.
Only their single farm payment keeps them going by subsidising production.
So, when it is publicised that a farmer has received EUR 20 000, it misleads for there is no mention that at the same time he is losing EUR 40 000 or more in his production operation.
To be fair, publication should be accompanied by typical profit-and-loss statistics from the commodity sales in each sector.
(EL) Mr President, I was pleased to note that we all want both transparency and control: we all want the EU's money contributed by taxpaying citizens to be protected and to go to those who are genuinely entitled to assistance.
Where there are irregularities or illegalities the specified sanctions must be imposed and I think that on this point we are all united and determined.
It goes without saying, however, that the proposed measures ought to be put into force after the relevant regulation has been passed and ought to relate to the following financial year.
We believe that this clarification is absolutely necessary, and that is why we have tabled the relevant amendment.
We want this amendment to make it clear that the measures for suspending monthly payments laid down in Articles 17a and 27a of Regulation No 1290/2005, concerning the funding of the common agricultural policy, will not be implemented before 16 October 2008.
Thus we believe it right that the measures should not have retroactive force.
To conclude, let me emphasise that we all want:
firstly, protection of taxpayers' money;
secondly, the money to go to those who are genuinely entitled, as my fellow Member very rightly pointed out;
thirdly, lawbreakers to be punished;
fourthly, let us be fair, as happens throughout the world; the laws do not have retroactive force, nor should they.
If these conditions are met, we will wholeheartedly and gladly endorse and vote for the report by Mr Chatzimarkakis.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the institutions of the European Union are making up for long-standing neglect.
If there is anyone who is interested in having us sort out European agriculture and make it transparent, it is the European agricultural sector.
The rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, whom I would like to congratulate, put it very well in saying that the European Union does not have a good image in the eyes of European citizens, and they have most often made European agriculture a scapegoat.
Therefore, at this late hour, I would like to quote General de Gaulle, who said that we must stand on the brink of the inevitable.
Yes, we, to whom the Common Agricultural Policy is so important, must stand on the brink of the inevitable, of transparency.
It is a big problem for the Common Agricultural Policy - and I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf - that the whole European Common Agricultural Policy is a tangled mess, hardly transparent and, in many respects, unfair.
Both of us, and, I think, those sitting in this chamber, would like to safeguard the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, but at the same time we would like to protect it.
My dear friends, what does it tell us when the Common Agricultural Policy has its favourite, spoiled children, such as the cereals, sugar and tobacco sectors, and that it has hostile sectors, such as the fruit and vegetables, grapes and wine, pork and poultry sectors?
Nobody in his right mind could explain this to a European citizen.
Often, nobody in his right mind could explain to a European citizen either that a whole heap of aid does not go to the producers, as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf said, but is creamed off by commercial organisations.
Nowhere has a report yet been produced, and it would be good if the Commission and the Council were finally to prepare a report on the amounts that go out of the agricultural sector. Enormous amounts.
This report is therefore very important for showing clearly who receives aid, and how much, so that it does not come about that the media give the negative example that 200 head of cattle have been on a sixth floor in Rome for years, while several hundred thousand Italian peasants are going honestly about their business.
My dear friends, transparency and data processing are therefore very important, and the European Union has to do this in other areas, so I support the report by Mr Chatzimarkakis.
Thank you very much.
(FI) Mr President, I also right away wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Chatzimarkakis, on this report.
We might well ask, of course, what sort of a report could be expected of a rapporteur who has the common sense of a German, the heart of a Greek, and even a bit of the Finnish landscape in his soul.
We might say in such a case that the report might turn out to be rather good in many respects, and that happens to be true with this one.
My congratulations once again.
It is true that, when we speak of agriculture and the system for financing it, it is very important that we stress the importance of transparency. Transparency is the basis of everything.
Of course, another factor that has to go hand in hand with transparency, with regard to financing programmes, is fairness.
In my few years here in the European Parliament, however, I have come to see that fairness, if anything, is a relative concept, and that the way we perceive it varies.
In any case, I hope that increased transparency will also boost the confidence of the public in our decision-making system and in the notion that we here want to make the right kind of decisions on the financing of agriculture as much as in any other area.
I would nevertheless like to mention my concern about agriculture in a broader context.
In mentioning fairness, I hope that in future we will pay attention not just to transparency but also to fairness.
Now, with the Commissioner present, it is very important to ensure that the small Member States also get treated properly.
In the future too we could make sure that any sort of national self-sufficiency can be preserved.
We in Finland have some serious examples of this, with the decision on sugar taken very recently by the European Union and the decisions on agricultural payments too.
They do not treat the small and the big Member States in the same way, and in this respect I hope there will be greater attention paid to fairness in future, now that this matter of transparency has been sorted out in the context of Mr Chatzimarkakis's report.
We must ensure that the European Union and our decision-making system are open and something which our citizens can trust in and which they feel they can support in the future.
(PL) Mr President, today's report on the financing of the common agricultural policy, and especially the matter of its transparency, are of huge importance for social acceptance of residents of the Community, and primarily for European farmers.
By publication of the beneficiaries of public aid, we will be able to see in detail in what context the division of funds is taking place; and particularly in the countries of what are known as the old and the new EU.
One very important proposal made by the rapporteur is the mention of a requirement concerning comparability of data between Member States.
This will enable false accusations between EU members concerning the size and methods of support for individual markets in given countries to be avoided, and will enable action to be taken with the aim of levelling out farmers' opportunities in the sphere of public support.
As a general point it should be stressed that suitably clear financing of agricultural policy, along with a suitable quantity of such products, guarantees food security for European consumers.
This is why European farmers should have long-term security and financial prospects with reference to investment in farms.
The voices that are currently being heard calling for a speedier review of the common agricultural policy are irresponsible and bring with them a threat to the EU's food security.
Nor should we forget the guarantees that have been given that subsidies for farms will be levelled out for all EU members by 2013.
To end, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur.
(NL) Mr President, I too would like to thank our fellow Member for this thorough report, which on the face of it concerns very technical rules, budgetary rules.
In reality, however, these rules are capable of affecting the work of our farmers - who are after all the legitimate and indispensable producers of our daily food.
I would like to discuss a couple of these in greater detail, without starting a very wide-ranging debate about the Health Check or anything else.
I do just need to get off my chest, however, that it puzzles me where my highly respected fellow Member from the Dutch Socialist Party (SP) found the large landowners of whom she spoke in a country as densely populated as the Netherlands.
Anyway, I digress.
First of all, I would like to express my support for the Commission proposal to make it possible, in the event of shortcomings, for the Member State concerned to be penalised - to have deductions applied - more efficiently, possibly by suspending or reducing its intermediate payments.
In my opinion, the Commission should look not only at the gravity and nature of the non-conformity, as it wrote, but also at its duration.
For example, in the event of sustained breaches the Commission should increase the percentage reduction every year.
We must also ensure that the new rules we are now introducing do not lead to an increase in the administrative burden.
I should like to conclude by discussing the tricky subject of the publication of the names of those receiving support from the European Agricultural Fund.
My country is doing this already to a great extent, and the Commission is now proposing to introduce it throughout the EU with a view to transparency and the legitimacy of this expenditure.
I can endorse these efforts, but with two brief comments, which are also expressed in the form of amendments.
First of all, the publication of this data may infringe the rights of those involved.
We must thus ensure adequate data protection to prevent the data falling into the wrong hands or being used to benefit the actions of radical animal-rights activists, for example: a phenomenon with which several Member States are already confronted.
Finally, I would like to say that the Commission believes that this proposal will also enable it to improve budgetary control.
This may be the case to a certain extent, but I take the view that it is of even greater benefit to budgetary control to introduce national declarations concerning the budgetary resources managed at national level.
Therefore, I would just like to devote my last second to calling on the Commission and the Council to speed up the process of introducing these national declarations.
(HU) Increasing the transparency of the Common Agricultural Policy is an important Community objective, and so I support the report by my fellow member, Mr Chatzimarkakis.
But since the Common Agricultural Policy is already being discussed, I would like to draw your attention to one of the most important issues in environmentally conscious farming, the Natura 2000 programme.
As you know, those who farm in a manner that sustains protected flora and fauna receive aid from the Community and Member states, within the framework of Natura 2000.
Nearly 1/5 of the territory of the European Union, and 21% of the territory of Hungary, comes under the protection of this programme.
Farmers expect this aid, since sustaining natural interests requires financial self-restraint on their part.
However, it is crucial for a sustainable future that we protect as many natural interests as possible. This is why it is important that we put as much money as possible into aid for areas affected by the Natura 2000 programme.
At the time, I was the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group for the Natura 2000 programme.
Unfortunately, since then it has not been possible to bring about the amount for which we pressed at the time, EUR 3 billion a year.
However, it is the eleventh hour if we want to stop the obliteration of nature, particularly in Europe, which is already over-populated.
It would be useful to have the planned Internet list of how much aid is given to farmers within the framework of Natura 2000, thus popularising practices that point forward.
This openness will hopefully also stimulate environmentally friendly farming and the protection of our unique natural interests.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, we are talking about the common agricultural policy, but in reality there is no common policy.
I can say this because that aid for agriculture is differentiated not only in individual regions, but the differences are very clearly to be seen between the old Member States and the new ones.
In order to talk about a common agricultural policy, we must have common and standard principles, duties and potential to obtain support for production.
It is my view, however, that the report is very welcome and necessary, because at the end of the day who gets what must be disclosed, as well as how these funds are utilised.
An improvement in statistics will not directly provide an increase in the funds for agriculture, but it will improve thrift, there will be transparency, greater trust in people, and we as parliamentarians will be in a position to draw our own conclusions and to search for common solutions, which would in fact build a common agricultural policy on the same democratic and partnership principles for all countries of the European Union and for farmers, regardless of the region where they happen to work and live.
(PL) Mr President, the European Commission's initiative to impose on Member States the duty to publish information on the beneficiaries of EU funds obtained under the umbrella of the common agricultural policy is worthy of support in every respect.
Publication of such information on the Internet using standards that ensure comparability of data between individual countries will not only do much to improve the transparency of budget expenditure and the efficiency of the budget control process, it will also shed a bright light on at least two serious problems linked to agricultural expenditure in the EU.
To begin with, a very large proportion of direct subsidies in individual countries goes not to farms but to large concerns like Smithfield, or large landholdings like the Crown Estates of Elizabeth II.
Perhaps data like this on the scale of the whole EU will make it clear to the decision-makers that there is a need to limit subsidies allocated to a single farm so that these subsidies help family farms more than large estates.
Secondly, there is a very large disproportion between the support per hectare of agricultural land utilised in the old Member States and in the new Member States.
In the period 2007-2013, this indicator will be a little over 60%, and when Romania and Bulgaria are taken on board it will be even lower.
So for each Euro paid out in the old EU there will be barely 60 cents in countries of the new EU, even though agriculture in the new countries has to catch up with the more developed agriculture in the old Member States.
Mr President, I wish that a group of farmers who I spoke to this afternoon from the North West of Ireland were here to listen to this debate because they might even want to contribute.
Let us be honest: no one wants their financial affairs made public, and I think there are Members of this House who are talking about openness and transparency who would run a mile from it themselves.
I liked the point made by someone else this evening that it may be right that we publish the payments of everyone who gets money from the public purse.
Having said that, I believe we are going to have publication of payments and I believe generally in this term 'openness and transparency', but it is a two-way street.
I also would question the notion that information is equal to understanding and it is because of that question that I think you do need to have clarification about what the payments actually mean.
The group of farmers I met today were in beef and sheep farming, and many of them were using their single farm payment to subsidise their production.
Perhaps they are silly to do that.
Maybe they should stop farming and let the farms go to rack and ruin and continue to accept the cheque.
Some comments have been made here about the failure of policy as though it were farmers' fault.
But I think it is the policymakers of Europe who should take the rap for the failures that have been identified.
Those who talk about intervention and export refunds must have forgotten about the 2003 reforms.
We now have a problem of shortages within the European Union.
We import beef.
Global demand is rising for dairy products, and grain is in short supply so we have moved on a great deal.
Yes, publish, but explain.
Protect people and make sure that they are not ridiculed wrongly for the payments they receive.
Do not use this as a weapon to beat farmers with.
The Commission are doing it already in the health check, where they have talked about how, now that publication will be made, we could look at cutting back on payments.
Perhaps we need to do that at the higher level, but let us be honest in how we debate this topic.
I think we do need to review the use that the information is put to.
(PL) Mr President, we are debating an important report concerning the financing of the common agricultural policy. A policy to which we devote some 45% of the EU budget.
The European Commission's proposal is aimed at increasing the transparency and credibility of expenditure for EU farmers and rural areas.
By the same token it is supposed to improve the way the policy is accepted and assessed by EU citizens.
But people keep on popping up who are not well disposed towards the common agricultural policy, people who wish to deprive our farmers of support at any cost and expose them to open and unequal competition with farmers from third countries.
The question is - what would then happen to food security in the EU?
I am sure that MEPs from the Committee on Agriculture will share my view that no cuts can be made in the envisaged budget for the common agricultural policy.
This budget is steadily shrinking, and in 2013 it will constitute only 33% of total budget expenditure.
Let us hope that the new rules will help to simplify legislation in line with the slogan of 'better regulation' promoted by the Commission.
Our citizens will be able to check and find out for what purposes we are handing out EU money.
In November of this year the Commission is to present a communication on the matter of a health check.
I am of the opinion that the EU direct payments system should be very much simpler and also transparent, and that the level of subsidies should be standardised for all Member States, in other words be fair and understandable.
I also hope that our colleagues from Romania are coping with the current problems connected with their payment systems.
We cannot allow Romanian farmers to be harmed and punished by a drop in subsidies. They are just as necessary in Romania as in other Member States.
Instead of punishing Romanian farmers, we should be helping to sort out the system of subsidies.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I thank you for your interesting remarks.
I am very happy that I have an opportunity to participate in this discussion because, when the Commission started discussing the proposal to have more transparency concerning the beneficiaries of EU funds, the information was published only in two countries: in Denmark and in Estonia.
Now it is 13, and finally it will be in every country.
This, in terms of Europe's decision-making process, is very fast.
I would like only to say some factual remarks.
First of all, what was mentioned - the disclosure of beneficiaries - will be done in full respect of Community legislation on data protection.
It is already laid down in the proposal.
Several people raised the issue of the publication of information on structural funds, but absolutely the same logic applies to the Structural Funds, to which the same Article 53b of the Financial Regulation applies.
So there is no difference.
All benefits which will be paid out from the European budget will be open, including the salaries of the highest officials and Commission members.
This is totally public.
So there is nothing - and this has been public since the adoption of the staff regulations.
I would like to ask Parliament to endorse the Commission's approach as reflected in its proposal.
We have sympathy for the substance of some of the amendments proposed, and some of these will be mirrored in the implementing legislation or in the final text to be adopted by Council following the Presidency's compromise text.
I am confident that the innovations now on the table will make Regulation 1290/2005 an even more effective instrument than it already is.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 11 October 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) I support the Commission's recommendation for several reasons.
Firstly, it will become transparent who is benefiting from the CAP, and the scale of agriculture grants among EU Member States will become comparable.
Secondly, it will increase the legitimacy of all the EU institutions and of all Union policies towards European citizens.
Thirdly, this initiative will extend not only to agricultural grants but also to grants in all sectors of the EU, and may thereby also increase the effectiveness of budgetary monitoring.
I agree with the second point of the recommendation, which recommends that, if the monitoring systems of the Member States are wanting, the rules relating to sanctions should be made more stringent.
In Hungary, at the expense of great effort, we have managed to develop the institutional system so that it works as effectively as possible and complies with the Commission's stipulations.
I support the rapporteur's recommendation, which would prescribe the publication of data on the Internet as a compulsory requirement.
The Internet sites of the paying agencies in the Member States would be connected to the Commission's websites, or to a common network of websites within a Member State.
Naturally, such data provision must comply with the stipulations of the European Data Protection Supervisor.
Among other things, it is crucial that the relevant parties receive advance notification of the publication of data, as soon as possible and where possible, even when the data is collected.
in writing. - More transparency means less unfounded anti-EU propaganda.
Therefore it is easy to support the rapporteur's approach welcoming the Commission's proposal to improve transparency and implementation of European agricultural expenditure.
We have to keep in mind that agricultural expenditure constitutes one of the largest shares of EU spending.
Therefore it is a question of legitimacy for the Union.
The lack of a clear view on all expenditure, not only agricultural, results in a distorted picture of EU spending.
At the same time we know that management of agricultural expenditure has steadily improved.
Data on Community expenditure should be easily available on the internet.
Full transparency is essential for budgetary control.
Therefore I am happy to note that Mr Chatzimarkakis received 100% support in the committee.
Combating cigarette smuggling (EC-Philip Morris agreement) (debate)
The next item is the report by Bart Staes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the implications of the agreement between the Community and the Member States with Philip Morris on intensifying the fight against fraud and cigarette smuggling and progress made in implementing the recommendations of Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the reports by the Committee on Budgetary Control often contain fairly bad news - it is the EP's anti-fraud committee, after all.
This often concerns weaknesses, irregularities, trickery - sometimes even fraud and deception.
I am glad, ladies and gentlemen, that today I have something positive to report, a success story, a story that demonstrates how the cooperation between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Member States can ensure the resolution of problems.
What is the context?
At the start of the 1990s, fraud involving cigarette smuggling was found to be big business.
Hundreds of millions of ECU - in those days we still spoke in terms of ECU rather than euro - disappeared into the pockets of criminals at the expense of the budgets of the European Union and the Member States.
Back in 1994 the then UCLAF - the predecessor of OLAF - set up a Cigarettes Task Force.
In 1996 and 1997 an EP Committee of Inquiry - which, incidentally, was the very first Committee of Inquiry launched under the Treaty on European Union - examined all aspects of transit fraud.
The Committee of Inquiry found that the monitoring system in the transit sector was archaic.
Lorries in transit had to have a document stamped at the customs office where the goods entered the Union, then drive through the Union and have the same document stamped again at the customs office where the goods left the Union.
The document then had to be sent back to the customs office of import.
A great many problems arose in this connection.
The documents arrived back much too late: sometimes three or four months.
There was the problem of forged documents, and also of forged stamps.
Consequently, one of the most important recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry was the replacement of this whole archaic system, based on paper and stamps, with a computerised system.
This New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) was gradually introduced and is now operational in all Member States.
It helps the customs services detect in real time whether goods are illegally escaping customs supervision - and thus represents tremendous progress.
This does not, of course, rule out false declarations still being made, and that is why we are asking the Commission to set up a system for this, too, to prevent the false declaration of goods.
We also ask that OLAF be given direct access to this computerised system.
As has been said, the Committee of Inquiry concentrated on the problem of cigarettes.
Cigarettes were transported across the territory from one border point to another, but very often those goods, those cigarettes, ended up on the black market.
In addition, those goods were very often smuggled back into the Union. This led to immense problems, even sometimes to violence.
In Italy, for example, two agents from the financial police were even murdered.
The overall investigation also revealed that some tobacco companies were in league with the smugglers, and on the basis of that information the Commission, together with a number of Member States, brought an action against Philip Morris before a court in New York.
It gradually became clear that Philip Morris would find it particularly difficult to win the action, and in 2004 a deal was struck with the company.
In exchange for USD 1.25 billion, to be spread over a 12-year period, the Commission and the Member States refrained from proceeding with the action before the New York court.
In fact, the second part of the agreement with Philip Morris was perhaps even more important.
It comprised provisions on cooperation between Philip Morris and the European Union in tracking and tracing cigarettes.
If the customs services found cargoes of cigarettes, and the provisions of this agreement had not been followed, Philip Morris was bound to pay the evaded customs duties immediately - and the figure in question can be up to EUR 1.5 million per container of cigarettes.
To reiterate, this is a success story: it demonstrates how Parliament and the Commission can work together.
I do have a few criticisms, however.
When the USD 1.25 billion was distributed among the Commission and Member States, only 9.7% went to the Commission, and the lion's share to the Member States.
I do not think this fair, particularly as OLAF and the Commission do the lion's share of the work.
A second criticism is that, according to the spirit of the agreement, this money was to be used in the fight against fraud.
The Commission has done its work.
It has spent a proportion of that money on the Hercules II programme.
The Member States, on the other hand, have simply let the money flow into their treasuries, when they should really have been using it better to equip their investigative services, for example their customs services, and to step up the fight against this kind of fraud.
To recap, Mr President, this is indeed a success story, one that it may well be possible to apply to other products, such as alcohol and certain agricultural products.
I also hope that this report has added a positive note to the important work being carried out by the Mr Kallas and the Commission and also our Parliament in the fight against fraud.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I must thank Mr Staes for this own-initiative report and the European Parliament for its support of these issues and finding solutions to these difficult issues.
In my statement I will speak first about the Community transit system, for which my colleague LÃ¡zlÃ³ KovÃ¡cs has responsibility.
The European Parliament applauds the successful introduction of the new computerised transit system.
It is indeed an enormous change compared to the archaic paper-based procedure.
Full implementation of the upgraded system will take place by 1 July 2009.
Risk management is a modern control tool.
The Commission is actively implementing the customs risk management framework to better target the checks.
We are currently establishing criteria, priorities and the IT platform with the Member States.
The new system will also provide for the possibility of regular monitoring of the effectiveness of the risk analysis made.
The planned development of the anti-fraud transit information system will strengthen the capacity to analyse and counter risks in transit fraud, first with regard to sensitive goods and later for all kinds of goods in transit.
This is conditional on Member States granting wider access for the Commission to the NCTS movement data.
However, freezing further financing for the NCTS, as proposed in the report, would be counterproductive to the necessary further development of more effective transit control.
A few words on value added tax fraud.
In its report, the United Kingdom's House of Lords pointed to many factors behind the phenomenon of missing trader fraud.
However, we do not see any proof that weaknesses of the transit system led to carousel fraud.
I would like to clarify that, even though transit was not a priority during traditional own-resources inspections between 2001 and 2006 when change was ongoing, nevertheless it was not being ignored.
As a result of many inspections, payments of own resources and interest were demanded.
This approach represents efficient use of the Commission's inspection resources and avoids falling back on ex ante audits.
I would like to turn now to the anti-fraud agreement with Philip Morris International, which comes under my portfolio.
I must thank the Parliament for its continued strong support.
The Commission has consistently stated that it hopes that the agreement can serve as a model for similar agreements with other companies.
With regard to the funds coming from this agreement, the new Hercule Programme has received in Greece funding devoted to combating cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, which are newly added objectives.
We are considering whether the programme could be used to fund the establishment of a laboratory which would verify the authenticity of cigarettes.
But I must also say - and Mr Staes knows this very well - that the distribution of money was a real nightmare and it will be a nightmare in the next financial periods as well.
Of course I am very happy about the support and the constant interest expressed by Parliament in the use of this money because I am also interested in having this money used for the purpose of fighting cigarette smuggling and other kinds of fraud.
With regard to seizure statistics, most Member States inform the Commission of the amounts on a quarterly basis.
However, not all Member States indicate the brands they have seized and there is therefore no complete data available.
Moreover, the notifications of seizures by the Member States do not always differentiate between genuine and counterfeit cigarettes, partly because it is not necessary for the purposes of the prosecution of offenders and the collection of duties and taxes and partly because it is sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine cigarettes.
We continue to encourage the Member States to provide more complete figures.
Finally, the Commission is willing to prepare an OLAF report on this topic, as suggested by Parliament, but I consider that it would more beneficial to wait until 2010 for a comprehensive overview. This is due to the fact that many significant changes are in the pipeline in the customs area and a report in 2008 could only be an interim one, reflecting the state of play at that point in time.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to congratulate the rapporteur, Bart Staes, who has managed to produce an excellent report on the difficult subject of the flaws in our Community Transit System.
I am also most grateful to the European Court of Auditors which, in its report in December 2006, highlighted the scale of the problem very clearly.
I am disappointed, in this regard, that we are confusing the repercussions of the Philip Morris agreement, which we must remember is an agreement to drop legal proceedings and not a partnership agreement, with the serious problems of Community Transit.
That is the reason for the amendment I tabled on behalf of the PPE Group, which aims to prevent the confusion.
On the subject of the industry, I propose that the European Union and the whole of the tobacco industry jointly finance a programme to combat cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting.
However, I want to focus my comments on the flaws in our Community Transit System.
The European Commission tells us that it has strengthened the customs transit system by introducing a modern, robust computer system.
It is forgetting that, though a computer system is necessary, it is never sufficient, and the reality is that it is the system itself that is flawed.
It is flawed because it is conducted under the authority of the Member States, which means - as our rapporteur and the European Court of Auditors quite rightly pointed out - that the Member States are applying the new Community Transit rules with serious weaknesses.
In 1997 Parliament set up a Committee of Inquiry, which clearly stated that the EU should set up a framework to enable the customs services to function as one.
We are a long way from this.
In 2005 our fellow Member Herbert BÃ¶sch highlighted in his excellent report the scale of the problems and the need to fight fraud and errors.
The reality is, ladies and gentlemen, that this report invites us to think much more widely about the quality of our customs system, our financial circuits and, more generally, about the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.
In this, Commissioner, you have the full support of MEPs.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we expressly welcome this report, which is excellent.
The term 'own-initiative report' is not quite accurate.
What we are doing here is persevering with the subject of Parliament's first Committee of Inquiry - and we shall continue to do so.
I do not want to complain, but it is a shame that we have to do this at such a late hour.
I note with interest on the list of speakers the groups that have asked to speak on this subject today.
It seems it is always somewhat easier to complain about the scandals in the EU than to work on specific, positive solutions.
The road there is sometimes long - we are talking about cigarettes - but it is a good one to take.
We are making progress, and the Staes report shows this very clearly.
Of course, we have the incompleteness of European integration to contend with in this field.
Various Ministers for Finance still cannot resist simply raising the tax on tobacco a little when the treasury is starting to look a little empty, wrongly earning praise from some health politician or other in the process.
I say 'wrongly' because consumers of cigarettes simply switch to smuggled cigarettes or, increasingly, to counterfeit cigarettes.
The profit from this kind of fraud goes directly to organised crime.
The fact that there is cause for us all to celebrate progress this evening makes me even more inclined to remind the House of an episode that does less credit to Europe, and particularly the Commission.
There is evidence that, in the period 1992-2001, approximately 10 000 lorry-loads of cigarettes were smuggled into the EU via Montenegro, particularly heading for Italy.
This is probably the biggest fraud against the EU budget of all time.
The public prosecutor's office in Augsburg, Germany, has made 60 requests for legal assistance in this connection.
There have been confessions, convictions and all such things in Switzerland.
Yet the European Union has not submitted any claims for recovery of own resources against the Republic of Montenegro.
Commissioner, I should like us to be able to stand before our taxpayers and say, 'We have looked into this matter, too'.
There are petty customs officials in Germany, Austria and Central Europe who have done great work in this field, but who it seems have been rather let down by the European Commission.
We must deal with this mammoth affair, for which the limitation period is not yet at an end.
That would be my wish in connection with what is by and large a very pleasing occasion for today's debate.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the House much prefers dealing with expenditure to revenue - and so it is to Mr Staes' great credit that we are today turning to the trifle of revenue for once.
All the same, this is a matter of EUR 17 billion in VAT and own resources and EUR 14 billion in customs duties - which is almost 30%.
In my opinion, it is good that we are addressing this issue today.
Evidently, there are only winners here, and the Commissioner, too, deserves our congratulations for this.
We are pleased that we have managed to find a way -in cooperation with the Member States.
It is essential to shore up the future of OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office, to enable it to play its role within the EU even better and more efficiently.
Congratulations are due for what OLAF has shown us so far and what we are seeing before us now.
We are all very proud of these successes, as it was these experts, of course, who made them possible.
It was not a foregone conclusion, particularly given the subject, that we would make real progress with the counterfeit tobacco products dossier or that the Member States, too, would cooperate.
We should like this scenario to be replicated in the case of other dossiers concerning the protection of the financial interests of the Union, for example the fight against VAT fraud.
Then we would have true winners: the European taxpayers who sent us here and have certain expectations.
I believe that continuing the fight against cigarette smuggling is an important task, that there is an urgent need to call in an investigator from OLAF in Beijing, and that we need to strengthen the anti-fraud presence worldwide.
The question to the Commission now would be how to step up the pressure on other cigarette manufacturers to induce them to subscribe to the agreement between Philip Morris and the Community in the Member States.
In my opinion, we must consider very specifically how to follow this up and how to continue working on this issue, as failure to do so would endanger our own credibility.
(PT) Our rapporteur, and in this case also the European Commission, deserve all our congratulations.
This was the biggest success I can remember the European Union achieving to date against smuggling and tax fraud.
The message already announced by our rapporteur and supported now by all speakers is, however, that we must also take this fight to other fields.
It is fundamentally a case of ensuring that the movement of any kind of substance throughout the whole customs system should manage effectively to protect the financial interests of the European Union and of all the Member States and, from that point of view, I think there is still a lot to be done.
I should therefore like, above all, to invite the European Commission to pursue the matter more assiduously.
(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
Most esteemed Commissioner Kallas, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Staes is right, and I would hereby like to congratulate him on his work, which is solid yet willing to make sacrifices, and on this present report.
The European Union and its institutions - including the Commission, the Court of Auditors, OLAF, the European Parliament and not least the Budget Control Committee - regard the agreement signed with Philip Morris in 2004 and its subsequent life and follow-up as a real success story, and rightly so.
In the fight against smuggling and fraud, we have managed to achieve a serious result here, not only for the traders and consumers at the end of the process but also for a large international manufacturer at the beginning of the process.
This agreement not only compensates financially for past losses but also covers their future prevention.
We have managed to make Philip Morris understand that it also has an interest in preparing a joint strategy against smuggling and fraud and in ensuring the financial instruments necessary to bring it to fruition.
It is particularly pleasing and, for us newly acceded countries, very significant that the cooperation will cover not only the ten Member States in the agreement but also the new countries that are particularly threatened by smuggling and fraud, and thus also ensuring the financial and technical conditions for the fight against smuggling and fraud, albeit with varying degrees of success.
Thank you.
(PL) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I accept and approve of Mr Staes's report, which will first and foremost lead to contraband being limited as far as possible.
This is the strong point of this report.
Secondly, it provides important advice on how to collect duty with maximum efficiency.
As someone who comes from a country which has a very long eastern border, that is to say Poland, however, I would like to draw attention to external borders.
Herbert BÃ¶sch is entirely correct when he talks of using experienced customs people.
These people will actually be much more crucial than equipment and systems, and so, Commissioner, I would earnestly request you to have a reasonably thorough look at the proposals and recommendations and take them to heart.
Efficiency and effectiveness in combating contraband will be the indicative factor where the reputation of our Community is concerned.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for your constant support for these issues raised.
I must say the biggest problem is that all the competence in customs and value added tax is in the hands of the Member States.
I do not really understand why some Member States are so reluctant to give more possibilities to use the facilities which exist within the European Union institutions.
For instance, OLAF has been extremely operational in several cases, in the Philip Morris operation and in the Diabolo fight against counterfeit operations, and this cannot happen without cooperation at European level and cannot happen without support from specific Commission services.
But legally, this is fully in the hands of the Member States, as is the strengthening of customs providing necessary resources.
The Commission is doing whatever is possible to facilitate this cooperation.
I must say that, without cooperation between Member States, an efficient, effective fight against cigarette smuggling, and especially value added tax fraud, is impossible.
I think that we have common interests here, and we should raise this issue constantly to increase cooperation.
Also - and perhaps I understood incorrectly from the interpretation - the Philip Morris agreement was between 10 Member States and the European Commission on the one side and Philip Morris on the other side, which is quite unique.
It was the Commission, its legal service and OLAF which achieved this agreement, and, with Ms GrÃ€Ãle, this is continuing.
So I think that we can tell something in the future.
But the main issue is really the reluctance of some Member States to accept the mutual administrative assistance proposal which has been put forward, which can serve as a platform.
We are offering a platform for cooperation, and there are still some Member States, some of the bigger Member States (I myself have tried to convince certain ministers of the biggest Member State to be more open to this proposal.)
Somehow, there is a lot of suspicion; but, at the same time, being a former finance minister, I know that to fight value added tax fraud and customs is possible only with cooperation between Member States.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 11 October 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) As rapporteur on combating fraud in the EU, I welcome the important agreement with Philip Morris on combating cigarette smuggling at customs.
Customs fraud is one of the main sources of damage to the financial interests of the Community, and fraud relating to cigarettes is one of the most vulnerable sectors.
OLAF's recent operations - such as Operation Diabolo (135 million cigarettes seized, estimated loss of EUR 220 million) - have demonstrated that customs fraud can and must be combated: it is important to strengthen the operational capabilities of the European authorities.
The agreement with Philip Morris may serve as an example not only in the field of tobacco, but also in other fields of combating counterfeiting.
The proceeds of the compensation owed by Philip Morris, amounting to approximately EUR 1 billion, ought to be used to step up the fight against counterfeiting in the EU.

EC-USA air transport agreement (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr El Khadraoui, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a decision of the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting with the Council, on the conclusion of the Air Transport Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and the United States of America, on the other hand [8044/3/07 - - C6-0210/2007 -.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr El Khadraoui, Parliament played a major political role in helping us sign the first EU-US air transport agreement on 30 April in Washington.
By backing the agreement on 14 March, even before the Committee on Transport and Tourism had made its announcement, Parliament played an extremely decisive role in modernising the arrangements regulating transatlantic aviation and offering new possibilities to European citizens.
The agreement will enter into force in March next year, and European and US businesses are on their starting blocks for new transatlantic connections.
The Joint Committee which is to operate the agreement has already met in June.
It is due to meet again in November to ensure smooth application and start work on important issues such as competition or security.
You make a number of key points in your formal discussions on the agreement today, which I share.
You emphasise the importance of a second stage agreement to move forward access to the US market, especially as a means of taking European investment to the United States.
You emphasise the importance of converging our regulations, particularly with regard to security, in a bid to obtain 'one-stop security'.
You emphasise the importance of the environmental aspect, and CO2 emissions trading in particular.
Lastly, you also emphasise the importance of informing and consulting Parliament.
I also share your political priorities.
I welcome the agreement between our two institutions on items so politically sensitive in both Europe and the United States.
I am also extremely pleased that Parliament is conveying Europe's voice to the United States through continuous dialogue with the US Congress and Government.
We must work relentlessly together on items posing a problem with Washington.
The International Civil Aviation Organisation's Assembly in Montreal in September was a disappointment.
As you are aware, the EU and its European neighbours, 42 countries, were compelled to voice their reserves concerning the resolution on CO2 emissions trading, for we are in opposition with respect to the US and the rest of the world.
The House of Representatives also adopted an amendment to restrict the possibility of US businesses coming under foreign control.
Although the amendment has not yet been voted by the Senate, this casts a shadow over negotiations towards a second stage agreement, due to commence in the spring.
The European Parliament has made Congress and the US Government aware of this matter, as I have, and we must continue to deploy our energies to prevent any movements that are at odds with normalisation of the aviation sector.
However, if these events point to the difficulties to be overcome, we must not forget the most important part.
We now have a solid work base between Europe and the US to treat each other as equals.
This was not the case six months ago.
We must, therefore, build on this achievement, which is the result of four years' work.
Obviously, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr El Khadraoui, I wish to let you know I am ready and willing to meet the political objectives of both Parliament and the Council, and that I am extremely pleased with European unity on this issue, with the union of Europeans.
Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when this afternoon we finally give the green light to the air transport agreement between the EU and the United States, that will not only mark the end of a procedure that has lasted for many years and that progressed with great difficulty, it will also mark the beginning of a new chapter in the history of air transport and the consequences - while not entirely predictable - could be immense.
At the same time we know that this is only an interim phase and that there is still a lot of work ahead of us to get to the more or less integrated transatlantic aviation market for which we are aiming.
Some members believe that we have already made too many concessions to the Americans in this first phase.
They believe that the mind to negotiate will melt away, especially as airlines from the US already have de facto stand alone cabotage to fly from one Member State to another, which we cannot do on US territory.
Both parties get what we call the fifth freedom of the air, which offers American airlines the opportunity to fly on to Africa or Asia via Europe.
The other way round is also possible but is less important on account of the geographical location of the US.
What is more, from March of next year the restrictions that still exist on access to certain airports will be lifted: just think of Heathrow, which only two American airlines are allowed to use at present.
In some senses, therefore, there is no real balance but, on the other hand, Commissioner, the agreement is obviously a step forward and an improvement over the present situation.
First, the agreement puts an end to the legal uncertainty created since the judgments of the Court of Justice in 2002, which pronounced that the existing bilateral open skies agreement contains elements which are unlawful and which must be amended.
Second, consumers will feel the difference.
Whereas up to now only national carriers and American airlines have been able to fly from the Member States to the United States, in future all European carriers will be able to fly from any point in Europe to any point in the United States, with the possibility of then flying on to, for instance, Mexico or South America.
Now, this will undoubtedly mean more choice for the consumer and probably lower prices too.
Third, with the setting up of the Joint Committee - to which you also referred, Commissioner - with representatives from both sides, we are creating an institution which will discuss issues relating to the agreement, as well as issues concerning social, environmental and safety regulations, and so on. This is an instrument, therefore, that could boost confidence and understanding on both sides.
That is very important because, parallel with this opening of the transatlantic market, it is, of course, essential that the regulations are gradually harmonised and aligned with one another at a high level.
As the authorities come to be on better terms and as the benefits of close cooperation become clearer, the Americans may also become more willing to make new concessions on access to the internal US market.
After all, there are still many unresolved issues: you have already referred to them.
I am talking about cabotage, right of establishment for European airlines, rules relating to control and ownership, and all manner of other restrictions that are still in place.
Knowing, therefore, that the negotiations for stage two will start very soon - next summer, in fact - it is necessary for the Commission to think about a good negotiating strategy now.
What in fact do we want to achieve?
What are our priorities?
How can we persuade the Americans to take new steps?
Where can concessions still be made without disadvantage to us?
I do not need to tell you, Commissioner, that the context is highly problematic.
There are presidential elections next year.
There is a general mistrust in the United States, which goes right up to Congress, about allowing third parties control over strategic industries such as aviation.
The American trade unions also fear losing their grip on the sector through foreign interference, chiefly because it is felt that they could be successful and because there is an assumption that the European airlines are better organised and will easily be able to grab chunks of that market.
Then, of course, we also have the European elections.
Then there are the problems that already exist today.
You refer to the attempt of our US counterpart, Congressman Oberstar, to put a different interpretation on a number of elements of the agreement.
However, having said this, as rapporteur and as Parliament we are going to give it the green light this afternoon.
We are going to vote 'yes' wholeheartedly.
Of course, we will follow the preparations very closely indeed. We hope to be very closely involved, as we have been in the past.
We are counting on that.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, first of all I would like to make an apology to you, to the Vice-President of the Commission and to honourable Members, because after I have made my speech I will have to leave the Chamber to do an interview.
It is not my habit to do so, and I apologise for not staying for the rest of the debate.
I would like to thank my colleague, Mr El Khadraoui, for his report and warn him that he perhaps may beat my record of being the longest-serving rapporteur in parliamentary history if he continues with this particular dossier!
Let us be honest. The marriage entered into between the European Union and the US in the form of the initial civil aviation Air Transport Agreement is a marriage of convenience, with the EU being the eager bridegroom and the US the very reluctant bride.
Now, when we come to consummate the marriage, we find that the US bride finds that her EU bridegroom is not very fanciable, and, seeing as she has got all the best bits out of him on their wedding day, the US bride now cannot be bothered to consummate the marriage, because Representative Oberstar is standing over the couple, shotgun in hand.
Great differences exist between the EU and US on aviation policy, and I for one would not be surprised to hear, in the weeks and months to come, that negotiations on the second stage agreement have broken down because the US would not move on key issues.
My fear is that the EU bridegroom is so desperate to consummate this marriage of convenience that we yet again give in to the reluctant bride.
What about ETS and security, where the EU and US are worlds apart?
What about foreign ownership of US airlines, or fifth freedom reciprocals?
What about passenger lists and Chapter 11 protection?
These are all issues that divide us, and, whilst I accept that there is a willingness to sit down and negotiate, it is always, it would appear to us, on the terms dictated to us by the Americans.
I wish everybody well in their efforts, and the PSE Group will vote in favour.
However, I sincerely hope the negotiations are successful, and that a more balanced, reciprocal, fair agreement is forthcoming at the end of the road.
But I question whether that will happen, because of US attitudes, and I ask whether the road that we are actually on will lead to this marriage of convenience ending in a Las Vegas-type divorce.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am substituting for my colleague, Ms in 't Veld.
I bow to the knowledge of other people on the technicalities of this agreement.
As an MEP representing London, which includes the major airport of Heathrow, I am certainly encouraged by the fact that this agreement will grant more benefits of competition to passengers and, to that extent, it is good that it has been concluded.
I want to address the security aspects of the agreement, understanding from the report that this is largely left to regulation by the Joint Committee.
I agree with the report's welcoming of cooperation between the EU and US authorities responsible for aviation security.
However, as the report says, security measures should be based on a proper risk assessment and should not be excessive or uncoordinated, and the privacy of European and US citizens should be respected when personal passenger data are exchanged between the EU and the US.
Members will be aware of the considerable controversy surrounding the Passenger Name Records (PNR) Agreement.
The European Parliament has expressed itself very forcefully on the fact that it has not played the major role that it would have wanted in that agreement.
Certainly, the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisors is that safeguards under the new agreement have been considerably weakened in comparison to previous agreements and that the new agreement leaves open serious questions and shortcomings.
While Commissioner Barrot welcomed the major role Parliament has played in modernising the regulatory framework for other aspects of the aviation business, I am afraid we have to express disappointment that we have not succeeded in having the input we wanted on privacy and the enforcement of personal data safeguards.
The data under the PNR Agreement will be retained for 15 years, which, I put to you, is excessive and which this report says we do not want.
The US will be able to have access to sensitive data and even to use it in cases of petty crime, which is not fighting terrorism.
All in all, while welcoming this agreement overall, I am afraid to say that the aspirations of this report that security measures should be properly assessed for their contribution to combating risk, should not be excessive and should protect privacy have not been secured in the area of the exchange of passenger name records.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, this was not the first time that you faced a negotiating partner who is very difficult, to put it mildly, because based on experience, he assumes from the outset that Europe will always give in, in every instance.
As before, if you read through this document, it is clearly to the advantage of the US.
Whether there is anything in it for the European Union remains to be seen, for a joint committee is no more than an opportunity; it is not yet a success, especially given that the US is already calling the outcomes into question.
I see no balance yet, and very little concern for our demands.
The comparison drawn by the previous speaker about the rather bizarre marriage of convenience is very apt.
The issues of aviation security, environmental protection and ownership rights are still unresolved.
On the question of security, we have still not achieved what we need to achieve.
On the issue of data protection in particular - the protection of European citizens from overzealous measures - we have still not achieved the result that we need and that we must achieve.
In addition to that, the contribution of aviation to our failure to achieve the Kyoto target is still massive.
With the present rates of growth, Europe will face major difficulties unless we have a common agreement with the US, and I see no sign of that at all at the moment.
At most, I see initial faltering steps, but Europe must be much more self-confident and speak with one voice in this negotiating process, for what has happened so far gives us opportunities.
We have not yet reaped the benefits, however, and I can say with confidence that the European Parliament and the Committee on Transport and Tourism will be scrutinising the outcomes produced by this joint negotiating committee very carefully.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the heart of the EU's foreign policy on air transport lies the establishment of an open aviation area between the European Union and the United States of America.
This policy is wholly in the interests of capital.
It is being used to create through pressure and threats two or three monopolistic aviation business groups within the EU. They will also have the pick of international air transport, while the remaining aviation companies - those that are left - will be regional in nature and their activities will be restricted to within the Member States.
The strong pressure and threats experienced by staff at Alitalia, Olympic Airlines and other aviation companies in the Member States are typical of what is now happening.
Conflicts were evident in the negotiations with the United States. The resulting agreement and signs of friction can be inferred from the state subsidies to Airbus and Boeing, the prevention of sabotage on internal US flights and the US Government's refusal to permit the participation in or even the buying out of US aviation companies by European air carriers.
The agreement shows the level of compromise between the EU and the United States.
This is far from meeting the needs of the people; it will contribute to the increased rate of concentration through buy-outs and mergers of aviation companies.
In all these areas, severe problems remain with regard to the protection of personal data as well as that of the environment.
For these reasons, we will vote against the proposal for an Air Transport Agreement between the United States and the European Union.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, reciprocity is an important value in interpersonal relations and all the more so in relations between states, even commercial ones.
I did in fact attempt to introduce a few amendments to the El Khadraoui report, in a fruitless effort to make our Commission colleagues aware of this point and others.
In an age when communications are crucial, and when communications by air afford previously unimagined travel opportunities, air transport agreements between nations are clearly necessary and desirable.
What is not clear, however, is why in this report - as in all other acts adopted by the European Union - we seem incapable of demanding reciprocity, which also means equivalent conditions of competition.
We ought to reason like citizens, especially we Members, given that ours is the only EU institution effectively endowed with a direct popular mandate.
Therefore, if Parliament wished to demonstrate an independent capacity to guide the other institutions' policies, it would have to demonstrate in its acts and its (albeit limited) codecisions that it is not easily swayed by non-European interests.
This is the case of Mr El Khadraoui's report today, which is otherwise excellent in many respects, and I should like to take this opportunity to thank him for his work.
As on so many other occasions, however, the report lacks the capacity to state clearly that, if there is to be free competition, there absolutely must be equal conditions for cabotage and compliance with social and environmental standards.
Nor does reciprocity apply with respect to safety or passengers' rights.
Moreover, the report recognises that the aviation sector has many negative effects which contribute to climate change.
I therefore fail to understand why my fellow Members did not support the amendment I tabled on the adverse impact of the compounds contained in aircraft vapour trails and the likelihood that these effects will increase with the growth of aviation, and hence calling for aviation to be included in the European emissions trading system.
Finally, as concerns the application of international social legislation, European and US carriers do not seem to me to be on an equal footing, and so there are no bilateral rights here either.
All of this, I believe, is sufficient to justify voting against the report.
(DE) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reject the points made by Mrs Lichtenberger and Mr Romagnoli in their statements.
Of course, there is no total reciprocity of rights, but compared with the previous situation, this is a balanced agreement, which is why we will be voting for it.
If you take the view that this is not a balanced agreement, then by all means vote against it, but we agree with the rapporteur that this is a balanced first step and we also agree that a second step must follow.
I of course support the rapporteur in his demand - as my colleague Mr Rack has said - that we should proceed to this second stage quickly.
We should, quite simply, make use of what has now been agreed.
I therefore urge the European airlines to utilise the new opportunities afforded to them by this agreement as regards their ownership and control rights, and to set up licensing operations and engage in branding policy and in part to participate in the US Government's programme.
They should not be waiting for the second stage; they should be using the first stage now, so that when we enter the second stage of the negotiations we can benefit from initial experience and identify the areas where there are still deficits as regards our European companies' rights in the US market.
We must also call on the Administration and our own Commission to capitalise on the opportunities afforded by this agreement and, for example, agree one-stop security on a more permanent basis.
This can be achieved through the Joint Committee and in cooperation with the Administration, and we can show citizens that this agreement is beneficial for them, especially if they do not have to undergo a second security check at airports.
My colleagues and I would like to thank the Commission for its good cooperation in this instance, but we must insist on similarly good cooperation in the second stage of the process.
I warn the Americans to adopt Mr Oberstar's motion, for if they want to undermine this agreement with all their unilateral amendments, we will react sharply.
Therefore, let us say to the Americans that we will gladly continue the talks between Congress and the European Parliament, but that they must not undermine the agreement with their biased interpretation.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his clear depiction of the situation and the position taken.
First, the positives, which have also been mentioned by the previous speaker.
With the open skies agreement between the US and Europe, we now finally have the opportunity to establish airline routes from the European Union via the United States to third countries such as Mexico and South America.
It also offers the opportunity for any carrier based in the European Union to fly from anywhere in the EU to anywhere in the US without any restrictions on capacity or prices, and I agree with the previous speaker: these opportunities must be utilised.
In the area of investment in US airline companies, too, progress has been achieved with this agreement.
The Open Skies Agreement thus takes the first important step towards an Open Aviation Area without any restrictions on either side.
It can thus create useful new air routes and a large number of new jobs.
On the other hand - as has already been said - it must be made clear that this is only the first step and cannot be regarded as a final agreement.
We expect the Commission, in a second stage, to negotiate unresolved issues such as cabotage, right of establishment, ownership and State aid with the US.
The potential for conflict has already been made very clear by the Commissioner, but I hope that the work in the transatlantic committee will make progress so that we ultimately have reciprocal rights which can be implemented and an Open Skies Agreement which is worthy of the name.
In parallel to this, the committee should push for the inclusion of flights from the US in emissions trading, for we know that we did not achieve very much at the ICAO meeting, as you have mentioned.
Of course, it should also give emphasis to our demand for one-stop security.
Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome and give the floor to Mr Georgiou, who is a new Member of the European Parliament.
- (EL) Madam President, during recent years I have observed a desperate attempt by Europeans to sign an air transport agreement with the United States.
Despite a great willingness on our part, I have also noted the reluctance of the Americans.
If they want to achieve a major agreement, we should alert Europeans to the fact that they should be ready to hand over a blank cheque.
These agreements, Madam President, do not, however, merely concern machines, interests and companies.
These agreements concern people - people who travel from Europe to the United States.
Some are Greeks, who are treated differently from other Europeans.
They have much to say about the hardships they undergo in order to obtain a US visa and about what they also put up with when they arrive, and they are subject to checks and searches as if they were potential terrorists.
You will obviously understand that this is stressful, at least for Greeks, who, in any case, are part of Europe.
Madam President, if these agreements signed between governments or parliaments do not touch the hearts and souls of the peoples and citizens of Europe, they will be exceptionally short-lived and completely unsuccessful.
I should like this to be included in our instructions when we again attempt to negotiate.
The agreements ought to be founded upon equality, probity and reciprocity.
Madam President, first of all I welcome the principle of the agreement.
The agreement between the United States and the EU will be, when it is finally negotiated, a major and historic development.
For EU airlines it means more transatlantic flights to the United States.
It is also good from the point of view of airline passengers, with more airlines, more competition and lower air fares.
We have already seen within Europe the positive impact that low fares airlines have on the aviation sector in terms of the huge increase in passenger numbers.
I pay tribute to the EU negotiators for successfully pursuing what are very difficult negotiations.
These are not yet concluded and are taking a lot of patience and diplomacy, but when this eventually happens the net outcome will hopefully have been worth waiting for.
I sincerely hope that the outstanding problems with the agreement can be overcome.
I agree with all the previous speakers with regard to the problems.
We have to dig in to ensure that this is a 50:50 agreement and that, at the end of the day, we fly the flag for Europe in terms of insisting that, whatever they look for, we look for too.
I believe that the restrictions by the United States authorities in relation to demanding personal details for security reasons are most unreasonable.
We have got to ensure in fact that this is not a deterrent to EU passengers going to the United States, because if we do not solve this particular problem it will be a major deterrent.
I am now going to be very parochial and provincial.
I have another problem, which is that the first international transatlantic airport in Ireland was Shannon airport.
It was the gateway to Europe for many a long day, but the mandatory stopover in Shannon will now go, under this agreement.
That will effectively undermine the viability of Shannon airport and have major consequences for the Mid-West region, which is a very disadvantaged region.
However, that is not a matter for Europe but for the Irish Government.
Again, at the end of the day, the EU badly needs an agreement and passengers need an agreement - but not at any price.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, I wish to thank all the Members who have spoken.
First and foremost, in reply to your rapporteur, Mr El Khadraoui, it can nevertheless be said that the first stage produced a balanced agreement.
A commitment was also obtained from the United States to negotiate the second stage.
There is even an obligation to commence negotiations within 60 days of provisional application.
The European side approved retaliatory measures.
It is possible to go back on certain concessions if the second stage does not meet European interests.
This is certainly quite an important point.
The Commission has already begun a debate with the Member States in relation to the special negotiation committee to define negotiation strategy for the second stage.
You insisted, as did Mr Jarzembowski, on the need to define a good negotiation strategy.
I obviously intend to involve you and Parliament to allow us to truly negotiate as effectively as possible.
What is true, as Mr Jarzembowski said, is that there are now opportunities for European businesses which must be snapped up.
This agreement provides a wider range of services and lower prices, it creates jobs, and has allowed us to establish coordination for measures that could affect passengers: problems relating to safety and security, and 'one stop security' in the long run, in addition to environmental issues, obviously.
I wish to answer Mrs Ludford by saying that the PNR is not part of the aviation agreement.
Any decisions or measures in relation to PNR must be compatible with the terms of the agreement.
The PNR issue, however, must be reviewed in context, and Mr Frattini is aware of your concerns on that score.
It is true you have placed much emphasis on the problem of security and it is true that this dialogue must genuinely form a part of the agreement's Joint Committee in order to produce solutions in a positive manner.
Both parties are working to obtain a high level of security that will not penalise air services or passengers.
Obviously in relation to this agreement the Transportation Security and Coordination Group must be able to produce specific responses to your concerns, and evidently I take due note.
I would also like to say that we do seem to have two problems here, which ought to produce some improvements and solutions: a security problem and an environmental problem.
In relation to the environmental problem, it is obvious we are keen to see an integrated global approach in order to take up the challenge of climate change. Also, as I said before and say again, at the ICAO Assembly in Montreal we all defended the emissions quotas exchange system together, a method that uses market instruments and would appear to be the most effective solution.
For the moment we have come up against a refusal by the United States and certain Asian nations.
Nevertheless, we feel that this does not prevent cooperation.
You know that in the CleanSky project, cooperation with the US is also making progress.
The Atlantic Interoperability Initiative to Reduce Emissions is a most interesting idea.
This involves new landing procedures that may help us improve the consequences of CO2 emissions.
I wish to say, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that obviously we must succeed during the second stage.
Substantial pressure and unwavering commitment are required from Europe to bring off this second stage, which is obviously much more important since it would certainly produce the open skies agreement.
Rest assured that Parliament will be closely involved in the negotiations, which will certainly be difficult but, as I said before, will commence in due course as we only signed the first part of the agreement because it had this second stage.
In any case, I wish to express my thanks to Parliament for what would appear to be wide-ranging solid support: we will need its support again to complete the agreement and succeed during the second stage.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Airport capacity and ground handling (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Jensen, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Airport capacity and ground handling: towards a more efficient policy.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the strain on Europe's airports is currently so great that even the smallest delay at one airport can mean considerable delays at others.
In addition, the continuing increase in air traffic will increase the problems at airports, and this will have adverse effects on effectiveness, competitiveness and the environment.
The capacity problems at Europe's airports are not only a national problem but also a European one, and consequently I welcome the Commission's action plan and 14-point plan as an initial step towards improving capacity at Europe's airports.
The Commission's proposals are insufficient, however, and so my report proposes that the Commission draw up, by 2009, a master plan for enhanced airport capacity in Europe.
Of course, it is ultimately the responsibility of Member States to build and expand airports.
The master plan is to be an instrument, or method, to ensure that Member States coordinate their initiatives to promote and expand airport capacity.
The problem needs to be examined from a cross-border angle.
Airports have different characteristics, different strengths, but interaction is important. This goes not only for interaction between airports, but also for interaction with other modes of transport and infrastructures surrounding airports ('co-modality').
I should like to thank both the Commission and the spokespeople of the other political groups - Mr El Khadraoui, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr LÃ³pez-IstÃºriz White and Mrs Lichtenberger - for their extremely constructive cooperation on this report, and I am pleased that Parliament is able to present a clear message showing widespread support in the matters of both capacity and liberalisation of the 'ground handling' Directive.
Of course, airports are both loved and loathed.
They create growth and prosperity, and provide a link between regions, but they also generate noise and pollution and take up space.
It is important, then, that problems be handled in a way appropriate to all parties concerned.
Firstly, we propose promoting environmentally friendly capacity expansion.
Airport congestion itself can have a negative impact on the environment if aeroplanes are left in a holding pattern, resulting in unnecessary CO2 emissions.
Consequently, I also welcome the Commission initiative to incorporate aviation into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.
I should like to emphasise, however, that it is important for us to have things implemented at global level, too.
Secondly, it is important for the Commission to follow up on countries' implementation of the common rules for the allocation of slots.
In this context, the report also requests that the Commission lay down a timeframe and deadlines in order to enhance cooperation between neighbouring Member States as regards the building of functional airspace blocks (FABs).
There must be substantial improvements in this area by 2008 - this is a high priority for Parliament.
Thirdly, it is a pipe dream to imagine there can be any expansion of an airport's capacity without thorough involvement of and cooperation with regional and local administrations.
It is important, therefore, to establish a dialogue among those European regions with an airport on coordination of capacity expansion.
The regions can exchange experiences and learn from one another (What environmental impact does the airport have on the neighbouring population?
What are the spatial development plans?
What significance does an airport have in general for growth and employment in the area?) and perhaps develop good practice from this.
I hope the Council will support the basic ideas in this report, namely that the Commission's action plan is insufficient, that guidelines must be developed for optimising and developing airport capacity, that additional capacity is nevertheless required, and that words must be accompanied by action.
The second part of my report concerns ground handling - that is, all the handling surrounding the aeroplane and in the airport, from fuelling and baggage handling to the check-in procedure.
Here, the Commission is preparing for a revision of the existing Directive on access to the groundhandling market at Community airports, which, as we know, is a thorny issue.
I should like to reiterate my thanks to the spokespeople for the constructive cooperation we enjoyed.
We agree that the Commission should carry out an updated analysis of the implementation and impact of the current 'ground handling' Directive before we put any new liberalisation on the agenda.
We must have a full overview of the impact on users, passengers and staff, and a future directive must ensure quality in ground handling and decent working conditions for staff.
We must ensure that there are no monopolistic conditions and that there are clear rules for calls for tender in order to involve users.
I hope that this report will inspire the Commission to proceed with both the 'ground handling' Directive and the 14-point plan.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Mrs Jensen, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Thank you for supporting the Commission's action plan and for your commitment to Community air transport policy.
One of the challenges of aviation policy is to prevent congestion at European airports.
Our action plan focuses on developing a coherent global airport policy.
It involves optimising the output of existing airport capacities, and improving the planning of new infrastructure by avoiding juxtaposition of purely local solutions and the formation of bottlenecks.
As the EP understands only too well, optimum functioning of the European airport network can only be guaranteed if local actions form part of a coherent global policy.
The course of action proposed by the Commission is meant to be realistic, since it considers the economic and environmental constraints that must be taken into account.
That is why, Mrs Jensen, priority is initially given to better use of existing airport capacities, thanks to development and harmonised implementation of new technology.
It is patently obvious, if we obtain a Single Sky with functional air traffic control blocks, that we will be able to use the existing infrastructure much better.
It is true that building new infrastructure will cause even more problems, especially in large urban areas with a heavy demand for air transport.
Our action plan, however, deals with the problem of creating new infrastructure, which is frequently essential, and we wish to plan the new infrastructure for a better appreciation of its utility and location in order to make it more environmentally-friendly.
On 2 October the Committee on Transport and Tourism adopted conclusions, Madam President, that are less ambitious than the conclusions of Parliament.
A large number of the Member States, perhaps too prone to listen to those in charge of their own airports, are loath to take up Community coordination and prefer to continue giving priority to local solutions implemented at each airport.
This kind of reluctance makes it more difficult to implement the action plan, but EP support will allow the Commission to work specifically towards initiatives on the basis of Mrs Jensen's contributions here.
I thank her, and I also wish to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism for the quality of its work and for helping us move forward on this issue, which is so important in terms of the harmonious sustainable development of the entire air transport sector.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - Madam President, advances in the aviation industry have contributed massively to economic progress and general well-being, and they can continue to do so.
This industry does not deserve the environmentalist hostility which is often heaped upon it.
This attitude is also politically unwise, as all our constituents benefit enormously in both their work and their leisure.
Aviation has done much to meet its environmental obligations by developing and adopting new technology and improving operational efficiencies.
It rests with the political authorities and the administrative and regulatory authorities to play their part in permitting and enthusiastically encouraging continuing improvement.
Ms Jensen's excellent report incorporates much of what my committee proposed.
But there are three matters which the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs put forward in its opinion and which did not find their way into the final report.
Firstly, with the advent of quieter aircraft, it should be possible to relax limitations on airport opening times and move towards 24-hour operation almost everywhere.
This would greatly enhance capital and capacity utilisation of airport infrastructures and of the aircraft themselves, facilitating better productivity and cheaper services with less than proportionate environmental impact.
Secondly, the selection of efficient ground handlers can also enhance productivity by improving utilisation of airport infrastructure, notably where they speed up aircraft turnarounds and contribute to good timekeeping and passenger satisfaction.
Thirdly, we advocated applying market forces by the open auctioning of airport slots, moving away from grandfather rights while retaining a defined proportion of slots at hub airports for those vital regional feeder services.
Those bodies responsible for providing the environment in which airlines operate must facilitate greater productivity by providing adequate and efficient infrastructure and imposing only appropriate regulatory conditions.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many of you will have flown here to Brussels via my home airport, Frankfurt am Main.
Rapid handling is a key factor in the quality of ground services, which are responsible for loading and unloading, cleaning and refuelling of aircraft, and easing passengers through the system.
However, these work processes must fit together seamlessly.
In order for good professional standards to be maintained at all Europe's airports, the European Parliament adopted a decision back in 1996 to the effect that besides the airport operators, only those service providers which could operate efficiently on a lasting basis would be licensed to work in airports.
However, the number of these service providers is limited.
Then, as now, I was the draftsman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and was able to prevent unlimited liberalisation of these services.
While fully appreciating the need for competition, this can only be accepted if it is fair and is not to the detriment of the workers or security.
Not every supplier can guarantee the requisite high level of training, appropriate wage levels or good service.
Tough competition on prices means that more and more permanent jobs are being replaced by poor-quality temporary and agency contracts.
I would like to express my thanks to Anne Jensen.
My Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and your Committee on Transport and Tourism have joined forces and called on the Commission to ensure that, first and foremost, the 1996 Directive is implemented properly in all EU Member States.
The data we have been given are out of date. They only report on experience in 15 Member States.
We want a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of liberalisation, both for workers and for passengers.
Ground handling services make a key contribution to aviation safety and security.
Sensitive infrastructures like the European hub in Frankfurt am Main and elsewhere are completely unsuitable as a playground for those individuals who compulsively champion the cause of harmonisation in Europe.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I should like to congratulate Mrs Jensen on her excellent work.
Technical and organisational issues are very important in relation to airport capacity.
A holistic approach to the issue should be adopted, however, with reference also to the local and regional environment of airports.
Air transport has helped to improve territorial, economic and social cohesion, especially in the case of areas far from the centres.
The existence of such links is often decisive when it comes to placing investments and receiving tourists.
In a nutshell, these links are vital to a region's development.
Airports are also important in terms of job creation.
The Member States, regional and local authorities must ensure that airports, regardless of their governing bodies, are included in regional spatial planning plans and national development strategies.
There should also be coordination at European network level.
Airport location should be determined not so much by the ambitions of the authorities involved as by the logic of each situation.
There are cases within the Union where fairly large conurbations located less than 100 kilometres apart each have separate airports.
It would be sensible for a single airport to serve both towns.
The location of airports should be chosen to enable them to serve neighbouring and border regions.
Where possible, intermodal solutions should be put in place, because fast rail connections between airports significantly increase their capacity.
It is of course also essential to provide good transport links between airports and city centres in their hinterland.
The maintenance and extension of existing airports and the construction of new ones must be subject to the relevant territorial impact assessment.
This is particularly necessary in connection with the natural environment, in terms of noise, emission of pollutants, road traffic density in the vicinity of the airport, the proximity of fuel tanks, and also in relation to meteorological factors.
Finally, I should like to say on the basis of my own experience and my constituents' statements, that issues relating to airport capacity involve much more than technical matters, air traffic control systems and coordinating take-offs and landings.
The organisation of the tasks concerned is also relevant, and all too often it is very poor indeed.
Personal checks on passengers are one example.
Mr Mann referred to Frankfurt airport, where passengers are checked twice, whereas once might be sufficient.
A good deal of time is wasted at baggage collection too.
Even in the case of reputable airlines, delays are constantly being experienced supposedly for technical reasons.
Perhaps the real reason is plain incompetence?
It is not unusual for passengers at an airport to feel they are unwelcome and a nuisance.
They are given the impression that they are simply getting in the way of the staff and upsetting working arrangements by their presence.
People need and want to fly, however, the disabled included.
Air transport services offered by carriers and airports should be provided safely and punctually.
Passengers should be treated with respect at all times.
Both sides would then be happy.
The Commissioner's statement gives me reason to hope that this will one day be the case.
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have only one point to make in this debate, and that is in regard to the Commission proposal on radio identification tagging.
The original proposal to tag both passengers' baggage and the boarding pass of each passenger to me poses a significant breach, or potential breach, of civil liberties.
I can see little benefit in being able to tag passengers' movement around airport terminals and would also call into question how much it would cost for airports to implement such measures.
There are clear benefits in being able to quickly identify where certain pieces of baggage or luggage are at any point in time with radio frequency identifiers, and this is where I draw the line.
My amendment to restrict the tagging of baggage, which was adopted in both the Civil Liberties Committee and the Committee on Transport, to me strikes the right balance between being able to reduce delays to flights and to respect the personal freedoms of passengers as they circulate through airports and terminal buildings.
With this in mind, I can therefore fully support the text before us today.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I believe that we should be pleased with the agreement reached in this report.
It is clearly a balanced report, which is the result of consensus and an in-depth examination of the matter.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Anne Jensen, in particular on her willingness to engage in dialogue and consensus when drawing up this report.
Later today the European Parliament is going to vote on a report that clearly demonstrates its support for the Commission with a view to alleviating the problem of airport capacity crunch.
As the Commission itself warns - and Vice-President Jacques Barrot has said the same - this poses a threat to the efficiency, security and competitiveness of all those involved in the air transport sector.
According to the statistics, by the year 2025 there could be nearly 4 million extra flights per year and, as a result, more than 60 European airports will be at full capacity.
From the first contacts in relation to the preparation of this report, it was important to bear in mind that, as we know, the European Commission is not responsible for competition in relation to airports and unfortunately it cannot, therefore, require the Member States to take a series of measures on airport capacity.
However, the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, together with the Commission, understand that it is vital to implement a master plan for air traffic management and to propose to the Member State measures that are needed to optimise the capacity of European airports, thereby minimising the problems created by a capacity crunch.
The report proposes measures including: improving the use of ground handling services; promoting 'co-modality'; improving operational planning; optimising departure sequences; and above all, in relation to the famous slots, ensuring coherence between slots and flight plans. With that in mind, we have supported the creation of the European Air Capacity Observatory under the auspices of the Commission.
I sincerely hope that this proposal moves forward.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Jensen. I am not doing this just as a matter of form but in all sincerity.
She has produced an excellent and extremely balanced report.
It is clear that both of the topics it had to tackle are extremely important and will demand a great deal of follow-up work on the part of the Commission.
With regard to airport capacity, it is clear that we need a global outlook.
The spectacular growth will create problems, which is obvious now already, and they cannot be solved simply by building new airports here and there.
In the areas where they are most needed, that will be very difficult or even impossible because of population density and opposition from local residents.
The first thing, therefore, is to make optimum use of the capacity we have now.
There are many ways to do that but an integrated approach is absolutely essential.
A multi-track policy is needed in which we join forces at all levels.
It concerns infrastructure, such as connections to high speed rail lines, good links between cities and airports.
It concerns technology.
You have already referred to CESAR, to functional airspace blocks, to the unified air space, as well as to quieter aircraft that will enable local residents to tolerate more flights. It is not simple.
However, taking all these measures together they are extremely significant Meanwhile an important step forward is the idea of mapping everything out and producing a master plan for airport capacity by 2009.
We are counting on the Commission to do this.
With regard to ground handling, the evaluation of the first steps toward liberalisation, which have been underway for many years now, is not entirely positive.
It is clear that prices have fallen and that airlines have benefited from that.
On the other hand, the effects on the employees have clearly been problematic.
Trade unions throughout Europe complain about lower wages, poorer working conditions and reduced job security.
You know that there is a public call for tenders every seven years: the ground handling companies can be replaced by others, but the personnel have no guarantees that they will be taken on.
Trade unions report to us that wages have fallen by an average of 20%.
The number of accidents at work is also reported to have increased.
These are matters that we really do need to examine more closely.
Consequently, it seems to me that we need a new study, not only to give us more recent figures to work with, but also to look at the number and quality of jobs.
In short, Commissioner, these are two fascinating issues that we will certainly want to return to many times in the near future and I think that this report is a good basis for future subsequent.
Firstly, I would like to thank the speaker for his cooperation and for keeping his ears open to various proposals.
In my speech I would like to present my thoughts on the 'ground handling' Directive.
I am concerned because interested states blocked the reconsideration of the Directive a few years ago when the Commission even had a new draft proposal drawn up.
The concern raised by market participants and the content of the improvements proposed today demonstrate the need to revise the Directive as soon as possible.
Moreover, we cannot forget that after 2004 the EU aviation market was supplemented by the particularities of the new Member States which, unfortunately, have not been evaluated in the Commission's document this time.
I would like to concentrate on some specific remarks.
The aim of the Directive now in force is to regulate the competitive conditions for third-party handlers and self-handling companies.
However, it is necessary to consider that a state monopoly of all ground handling services existed in the post-Soviet states until recent times.
Therefore, independent service providers inevitably appear when market conditions start functioning.
Airports controlling and using the infrastructure belonging to them at the same time continue their activities, providing the same services for airlines, and thus compete with their tenants.
Mostly, such competition infringes on the principles of equality of rights and transparency owing to objectively emerging conflicts of interest.
Conflicts also deepen because the Airport Users Committee does not establish areas for ground handling service providers.
To protect the principle of impartiality it is necessary to expand the rights of airport users: an airport should choose a provider that would meet not the expectations of the airport administration but those of the users, i.e., the airlines.
The increasing cost of equipment that meets safety requirements increases the amount of investment that is necessary.
However, the seven-year period for choosing providers has forced service providers to recoup the increasing investment sooner, often economising on staff working conditions and payments.
Therefore, I think it is necessary to extend the period for choosing ground handling service providers.
I encourage the Commission to present a draft revised directive, considering the European Parliament's proposals, as soon as possible (during this term of office) and thus save time on repeated improvements in the future.
Mr President, the Jensen report is a sound and thorough overview of the issues related to airport capacity and ground handling.
The dramatic increase in air traffic in Member States of the European Union necessitates the construction of new airports and the extension and modernisation of existing ones.
Mrs Jensen rightly points out that the choice of location for the construction of an airport involves difficult decisions in view of the area required and the need to comply with a range of technical, organisational and social conditions - such as the consent of local authorities and populations - as well as requirements regarding safety and environmental protection.
That is why the construction of large and medium-sized airports should be planned well in advance and included in the overall plan for the development of air transport within the Union.
The construction of airports of this nature is a very expensive investment.
Union support will be required in many cases.
It would appear that the accepted estimates for passenger air transport have not taken account of high-speed rail links.
For journeys of up to 500 kilometres, the latter are a very attractive option for passengers in terms of both fares and journey times.
The Brussels-Paris link is a good example.
It provides a direct connection between the city centres, enabling passengers to avoid additional journeys and all the checks related to air travel.
Taxes and aviation fuel surcharges resulting in price increases are also likely to have a bearing on the estimates.
It is important for the sector and for passengers to fully exploit the latent possibilities involving better and more efficient flight management and ground handling.
As we know from our own experience, the quality of airport services and carriers varies a great deal.
Certain minimum standards should be guaranteed and regulated for under Union provisions.
A good way to improve the quality of services would be for the Union's institutions to take the initiative and facilitate the exchange of best practice between airports.
The report and opinions constitute a very necessary document.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report draws attention to some of the problems, notably congestion, which we, as people who have to fly fairly frequently, very often experience but which naturally affect aviation as a whole, not just business flights but holiday flights as well.
I would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for attempting to reconcile two positions which emerged in the committee on this issue.
On the one hand, there was unfettered euphoria about the prospect of growth, which appeared to rely solely on building new airports to relieve the old ones; on the other hand, there was the concern about organisational aspects and, of course, the issue of responsibility for the protection of both the environment and local residents.
We face a situation in which the quality of life of people living around major airports or, indeed, poorly situated regional airports is severely impaired.
Here, too, we have a responsibility.
We cannot simply deal with this issue in terms of new growth prospects.
It is a question of organisation.
The system of hubs and slots which currently exists in European aviation is not as good as it could be.
We have such large hubs in some areas that the ensuing complexity of connecting flights means that one small mistake can potentially have massive consequences, not just for one airport but for the airspace as a whole.
That problem needs to be solved and the report makes some important suggestions here.
However, these solutions must not be implemented at the expense of passengers and especially not at the expense of the workers providing airport services, because they too have a right to quality of life.
Mr President, the aviation sector has been in the spotlight in the last few months.
The proposals to include the sector in the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, the agreement with the United States and the reform of landing rights are a few examples.
Mrs Jensen's report adds a new dimension to that list: the organisation of aviation on the ground.
It addresses the services being provided, but also noise and available capacity.
As far as ground handling services are concerned, we will indeed have to wait for a new evaluation by the Commission in which all Member States are included.
I concur with the suggestions to the Commission for points which need looking at in the future.
I am a bit more critical about the sections dealing with capacity.
The text urges the Commission to take major action.
The master plan is intended to be the key to tackling the aviation capacity problem on the ground.
A master plan does indeed offer a good overview of the current situation and can indicate problem areas.
However, it does not seem to me desirable that the Commission, with such a plan in hand, should force the Member States to take certain steps or indeed stand in their way.
The main purpose of a master plan is to promote international cooperation between all parties concerned, so that integrated solutions can be found for specific problem areas through good consultations and with respect for existing authorities.
I am pleased that some sections contain sensible comments on this.
My conclusion, Mr President, is therefore that I am able to support Mrs Jensen's report. I very much enjoyed working with her.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to the issue of airport capacity, we have to distinguish between two issues.
We want to mitigate the negative effects of aviation, which is why we agree on emissions trading for the aviation industry.
We may not agree about the methodology or timescales involved, Mrs Lichtenberger, but in principle, we agree that the aviation sector should make its contribution to mitigating environmental impacts.
However, we must also have the courage, Mrs Lichtenberger, to say that for economic reasons we need growth in the aviation sector, both internally and in respect of third countries.
When it comes to the economy, jobs and citizens' mobility, adequate airport capacity is essential, and it is essential for environmental reasons as well, by the way.
If the aircraft did not have to spend so long on the ground waiting for takeoff and did not have to spend so long stacking overhead before landing, just imagine what this would do to help the environment!
We have to recognise the fact that we need to develop our airports.
Mr Blokland is quite right: we do not want to take responsibility away from the Member States or regions, but in our experience there have been difficulties with airport expansion in many parts of Europe.
That is why our approach is right: we are requesting the Commission to put forward a coherent proposal on how we can have a European master plan and how we can introduce best practice so that we can all learn from each other and pursue this expansion effectively.
My second point relates to ground handling services.
I think we should wait for the new impact analysis.
I think that the basic Directive was very successful as the efficiency of ground handling services has been improved in recent years and the costs for passengers have been reduced.
As to whether we need further changes, that is an open question.
I would not wish to decide conclusively today.
I think we should wait for the outcome of the Commission's analysis, which is expected this winter, and only then should we decide whether or not there is a need for revision.
We should not rush into any decisions today.
(ES) Mr President, I would to begin by congratulating Mrs Jensen on her excellent report.
I believe that it will be very useful in terms of improving the Commission's proposals and improving airports, where European citizens are increasingly obliged to 'camp out'; of course airports are almost like a second home to Members of the European Parliament.
I would also like to congratulate, in particular, Mr Barrot and his services for this procedure to push forward the preparation of the legislation.
Normally, and increasingly because of its complexity, this legislation gives rise to conflict and can raise suspicions, and has come to be known as the 'vague method'.
In other words, it is good to hold very rigorous broad consultations to identify the strong points and the obstacles to be removed while making the most of all the good ideas available.
Mrs Jensen's report is full of such good ideas.
In particular, I welcome the strong cooperation of, and mandate given to, Eurocontrol in the preparation of the new measures.
It is important to do away with any hint of confrontation between the few bodies responsible for the organisation of air transport.
I also believe that it is extremely important to strengthen all the intelligence systems in this area, starting with the CESAR traffic management system, that are going to help us not only to improve traffic but also, as far as possible, to reduce its environmental impact.
I am very hopeful, too, that this future action plan will help to give a considerable boost to the Galileo system.
In addition, I am very interested in the role that territorial cohesion is playing through regional airports, although I understand - and share - the reservations concerning the large-scale creation of local airports that are not sufficiently efficient or feasible.
It is thus necessary, too, to ensure that we manage future conflicts with neighbours over noise, pollution, even spatial use, and I think that in this regard it would be very interesting to be able to assess the new demands: the types of shuttles, private jets, open-air leisure aspects, etc.
Moreover, I support the proposals to strengthen social standards in the area of ground handling services, because subcontracting, which is increasingly used in this sector, does not always ensure sufficient protection of this social standards.
I also welcome Mrs Jensen's proposal to ensure that users are consulted so that competition in the area of ground handling is truly effective.
Of course, we support, too, the creation of the Airport Capacity Observatory because we believe that with the Commission's support it will be a positive tool for the future.
In conclusion, I would simply like the Commission to include in its future work the logistical aspect and relations with cargo aviation, which is becoming increasingly popular and is a possible alternative in terms of the 'co-modality' suggested by the revision of the White Paper.
Mr President, this report makes good sense in saying that there should be an overall EU approach as regards the need for extra airport capacity.
This might mean that there would be seen to be less justification for all airports which see themselves as major hubs to expand.
If you look at Paris Charles De Gaulle, Schiphol, Frankfurt and London Heathrow all together, the conclusion might be, for instance, that there was no justification for a third runway at Heathrow.
I would not, though, want the report's call for a master plan for enhanced airport capacity to be misunderstood as Brussels muscling in and telling national, regional and local authorities where to build new airports; obviously, it just means pooling information and objectives.
Subsidiarity rules on any decisions whether or not to expand airports.
But there is a second danger of misunderstanding. The report cites forecasts of demand increasing by around 5% a year and says that, in 2025, the demand for flights would be two and a half times higher than 2003.
This, I am sure, should not be taken as succumbing to the discredited 'predict and provide' policy.
I am not sure that the call in the report to accompany the growth of air transport by measures limiting its external cost is quite enough, because we know there is a lot we can and must do to at least moderate aviation growth to a sustainable level - whether through emissions trading, proper and fair taxation, building high-speed rail alternatives and so on - in order to combat global warming and safeguard against the dangers of air pollution and noise nuisance.
I was surprised to see that there was no opinion from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, so I am sure - and I hope - that the risk of lack of consistency between this report and the resolution last year on reducing the climate change impact of aviation will be avoided.
This report must be seen in the light of that resolution, and not in any way - and I am sure it is not the intention, at least of the rapporteur - giving comfort to this idea that you simply build airports based on predictions, many of them from airlines, about increased demand, without all the other measures that we know we need to take to have sustainable aviation.
(SV) The report on airport capacity and ground handling is an own-initiative report with high-flying plans as regards central planning on the part of the EU.
We therefore have to ask what kind of society we want: a market economy or a planned economy?
According to the report, Europe is facing a substantial increase in airport use and there is a need to optimise existing resources.
The European Parliament considers, however, that the Commission has not yet fully investigated the possibility of a global approach as regards the need for extra capacity.
There is mention of planning future investments and setting strategic axes.
It is thought that it is possible to anticipate the risks of a capacity crunch.
The European Parliament urges the Commission to take a top-down approach.
If no significant progress has been made by Member States on this issue by 2008, measures must be taken and so on.
I do not believe in this global approach in principle.
I think that such centrally planned projects are doomed to failure.
In the vast majority of cases there is national competition between countries to meet air transport demand.
Some countries will fare well, other countries will do badly.
The countries that are successful will attract tourism and business.
Let the countries stand up to one another.
I also know from my own experience that in many countries private investors are building airport capacity and they are guided by investment decisions that are completely different from those taken by state bodies. In some cases decisions are also taken regionally.
It is impossible to coordinate these three types of decision, private, public and regional.
We should therefore allow developments to take their course and only regulate what it absolutely necessary, namely the air transport management needed in order to achieve organised air transport systems in the EU.
My experience is that the costs of expanded airport capacity almost never tally.
Costs are often three to four times higher than estimated and projects take twice as long as originally envisaged.
Technical developments are also a factor of uncertainty.
Demand is shifting quickly.
Suddenly entirely new regions want transport.
Suddenly we want new technology with high-speed railways which perhaps make air transport connections less interesting.
So let us not believe in a global approach.
I do not think that we should return to the kind of central planning that existed in the former socialist countries.
I will not therefore be supporting this motion.
(RO) I also want to congratulate Mrs. Jenzan for this report.
Europe needs economic development and, obviously, air transport development.
This is why I believe that the European programmes, such as Caesar and Clear Sky, will bring important contributions to the development of the European air sector.
In the first eleven months of last year alone, 225 new routes were developed, which actually means 1800 new flights every week.
Therefore, air transport has developed and the development of new airport capacities is required.
Unfortunately, big airports are crowded, there are very many flight delays, there is waiting time either on ground or in the air, which, on the one hand, contributes to pollution and, on the other hand, has certain social effects.
Nevertheless, we should not forget that the development of airport infrastructures requires a lot of time, between 5 and 10 years, and substantial investments.
This is why I believe it is important for the Member States - and I also refer to the new Member States - to be assisted in using the structural funds, the regional development funds for developing new airports.
Also, a framework plan for new airport capacities in Europe should be approached, at least simultaneously with or, if not, after the development of an action plan regarding the appropriate and efficient management of the existing airport capacities.
The approach of the need for additional airport capacities in Europe should be part of a strategy for the development of the passenger and goods air transport, not only in a European and continental context, but also an a larger scale.
Also, directives and regulations regarding airports should remain within the standards established and accepted by Annex No. 14 of the Chicago Convention.
If the Commission has proposals to improve such standards, it should present and support them in ICAO as well.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President, and I would like to congratulate you on your award.
Air transport is developing spectacularly, and traffic has trebled over the last 20 years.
This trend can be expected to continue, and this makes it urgent to optimise the capacity of European airports.
The strategy for the capacity, efficiency and security of European airports prioritises the optimised use and development of current capacity, aid for combined transport and reducing the environmental burden.
The recommendation is a complex one that requires a pragmatic attitude and dialogue by the relevant professional parties and authorities.
It may be a milestone in the formulation of a standardised European regulatory framework.
In harmony with the Lisbon Strategy, European airports play an important role in maintaining the economic and social competitiveness of the Community, in regional development, and now, in contrast with previous experience, they will be able to apply standardised rules in Europe.
When optimising capacity, it is important to pay attention to airport facilities, vehicles that transport passengers and ensuring that disabled people can approach aircraft, since this is the only way to ensure equality in air transport.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Thank you, Mr President.
Obviously I have listened very carefully to everything that has been said.
I would first like to thank Mrs Jensen sincerely for her report; I see that it has earned a great deal of support from the House.
Mrs Jensen, we will use your observations, which I found extremely interesting, to best advantage.
I wish to add that, as a number of speakers said, air transport is developing at a rapid pace, and even though in certain cases high-speed rail transport may take up part of the market share, air transport is a means of travel that will continue to evolve in years to come: I think that this is certainly the case.
We must, then, go along with this development in air transport, and actually increasingly adapt it to the needs and wishes of users.
I would also say that in the main the entire problem of better adaptation of airport infrastructures to our needs depends on three issues.
The first issue is obviously the infrastructure.
Evidently, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot let it be said that the solution is to centralise.
It is not a matter of centralising, but rather of coordinating and exchanging good practices.
I think all this is essential for all our citizens, and so we must make an attempt to optimise use of existing infrastructures before we can think of new investment.
What we need is better coordination and, Mr President, I wish to thank the various committees that delivered an opinion on this matter: the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Committee on Regional Development, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I feel that all of their contributions shed some much-needed light on the report.
The first issue, then, is infrastructure.
The second, as Mrs Ayala rightly stressed, is the use of satellite navigation technology, the modernisation of air traffic control, and this is essential.
If we have functional groups for air traffic control, we will actually have a chance of reducing delays and planes going round and round in the sky unable to land.
This second issue is extremely important.
The third concerns ground handling services, which must be effective and productive.
On the basis of these three issues, we must try to optimise the facilities connected with air transport, which is a rapidly developing sector.
I intend to answer a few questions, Mr President, and I do apologise for not answering them all.
I wish to reply to Mr Bradbourn's question on data.
