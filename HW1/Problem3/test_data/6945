There is enormous potential for growth in the reduction of obstacles to the provision of services across borders.
If we want to put Europe on course for growth and combat mass unemployment, this is where we have to start.
In this debate, let me add, those rabble-rousers who know nothing except how to stoke peopleâs fears have had a free run for far too long, and I am at present primarily referring to the unholy alliance that has been forged this week in Westphalia, on the other bank of the Rhine.
President Chirac and Chancellor Schroeder are waging a campaign of half-truths and falsehoods that play on peopleâs fears, and so let me make it quite plain that it is a particularly good thing that the Commission has at last fought back against such polemics.
I would like to congratulate Commissioner McCreevy on his passionate appeal yesterday.
Let us muster the courage to fight mass unemployment.
I also believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell Mr Lehne, as he made explicit reference to it, that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not find this text an easy one to deal with.
He will recall that we, as part of our coordination on Lisbon, introduced many amendments into the debate, but, on the points where we thought it necessary to make the text more concrete, we did not hesitate to list what we saw as its potential breaking points.
Let me remind you that, when we in the steering committee began to debate this text, we agreed that it would profit us nothing to have only general agreement, but that this House would have to make of the Lisbon process something more concrete.
That is still the Group of the Greensâ position.
For example, we do believe that an agreement on the freedom to provide services in the European Union is really necessary.
If I may be frank, the impression I get is that the Bolkestein directive basically refers to the realities in the old European Union and that it fails to address the great challenges in terms of social convergence, including that of preventing social dumping, that await us following the creation of the larger European Union that we now have.
For that reason, I take Chancellor Schroederâs, and President Chiracâs, statements seriously.
I believe that this directive must be withdrawn, and that the Socialists in this House will support our amendment.
If, for example, you do not want the Poles, Czechs and Slovaks to be disappointed in their hopes that this Europe would actually bring them social progress, or if you do not want Europe to be associated, in the West, only with social decline, then you cannot vote in favour of the Bolkestein directive as it stands.
For us, that is a breaking point in this text.
We would have expected this House to come to an agreement on it.
Concerning myself as I do with environmental and energy policy, I was delighted to see that many general blocks of text on sustainability have been incorporated into the draft that we are to vote on today.
I do, though, refuse to accept that these blocks of text are fit only for pious platitudes on Lisbon and that everything will be forgotten again when, for example, we vote in the Committee on Agriculture on such things as REACH, the research Framework Programme or genetically modified organisms.
I therefore believe that the Greensâ rejection is well founded, and we will continue, in the months to come, to debate with you on the future of social justice, a proper approach to the environment, and innovations, with reference to the actual projects concerned.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, where the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the conclusions to be drawn from it are concerned, the difference between the majority in this House and the group to which I belong is that the former, in principle, wants to carry on down the road we have already taken, that of supply-oriented economic policy with increased competition, whilst we say that that road is the wrong one.
We, in this House, do indeed agree on what the Lisbon strategyâs goals are, but we have quite different views as to the ways by which to reach them.
The main task is to create jobs, and that is something I can do only if demand for products increases and business is obliged to invest in expansion and thereby meet the increased need.
The facts ought to prompt even those whose economic thinking is of the most neoliberal kind to accept that, in the absence of demand, cutting taxes does nothing to create new jobs, but that, on the contrary, either the consequent rationalisation wipes them out or the increase in revenue is not reinvested, or alternatively, it finds its way, via taxation, into the stateâs budget.
The Lisbon strategy must not be about competing for the biggest returns, but rather competing for highly skilled jobs, excellence in education and training, product quality, high environmental standards and a high level of consumer protection.
That also means that the lower income groups â who, contrary to what is often asserted, are not saving more than they used to â must either have their wages increased or their taxes cut, all the more so as there is sufficient political room for manoeuvre, productivity having risen much faster than pay over recent years.
I might add that this is also reflected in the favourable foreign trade balance enjoyed by most of the European Unionâs Member States, who, despite high social transfers, were able to offer products acceptable in global markets.
Low-paid and part-time jobs do nothing to help do away with the scourge of unemployment.
If we want to become the worldâs strongest economic region by 2010, we must devote our attention primarily to welfare and the environment in the European Union, for that is the best way in which we can promote our economy.
Â Â  Mr President, the forthcoming spring summit is being overshadowed by what the referendums on the European Constitution might bring in the coming months.
That is detrimental to good decision-making on economic reforms.
Alongside this, decision-making at the coming summit is also fed by the fear that the welfare state might be affected.
That much has become clear since the autumn summit when Mr Kokâs report was discussed here.
I would, however, like to urge you to take a different look at economic reforms.
Is it socially acceptable for people at 58 to be taken out of the labour market?
Is it socially acceptable to saddle young people today with the burden of our system that has become unaffordable, while they themselves will never be able to enjoy the benefits?
I would therefore call on the Commission, together with the Member States, to work on the necessary structural reforms.
Growth is needed to maintain Europeâs social model, which, at the same time, needs to be reformed.
Whoever claims today that structural reforms are unnecessary is a dangerous demagogue.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we support MrÂ Barrosoâs initiative, and we are delighted that the Commission is taking steps to achieve the Lisbon goals in full.
We find it incomprehensible that MrÂ Barroso has been criticised over the Lisbon strategy, as after all it is not the European Commissionâs fault that the Lisbon strategy has not yet been implemented.
It is the Member States who are to blame for the fact that the Lisbon strategy continues to be a paper construct rather than a feature of Europeâs real economic life, as it is they who lacked the courage to reform the European Unionâs economies.
I come from a country in which for over 45Â years attempts were made to cast a verbal spell over the economy.
This is an impossible task, as what economies need is concrete action.
It is precisely because the European Commission is in favour of such action that we will support it.
I should like to make it very clear at this point that there is little chance of our commitments under the Lisbon strategy being honoured, or of real growth being achieved in Europe, if the Member States lack the necessary courage.
This is the very courage they also lack when it comes to the services directive that is currently under debate.
The prerequisites for growth in Europe are lower taxes, less regulation and more economic freedom.
Reality is knocking at our door, and Europe is not alone in the world.
We are all fully aware that Asia is experiencing very rapid growth, and that the United States is also experiencing growth.
Sooner or later, this economic reality will come knocking at our door.
We would therefore like to wish you courage and success, MrÂ President, in achieving the Lisbon goals.
Â Â  Mr Verheugen, it is important today, when we want to evaluate the progress of the Lisbon Strategy in mid-term, that we do not look for ready formulas, but that, above all, we identify possible failures.
First and foremost, cooperation between institutions has failed.
The European Council determined the objectives, whose fulfilment it had only to coordinate and facilitate, because in the majority of cases these objectives are subject to the national states within the framework of subsidiarity.
I therefore call upon the national states and, the citizens of these states directly, to assume an increased responsibility in adopting the ideas of the Lisbon Strategy.
The European Union would have to provide continuous monitoring and more consistently ensure the role of a flexible and effective centre, as it has, for example, in the verification and fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria.
Individual Member States have not undergone the social reforms required to resolve the issue of social inclusion.
The issue of securing greater job opportunities: the fulfilment of this objective requires an increased mobility of the work force.
But here we lag behind in the recognition of qualifications and skills, and particularly in the streamlining of this procedure.
The movement of the work force appears to be in an East-West direction, mainly the highly sophisticated work force, which intensifies the differences in the less developed regions even more.
The ageing of the population: the national states have failed to pay attention to this phenomenon and, through their social reforms, have not managed to ensure the social inclusion of these citizens, that is, an entire generation.
The main problem here is the qualitative replacement of this economically serious loss.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as you know, in order to succeed one must first learn the lessons of previous failures.
The Lisbon Strategy launched in 2000 has not brought the progress we hoped for.
We find that growth is stagnant and insufficient jobs have been created.
The first reason seems obvious: the strategy was too confused, too fragmented and looked like a battle plan without an army.
Even now, most people do not know what it is about.
Europe must therefore leverage on its ability to create added value while preserving its social model; the way to do this is through priority action plans with precise timetables.
We know that in terms of conventional competitiveness our companies are no longer a match for countries like China or India.
Our advantages are innovation, the quality of our training, our environment and making the most of our know-how.
Our trump card is eco-innovation and cutting-edge technologies that meet a demand for very high added-value products that our competitors are unable to satisfy.
The EU must also avoid shooting itself in the foot by always stifling its economy, faced as it is with the challenges of an ageing population.
That is why we have asked for an economic and social as well as environmental impact assessment for every legislative proposal.
That constitutes âbetter law-makingâ.
Reviving the economy and boosting employment means backing entrepreneurial activity by helping our large companies to become world champions and giving our SMEs the means to expand, developing a dynamic society for our fellow-citizens.
We must mobilise to make Europe a centre of excellence, as you said, Mr Barroso.
For that, we want a simple and fair tax system that causes as little hindrance as possible, public-private partnerships, an internal market with no social dumping, a high level of commitment to young people with the recognition of qualifications and greater use made of exchanges, the appointment of a âMr or Mrs Lisbonâ in every capital and commitment by the Member States to the financial perspectives.
The worldâs cards have been re-dealt.
Every continent has a good hand.
Lisbon ought to be Europeâs winning number, but we must always keep in mind what Churchill said, and make it our motto: âHowever beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the resultsâ.
Â Â  Mr President, President Barroso, Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to say how pleased I am today at the positive reception given to our draft resolution on the Lisbon Process.
I regard it, in fact, as a hand outstretched in cooperation and I see it as a manifestation of the fact that people have been listening.
Although we have had fierce discussions along the way, after each fierce discussion a conclusion must be drawn, and the conclusion being drawn today is that now is the time for action.
I would like to say that I was delighted to hear MrÂ Junckerâs recent comments, when he said that we should now end the debate concerning what comes first and establish that in Europe things happen at the same time; that we improve our competitiveness, carry out social reforms â including in the labour market â and implement environmental reforms all at the same time.
I should like to say that we in Scandinavia have shown that it can be done, and that is indeed partly what we understand by the European dimension.
We are not aiming for just any kind of combination, however.
We need reforms, and we need investment.
President of the Commission, I feel today that the greatest investment of all that we need is investment in human beings over the coming five years.
The Commission and MrÂ Å pidla talk of flexibility; we of the Group of the European Socialists in the European Parliament have nothing against flexibility.
It depends on the type of flexibility we are talking about.
I myself feel that we can create a reform that says that people must be able to move from an old job to a new job while maintaining social security and in the constant assurance of becoming more skilled, better qualified and more education-minded.
If we do this, we will have an opportunity to bring about a new deal in which we say to people: âWe shall safeguard your security in the twenty-first century in a new labour market with new jobsâ.
We shall commit ourselves to creating 1Â 500 new jobs in Europe each time we lose 1Â 000 jobs to Asia, India or the developing world.
In other words, we shall say that we are here to create new jobs that can take the place of the old ones, and we shall ensure that people are able to take those new jobs.
May I end by urgently saying to the Luxembourg Presidency and to the Commission that we need greater demand in Europe and that we need macroeconomic coordination of investments, for I can assure you that, without major economic growth, there will be no popular understanding for reforms, and without reforms we can have no sustainable economic growth.
If we can agree on this in the Luxembourg Presidencyâs proposal to the European Council, we shall have come a very, very long way.
I want to wish you the best of luck with your work during the Luxembourg Presidency.
I think great efforts are being made to secure balance, and we want to be there all the time, as MrÂ Schulz said today, to secure that balance that is the European identity.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the text before us is built on the necessary balance between the three facets of the Lisbon Strategy: the economic facet, of course, but also the social and environmental ones.
That is how we will demonstrate to our fellow citizens our determination to give substance to a Europe that is, of course, competitive, but is also based on social cohesion and the restoration and preservation of a healthy environment.
This text also sends a number of clear messages that I would like to underline.
A message to the younger generation first, since the text encourages the joint initiative of four Member States to help young people, an initiative which appears in the Commissionâs communication to the spring European Council.
The second message confirms the role of SMEs as job creators and innovators in a proactive and balanced industrial policy, one focused on the leading corporations, but also â and perhaps primarily â on those small companies which, again, are the key to job creation in Europe.
The third message stresses the obvious need for a major boost to research in the EU as a whole.
Finally, the text makes a fundamental point to which you referred just now, Mr Verheugen, namely that the Lisbon Strategyâs ambitions are pointless unless sufficient resources are made available, and this means in particular, as I am sure you understand, a European budget commensurate with its objectives.
From today, while the future of the Lisbon Strategy is indeed a matter for the European political authorities, it is just as much, and perhaps even more, a matter for the national political authorities and all those with a role to play in the economic life of the 25 Member States.
The Lisbon Strategyâs success depends on the Member Statesâ ability to steer their policies in the required direction and to involve Europeâs population as widely as possible.
It will only be possible to involve people in this way if public opinion is generally well-disposed towards the work of the European Union and its institutions.
The Commission must understand that and respond to that expectation.
If we bear in mind some recent statements that have been made about delocalisation, or what MrÂ McCreevy said here yesterday about the services directive, then I fear, Mr Barroso, that you may be continuing your work on the Treaty of Nice.
Be careful!
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Unionâs added value involves us making peace, bringing security, securing growth, employment and competitiveness, and guaranteeing social security and environmental sustainability.
That is what we are working to do.
We have a new project to work on â no longer economic and monetary union, but competitiveness, growth and employment.
What do we have to do?
Firstly, we have to breathe life into the European social model of an environmentally-responsible market economy, making it tangible and implementing it, for we see the market not as an end in itself, but only as a means to an end.
Secondly, we have to make the internal market a domestic market for all.
Without an internal market in services, then, the new Lisbon strategy will remain unrealised.
Thirdly, we should make real the four freedoms for all Europeâs citizens, for businesses and for research.
Fourthly, we have to revitalise the Stability and Growth Pact.
What does that mean?
It means wanting to achieve the goals we have set ourselves in a consistent way; it means allowing the Commission to exercise the prerogatives conferred upon them; it means not making judges of criminals, it means doing our work at home rather than blaming Brussels.
The same social model applies also to the Lisbon strategy.
Where it is concerned, we must not repeat the mistakes we made with the Stability and Growth Pact.
Fifthly, we need more leadership from the Commission.
We therefore need a European action plan, a European timetable, a European catalogue of measures; the Commission needs to engage in dialogue with the Member States when drawing up national action plans and it is the Commission that must monitor them.
Mr President of the Commission, you are the trainer and captain of the Europe squad.
The governments of the Member States are the members of your team.
That is why all the Heads of State or Government â and not just the ministers for the internal market â must again make the Lisbon strategy for growth, competitiveness and employment, their own project.
Listening to todayâs debate, I wonder what the ETUC wants to demonstrate against in the run-up to the summit in Brussels.
Against what you have put forward today?
Against competitiveness, growth and employment?
I call on the ETUC to call off the demonstration against growth, competitiveness and employment and do as the Socialist Group has earned our gratitude by doing â get back into the boat of growth, employment and competitiveness.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Council, in the year 2000, set itself the ambitious objective of Europe becoming, by 2010, the strongest â in economic terms â knowledge-based society.
It would be good if we were to manage to become, if not absolutely the strongest knowledge-based society in economic terms, but one that is strong and â for this is another objective that must be listed, has a social orientation.
The results from the mid-term review are, alas, something other than favourable, and so we must, as a matter of urgency, implement in a consistent manner the strategies that have already been devised.
At the heart of the Lisbon strategy, alongside social cohesion, growth, and employment, is education, which underpins everything else.
There is a need for more investment in education, science and research, although this needs to go hand in hand with reforms in response to the changes in technology and society.
What that means in practical terms is that we need, among other things, learning that accompanies life rather than learning that is lifelong â that has the ring of punishment about it â along with the promotion of mobility in employment, science and research, cross-border educational opportunities, the recognition of degrees â for many of them are not yet accepted everywhere â and access to education for all.
In other words, there must be no cutbacks in education, no tuition fees, no depriving universities of resources, and no reduction in teaching hours, particularly in the natural sciences, for it is they that foster creativity and are therefore necessary both for the development of the individual, whether personal or professional.
Any strong, and socially-responsible society must also take the gender dimension into account, and so, at its Spring Summit, the Council must devote its attention to such issues as equal pay for equal work, about which much was said on Womenâs Day yesterday, and also equality of opportunity.
Â Â  Madam President, since a great deal has, of course, already been said about the Lisbon strategy in this debate, I should like to confine myself to three points.
First of all, the Lisbon strategy must, after the euro, enlargement and the Constitution, become the EUâs next big success.
We have no choice.
That presumes, though, that we give the citizen the confidence and the leeway to develop new initiatives and meet new challenges.
My neighbour in Rijswijk is perfectly capable of taking sound decisions about his future himself, and he does not need to be told what to do by the Dutch Government, let alone the European Union.
This brings me to my second point.
We should be more critical about the role of the government in the framework of the Lisbon strategy.
The question presents itself whether the government should be the problem solver or if it is perhaps the problem itself.
Needless to say, the government must keep an eye on things and prescribe certain conditions, but far too often, we notice that the government obstructs, rather than stimulates, new initiatives.
In my view, deregulation, a reduction in the administrative burden and cutting right down on red tape must therefore be central in the Lisbon strategy if we really want to achieve this desperately needed reinforcement of Europeâs competitiveness.
Thirdly, I do, of course, agree completely with the Members who believe that Europe should take pride in its unique model, but we should also realise that this social model can be enforced only when we generate more economic growth.
All too often, my fellow MEPs on my left have preserved the myth that social policy and economic growth are mutually exclusive, whether the subject is the Lisbon strategy or the services directive.
Time and again, they intimate a false contradiction between a free, innovative, dynamic knowledge economy and social policy.
It is therefore beyond me why the Socialist Group in this House abstained during last weekâs vote in the parliamentary coordination group, particularly in the light of the fact that the other groups had really done their level best to reach a widely acceptable compromise.
I am therefore delighted that the spokespersons of that group now say that the text before us deserves broad support.
It makes last weekâs abstention of vote all the more mysterious, but let us simply put it down to progressive insight.
There is no policy that is more social than policy that creates more and better jobs and creates space for entrepreneurship.
It remains to be seen whether there is really a majority to back this Commission policy.
Should this be the case, then that would be a welcome development.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if I were asked for the two main reasons why I consider the convergence in the positions of the Council Presidency, the Commission and Parliament that we see today to be important, I would reply that my first reason is that the social and environmental aspects of development are being sincerely acknowledged not as constraints and obstacles but as factors in our competitiveness.
My second reason is that we all agree that in order to properly relaunch the Lisbon Strategy it is essential to create a sense of ownership of the strategy that filters down to local levels, so that responsibility lies first and foremost with national governments and parliaments as well as with the public.
I agree wholeheartedly on this point, which I hope will be transformed into tangible measures in the European Council.
This time, however, I must disagree with what MrsÂ Frassoni said in her speech.
Among her reasons for rejecting the proposal for a resolution â which I, on the other hand, support â she mentioned the fact that one of the paragraphs in the resolution called the REACH regulation into question.
MadamÂ President, you know very well how much I value that regulation and I would never risk jeopardising it by supporting the proposal for a resolution.
I should, however, like to call on my fellow Members not to regard the regulation as a symbol of good or evil any longer, as polarisation of that kind implies that in the end there will be winners and losers.
I believe, instead, that reaching agreement on that regulation would be a victory for us all.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the two co-rapporteurs, MrÂ Lehne and MrÂ HarlemÂ DÃ©sir, and above all the group of 33, including, too, those colleagues who will probably not take part in the vote.
I am rather sorry about that, but I can tell you that the working atmosphere was excellent, that we worked in extraordinarily good conditions and that I was highly satisfied as chairman.
It is important that the revitalisation of the Lisbon Strategy should be an indisputable priority and, for that to be the case, we must mobilise all the parties concerned.
Parliament has therefore set up its coordinating working group, with the sole aim of helping to improve the strategyâs implementation by making Parliament a clearer and more influential partner in the process than has previously been the case.
One of its tasks will be to prepare a recommendation for the Conference of Presidents before the spring summit.
I hope, Mr Barroso, that you and all the commissioners will take everything that has been said into account.
There is still a short paragraph which I have not heard, Mr Barroso, on the coordination of the three presidents.
I believe that is very important for what lies ahead.
So far as this draft resolution is concerned, I therefore hope there will be a very large majority today in the vote.
That is why we also need to identify key measures like the importance of the service sector, special support for private businesses and also the need for a new regulation on chemical substances and the modernisation of the labour market.
Another important stage will begin next week with the holding in our Parliament in Brussels, under MrÂ Borrellâs presidency, of the first parliamentary meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments.
It is very important that we study and work much more with our national parliaments.
Our meeting will mark the opening of a parliamentary dialogue on this Lisbon Strategy.
The aim is to coordinate initiatives at parliamentary level so as to send a strong and consistent message to the Heads of State or Government on the eve of each European Council.
We will also be continuing our work on the other aspects of the mandate we have been given, namely to work at interinstitutional level for better legislative programming and to improve the transposition and implementation at national level of the measures taken within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
Indeed, as the Kok Report suggests, we want Parliament to play a proactive role in monitoring the results obtained from this strategy.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Verheugen, objectively speaking, the enlargement of the European Union brings us into a new era of new beginnings.
So it is that people in other regions of the world look at us and wonder whether we, in the European Union, really are capable of competing internationally in a new age and of remaining so while maintaining and further developing high social standards.
Are we able to take economic and technical leaps into the new age while ushering in a new generation of production with higher â the highest â environmental standards?
The President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have presented us with very bold visions.
Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of values â values in the way businesses are run, values in social standards, values of social participation both in enterprise and in the life of society, describing these as vehicles with which the process of modernisation travels forwards.
While that is something I would underline, I do believe that the reality of life for many people is somewhat different.
They fear insecurity; they fear that these objectives will not be achieved in their day-to-day lives.
If we want to bridge this gap, our instruments must be reformed first, and then the gap must be bridged in the broad outlines of economic policy and elsewhere, where I want to hear no more of stale ideologies, but more of how people really live in society.
If what we are working on together in this House is to become reality, it is our own instruments that must be reformed.
Â Â  Madam President, what was pompously called the Lisbon Strategy is turning into a farce.
First of all, the aim of growth and prosperity has clearly not been achieved.
Half way through, growth is so weak that the OECD is describing the euro zone as the black hole of world recovery; growth is stagnating at 1.7% â lower in many countries â while world growth is 5% and, irony of ironies, Europe as a whole is producing a rate of 2.9%, thanks to the relative performance of those very countries which are not foolishly shackled to the euro.
As for prosperity, for our fellow citizens this is at present more synonymous with insecurity, loss of purchasing power and unemployment, the latter exemplified by the 8 million unemployed in the Franco-German nucleus.
The outlook is increasingly bleak, especially in the euro zone.
The euro has not kept its promise.
Clearly, it is not a currency of trade, nor is it a factor of budgetary discipline but is, on the contrary, one of laxity.
For our contemporaries it is more a factor of inflation.
As for the Stability Pact, it is clearly in the process of breaking up.
Moreover, I fail to understand how anyone can support the euro without supporting the Stability Pact.
That point, at least, is a contradiction in terms, and I should like to draw the Commissionâs attention to it.
The lesson for the Commission, moreover, is simple.
The enlargement of Euroland must be postponed so that only 12 of the 25 (soon to be 30) countries will be euro zone members.
That is, of course, a long way from the declared objectives.
All these are obviously arguments which will be used by the supporters of a ânoâ vote, and we would be quite happy with that, were it not for the sad fact that what is at stake is the very notion of Europe, an idea that has unfortunately been compromised in the minds of our citizens, perhaps for a long time to come.
Â Â  Mr President, one of my first speeches when I became a Member of this Parliament five years ago was on the first Lisbon Strategy in April 2000.
I was dismayed that the completion of the internal market was ranked well down the priorities in that original paper and there was only one page devoted to it in a voluminous document.
I thank you, President Barroso, and your team, for elevating the internal market to the top of the agenda where it ought to be.
If we do not complete the internal market, we will never have the basis for creating the jobs, growth, social and environmental policies we all want.
It is absolutely clear that the next phase of the internal market has to be in services; we all know that.
Last week I said publicly to you, President Barroso, that I thought you were wobbling over this proposal.
You were not here last night to hear Mr McCreevy make his barnstorming speech.
It showed how important this directive is and I thank him very much for that.
I can assure you that this side of the House will work with you to get the measure through, because it is the most important measure for the internal market since the 1992 programme and it is crucial for jobs and employment.
Small- and medium-sized companies are already benefiting from it.
I was delighted to hear that Commissioner Verheugen is going to bring forward a comprehensive programme for modernising and enhancing the conditions for small businesses.
That was a weakness in the proposal.
I am delighted it is going to be remedied, because if every small- and medium-sized company across Europe creates one more job over the next five years, we will have met that job creation goal.
That willonly be achieved when we have business-friendly policies and an environment in which people want to go out and start businesses, whether in services or in manufacturing and technical innovation.
That is the key to delivery of this Lisbon Agenda.
We stand ready, President Barroso, to work with you to achieve those goals.
Â Â  Madam President, the essential point of Parliamentâs resolution is the definition of European competitiveness.
We include social and environmental sustainability in competitiveness.
The Commission speaks too narrowly of competition and employment.
We Social Democrats are calling for social and environmental sustainability.
Moreover, this is how it should be.
In the long term, competitiveness will not be sustainable if it is not based on a social framework and the environment.
Is that possible?
Yes, it is.
For example, my country is just as competitive as the United States of America, to which we are frequently compared.
At the same time we have been able to maintain social and environmental sustainability, unlike the United States.
As a consequence, ours is a more equal, more secure and more environmentally sustainable society.
Competition must not be allowed to merely become a benefit for the few, because at the end of that road awaits a controlled society, currently the digitalised control dictatorship.
As a member of the Lisbon Committee, I was disappointed that the report is not insisting that the names of those Member States that have not implemented the Lisbon legislation should be repeatedly published.
There are as many as 1Â 500 internal market laws that have not been implemented and the process has therefore come to a halt thanks to a certain kind of non-solidarity movement.
I would ask the media now to publish over and over again the names of the Member States that purposely avoid implementation.
That way, having received the information, people could encourage implementation.
That would be one method of sustainable development.
Â Â  Lisbon is a challenge, and the most important project of the years ahead, the success of which hinges on the willingness of all of us â governments, parliaments, social partners at European, national and regional level â to join forces.
If we want to achieve this united cooperation, but also this involvement, then we have already negotiated the most important hurdle to succeed.
To you, President Barroso, I gladly trust the difficult, but also central, role of the pivot of this process.
When we look at the Lisbon objective, a â to my mind absurd â contradiction is created.
It is impossible to drive a wedge between the EUâs competitiveness, social policy and ecology, because without growth, we cannot meet the ecological obligations.
Growth provides more jobs, employment, income and prosperity among the public.
More people in jobs is the best guarantee for social securityâs affordability and for cushioning the rising cost of care, as well as the reform of affordable and lasting pensions.
Economy, ecology and social policy are therefore inextricably linked.
Commissioner Verheugen has drawn attention to new initiatives: better and simpler legislation, new industrial policy and more support for innovation.
In my view, these initiatives lack one thing, though, and that is retraining and extra training.
Without providing permanent education to the potential workers, we cannot put the unemployed, whether they be women, minorities or the disabled, in jobs.
So if we want to achieve this Europe , we should once again put our money where our mouth is.
Â Â  I would like to start with a question from twenty years ago: what was the coat of arms of COMECON?
(COMECON was the economic coordination organisation of the East European countries.)
The answer is: a green field with ten thin cows all milking each other.I am convinced that if the European Union does not make some crucial decisions within one or two years â decisions which the Member States will implement â then in twenty yearsâ time this could be the coat of arms of the EU too, only with the difference that there will be more cows, and they may be even thinner.
So that this does not happen, a radical change of approach and a series of bold steps are needed.
This is independent of oneâs political orientation, whether one is religious or atheist, woman or man.
According to my heart, my mind and my actions, I am left-wing.
I believe, as a left-winger, that our only chance rests in using the opportunities of a unified internal market, breaking down all barriers to the free circulation of goods, services, labour and capital with lightning speed.
Increasing European competitiveness is a question that will decide our future.
If we do not change direction, we will not only fall behind others, but also our own opportunities and our dreams.
We must forge an alliance to push ourselves and our national governments, and strive to convert public opinion to accept these changes, to subordinate their four-year electoral propaganda machines and their individual interests to Europe, and to the millions living in Europe.
We must be able to do so: we decide the future of our children and our grandchildren.
Whether they will have work twenty years from now.
My youngest daughter is nine years old.
I do not want her to say, mother, you wasted it.
The question is not who says what, but who does what.
Â Â  â Madam President, growth is not a game where the sum total is zero.
We do not need to dissolve our societies and destroy the environment in order to achieve high growth objectives.
In March 2000, we decided at Lisbon to maximise the competitiveness of Europe, subject to the limitations imposed by the maintenance of cohesion and environmental protection.
However, what we referred to at the time as the Lisbon strategy described everything we wanted, but not how we would achieve it.
Today we worked out our priorities.
Competitiveness is no longer the sum total of wishful thinking.
It is a strategy of hierarchical priorities.
Thus, the mid-term review summarises the Lisbon strategy in a simple equation:
Emphasis on research and technology programmes + support for small and medium-sized enterprises + construction of crucial infrastructures + improved human resources + promotion of structural changes = maintainable long-term growth and sustainable development.
We must distinguish these objectives in the budget and we must not deny these objectives financing.
We must also remember that we cannot achieve more growth with less money, just as we cannot achieve financial stability with less growth.
Â Â  â Madam President, this is our first opportunity to acknowledge the importance of this debate on the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament's agreement to relaunch, and above all, to take the necessary practical measures in order to create, at long last, a Europe which is genuinely more competitive and innovative, while at the same time continuing to strengthen its best and most valuable asset: the European social model, with the quality of life and social rights that it guarantees the European citizens.
I particularly welcome Commissioner Verheugen's emphasis on innovation and funding, because efforts to give young Europeans better training, to improve training and skills among workers and employers, to increase the number of women at work with equal professional opportunities while maintaining a commitment to family life: all of these activities we are advocating today as MEPs will not be enough if we are unable to promote the public and private investment required to establish infrastructures in Europe that underpin economic development, and to make free circulation of goods, services and people a reality throughout the European Union.
This is currently being worked out in practice through the thirty trans-European network projects, which, like the Lisbon Strategy, have until now suffered from a certain degree of apathy and from funding problems on the Member States' side.
The European Parliament urges and encourages the Commission to redouble its efforts to convince the Member States â and would like to offer its assistance and support in doing so.
We also call on the Commission to use all available resources to be more creative and to identify potential synergies between the three networks (transport, energy and telecommunications) in order to reduce costs and obtain adequate funding.
We also support the amendment on a sustainable development model for transport â something we feel is essential â including modernisation and technological innovation for transport.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Jacques Delors is regarded as one of the most successful Presidents that the Commission has had, for it was he who had the vision of creating and completing the internal market.
The Lisbon strategy could be this Commissionâs vision.
One difference, though, is that Jacques Delors was dealing with Heads of Government like Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, who had their own visions and goals for Europe.
With some of the Heads of Government that we have now, one could well ask, in a critical way, where Europe ranks in their list of priorities.
That, Mr President of the Commission, is one of the fundamental priorities for you â to overcome that obstacle and let Lisbon become a reality, so that you do not end up saying, âI had a dreamâ, whilst nothing productive came out of it for us.
That is what is crucial, and the Commission can contribute in various ways.
Commissioner McCreevy, whom I see here, can, in his own field, do a great deal to that end.
I hope that you will get your own way, despite the Member States, where the cause of Europe needs to be advanced.
People in the Member States need to be told what those States are supposed to be doing.
Transparency and comparability are at stake here.
We are currently seeing a failure to apply the law as it stands in the case of the Stability and Growth Pact, and that leads me to suspect that progress reports will not be enough.
Let us make very clear comparisons here, with benchmarking, in order to establish who, in Europe, has the best labour market policy.
When handling the Lisbon strategy in future, we will have to take care that the economy, ecology and social objectives do not act against each other, but are instead all subordinated to the goals of the Lisbon strategy.
When nation states implement it, it is even more important to ensure that lawmaking is improved.
There are Member States â and I am from one of them â that manage over and over again to plug the gaps as required.
The most important thing will be to encourage people in Europe, so that the goal of the Lisbon strategy can become reality.
Our main problem is that there are elements in Europe that do not believe that we can hold our own against the Americans.
If we do manage to do that, then we in Europe will have achieved a great deal.
This House is right behind you.
Â Â  Madam President, the core of the Lisbon Strategy has to be jobs.
For that, we need active labour market policies to ensure that work is rewarded, the unemployed are helped to get work, and that training and retraining are central to everything we do.
The three institutions must develop laws that are easy to understand and enforce and achieve their stated objectives without detrimental side effects.
The Commission has to deliver on the areas for which it is responsible, particularly the completion of the internal market.
I welcome Mr Barrosoâs commitment to the Services Directive.
We need it, but it must bring clear benefits and not losses.
The starting point of the Services Directive is the screening of Member Statesâ laws hindering the establishment of services.
We do not need a directive to do that.
Member States could be doing that now; if they were really committed, they would get on with it.
That is the key to the debate on the Lisbon Strategy: are Member States prepared to deliver on their promises?
The success of Lisbon rests with you, Mr Barroso.
In your relations with Member States, are you going to be a man or a mouse?
The answer to that will determine the success of your Commission and of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  â Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the text of the recommendation trots out general principles that have already been accepted, precisely when a structured outline of specific measures to be adopted would be more desirable.
One might say that everyone agrees on the goals but few know what to do to achieve them.
A knowledge-based economy requires a high level of education, as the text states, but it makes no mention of the fact that a high level of education has to be based on schooling that is also high quality right from a childâs first years at school.
As basic and secondary education in most countries is known to have a number of failings, it is a pity that the recommendation does not call on the Member States to examine this aspect and to seek an urgent solution to it.
This document points to the future, and the future cannot do without such a solution.
On another point, the text emphasises the need to mobilise European public opinion so as to convince it of the benefits of the Lisbon Strategy and to make it accept them, but there is not a single word on cultural policies at either a European or a national level.
It talks of a culture of dialogue, but it does not even mention a dialogue of cultures.
For the European citizen, accepting the need for the Lisbon Strategy and seeing its benefits will be a cultural process, more than anything else.
Culture is not only an essential aspect of democracy; it is also the yardstick with which we can measure the gap between failure and success in a strategy like Lisbon, particularly if we want to preserve the European social model.
A knowledge-based economy implies a world view that only culture can provide.
For that very reason, we must call on the Council, the Commission and the Governments to make a special, serious commitment in the financial sphere as well â I repeat, in the financial sphere as well â to further Europeâs cultural policies.
Without them, the Lisbon Strategy will remain little more than a nice list of good intentions.
Â Â  Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Barroso, I believe the Lisbon Strategy is really something that can embody the added value of the European Union, namely a long-term vision, a goal.
However, we also have what is sometimes the cause of all the European Unionâs failings: great ambitions but not the resources to match the targets we set ourselves.
That is what we have just experienced over these last five years.
We must therefore try to change things over the next five years.
That is why, MrÂ Barroso, MrÂ Verheugen, I was pleased to hear you say this morning that we were at the beginning and not at the end of the process of reviewing that strategy and that the results of the European Council were not awaited as an end in themselves.
After the meeting we are having today, there are, I believe, at least two essential meetings to come.
First, the one on the adoption of the financial perspectives, and what you have just said to us seems to me to be going in the right direction.
Then there is the reform of the Stability Pact, about which few have spoken this morning but which is facing the challenge referred to by Mr Poettering this morning when he called for stability and flexibility.
Where, however, have we seen leadership being recreated or confidence restored by telling the citizens that nothing must change except their ability to make their employment more flexible?
We will not achieve the Lisbon Strategyâs objectives like that.
If we really want to implement this strategy, a thorough reform of the Stability Pact will also be needed.
Â Â  â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the answer to the question 'is it possible to create six million new jobs in Europe by 2010?', is yes.
In response to the question of whether this is an overly-ambitious objective, the answer is no.
As to whether we are capable of achieving that aim, the answer depends on what we do and do not do.
What must we not do?
We cannot follow the example of those countries which have abandoned structural reforms and increased public spending.
We need to do the very opposite: to increase growth.
On this subject, I would like to use the example of the Aznar Government's policy in Spain â which can hardly be accused of inefficiency â to propose four practical measures.
Firstly, let us make the labour market more flexible in order to increase labour force participation.
Secondly, we need to ensure that the cohesion budget for the 2007-2013 period is sufficient for requirements.
Thirdly, we need to encourage entrepreneurship by reducing fiscal and administrative burdens.
Fourthly, we need to support measures designed to improve education and life-long learning.
We also need to complete the single market, making the liberalisation of the communications, energy and financial services markets a priority.
Then we need to open up the European economy to the outside world, focusing in particular on NICs.
However, none of this will be possible, ladies and gentlemen, unless we have adequate budgetary resources â the figure of 1.24% of gross Community income set by the Commission is fine â and unless we involve the Member States directly in the process, since they are the main stakeholders in the Lisbon Strategy.
If any of these States uses the Lisbon Strategy to propose cuts to Community policies that have been effective growth generators or in order to relax the Stability Pact, ladies and gentlemen, I bet you all a slice of Spanish and a Belgian beer that we will be on the road to disaster.
Â Â  â Madam President, I am delighted that it appears we will have a large majority for this resolution in the European Parliament.
A broad majority is the only way for Parliament to have political influence.
I feel that our influence consists of our having succeeded in our resolution in maintaining what is fundamental to the Lisbon Process, namely the balance between the three pillars of growth, social cohesion and environmental sustainability.
I do not think that the original document from the Commission succeeded in doing this.
It stated that growth was needed in order to achieve prosperity and environmental sustainability.
That is true, but it also applies the other way around; in other words, we need social cohesion and must make long-term sustainable investments if we are to achieve long-term growth.
What is important is for these to co-exist.
If we in Parliament can effectively make this point to the Council and if it becomes policy in the future, then we shall have succeeded.
Â Â  Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, at a time when the European Union has just undergone enlargement and we are confronted each and every day with huge differences in the development of countries and regions, it is impossible to view the Communityâs tasks in isolation from the measures and efforts undertaken by the individual EU Member States.
The whole point of integration and the opportunities afforded by the Lisbon strategy is to act in solidarity to support less-advanced regions and to help them catch up.
The original premise of the Lisbon strategy was to provide an answer to the internal and external challenges we currently face.
Over the past year, however, we have not seen any evidence of new ideas or debates on how to reinvigorate the Lisbon process.
I believe that the fundamental reason why the Lisbon strategy has not yet been a success is that both the European Commission and the Member States, which signed up to the strategy in 2000, have lacked the political ability to make changes.
The latter are a prerequisite for the implementation of the strategy, and include in particular far-reaching liberalisation of the labour market, a lower level of welfare protection, an exhaustive review of regulatory barriers and major cuts in the amount of public money that is redistributed.
The Lisbon strategy has fallen foul to bureaucracy, and the latter has become the greatest obstacle to the development of innovation.
In order to achieve the goals it has set itself, Europe must forge new visions and develop common actions that unite all its Member States.
Priority should be given to linking up the principles of the Lisbon strategy with cohesion policy instruments and the funding earmarked for these instruments.
This funding should not resemble alms given by the wealthy to the poor.
Instead, it should be an instrument to boost the competitiveness of regional economies and the development of human capital, and to encourage innovation and the transfer of technology from science to EU industry.
The new Member States have brought to the EU of 25 the vitality of a liberalised market, a strong spirit of entrepreneurship, a critical approach to over-regulation, a high level of compliance with Community legislation and rapid increases in productivity, as well as the synergy and similarities that exist between the Lisbon goals and the structural changes we have undergone in recent years.
Finally, I should like to say that the basic principle of economic development policy should be that the goals of economic growth and job creation are not designed to be achieved simultaneously.
It is difficult to achieve the second without having achieved the first.
Â Â  Madam President, I will be backing the resolution on which we are due to vote because I agree with what President Barroso said to the effect that the three children are now being treated on an equal footing.
The one does not follow from the other, but they should reinforce each other.
I wholeheartedly support the policy outlined by Commissioner Verheugen to have the economy compete in terms of quality and not in terms of costs, for that would be a dead-end.
I would like to ask for a debate on the method for achieving the objectives, because I think that, if that method ceases to be Community-oriented, the objectives cannot be achieved.
Finally, I would ask you to consider Parliamentâs question about the creation of a legal framework for services of general interest, together with a revised services directive.
This will greatly simplify what we do here in this House.
Â Â  Madam President, I would say to President Barroso that it is true the first five years of Lisbon have delivered little and most Member States, which bear the ultimate responsibility for implementing the Lisbon Agenda, have been very slow to take ownership.
It is also true that focusing on the economic agenda does not mean that we are downgrading other agendas, be this the environment or the social agenda.
I would say to Commissioner Kroes that competition is the objective, not the problem.
We cannot have a race to the back of the queue as Member States scurry to avoid attracting outside investment for fear of getting a rap on the knuckles from Brussels.
Two high-profile examples from Ireland â Intel and Ryanair â have been highly instructive in demonstrating how unreasonably applied competition policy can militate against competition.
I would urge Commissioner KovÃ¡cs, in relation to taxation, that âif it ainât broke donât fix itâ and above all âdonât break itâ!
Member States must be given the flexibility they require to implement the solutions they need to achieve their Lisbon objectives, hopefully by stimulating employment through a reduction in direct taxation, especially a reduction in labour taxes.
I would underline to Commissioner PotoÄnik that it is absolutely imperative that Community funding for research be substantially increased under the Seventh Framework Programme.
Fundamental research is essential, but equally we must facilitate the application of research and development in European businesses and foster innovation.
I would say to Commissioner McCreevy that facilitating the free movement of services is the missing key needed to unlock the potential of the European workforce and galvanise the European economy.
As you mentioned yesterday, Commissioner, it is always easier to find reasons not to do something.
Services contribute 70% of European GDP, and I urge you to proceed with the Services Directive.
It is particularly important for our new Member States, which have been denied the advantage of free movement of people, goods and services for so long.
Please single out health services, consider the benchmark of good regulation, and deal with this specific area in a more appropriate way.
Finally, a word to the College of Commissioners in general.
Could we please have less regulation; better regulation; simpler regulation; thoroughly vetted regulation; risk-assessed regulation.
We need to Lisbon-proof REACH, the Services Directive and the Nutritional and Health Claims Regulation.
We are always an action plan away from action.
Commissioner Barroso and colleagues, please go for it!
Â Â  â Madam President, in the light of the shortcomings that have characterised the Lisbon Process, it should be stressed that the most important issues here are not about what we want to achieve, but about how we can achieve it.
It is not a question of others being better in various areas, but of why they are better.
We may take particular pride in the social model, but we are still seeing unemployment, exclusion, stagnation and conflict.
We also have to ask ourselves why, and what decisions we must take to change this state of affairs.
What Mrs Doyle just said is correct.
In each area in which our actions hinder competition, the result is a deterioration in competitiveness.
Those who are currently fighting the Services Directive with its free and open market for services are actually opposing new jobs and European growth in the future.
There is no conflict between the internal market and peopleâs social security, since nothing is as crucial for social security as a job and an income.
There is nothing so crucial to social cohesion as opportunities for new businesses and new jobs.
The most important integration process in the European Union is happening right now while we are sitting here.
It concerns a flow of people, goods and services that is taking knowledge and ideas across borders.
We must therefore ask ourselves whether, in this process, we want to make it possible for every single Member State to exploit its particular competitive advantages.
The old Member States have had the advantage of developing their social economies and their competitiveness in peace and freedom for over fifty years.
During that time, the new Member States were suffering oppression and poverty.
The internal market must be characterised by everyoneâs being able to exploit their competitiveness.
The Commission has a duty to realise and emphasise that what we are concerned with here are solidarity, integration and opportunities for all to create prosperity.
That is why the Services Directive is important, and that is why it is important to remember that it is a question here of a European integration that is vital to competitiveness.
This is something we must implement.
Â Â  â (Madam President, Members of the Commission.
The Lisbon Strategy has set us aÂ task which is not an easy one â to create new and higher quality jobs and, at the same time, to provide for the citizens of the European Union aÂ similar or higher level of social security.
Most countries allocate substantial resources to pay for an army of unemployed.
Many young people spend far too long searching in vain for their first job, so that they can gain the necessary experience.
Meanwhile, apart from their regular employment, mothers have the responsibility of maternal duties and are therefore working twice over.
At the same time Europe has an ageing population as women are no longer prepared to bear as much responsibility for the normal reproduction of the population as they did in the past.
Equality in the field of education has given women more opportunities in employment and vocational advancement, if, of course, they do not have children or put off having children until later.
In this day and age we can no longer ask women to have more children for the good of society and devote themselves to motherhood, and also expect them to bear all the financial consequences on their shoulders.
Similarly we cannot expect employers to provide extra benefits for mothers voluntarily.
For this reason the countries of the European Union need to formulate systematically the kind of employment policy, including financial incentives and benefits, that will encourage employers to create jobs suitable for mothers, without either the employer or the mother herself suffering any negative consequences as aÂ result.
In this way mothers would not have to choose between aÂ career and motherhood but could combine both in the interests of society and for their own development and benefit.
Economising at the expense of motherhood is aÂ poor investment for the future of society.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a practical observation to help resolve what I think is one of the essential aspects of our problem, which is to go beyond the statements of principle and somehow get down to more concrete evaluations of our strategy.
I take my cue from the subject of human capital, which everyone considers a strategic factor in regaining our competitiveness.
During the last parliamentary term, when it was found that 94.5% of Europeâs schools had Internet connections but only 25% of teachers knew how to use the new technologies for teaching purposes, we spent a long time hoping that the -learning initiative would materialise.
Parliament hoped for action from the national governments, which were supposed to make good use of resources â amounting to EURÂ 30Â billion, or so we imagined â through a system of priorities that would enable them to solve the human capital problem.
When it was clear that the governments would not act, it was decided that the Commission should introduce a programme.
By that time the billions had shrunk to millions, 44Â million to be precise, a derisory amount to solve the problem, and so the proposal was left as just a statement of principle and the priority remained purely theoretical without ever becoming a budget priority.
In view of that, I ask that the Commission should be able to assign responsibility to those in power and to promote action in the area of human capital.
As the Union budget quite rightly obliges us to provide for agriculture to the tune of 50%, this step would prevent Europe from remaining just a guardian of animal capital rather than the promoter of human capital.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in early February the Commission presented a revised version of the Lisbon strategy, which was approved one month later by the Member States.
In spite of all the flowery language, however, there is no getting away from the fact that the Lisbon goals will not be achieved.
The revised version of the Lisbon strategy sets fewer goals, while attempting to categorise these goals, and gives clear priority to economic growth and greater competitiveness.
This is a good thing in itself, yet unfortunately this does not provide an answer to the contradiction inherent in the project, namely that the problems with which the European Union is struggling are due to the over-regulation of every area of economic activity.
The impact of this over-regulation is quite simply devastating, and it leads to low â or, in some Member States, zero â GDP growth and high unemployment.
The main problem Europe faces is the over-sized tax burden and excessive number of regulations with which the private sector and investors have to contend.
Liberalisation in the sense of the four freedoms has always acted as the foundation of the Community, and care must therefore be taken to ensure that any legislation that is adopted serves to promote effective liberalisation and freedom instead of over-regulation.
The Lisbon strategy also fails to mention a number of obvious problems that have arisen as a result of the EUâs enlargement to include ten new Member States.
Such problems relate primarily to discrimination against workers from the new Member States on the labour markets of 12 of the old Member States.
Such discrimination violates European principles and the concept of the four freedoms, and poses a major threat to the economic productivity of the European Union as a whole.
Similarly, the Lisbon strategy does not mention the common agricultural policy in any detail, although this programme swallows up the most EU funding.
This is another instance where double standards exist in the European Union; one rule applies to the old Member States, whose farmers receive full support, and another to the new Member States, whose farmers will not receive full support until 2013.
The amount of money spent on this policy is also ridiculously large.
In general terms, Europe needs less regulation, fewer grants and more freedom of movement for workers, services, firms, investments and capital.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I believe the debate has adequately shown that Lisbon is crucial, while at the same time we have to realise that we are in a way faced with a paradox.
Europe is the worldâs greatest trading power, certain Member States are export champions, as Vice-President Verheugen has also said, and many European firms are world leaders in their sectors â and yet we rather have the impression that we are falling into a kind of perpetual pessimism.
In aeronautics and space technologies, with Galileo for example, European industry has demonstrated its ability to make up lost ground.
Note, too, that we are experiencing the success of enlargement.
The new Member States are showing dynamism and an exemplary European momentum.
The gap between the old and the new members of the European Union is closing: 5% growth for the new, around 2% for the old.
This shows that Europe has tremendous creative ability.
It also shows that Europeâs decline is neither real nor inevitable.
At a time when we are complaining, feeling we are experiencing a period of decline, the rest of the world is concerned about the US deficits, the trade deficit and budget deficit.
However, the US is producing growth, it is producing research, it is producing jobs.
In the end, that is where the weakness of Europe as a whole lies.
The question must nevertheless be approached with some caution, because when we speak of Europe the situation varies from one country to another.
There are differences between Member States, there are States where employment is less of a problem, where there is growth.
Overall, however, we are struggling to reach a sufficient and sufficiently sustainable rate of growth to create the jobs Europe needs if it is to cut an excessively high level of unemployment appreciably and sustainably.
As I have already said, however, there are no grounds for pessimism provided the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy does not stop at fine words but really does bring a fresh impetus, a fresh impetus that we need, that Europeâs citizens need and on which they are really counting.
The revival of economic growth is certainly not synonymous with dismantling the European social model.
The suggestion that we can achieve growth by dismantling the system of social protection does not seem credible to me.
Nor is it synonymous with unlimited exploitation of natural resources regardless of the consequences, because in a way that would be the opposite of real quality growth.
That is not the way that has been chosen for relaunching the reform strategy, the Lisbon Strategy, either.
Social exclusion produces neither more growth nor more jobs.
We must also be aware, however, that an economy that is increasingly uncompetitive and which no longer generates enough jobs, inevitably leads to social exclusion and undermines the very foundations of the European social model.
That is why the presidency advocates growth as a way of fostering social cohesion, because social cohesion and economic growth are closely linked and in a way enrich one another.
In this respect, I think the European Parliamentâs resolution is an important contribution to the great reform project which the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy represents.
Your messages have been heard: more research, a better translation of research and innovation into new products and new services, better access to, and wider dissemination of, new technologies and innovation, enabling new knowledge to be better anchored in the economy and in societyÂ âÂ a project for a knowledge-based economy that is the opposite of a society which marginalises large sections of the populationÂ â and accelerated development of the eco-technologies that can allow Europe to affirm its leadership in its future activities.
Finally, I entirely agree with what Vice-President Verheugen said about the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the reservoir of jobs that Europe needs.
If that network is to develop, however, we have to think of new ways of financing it.
It is unfortunately often too difficult to find the financial resources to establish a business.
The bureaucratic and administrative hurdles are sometimes too much of a deterrent for young people to embark on the adventure of forming new businesses.
We must therefore concentrate on better legislation, reduce the bureaucratic obstacles where that can be done easily and also have European laws that are more accessible and easier to understand.
I believe we must follow that route more energetically in future.
However, social innovation, investment in human capital and lifelong training are also ways of ensuring that flexibility, a term on which there is broad agreement, does not preclude a necessary amount of security.
Insecurity is not a source of confidence for the future â quite the contrary.
To some extent, the aim of the new Lisbon Strategy is a dynamic Europe which is not a victim but is a protagonist of globalisation â a genuine protagonist helping to shape that globalisation.
We do not want a multi-speed society, we want everyone to share in growth, economic development and the expansion of knowledge.
Knowing that these are crucial days for the EUâs economy and for its economic development, we would be deceiving ourselves if we thought we could relaunch the Lisbon Strategy successfully without being able to agree on a serious reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It would be a waste of time.
We cannot face the media saying âyes, we succeeded in relaunching the Lisbon Strategy but we failed to come to any agreement over the Stability Pactâ.
That is no solution.
Europe needs structural reforms just as it needs a macroeconomic framework that will create a proper balance between stability on the one hand and growth and employment on the other.
Uncontrolled deficits are certainly not the answer here.
At the same time, however, future investments cannot be used to pay the price for a purely accounting approach that has nothing to do with good economic policy.
Finally, I also agree with Mr Verheugen when he makes a direct connection between the success of the financial perspectives and the relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy.
What credibility would the European Union have if, in March, it decided to revive research, to step up its action in support of competitiveness and to develop policies more compatible with the ecological balance only to find, scarcely three months later, that, for 0.0X% of its GNP, it was unable to agree on Community financing for its policies?
You must agree that is a joke.
It is not realistic.
People will be watching the European Union very closely over the next two weeks.
It may create a genuine new momentum.
It may also fail, putting at risk its future development, the confidence people have in its economy and also, perhaps even more seriously â as a number of speakers have pointed out â putting at risk the strong support it will need from its citizens if it is to succeed.
In close cooperation with the Commission and attentive to your Parliament, the presidency wishes to make a success of this great partnership project that we are in the process of getting off the ground.
We are counting on Parliamentâs support as next week it organises a big meeting on the Lisbon Strategy with the national parliaments.
The Lisbon Strategy is also an issue of democracy, it needs the backing and support of our societies.
Without that support, there will be no success at the end of the road.
I believe we now have the ability to release the energy, to release the creativity, to release the spirit of innovation and initiative with which Europe is overflowing, but we must take things in hand, open up new prospects for the people of Europe, and that gives me confidence for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to offer you my sincere thanks for this very committed and, above all, very rich debate in which many of you have taken part.
From it I conclude that Parliament is broadly in support of the new Lisbon Strategy.
I am pleased about that.
Our very positive exchange of views shows that the Commission can consider the European Parliament a genuine partner for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy.
You have responded positively to my request at the opening of the debate this morning.
In her speech, Mrs Ek almost made a slip of the tongue: speaking of Parliamentâs resolution, she almost said revolution.
I will not go as far as that, what we are doing is not a revolution, but it is a genuine reform.
It is also a revolution in the sense of our partnership: we are going to work together and we are all âÂ Parliament, Commission, CouncilÂ â capable of reaching a dynamic consensus, not a consensus of inaction or paralysis, but a dynamic consensus for the changes that are needed in our Europe.
They are changes that are necessary for a reform that is proactive but has a sense of moderation and balance.
That is why I would like to answer a specific question put to me by Mr Turmes of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
You asked me, MrÂ Turmes, where I was when the global strategy for sustainable development was drawn up in Rio in 1992.
Well, I was in Rio, but I was not on Ipanema or Copacabana beach!
I was the EU presidencyâs representative, because at that time it was the Portuguese Presidency.
I was then working with the Commission and the Member States, and it was Europe that led the debate on sustainable development at the Rio conference.
I am telling you this to show you my personal commitment and that of the Commission to the objectives of sustainable development.
There is no contradiction between social cohesion, sustainable development and growth and competitiveness.
I believe that is an obvious conclusion from our debate.
As we have always said, they are not contradictory objectives, they are objectives which can reinforce one another.
Having said that, we are all now aware that Europe urgently needs to raise its level of growth.
Growth and job creation are particularly urgent objectives.
That is why we are sure we are right to concentrate our short-term objectives in that area.
I am of course very pleased with the debate because we have shown that consensus was possible.
However, that consensus must go beyond the European institutions, extending to the national level, to the national parliaments and governments.
Your positive response increases our joint responsibilities.
The Commission, for its part, will do all it can to make the new Lisbon Strategy a success.
The Commission now knows that it can count on the European Parliament for the achievement of this objective.
However, Parliament will have to be an active partner, taking account of the Commissionâs demands.
The Commission and the European institutions must not forget that the time for action has come.
In this regard, I would like to highlight the support I have found in this Parliament for the priority we have given to developing the internal market.
We will have no growth in Europe without a fully operational internal market.
Services account for 70% of our economy.
We have an internal market for goods, but still have 25 different markets for services.
We therefore need to integrate the service markets, but to do so of course while taking account of the legitimate concerns put forward during the debate on the services directive.
That is why the Commission is listening.
It wants to work with you.
I also want to stress our support for all that Commissioner McCreevy said about the services directive yesterday.
We are going to work with you in that spirit.
We believe an internal market in services must be established and that it is, at the same time, possible to resolve any problems to which the implementation of that directive might give rise.
We are also very attentive to what has been said about human capital and the priority of human capital.
Many of you, Mr Rasmussen in particular, have stressed the importance of human capital, education, research and innovation, and I will also add, as Mr GraÃ§a MouraÂ said, culture.
Indeed, our concept of human capital is not a technocratic view.
Culture is also a part of our objectives for the knowledge economy.
That is why we have made concrete proposals: the European technology institute, the new research programme.
We have definite programmes to encourage a growth economy, but also a knowledge-based economy, at European level.
In this context, I would like to answer a specific question put to me by MrÂ DaulÂ â whom I would like to congratulate as chairman of the Committee of 33, together with all the rapporteurs who have made a broad consensus on your resolution possible.
For our part, we agree to the holding of a tripartite summit of the presidents of the three institutions to discuss the Lisbon Strategy.
I personally am willing to take part and I hope the President of Parliament and the president of the Council will back the idea.
As you know, our medium-term objective is that the three institutions should work together.
Having said that, the Lisbon Strategy would gain a lot if there were a greater sense that the institutions we represent were wholeheartedly behind it.
Now we are looking to the European Council in the expectation and, if I may say so, the certainty that it will, in turn, give the necessary political impetus to the relaunch of Lisbon and the preparation of a European strategy for growth and employment.
Many of you -Â MrÂ Karas, MrÂ Radwan, MrÂ Watson, MrÂ Titley, MrÂ HarbourÂ â have stressed how important it now is that the Member States should be committed.
Of course, the Commission now feels stronger due to the support which the European Parliament is giving to the new Lisbon Strategy.
The proposals made by ourselves and the European Parliament must not now be weakened when they come to be implemented, the Member States must also be able to commit themselves and national public opinion must understand that the new Lisbon Strategy is not purely decorative but is really at the heart of the programmes for economic reform, social cohesion and sustainable development in Europe.
In conclusion I must say that, for me, the great result of this debate is this willingness to work together, the possibility of reaching a dynamic consensus and also the broad support for the new Lisbon Strategy and, beyond that support, the fact that, for the next five years, it will be at the centre of the work done by our institutions and at the core of the reforms that will have to be undertaken by our Member States.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I have received three motions for resolutions(1) to end the debate pursuant to RuleÂ 103 of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place today at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  Mr President, I have an oral amendment.
I would like the second half of paragraph 11 to read as follows: âstresses that inclusion of the EDF in the budget of the European Union should be accompanied by reinforcement of the political role of the JPA in monitoring the funds committed to the framework of the ACP-EU partnershipâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have no problem with that and am happy to accept it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, for this amendment and the next two, which are exactly the same in that they propose deleting three words, I would suggest we keep the term 'systematic'.
Â Â  Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to withdraw AmendmentÂ 32 in favour of AmendmentÂ 27 by MrÂ MÃ©ndez De Vigo and MrÂ Lehne, as the two amendments have the same aim. We would therefore ask Members to vote in favour of AmendmentÂ 27 instead.
Â Â  AmendmentÂ 32 is therefore withdrawn in favour of AmendmentÂ 27, upon which we will vote presently.
Â Â  Mr President, it is extremely kind of you to state the name of the group when you call amendments.
I would, however, ask you to note that there is no longer a Liberal Group in this House; the group is now called the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
Â Â  I will be happy to bear this in mind, especially because the Sittings Service has asked me to avoid using shortened names for the groups, as I have been doing.
I will therefore do as you ask.
Â Â  I agree with you entirely, Mr DÃ©sir, that the words âon liberalisationâ have been included in the French version by mistake.
I should like to make this clear, and also to note that AmendmentÂ 29 falls.
Although the texts will in any case be checked later, the amendment falls because one of the two parts of AmendmentÂ 5 has been adopted.
Â Â  In my opinion, the fact that the first part of AmendmentÂ 5 by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has been adopted does not mean that AmendmentÂ 29 should fall.
Â Â  The amendments relate to the same words, MrÂ DÃ©sir, ânew initiativeâ and âinitiativeâ.
AmendmentÂ 29 falls, but your correction was relevant and an account of the whole matter will be given to the House.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like â with the agreement of my co-rapporteur, Mr DÃ©sir â to put an oral amendment that we think covers the topic better.
Perhaps I shall just read it out, in English: after âdemographic situationâ it reads:
âcalls on the Commission and the Member States to develop the necessary comprehensive measures in order to support schemes, as a way of supplementing existing national pension systemsâ.
What is new is the use of the term âcomplementary financingâ I ask the House to accept this oral amendment, which has been agreed by both the rapporteurs.
Â Â  I should like to thank my co-rapporteur, MrÂ Lehne, for having moved this oral amendment, and I should like to join him in asking the House to vote in favour of it.
Â Â  Mr President, a request has been made to hold a separate vote on the second part of Amendment 30, which seeks to delete two words.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament wishes to withdraw this part, and I hope that this will make it possible for us all to vote in favour of a more sustainable transport policy.
Â Â  I will therefore put AmendmentÂ 30, which now has only one part, to the vote.
Â Â  . â The relationship that has developed between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries deserves our recognition and our applause.
These countries have a special significance and importance for the great majority of the Member States in particular and for the whole European Union in general, both for historical reasons and also simply out of a sense of international responsibility.
Because this is an important and useful relationship, as reflected in the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, it must be both honest and consistent with the principles upheld and regularly demanded by the European Union.
Good relations between the two sides are not just desirable but essential, but they are only possible â and only useful â if based on a philosophy of upholding the values in which we believe and, consequently, if the European Union does not hesitate to criticise â and to act accordingly â in cases where the countries in question do not fulfil their duties towards the international community or towards their own citizens.
Relations have generally been like this, despite the disagreement that we have had occasion to express in cases such as Cuba or Angola.
Even so, I voted in favour of the report.
Â Â  . â The unanimous approval that this report received in committee illustrates the growing importance that all groups in Parliament, right and left alike, have been attributing to relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) parliaments and their members.
These relations are fundamental in a Europe that wants to be open to the world and is committed to strengthening dialogue with its strategic partners, along the lines of its historical ties.
I am pleased to note the significant progress that was made last year in the internal organisation, external action and institutional influence of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, and I hope it continues and grows even stronger.
I welcome the recognition of the fact that the topic of post-conflict situations needs to be addressed as a whole, and I am grateful for the trust placed in me as co-rapporteur on this subject.
Despite the grounds for contentment that I have mentioned, I must once again criticise the fact that the use of Portuguese and the availability of interpretation in this language â which, it must be remembered, is the third most spoken European language in world communications â are repeatedly passed over in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly sessions in favour of other languages (and very much minority languages in the ACP context), thus denying Portuguese-speaking parliamentarians a level playing field with the remaining members of the Assembly.
I voted for the report.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report in its entirety because, in many areas, it contains important improvements on the Commissionâs original proposal (for example, the elimination of the requirement of a double transformation process etc.).
We have objections, however, to Amendment 31 (Article 13, paragraph 1), since we believe that the scheme of generalised tariff preferences is an instrument for reducing global poverty and is not to be used to protect our European textile industry.
Â Â  . The system of generalised tariff preferences for developing countries is one more in a series of schemes promoting generalised preferences for foreign trade, and one more example of the way in which the European Unionâs customs duties are being abolished.
Claims are being made that this system works to the advantage of beneficiary countries, yet it is also acknowledged that the reform currently being proposed is not based on any evaluation of the way in which the previous system functions or how effective it is.
It is, however, easy to predict the negative effects this will have on the EUâs industry and agriculture. They include the following;
- zero or preferential customs duties will be granted for a larger number of products, which will mean that a great many sectors, including agriculture and fisheries, will face even harsher global competition,
- the market share that countries will be allowed before they lose their right to benefit from customs preferences will be so large that it will bring about the downfall of entire industrial sectors.
The textile industry will be particularly affected, as it will bear the brunt of the end of the quota system,
- safeguard measures are always inadequate and overly bureaucratic, and are never applied.
As usual, however, all the Commission is concerned about is pursuing an ideology that places trade above all else.
Impoverishing Europe and causing more Europeans to lose their jobs will not further the development of developing world countries.
It is for this reason that we will vote against this report.
Â Â  . â The current generalised system of preferences (GSP) is based on a way of thinking that embodies a contradiction: the idea that development can be promoted through the liberalisation of international trade â a model that promotes exports and is regulated at world level, with a âcentreâ and a âperipheryâ.
That way of thinking runs counter to fair international relations and to aid aimed at developing endogenous factors in the least economically developed countries.
Without such factors, and trapped between the robbery that is external debt and the imposed interests of the major US, EU and Japanese multinationals, those countries will continue to have a peripheral and subordinate status.
Trade is one component of development, but it is far from being the most important.
The GSP guarantees preferential access for products from about 178 countries.
The current proposal brings forward the schemeâs entry into force and opens up the GSP to particularly sensitive products for Portugal (tuna preserves, tomato concentrate, textiles and clothing).
Textiles and clothing are particularly badly affected, especially because there is a high graduation threshold for the sector.
That and other adverse aspects need to be reversed; otherwise there will be serious consequences for the countryâs manufacturing sector, with the social and economic fallout that will result from that.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs reform of the generalised system of preferences has been stepped up a gear, apparently because of the urgent need to support the economies of those countries hit by the tsunami of 26Â December 2004.
The plan is for the new system to come into force on 1Â April.
In the aftermath of the tsunami disaster, European citizens and States proved that their generosity could be counted upon.
Yet the Commission intends to make sectors of European industry that are experiencing difficulties, in particular the textile industry, pay a heavy price for this generosity.
The textile industry has been hit hard byÂ unfair competition from China, and this competition will only get worse. Yet the industry provides a livelihood for 2.5Â million people in Europe, and generates turnover of EUR 230Â billion.
The Commission intends to set a threshold of 12.5% of Community imports of these products before a country loses its entitlement to GSP, which will encourage competition from the Indian textile industry, as the latter will benefit from reduced duties. This industry is regarded as competitive under the current GSP, which sets a threshold of 10% before customs duties are introduced, or which in other words enables balanced competition despite differences in salaries and welfare conditions.
Making one sector of the economy pay the price of state aid flies in the face of liberal thinking. Such a move, which would make hundreds of thousands of people in Europe redundant, would also be antisocial.
Â Â  The generalised system of preferences for customs duties is over 30 years old.
The idea upon which it is based goes back even further, to the UNCTAD of 1963, which introduced the idea of compensatory differences, or what would today be called âpositive discrimination in the field of customs dutiesâ.
It would appear that poor countries, such as Peru or Colombia, have benefited from being able to send us their asparagus or prawns without having to pay customs duties, even if someÂ trade deflection has come about due to a lack of clarity over the rules of origin.
When looked at more closely, the GSP has something in common with the entire GATT and WTO system; it owes its existence to a redundant theory, namely that customs duties should be reduced with the aim of ultimately abolishing them.
A more innovative idea would be to introduce a system for deducting customs duties.
The exporter would be granted a customs credit in the importing country equivalent to the customs duties that had been imposed and that would be deductible on purchases made in the importing country.
Funding for these customs credits could be raised on a forward stock market.
The problem of economic and social inequality would be resolved, and a balance would be achieved in global trade.
Â Â  . â The scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) must be understood both as an instrument of trade policy and as an instrument supporting development, since international trade is undoubtedly one of the most powerful drivers of development and growth in any economy.
In that context, and as the rapporteur explicitly mentions in his explanatory statement, âthe GSP therefore needs to be consistent with development policy objectives and compatible with the Doha Programmeâ.
The Doha Round is, indeed, an important ongoing step towards a more open and fairer world economy and, as the rapporteur proposes, that understanding must be present in the GSP.
Lastly, I consider that the speed with which the GSP was amended to respond to the effects of the tsunami should be applauded.
Â Â  . â The graduation mechanism that has been introduced makes it possible to stop applying the generalised system of preferences (GSP) to countries that are competitive in the Community market and no longer need the preferences scheme to promote their exports.
Furthermore, the mechanism also plays an essential role in regulating the commercial influx of textile and clothing products, and that is proving extremely important in protecting Europeâs textile industry in view of the abolition of quotas on 31 December 2004.
I also realise that one of the areas where sustainable development is promoted is in improving the economic situation of developing countries, especially those countries that are least integrated into the international trading system.
Consequently, the most vulnerable developing countries that take on special duties and responsibilities as a result of ratifying and applying the basic conventions on human and workersâ rights will benefit from additional tariff preferences within the GSP, something that I warmly welcome.
Lastly, I wish to highlight the simplification achieved by cutting the number of arrangements from five to three, so that now there is a general arrangement, a special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, and a special arrangement for the least developed countries (âEverything but Armsâ â EBA).
I voted for the report.
Â Â  . âI and my British Conservative colleagues have supported the report by Mr. Dombrovskis on the Budget Guidelines for 2006 because we believe it is a step in the right direction.
We approve of using appropriations in a more efficient way, of demanding more clarity in the breakdown of each submitted budget proposal, and in stating that it costs more than â¬200 million per year to site the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg.
This is a gross waste of taxpayers' money!
However, reform of the EU budget is essential.
Fraud and maladministration can only be tackled if the right structures are put in place and so far this has been slow and inadequate.
There must be better accountability and transparency in the spending of appropriations by all the EU institutions and a commitment by Member States to account adequately for all expenditure on EU programmes.â
Â Â  . I think it is imperative we foresee sufficient expenditures in areas where political decisions require greater financial engagement, in order to make amending budgets and transfers superfluous.
For example, the budget for the parliamentary dimension of the WTO should cover all expenditure for the European Parliament's delegations to WTO Ministerial conferences as well as expenditure relating to the organisation of the Parliamentary Conference on the WTO
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Dombrovskis(A6-0043/2005)on the guidelines for Sections II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII (A) and VIII (B) and on the European Parliament's preliminary draft estimates (Section I) for the 2006 budgetary procedure, because I agree with the thrust of the evaluations and proposals before us, and, in particular, the consolidation and preparation for the next enlargement and the efficient and rational use of appropriations.
I should also like to point out that I agree with the specific points relating to vocational training, especially in the area of translation and interpretation.
In my opinion, it is essential that Members of this House take part actively in their mother tongue, thereby ensuring a level playing field for all Members.
Lastly, I should like to highlight Parliamentâs increased responsibility in legislative decision-making, which will obviously require better management of existing resources and the allocation of more funding to support our work.
Â Â  . The report before us highlights the areas in which it is important to guarantee that available appropriations will be increased and properly used.
The challenge of enlargement unquestionably requires renewed and determined effort, and, as such, we must accommodate new staff within the institutionsâ structure as swiftly as possible â the same swiftness that we are requesting of the Secretary-General â and must allocate funding to increase the number of interpreters and to improve general working conditions in the committees by increasing the number of rooms and computers available.
The plan to clarify the nomenclatures of the other institutions' budgets is to be welcomed.
The transparency and intelligibility of data â as I have said on previous occasions â are essential prerequisites of accountability and efficiency as regards budgetary matters.
I welcome the proposal to adopt ecological efficiency standards in administrative management, and the call to adopt much more ambitious information and communication policies.
This is, indeed, one of the things that I often fight for in each budget, given that it strikes me as essential that we bring Europe â its projects, its designs and its actions â ever closer to the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to draw the attention of the House to two matters being considered by the Committee on Petitions at the moment.
The first concerns Mike and Ann Radford, two constituents of mine from Chipping Barnet, who bought a property in Cyprus in the 1980s and for 14 years have been trying to get redress from their builder for a faulty retaining wall.
This is a matter which the Committee on Petitions has under consideration.
I would urge the committee to do all it can to address the concerns of Mr and Mrs Radford, their neighbours and people who find themselves in similar situations in many parts of Europe.
Consumer disputes of this kind are deeply problematic and painful for the people involved and I hope the Committee on Petitions can help.
Secondly, on Equitable Life, my constituent, Arthur White, has submitted a petition highlighting the regulatory failings that occurred in relation to Equitable Life.
Again, I would urge the Committee on Petitions to speed up its consideration of this important matter and do all it can to ensure that the petitioners get justice and redress.
Â Â  . Good democracy is founded on absolute respect for the citizensâ rights, and that respect historically encompasses the citizensâ right to table petitions to parliaments.
This practice, which might at times appear to be of little use, is above all a sign of democratic humility and readiness to listen to the citizens, which are characteristics of prime importance in a democratic society.
Accordingly, we must publicly acknowledge the existence of the Committee on Petitions in Parliament and the work that it does.
Â Â  . The most oft-heard criticism of the current state of the process of European integration is the divorce between the decision-makers and the citizens, the so-called democratic deficit.
Given that, in parliamentary terms, the Committee on Petitions constitutes a fruitful way of strengthening contact with the populations, its work ought to be strengthened, as this would encourage people to become involved in European affairs.
I feel that this offers the major benefit of, on the one hand, bringing to light the real concerns and anxieties of the people and, on the other, enabling politicians to show to those interested the work that they have done and to show that they are prepared to work to address the real needs of their citizens.
In this context, I wish to express my disappointment that due attention was not paid to the petition calling for the inclusion of a reference to Europeâs Christian heritage in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, and that, as such, the wishes of the million-plus people throughout Europe who signed the petition were completely disregarded.
Lastly, I feel that the Committee on Petitions would benefit from increased resources and effective and balanced support from both the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  . Along with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the large majority in this House, I voted in favour of this report, because it presents guidelines and measures that will enable us to revitalise the Lisbon Strategy, to improve its implementation and to meet the objectives set in 2000.
As I have always advocated:
- It provides for greater involvement in the process of decision-making and implementation for Parliament (âa real culture of dialogue should be developed with the Parliamentâ), alongside the Commission (with which a âstrong partnershipâ should be established) and the Council (it is proposed that tripartite meetings should be held between the three Institutions), and the national parliaments (with which Parliament should also establish a âstrong partnershipâ), as well as âincreased involvement of regional and local authoritiesâ; and
- It calls for budgetary resources at national and Community level to be commensurate with the objectives set within the scope of the Lisbon Agenda; this must be reflected in the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 and in the Structural Funds, as reworked within the framework of the cohesion policy.
In addition, the reviewed Lisbon Strategy will constitute the instrument used to implement the desired change to the economic and social development model that has until now been followed in the Madeira region.
Â Â  .
The Lisbon Strategyâs goal was to make Europe âthe most competitive knowledge-based economy in the worldâ by 2010.
It has entirely failed to do so; instead, Brussels bureaucrats have succeeded in turning the European Union into the least dynamic economy in the world. A special mention should also be given to the euro zone, which is performing even worse than the rest of the EU.
Brussels will never admit that it is to blame, of course, as the EU never questions its own actions.

Its proposals for solving these problems consist of even more Europeanisation â more market liberalisation, more regulatory constraints on firms, fewer public services, more European and global competition, less public funding and less welfare protection.
The social and environmental goals of the Lisbon Strategy mark one have been done away with, and all-encompassing competition and productivity put in their place.
People have become commodities, and the idea is that the market will shuffle them around and take care of unemployment.
The Barroso Commissionâs proposals are nothing short of a nightmare.
They admittedly take a âsoftâ approach, as all they consist of is a programme and objectives, some of which even make sense.
Yet we are only too familiar with the actual directives which transpose programmes of this kind, and which attempt to implement their objectives; the Bolkestein directive is an excellent example.
Â Â  This draft resolution is a confused mass of text in which everything that any civilised person would want to see implemented is considered without the least regard to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Nobody would oppose efforts to counter and eliminate poverty and unemployment as soon as possible.
Nobody would object to having taxes that are simple and fair rather than complicated and unfair.
Nonetheless, the principle of subsidiarity â which is supposed to be a guiding principle of EU cooperation â means that the Member States should have the right to weigh up differently the conflicting objectives that democratic government has to deal with.
The underlying purpose of this draft is to shift even more political decisions from the Member States to the institutions of the EU.
The June List has been mandated by its electorate to oppose such centralisation of power in Europe and therefore rejects the draft in its entirety.
Moreover, we have opposed several amendments that we would in principle support in the Swedish Parliament, but which we oppose at EU level out of concern for democracy in the Member States.
This applies in the case of Amendment 32, for example.
Â Â  . âI and my Conservative colleagues' voting decision on the resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda is based on the need for economic reform, greater labour market flexibility, more competitive taxation policies and reduced barriers to employment growth, particularly the excessive regulation that pervades many European economies.
Of course, the US continues to out-perform Europe and the competitive challenges from Asia, particularly China and India, are increasing with no apparent urgent response from national capitals in the EU.
The Council Presidency must not be distracted by calls for the preservation of the completely outdated âEuropean Social Modelâ.
It is precisely because so many governments have failed to grasp the nettle on reform that the Lisbon process has sadly, to date, failed in key areas.
Competitive taxation policies, flexible labour markets, less red tape and a determination to tip the balance firmly in favour of the wealth creators offers the only way out of Europe's relative economic decline.
Those things are anathema to Socialists, but vital for all of us.
We have voted against a number of amendments that would undermine the market and enterprise driven policies that we believe a revised Lisbon agenda should champion.â
Â Â  I fully subscribe to the Lisbon goals of strengthening employment, economic reform, enhancing competitiveness, completing the internal market, Social Cohesion and environmental protection as engines of a sustainable growth-orientated economy.
In order to build a broad coalition for change, the Lisbon Strategy must be universally understood as a strategy whose benefits will be widely shared and developed in cooperation with all relevant socio-economic actors, which looks for labour markets which promote both dynamism and security, which seeks to modernise, but not to weaken, social security, and which sees high social and environmental standards as part of Europe's competitive model.
I believe that to revitalise the Lisbon strategy is essential in order to address the failure of living up to the goals of March 2000.
I welcome this opportunity to support the idea of national action plans as a way of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, with every government nominating a minister to coordinate action.
Â Â  . Between the illusion that all you have to do is to state an objective and it will be met, and the reality that the European economy has not been able to deal with the current economic crisis, there lies a Union made up of different economic and social realities, a Union that repeatedly states its good intentions yet has had little success in solving its problems.
Having said that, it cannot be denied that Europe is the best continent to live in.
Accordingly, if Europe wants to be the most competitive economy, we need to alter the route that we have been taking.
This must be done without losing our best features and our core elements, and ensuring respect for the historical and cultural diversity and the varied levels of development across the countries of Europe.
I therefore believe that the resolution before us articulates a vision that I share: sustainable growth and employment must be the EUâs most pressing objectives and achieving those objectives will promote environmental and social progress.
There can be no European social model without a European economy, and there is also no point in having a competitive economy that does not serve the interests of the citizens.
Â Â  . The mid-term review before us is characterised by the conclusions of the last Brussels Spring European Council, which were that results have been modest in terms of the targets that were set.
The stagnation affecting the European economy since 2000 has certainly not helped.
Otherwise, apart from asking for greater determination on the part of the Commission, the proposed text confines itself to reiterating principles laid down in the original strategy.
Our orientations are, and have always been, sustainable development, social cohesion, improved working conditions, more jobs, continuing or dynamic training and economic competitiveness.
Unfortunately, however, those orientations continue to be held back by the alienation of many states and citizens.
I therefore regret that another opportunity to combine financial discipline and budgetary austerity, on the one hand, with the necessary importance attached to the nature and quality of public spending, on the other, fell by the wayside at the last ECOFIN meeting.
We must also improve the regulations and the legislative environment, by simplifying them.
Lastly, I feel that we need a substantially more realistic outlook that is not confined to condemning failure and repeatedly justifying everything by accusing the Member States of a lack of motivation and of non-compliance.
We need creativity, leadership and determination, which is the main thrust of this resolution and which persuaded me to vote in favour.
Â Â  . Today we are to vote on the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy.
At a time when 68 million of our fellow citizens in the European Union are still living in poverty, the only option open to us is to endorse the Lisbon Strategy adopted in 2000 and to reiterate the goal of eliminating poverty.
Progress has been made in certain areas, such as the National Action Plans on Social Inclusion and the incorporation of the fight against poverty as a goal in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Yet we cannot stop there; we owe it to our fellow citizens to stay the course. They expect us to make good on our promises, and I would urge that all the necessary measures be put in place at the Spring Summit.
Â Â  . I am glad to see that the Lisbon strategy also covers the use of all forms of alternative energy, which must therefore be promoted accordingly.
While we are all aware that their use protects the environment and helps with compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the positive effects of their use include, among many others, increased competitiveness, added regional value and the creation of jobs in rural areas.
I am therefore glad that the European Parliament, as stated in its motion for a resolution, believes that a competitive and sustainable European economy is conditional upon the use of sustainable energy sources.
Â Â  . As a result of the realistic picture painted by Mr Kok in the mid-term review, the Commission decided to take stock and table a reform of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
The priorities set in 2000 have been redefined on the basis of the ongoing concerns of European citizens, namely growth and jobs.
In this new reality, those responsible for each measure are identified, practical deadlines are set and progress is assessed.
The next step is a single national programme and the appointment of a âLisbon Czarâ for each Member State, who will be responsible for monitoring the actions of the Lisbon Strategy and for simplifying methods of assessment.
Given that this is an intergovernmental matter, the âLisbon Strategyâ depends almost entirely on the Member Statesâ ability and commitment to carry out far-reaching structural reforms.
Following the review of the Strategy, the Member States must set clearer priorities and work to a strict timetable if the Lisbon Strategy is to be a success story.
At the moment, the Lisbon Strategy must come across as pie in the sky to most European citizens.
EU history is replete with stories of this nature.
In the 1980s, nobody believed that the single market and the single currency would be successful.
I wish the âLisbon Strategyâ similar success.
Â Â  . â The European Parliament adopted the resolution on the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy with the vote of the PPE-DE, the social democrats, the liberals and other conservative political forces, who put any minor differences between them to one side and united on the strategic objective of the Lisbon treaty.
In the name of the competitiveness of the economy of united Europe (in other words of its monopolies), an unprecedented attack has been unleashed on the employment and social rights of the grass-roots classes.
I refer to the violent redistribution of workers' income for the benefit of big business, with reductions in the salaries of workers and those entering retirement, the abolition of welfare payments and reductions in benefits, privatisations and so on. The aim is to use so-called active forms of employment in order to extend flexible forms of work and push back the retirement age; in other words, to create cheap, flexible manpower which will be easy prey for exploitation by the monopolies with impunity.
The parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution, which accepts the full frontal attack on the working and other grass-roots classes and demonstrates the class orientation of the ÎU.
There can be no self-delusion as to the importance of the Lisbon strategy.
The organised resistance, disobedience and fight of the majority of the grass-roots classes in the ÎU against the Lisbon anti-labour strategy is the only way out.
Â Â  The resolution concerning the Lisbon Strategy contains much that is commendable.
Nonetheless, I should like to have seen even greater emphasis on the importance of policy integration; that is to say the fact that growth initiatives must take place in forms in which careful consideration is given to the social and environmental consequences.
These three dimensions of development must be mutually supportive.
The idea of âgrowth first â we can deal with the rest afterwardsâ is wrong and represents an unfortunate return to the debate that took place prior to the EUâs adoption of its sustainability strategy in Gothenburg in 2001.
The EU faces a number of difficult challenges in the area of the environment.
The risk of irreversible climate change is particularly serious.
To address this problem we need to rethink our energy and transport systems in Europe, and this is something that must primarily take place through substantial investment in innovation and the development of new technology.
Such investment would stimulate growth and create new job opportunities.
At the same time, European countries would develop top-level expertise in an area in which the entire world is crying out for new solutions.
Neither the Commissionâs proposal nor Parliamentâs resolution puts sufficient emphasis on these aspects.
It is my hope that the European Council will pay far more attention to these issues in its sitting on 22 March.
Â Â  That concludes voting time. The sitting is suspended.
Â Â  Â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 22-23Â MarchÂ 2005).
Â Â  . Mr President, it has been agreed that the European Council of 22 March will focus on the Lisbon Strategy, which was the subject of our debate this morning, as well as on the Stability and Growth Pact, even if there is still a chance that this issue may be settled before the European Council meets.
The Council will also discuss the sustainable development strategy and the Kyoto Protocol.
In view of the fact that the Lisbon Strategy was discussed in this morningâs sitting, I do not intend to return to it again now.
Instead, I will focus on the other two or three topics.
The first of these is the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Council has been debating reform of the Stability and Growth Pact for some time now, and indeed there are those who probably feel that it has been debating it for too long.
It was discussed on several occasions during the Dutch Presidency, and every Ecofin meeting under the Luxembourg Presidency has taken the issue as its central focus.
In view of this in-depth debate and the changes requested by the finance ministers, on 8 March the Presidency presented a document to Ecofin aimed at finding a balanced solution that would meet the needs of all the Member States. It does so by proposing a compromise which is founded on good economic sense â an issue which was also debated by the House this morning â and whichÂ provides an answer to the real need for increased flexibility during difficult periods, as well as calling for tighter budgetary discipline during times of growth and prosperity.
As the Ecofin Council was unable to reach an agreement on a report to the European Council during its meeting of 8Â March, the Presidency will continue talks with the aim of finding a solution that is acceptable to everyone and that can be presented to the Heads of State or Government.
Another meeting of the Ecofin Council has been called for 20Â March, or in other words two days before the European Council meets.
This morning I mentioned that a failure to reach an agreement would entail real and significant risks.
It is an unfortunate fact that the current Pact would not simply be applied as though nothing had happened, and that failure to reach an agreement would not boost the credibility of the current Pact.
At the same time, however, a compromise at all costs â a cut-price compromise, one could say â would be an equally poor solution.
Furthermore, this is an area where Europe is under close observation, first and foremost by the citizens, who expect their decision-makers to be able to pursue economic and budgetary policies that sacrifice neither growth to stability, nor stability to a growth that is at best short-lived.
We should not yet resign ourselves to failure, however, as there is still every chance that a balanced and credible solution may be reached.
If we achieve such a solution, which we very much hope to do, the Commission will be provided with a clear mandate regarding the improvements the Member States have agreed to make to the Pact, and the procedures necessary for a formal revision of the Pactâs provisions can then be set in motion.
Revision of either of the two regulations will entail a Commission proposal and the involvement of Parliament in accordance with the rules set out in the Treaties, which are in fact different forÂ each of the regulations.
I will now move on to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol, both of which are obviously also closely linked to the Lisbon Strategy, given that this morning we came to the conclusion that the environmental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy should beÂ retained or even given extra weight.
It is therefore quite natural that the European Council should also deal with issues relating to sustainable development and the Kyoto Protocol.
The Presidency believes that sustainable development should be an overarching concept, and one of the aims of the European Council will be to clarify how changes to the sustainable development strategy should be tackled in future.
For example, the guiding principles of sustainable development could be enshrined in a charter, one of the main components of which would be a series of relevant indicators to be used in the various policies in the future.
The Commission could submit a proposal to this effect to the European Council to be held in June.
Time is short, however, and in our opinion it would be a good idea if the new sustainable development strategy were to be finalised and presented before the end of the year.
We all agree that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and that it has a major impact in environmental, economic and social terms.
We were therefore delighted when theÂ Kyoto Protocol came into force, and we are also delighted that the Russian Federation has ratified the Protocol.
It is our firm intention to give new impetus to international negotiations.
In order to do so, our first task will be toÂ examine the options that exist for a UN-led post-2012 regime that would ensure that the highest possible level of cooperation was achieved from all countries.
This weekâs Environment Council will focus on this issue, and should come to some kind of conclusion. It will then be necessary to draft a long-term strategy for the European Union, the aim of which should be to stop emissions from exceeding the much-quoted 2ÂºC increase in temperature and to reduce total emissions from 30% to 15% against 1990 levels by 2020.
Finally, a study should be drafted with the aim of achieving a good cost-benefit ratio for all of these measures. It should be plain to everyone that the European Council has a very full agenda; it will deal with issues that are of major significance for the future of the European Union, yet at the same time it will also reassure Europeans that this Europe of ours is concerned about their present and future problems.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we discussed in detail the new strategy for growth and jobs and managed to achieve perfect convergence between Parliament and the Commission.
I believe that, in this area too, the forthcoming European Council has a crucial role to play in implementing this ambitious strategy and we must not miss this opportunity.
This European Council comes at a very important time, firstly because it is taking place just as a new Parliament and a new Commission are starting to find their feet and to set out their working methods for the next few years, and also because a wide-ranging debate on the ratification of the Constitution is due to take place, a debate that will focus on the type of Europe that we want and the type of Europe that we are capable of building for our fellow citizens.
Accordingly, we must demonstrate at the forthcoming European Council that the EU is actually working and that the EU is capable of successfully launching new initiatives that produce tangible results in the lives of Europeâs citizens.
Let me single out the two main deliverables for this European Council.
First, there is the need to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy and to re-focus it on growth and jobs in order to bring our wider economic, social and environmental objectives within reach.
This requires more than just words.
People need to see a real commitment from Member States.
That is why our new approach to working to support Members States in delivering on the Lisbon objectives is critical.
Second, we must ensure that a stronger Stability and Growth Pact emerges from the summit with its credibility reinforced.
Both these goals are well within our grasp, and I would like to comment on each one in turn.
In relation to Lisbon, I would simply emphasise the importance of giving fresh momentum to the process of reform.
That is why the European Council should make a clear commitment to the new governance mechanisms, the new integrated guidelines and the national and EU Lisbon programmes, with simple reporting and better coordination of reforms at a national level.
The launch and follow-up to the renewed Lisbon approach must be prepared via close cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament.
I shall now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that operation of the Stability and Growth Pact has recently experienced problems.
Differing interpretations of the Treaty and of the Stability Pact have led to uncertainties over the methods of budgetary supervision.
We need an interpretation which can ensure the pactâs effectiveness and credibility, without the need to re-write the pact itself.
Yesterdayâs ECOFIN discussions were inconclusive.
The Presidency has opted to hold a further meeting of ministers prior to the European Council.
Nonetheless, I continue to hope that the spring summit can unveil a renewed and more credible pact, based on a comprehensive, consistent and balanced solution.
The Commission will continue to fight for the principles it submitted, in particular for reform of the pact.
The deficit and debt benchmarks set out in the Treaty must continue to be complied with as the cornerstone of the system.
The preventive aspect of the pact can be improved, in particular by defining medium-term budgetary targets specific to each country.
When the economic situation is buoyant, budgetary policy must remain sound.
Excessive deficits must be identified unambiguously and corrected rapidly.
However, the timescale for the correction could take account of economic factors.
As for the Commission, it will continue to make all possible efforts with the Presidency and Member States to reach an agreement â but not an agreement at any price.
The Councilâs conclusions will also cover other important issues.
On some of them, such as sustainable development and climate change, it is also vital to reach agreement if we are to use the Lisbon reforms to underpin sustainable growth.
I await with interest the political impetus to come from the European Council towards a European charter for sustainable development, which the Commission will certainly follow up and support.
Finally, we shall certainly review the latest developments in the Middle East and Iraq, and shall examine the progress made in preparation for the next round of enlargement and any future negotiations.
MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I will close by saying that this summit is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss.
It must set the tone for future reforms by relaunching Lisbon and reinforcing the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact.
As we said this morning, the two are linked.
What is at stake here is our credibility, and the way we demonstrate to European citizens that we are seriously concerned for the future of Europe and determined to work towards that end.
The public, the electorate, would simply not understand if we were unable to achieve a breakthrough, or if the summit ended not with a success but with winners and losers.
Any fine distinctions we may wish to introduce in areas such as which institution does what, or whether the new Lisbon strategy is more to the left, right or centre, will be irrelevant to the majority of our citizens.
For them, the issue is Europe, not one particular institution or another or one particular aspect or another.
It is therefore extremely important to send a consistent message and to show that we are really working together in the interests of our Europe.
Projecting an image of disharmony between institutions or conveying a tentative or pessimistic message on the future of Europe would inevitably have a negative effect on public opinion, something particularly dangerous at a time when the constitutional treaty is going through the ratification process.
However, I believe we have a first-rate chance of success.
We have a competent and determined Presidency.
We have a Commission which is making its very best efforts.
We are achieving an important victory today by showing our shared determination to achieve a new Lisbon strategy.
We have demonstrated today that it is genuinely possible to reach a stronger and dynamic consensus.
It is therefore vital to show the European Council that we can assist Europe in moving up to a higher gear.
We can launch the reform process and begin to mobilise opinion in favour of a European renewal.
That is what is at stake at the spring meeting of the European Council â to ensure that our vision is translated into action.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the ECOFIN meeting at the beginning of this week has still not finally resolved the issue of how the stability criteria are to be evaluated in the future, I do very much hope that the finance ministers will nevertheless come to an agreement before the European Council.
For my own part, I remain convinced that the foundations of the Stability and Growth Pact must not be tampered with.
The current threshold values â 3% for new debt and 60% for outstanding debt, measured in terms of gross national product â are so closely entwined with the euroâs exchange rate that they must be retained if the single currency is to be kept stable and solid.
It is also fundamental to the Pact that a stateâs budget should be considered as a single whole when assessing compliance with the criteria; this is not just prescribed by general budgetary law, but also enjoined upon us by sound human reason.
A single, integral budget cannot be evaluated both with and without whole categories of expenditure.
That is why we cannot have the situation in which categories of expenditure that some Member States regard as special burdens are excluded when assessing to what degree the stability criteria have been adhered to.
After all, the Pact â containing as it does also a substantial growth component â does make provision for the possible nuanced valuation of a national budget in the light of the countryâs current position in the economic cycle.
For that reason, the current procedures have to be retained, while making their detailed course and consequences dependent on the realities of budget policy, and this â as I told the House a few weeks ago â for the reason that the Pact is called a âStability and Growth Pactâ and excessive stability must not be allowed to hamper growth rather than it being stimulated.
The ECOFIN Council has listed possible approaches to a more finely-honed evaluation of the nation statesâ efforts at achieving stability.
I very much hope that some of these will prove the key to bringing about a final agreement prior to the summit on 22 and 23 March.
Let me now just say something else about the Lisbon strategy.
The disappointing results at the end of its first half are, in essence, attributable to a too widely-dispersed range of goals.
That is why, if we are to end up with tangible successes after the next five years, we need to concentrate on a number of essential objectives, and so I am in favour of an approach that relies more than hitherto on the nation states implementing the Lisbon requirements.
This allows a certain degree of competition around what are termed âbest practicesâ that can in fact do nothing but good in terms of the strategyâs overall success.
In future, we should cut the really big announcements down to size if it is not absolutely certain that they will actually be implemented.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I just want to make a brief comment on the Stability and Growth Pact.
If I consider it as an economist â which is what I was trained to be â then there are many countries that make a success of things without stability rules; the USA is often quoted as an example.
There are countries that strictly observe stability rules and achieve but little success, and the reverse also occurs.
From an economic point of view, then, a variety of approaches are possible, but there are good reasons why we, having established ourselves as a community and now being desirous of creating a single market, should equip ourselves with a Stability and Growth Pact of this kind, the most important of these being the introduction of the euro.

Despite the many prophecies of doom, originating not least from this House, we have ended up with a strong euro â it could even be described as too strong, and that is why now is very definitely the time to rearrange matters; not, though, by abandoning the Stability and Growth Pact, but by taking into account economic conditions in the individual countries.
What is needed is not special arrangements for Germany, but the recognition that special economic conditions can occur in any of our Member States.
Once such a change is made, it does of course follow that every country â whether Germany or some other â must abide by the rules.
Some account should also be taken of the fact that Germany is still the European Unionâs main paymaster.
With this in mind, I regard the Luxembourg Presidencyâs proposals as very, very worthwhile, and I hope that they will prove to be a successful solution.
I hope that the Commission and its President will be able to help us on our way to a real solution.
Second only to that solution and to the boosting of the Lisbon process, we need two things: closer coordination of general growth and economic policy between the individual countries, and a solution to the financial perspectives, if at all possible before Luxembourg vacates the presidency.
I know that a heavy burden rests upon your shoulders â not, perhaps, broad ones in terms of your country â but I do hope you will be able to sort this out.
In any case â and I am speaking on my groupâs behalf when I say this â we wish the Luxembourg Presidency much success.
It has brought with it all that is needed to resolve this issue with, not least, a new and rational reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Â Â  MrÂ President, with the Lisbon strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact, the prime focus of the forthcoming spring meeting of the European Council will be issues of economic policy.
With unemployment at 9% in Europe and a growth forecast of only 1.6% in the euro zone, it is perfectly clear that the time for talking is over and we need to take fundamental action in order to relaunch growth and employment.
We need shared budgetary discipline.
We must reaffirm that clearly so that there can be no doubt in anyoneâs mind.
It is the responsibility of each Member State to control public expenditure, to act to reduce their deficit and to stabilise or even cut the debt burden.
Failing this, future generations will bear the cost, and the more the Member States try to circumvent the rules which they themselves introduced, the more they will destabilise the system as a whole.
If we have rules, we obviously need to ensure they are adhered to.
If not, they serve no purpose.
It is only when we have agreed on these basic, common-sense principles that we can open the debate on possible changes in the pact.
Moreover, these changes must take account of the nature of economic cycles and the necessary distinction between an operating deficit and an investment deficit.
There is another and even more important question facing us: can we live in the longer term with common budgetary discipline while at the same time operating different economic policies?
In my view, the answer is no.
I believe we must urgently decide to coordinate our economic policies, failing which we shall never be able to generate our own growth.
We are fortunate in having a President of the European Council who is simultaneously the Eurogroup President.
Let us, therefore, take advantage of it.
The time is now ripe â it is now or never â to introduce economic governance which is so lacking in Europe and to take initiatives which will finally get things moving.
We propose that the major investment for the future should be made on a European scale.
I am thinking, for instance, of defence, research or major infrastructure investment.
We are lagging far behind in this area and I think the time has come to change that â or at least to make an attempt to do so.
There you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
Of course we will need ambition, determination and courage, but I am sure of one thing: none of us acting alone and in isolation can achieve it.
If we want to create growth and employment, if we want to continue to implement an innovative social model, the only solution is to do more at European level.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, MrÂ President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President, on the issue of the Stability and Growth Pact, our group unequivocally backs the efforts of the Luxembourg Presidency and, in particular, supports the idea of a list of relevant factors, as indicated by MrÂ Juncker.
I believe we need to make progress towards greater differentiation of the national economies, particularly by reference to their debt levels and the demands placed on them.
Therefore, we agree on an explicit list of factors which â to borrow Mr Prodiâs expression â would render a political and more intelligent assessment of the Stability Pact possible.
Having said that, reform of the pact still falls short of a European coordination of budgetary policy â Mrs de Sarnez just referred to this.
On this point, I would say to the Council that the statement I read after the ECOFIN Council, in particular to the effect that an agreement reached within the euro zone by the 12 Member States would not necessarily be ratified by all members of the Council, namely by all 25 Member States, constitutes, in my view, an extremely worrying signal from a political standpoint.
From this point of view, the triangle to which Mr Juncker referred at the start of the Luxembourg Presidency when discussing the Lisbon strategy, the Stability Pact and the financial perspective, makes a lot of sense.
I believe that interpretation of the Stability Pact should echo the readiness of Member States to make extra budgetary efforts in order to obtain a financial perspective and a European Union budget fit for purpose and able to deliver the objectives we should like it to achieve.
From this point of view, the political timing is not particularly good, since we are asking the spring meeting of the European Council to reach agreement on Lisbon and on the Stability Pact, while possibly postponing the debate on the financial perspective until June.
However, I believe that this danger of a rift between the new Member States, in particular, and the old Member States is a political risk which should not be underestimated in this whole debate.
Finally, with regard to sustainable development, I am quite surprised by, let us call it, the superficiality of the proposition.
The European Commission has issued a report on the Community strategy for sustainable development which therefore concerns the Unionâs sectoral policies.
This report is highly critical.
It is honest enough to be extremely critical.
Therefore, if the major political impetus which Mr Barroso is expecting and which we, too, are hoping for from the Council consists merely of saying, âwe plan to draw up a European chart of indicatorsâ â we would say: is that all? All you need to do is to look at the European Environment Agencyâs reports and you will have your indicators.
We are expecting a great deal more; we are expecting much more restrictive targets to be set in the areas of transport policy, energy policy and the Kyoto commitments.
It is no longer enough to keep going back to the question of the indicators saying, in the morning, âwe want fewer indicatorsââ, and in the afternoon, âwe want moreâ.
What exactly do we want?
We want successful policies and we want the Commission and Council to abide seriously by the Gothenburg commitments.

Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel, quite frankly, that the debate in this Chamber is rather paradoxical, since we are taking a fragmented approach to issues such as the Lisbon Strategy, the Financial Perspectives, the forthcoming European Council and the possible ways to reform the Stability and Growth Pact.
The last, by the way, is an issue on which everyone except Parliament is taking action.
I believe, instead, that these aspects should all be dealt with together.
Indeed, social cohesion and growth in the number and quality of jobs have certainly not been facilitated by policies focusing on competitiveness, nor by monetarist policies.
These have even been enshrined in the new Constitutional Treaty, the only case in history where a constitution includes a monetary treaty.
We are confronted by the paradox of a Europe with a very strong currency but a weak economy in a deepening crisis and a society in great difficulty.
There is a growing number of factors that are likely to make the situation even worse, such as those implicit in the Bolkestein directive, in the European budget cuts and in the false flexibility of the Stability Pact, which some would like to see used only to downgrade pensions.
That has all led to a Europe of social fragmentation, relocations and the inevitable decline in its social and cultural model.
We have to set off along a new path, one that breaks with economics and monetarism, is based on an upward harmonisation of rights and wage levels and provides new impetus for quality development.
To achieve that, it is necessary on the left to break out of the Stability Pact straitjacket so as to invest within individual countries â but also directly as the European Union â in research, innovation and whatever else is needed to promote development.
What we need, therefore, is a different Europe, a social Europe, the kind of Europe that we shall be demanding at the European demonstration in Brussels on 19 March.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for agreeing to complete openness concerning 3Â 000 working groups.
For the first time, we can now see the list of the groups.
It can be found on the Commissionâs website or, even easier, can be downloaded from my website at bonde.com.
MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m, the Vice-President of the Commission, yesterday agreed that we can also have the names of the participants.
Thank you.
Now, we shall soon see whether those advising the Commission on smoking are from the tobacco industry or from groups working to combat cancer.
I would also like to thank the Commission for agreeing that in future we can find out about all the contributions from the Commission to the Council of Ministers and its working groups.
Eighty-five per cent of all legislation is finally completed in 300 working groups and in Coreper.
Until now, we have been excluded from the majority of this legislation.
Now, we have been promised the greatest reform in openness to date.
I am as happy as a little boy on Christmas Day, because I have been working towards such openness for many years.
Thank you.
It is almost too good to be true.
Now it is your turn over in the Council.
My dear Council of Ministers, can the Luxembourg Presidency not ask that the 300 working groups dealing with legislation be laid open to Parliament?
It is humiliating that elected representatives must always beg for the documents in a corridor or from a lobbyist or from a student at one of the permanent representations, or from the ambassador or from the actual minister.
When we sit on the committees and deal with the draft legislation, officially we have only the original draft from the Commission, while the Councilâs working group is sitting looking at edition 17 â which we cannot legally obtain.
Officials and trainees sit behind us at the committee meetings with the latest edition of the draft legislation, but what about the members of the committee themselves?
We have the electorateâs vote, but we lack the confidence of the Council of Ministers.
Now we will get the Commissionâs new drafts while the legislation is being discussed.
When will we have the opportunity to thank you in the Council for what would be the most natural thing of all?
In democracies, those exercising power are responsible to the elected representatives; in democracies, there is nobody above or equal to the electorate and their directly elected representatives.
Thank you, Mr President, especially if the Council will give us a little more to say thank you for.
Â Â  . I wish to thank the President-in-Office and the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, for their presentations.
This Parliament has often taken a very narrow viewpoint with regard to the future development of the European economy and the European social model, whereas experience should have taught us that each action we take has an immediate effect on other areas.
Therefore, we can no longer speak of exclusively having a social model that works according to the old ideology of high taxation and high social protection.
Likewise, there cannot be a simple free-market area, where everyone can do whatever they wish, without any restrictions.
We need rules and regulations to ensure that Europe works properly not only for the consumer or business but, most importantly of all, for the citizens we govern.
That is why the Stability and Growth Pact is a good thing, in spite of the faults and mistakes in its operation that have recently been highlighted.
The fact that it remains in place is a good thing, as also that it can be altered and changed to adapt to changing circumstances.
However, I would warn against making widespread changes or reducing the powers contained within the Stability and Growth Pact.
Let us not forget that the Growth Pact itself cannot be seen in isolation: it must also be seen in coordination with the broad economic policy guidelines that are laid down.
Action has been taken in the past against one government â the Irish Government â because of its so-called failure to meet certain criteria under the broad economic policy guidelines.
The mistake was not that the Pact was there, but that it was not enforced against other countries that continue to breach those guidelines and fail to observe the overall policies on the proper management and operation of economies and fiscal policies.
Finally, the Lisbon Strategy, which we voted on today, is a strategy for good governance, good economic growth and, above all, employment creation, which is the best tool for tackling poverty, social disadvantage and isolation.
It will ensure that we in Europe can give the very highest standard of jobs, training and, most importantly of all, social protection to all our citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw the Councilâs attention to the fact that the brutal action taken on the part of the Turkish police against demonstrators a few days ago has resulted in quite justified protests across Europe and even â or should I say at long last â in it being asked somewhat more overtly whether a country such as Turkey could be a Member or candidate country of the European Union at all.
This is, in itself, somewhat odd, of course, because we have known for some time that Turkey takes a rather casual approach to human rights and has for many years pursued a real policy of genocide against ethnic minorities and non-Islamic faith communities.
I think that the incidents of a few days ago do indeed give the Council good cause to revisit the whole Turkey issue.
There are sufficient fundamental reasons for doing so.
Â Â  Â MrÂ Vanhecke, I would ask you to keep to the subject of our debate.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe myself to be entitled, as a Member of this House, to draw the Councilâs attention to whatever subject I like and it is not for the President to concern himself with the content of Membersâ interventions.
I do indeed think that there are sufficient fundamental reasons for putting this issue on the agenda.
I would like to repeat that Turkey is not a European country politically, culturally, economically or historically speaking, and I have not even mentioned the problem of Islam, although no one would deny that the possible enlargement to include a country of 70 to 100 million Islamists threatens to fundamentally change the nature of our society.
I would urge the Council to revisit the Turkey issue as a matter of urgency, and also for internal and democratic reasons.
I consider the way in which in the past few months, in all European countries, debate on Turkeyâs accession has been made impossible and the way in which the verdict of the voters and citizens on this subject has been avoided, to be totalitarian and undemocratic.
Our citizens are intelligent enough to decide for themselves on Turkeyâs membership in a referendum.
Anyone who denies them and us the right â and indeed, anyone who denies us in this House the right, let me say now â to address the Council at any time about this fundamental problem, does the European Union a disservice and brings us a step closer to a totalitarian European regime, something that we cannot tolerate under any circumstances.
It is the Councilâs duty to discuss this as a matter of high priority.
Â Â  Â I regret to say that despite my request, MrÂ Vanhecke, what you said did not relate to the subject of our debate.
I should nevertheless like to thank you for your intervention.
Â Â  â Mr President, I agree with the Commission President's conclusions.
I believe that Europe is currently standing at a crossroads.
Europe could enter a crisis period if the Constitutional Treaty is not ratified either now or in a few years' time, that is, if we are unable to define Europe in a way that affirms our political and economic identity to the outside world.
We need to be defining Europe now in line with the mandate of the current Commission and of this House.
To do that, in economic terms â which is what we are considering today â macro-economic stability is essential.
The other minimum requirement is speeding up the Lisbon reform process in order to increase employment and productivity, and therefore competitiveness, which will narrow the gap between us and the United States and enable us to stand up to competition from emerging countries.
We discussed the Lisbon reforms this morning, so I am going to return to the importance of the Stability Pact.
I feel that we need to be very honest with one another on this matter.
We are going to reform the Stability Pact not because its internal logic has failed, nor the ideas underpinning it, but rather for the simple reason that too many countries have failed to comply with its terms, notably the larger countries.
Since it is the larger Member States who are forcing us to revise the Pact, we need to know what they are willing to do â which is what we have just heard.
They are willing to accept reform of the preventative features of the Pact and to make an effort in the good times, simply because they know that no world power can force them to comply with the rules.
In terms of prevention, they want to slacken and break the rules to the point where â as one German Social Democrat has said â there are no absolute rules.
There are two options â and only two â in this state of affairs: either we move towards economic governance, economic coordination, and an independent judge incapable of imposing any sanctions, or we maintain the existing automatic procedures.
We have not wanted to move ahead with economic coordination.
The Intergovernmental Conference reversed all the tentative progress made by the Convention on the subject of coordination, leaving us in exactly the same position as before.
Nor do we want to continue with the automatic processes.
All that will happen in this Council and in future Councils is that we will move backwards.
The question is how far will we backtrack, and at what pace?
The exemptions to the rules we set ourselves amount to weakening, to giving ground on the Stability Pact.
How much you are willing to concede will determine our future credibility, our economic strength, and will affect whether or not we avoid the economic crisis I anticipate in the coming years.
