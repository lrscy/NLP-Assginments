It should be a debate in which both sides, pro- and anti-, should be heard.
It was done through the whole constitutional debate process and it was organised in a broad consultative manner.
That is the intention for the future.
Â Â  . On 1Â May 2005 the Commission launched a new network of Europe Direct information relays.
Implanted locally all over the enlarged European Union, 393Â new relays have taken over from former Info-Points Europe and Rural Information and Promotion Carrefours which targeted the public in urban and rural areas respectively.
The objectives of the new network have been streamlined in order to better meet the information needs of the public.
As regards the financial mechanisms put in place to support the network, they need to comply with the EC financial regulation.
The new relays were therefore selected on the basis of a call for proposals, following the decision from the Commission, C/2004/2869.
Each Europe Direct information relay benefits from an operating grant of a maximum of EURÂ 24Â 000 while the maximum grant for former IPEs and Carrefours was EURÂ 20Â 000.
Furthermore, Digicom is planning to launch a complementary call for proposals at the beginning of 2007 in order to open new relays in geographical areas insufficiently covered by the current network and taking into account future enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria.
Concerning the assessment of the impact of the networks, an internal assessment of the former information relays in 2003 revealed the real value of the relays as partners in the communication policy, especially at the local and regional level.
As for the new relays, starting from the second semester of 2006, an online monitoring system will be implemented in order to assess the activities of the information relays.
Finally, in the framework of the action plan on communicating Europe published in July 2005, the Commission intends to carry a feasibility study â actionÂ 6 of the action plan â to assess the desirability of progressively streamlining the Commissionâs various information sources.
As stated in actionÂ 42 of the same action plan, an impact study on the communication of the relaysâ activities is also scheduled to start at the end of 2006.
Â Â  â Madam President, having listened to your reply to the previous question, I should like to ask how proportionate spending on this permanent information on Europe's present is in relation to spending on Plan D to which you referred.
Â Â  . There is no money for the relation.
There is no link between the previous issue and this one.
Â Â  . In 2005 the Commission signed a service contract with EuroNews to cover EU affairs in its news and magazines, under a strict editorial independence charter.
The contract covers the production and distribution costs of the EU programmes.
It was signed on the basis of the existing seven languages â German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian â and state of distribution.
It does not contain any obligation for the channel to increase its geographical coverage or the number of languages.
Nevertheless, the contract provides that however much the coverage or the languages increased during the life of the contract, the EU programmes would be included.
One of the selection criteria was the capacity and the will of EuroNews to develop its geographical and language coverage.
Since the contract was signed, a window has been opened in Romania and in the Romanian language; agreements have been signed in India, China and elsewhere.
EuroNews is also diversifying the various distribution technologies through which it can be received: cable, DTT, mobile phones, etc. However, distribution is a commercial matter over which only EuroNews has full command.
Obviously, the Commission is encouraging EuroNews to increase by all the means under its control its geographical distribution technologies and language coverage.
As far as Lithuania is concerned, at present only 49Â 000 households out of 1.33Â million are able to receive EuroNews via cable or satellite.
EuroNews is a candidate to be distributed via digital terrestrial television, Lietuvos Telekomas, and hoping for a positive answer.
Moreover, negotiations are on course with the public channel, LRT, which would permit LRT to broadcast EuroNews programmes on their Hertzian base frequencies as often as they like.
A Lithuanian window, similar to the Romanian one, is also currently under discussion.
Â Â  I would just like to thank you for your answer.
I trust that in future the Commission will try to ensure that all those âEuro Newsâ opportunities exist in all countries where they are not broadcast, and in, let us say, neighbouring countries, as television is still the most popular information channel, especially where Europe is concerned.
Â Â  . We are trying to do the best we can, taking into account the contracts and the independence of EuroNews.
Â Â  Madam President, honourable Member, when it comes to applying Europe's common agricultural policy, there has, right from the beginning, been a fully recognised principle whereby account should be taken of the special character of agriculture and of the structurally conditioned differences between the various areas of the EU â from Finland in the north to the southernmost tip of Italy.
If need be, these dimensions might, moreover, be taken into account with the help of State aid.
It is currently permitted to grant State aid for the production and processing of various agricultural products listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty, if three different criteria are fulfilled.
Firstly, the conditions of competition must not be repudiated.
Secondly, the aid must be in keeping with the common agricultural policy in general and, thirdly, such aid must of course be compatible with the international commitments we have entered into.
In this connection, I could mention our WTO agreement on agriculture.
At the November European Council, the agricultural ministers laid down the political strategy for reforming the common EU policy on sugar.
According to this agreement, it will be possible to grant limited and specific State aid of no more than EURÂ 350 per hectare to sugar beet producers in Finland, with a maximum of EURÂ 90 million per year being specifically targeted at the EUâs âoutermost regionsâ.
It was also decided that those Member States that reduce their sugar quotas by more than 50% be given the opportunity to receive temporary aid for a transitional period of five years, calculated from that production year in which they make a start on reducing their quotas or in which they reduce their quotas to below 50%.
In the case of Italy, it has already been possible to grant such transitional aid, corresponding to approximately EURÂ 11 per tonne of sugar beet per production year.
It has primarily been earmarked for the transport of beet.
The reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP reform), adopted in 2003 in accordance with the decisions in the agricultural sphere previously taken in Berlin, Gothenburg and Brussels, is now in the process of being implemented.
In the new Member States, the reform clearly lies within the budget framework for the enlarged EU, laid down in Brussels in 2002.
In connection with the adoption of the CAP reform, there has been no desire whatsoever to renationalise European agricultural policy.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for her answer.
Firstly, I should like to say how pleasing it was that we obtained a sugar reform.
What is more, I am not for a moment in any doubt that the Commissioner is acting legitimately.
I am not questioning the way in which the reform has been worked out.
I am no doubt looking, rather, for a political answer and political declaration.
I believe that we need more reforms within the agricultural area during the next few years.
I should therefore like to know what the Commissionerâs attitude is to the use of renationalisation as an instrument of reform.
Has the Commissioner no reservations about going down that road?
As I see it, renationalisation would mean our abandoning the common agricultural policy.
In other words, I want to know what, on principle, is the Commissionerâs attitude to the concept of the renationalisation of future agricultural policy.
Â Â  Madam President, I do not believe that the honourable Member can be in any doubt as to my attitude to renationalisation when we talk about Europeâs common agricultural policy.
At no time has renationalisation been proposed.
On the contrary.
If, moreover, I might refer to a relatively topical example, it is clear that I have fought with all the legal means available to me against the proposal for a voluntary modulation of up to 20%, put forward by the British Presidency in connection with the negotiations concerning the next financial perspective, namely that for 2007-2013.
In my view, such a proposal would mean our taking the first step towards renationalising Europe's common agricultural policy.
It would mean that, instead of competing on the same basis, we should get into a situation in which agricultural policy would be about competition between the various national exchequers and between the different finance ministers of the EUâs 25 Member States.
Â Â  . The sugar quota is in principle fixed per country by Community legislation.
Under the current sugar market organisation, the quotas are allocated by the Member States to the sugar manufacturing undertakings and are actually not allocated directly to the beet growers.
This principle will remain unchanged after the reform and Poland is no exception to this rule.
The restructuring fund will be set up in order to facilitate the necessary restructuring measures that should lead to lower sugar production in the less competitive regions within the European Union.
Undertakings which renounce their sugar quota will be eligible for restructuring aid over a transitional period of four years.
However, this payment will be linked to a series of conditions, including obligatory consultation with the beet growers and the submission of a restructuring plan to be agreed between the government and the industry.
Member States will have significant flexibility to lay down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid, as long as they comply with the general rules of future Community legislation.
Therefore â and this is very important and I underline it at every opportunity â the restructuring money by the industry.
This is very important and it is the whole idea behind this restructuring fund.
Besides the undertakings, beet growers and machinery contractors will also be able to benefit from this restructuring fund.
An amount of at least 10% of the restructuring fund, amounting to EURÂ 730 per tonne, should be reserved for the farmers, to compensate in particular for investment in the specialised machinery needed to produce sugar beet.
It is quite clear, with this wording of âat least 10%â, that Member States can decide that a higher percentage should be allocated to the sugar beet producers, the farmers.
It should also be emphasised that, independently of the restructuring fund that we have just talked about, sugar beet growers will receive direct aid as compensation for their loss of revenue due to the reduction in prices.
They will receive this direct aid even if they stop producing sugar beet.
This is very important.
For the new Member States specifically, there will clearly be no phasing-in of the direct payment for the sugar beet compensation.
The sugar beet producers in the new Member States will receive exactly the same amount per hectare in compensation as the EU-15, which means that there is no phasing-in as there is for cereals.
The compensation will be 100% right from when the new sugar reform is first implemented.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to ask another question.
Does the Commission have instruments to limit the transfer of sugar quotas between countries, for example from Poland to other countries?
Do such instruments exist and will they be effective?
Â Â  . It has not been part of this agreement in the Council that it is possible to transfer quotas between Member States.
It is possible within a Member State.
For example, within Poland or any other country it is possible to take a quota from one factory to another, but there is no cross-border quota transfer in the reform proposal.
Â Â  . To guarantee the price for Sugar Protocol countries, prices have always moved completely in line with EU institutional sugar prices, so there has never been a guarantee for a fixed price for the Sugar Protocol countries.
However, these Sugar Protocol countries will benefit from a lower cut in the prices until the 2008-2009 production year. This will give these countries a period of three years to adapt to the new price support arrangements within the European Union.
During 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, the reference price for raw sugar will decrease by only 5%, while the producers of sugar beet in the European Union will see a decrease of 20% the first year, and 27.5% the following year.
The reason for this decrease of only 5% is due to the fact that refiners and therefore the ACP suppliers will be exempted from the restructuring levy.
They do not have to pay the levy at all.
However, refiners will lose the benefit of the refining aid which will be abolished in the context of the reform.
It is quite clear that the different conditions for the ACP countries after the introduction of a reform within the European Union has been discussed at length before finalising the political agreement in the Council.
It is quite clear and it has been from the very beginning that it was important to secure the period of the last six months of 2006, which is outside the next financial period.
Therefore the decision was taken to allocate EURÂ 40Â million specifically for the period from 1Â July until the end of this year.
For the period within the next financial perspective it has been quite clear that the Commissionâs wish to allocate a significantly higher budget than the aforementioned EURÂ 40Â million will be dependent on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspective for the next period.
But it is a significantly higher amount than that mentioned.
I can only say that within the Commission proposal, a budget of EURÂ 190Â million a year was in the budget and I therefore hope that there will be an understanding also in this Parliament of the need to help these ACP countries, specifically in a transitional period.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
I am talking about the fact that the collateral damage from the effects of the reform of the sugar regime has been felt by the 18 protocol countries.
You say that they had EURÂ 40Â million between 18Â countries.
Three commissioners â you, MrÂ Mandelson and the President of the Commission â pledged EURÂ 190 million to the ACP countries.
I am now following that very closely.
We can see no place in the budget for that money; we can see no likelihood of anything like the amount you promised to them being included in the budget.
However hard this Parliament tries, it is very difficult in terms of the budgetary allocation that we have to make sure that we ring-fence the kind of money that we need.
Will you, Commissioner, urge the Council to agree that we should ring-fence the money in any unallocated money that we may find under Heading IV?
Will you make it your business to protect the ACP sugar-producing countries at this time, when they are feeling so vulnerable?
Â Â  . Mrs Kinnock, I am quite sure that, as you are so well informed about this issue and it is not the first time that we have discussed it, you will know that we have been in very close contact with the sugar producing ACP countries.
Not all of those countries produce sugar.
It has been very important for us to try to help them, perhaps not to continue to produce sugar if they could not be competitive, but then to try to do something else.
Therefore, I was very happy that at the Commission meeting last week it was possible to get through a communication on bioethanol.
Afterwards, Mr Michel, who is responsible for the development money, took part in a press conference with me on this because bioethanol might be an alternative for those countries that want to stop producing sugar.
On the figures, this is an ongoing discussion.
But it has been important for the Commission to send a clear signal that we care about the possibilities for these sugar-producing ACP countries.
I am quite sure that when you are in contact with them, they will also recognise that we have had numerous meetings with these countries.
For example, we have been able to have direct contact during Council meetings on two occasions.
It has been acknowledged that this is really an issue that is on our minds.
Â Â  Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector [2005/2053(INI)] (A6-0014/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the European Parliament, especially the rapporteur, MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for their work on risk and crisis management and the very useful resolution and report.
I will, of course, study your position and the different proposals in the report carefully.
My intention with the communication on risk and crisis management presented in March 2005 was to launch a comprehensive debate.
I think that objective has been successfully achieved, in the Council, in the European Economic and Social Committee and now in the European Parliament.
Your contribution will be essential for the progress of our work.
I therefore take note of your position regarding the three options for new rural development measures to support risk and crisis management.
I welcome your encouragement to continue the work on the subject.
I note your particular interest in option 2, which concerns mutual funds.
In the shorter term, I share your views concerning the fruit and vegetables sector and I have already said to the Council that we are going to examine the subject of risk and crisis management in the context of the future reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables.
As you have noticed, however, the subject of risk and crisis management is really very complex, notably because the purpose is to adapt to a changing international trade context in respect of WTO rules.
We therefore need to study this area further.
As regards the analytical background, at the beginning of 2005 we launched a research project on risk and crisis management instruments for EU agriculture.
The work is well advanced and we should have some intermediate results in the coming year.
We are also preparing a study on the agricultural insurance systems in the various Member States and the technical issue of insurance systems in agriculture.
This was specifically requested by the European Parliament.
It is essential to describe and analyse what is done at Member State level before eventually deciding whether we need to set up permanent European instruments for insurance possibilities.
We will then have a good basis for discussion during the coming year, which will facilitate the detailed political debate that is essential before we agree on additional measures.
I am quite sure that, after listening to your comments, I will be able to respond directly to some of the questions raised.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Commissioner, the farming sector is dependent on many factors, not all of which the commercial sector regards as risks at all, and it is for that reason that the common agricultural policy has always protected it from certain risks, and, in the past, intervention in the form of guaranteed prices and guaranteed sales for important products provided specific farms with income guarantees.
However, this resulted in a distribution of aid that very much favoured larger holdings to the detriment of the smaller ones.
In the end, the distribution of payments was such that 80% of the money was going to 20% of the farmers.
These also resulted in partial surpluses being generated in a region of the European Union that is one of the biggest importers of foodstuffs in the world, because this state intervention had given rise to a sort of vacuum effect.
These surpluses were then sold on the world market for billions in a tax-subsidised dumping operation, the consequence of which was that in some countries, mainly in the developing world, regional markets were destroyed.
Following the reforms, we have therefore attempted to at least start to put an end to this, but the money is still being distributed in the same ratio.
We have a situation where highly rationalised businesses get EURÂ 120Â 000 per employee per year, while the majority of farmers get less than a tenth of that.
Now that we are considering whether we need to initiate a new system of crisis and risk management, we need to correct the distribution of State aid in favour of rural farms.
This is nothing to do with large and small holdingsÂ âÂ it is to do with the production method, in other words with where workers are actually employed.
We â and I as the rapporteur â take the view that, of the options you have listed here, we obviously need to look into the first option of insurance against natural disasters; this already occurs, but just needs to be put on a more systematic basis.
Option 2, regarding whether there is or should be a mutual fund, is an interesting consideration, but, as I said earlier, it should be made clear here too that the payments that farmers have to make to these funds must take account both of the scale of production and of the farmer's ability to pay, so that the new system does not end up once again in inequalities to the detriment of rural farming.
It is also important for farmers themselves to be involved in this insurance, in other words for there to be cofinancing from the farms, so that we do not end up with state protection, replacing one system with the other, that is to say bringing the system we have just abolished back to life under a different name.
Normal risks must largely be allowed for and managed by farmers and farm managers themselves on the basis of their business knowledge.
Our main criticisms are reserved for Option 3.
This relates to providing basic coverage against income crises.
Natural disasters and unpredictable risks obviously always result in loss of income, in other words to economic strain.
However, we must not run the risk of this coverage against income crises taking us back to the old system of guaranteed incomes via state intervention.
It will be clear from our report just how careful we have been about this.
Nevertheless, some groups have concentrated on this area in their amendments, and have at least said that we should look into the possibility of supporting these measures and the connection with the WTO.
To that we say that the reforms dismantled the old-style intervention system, and it must not be replaced.
Â Â  â Mr President, everyone knows that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate conditions.
The previous speaker told us so and there is no need for us to repeat ourselves.
Everyone also knows that, under the old CAP, there was far more protectionism towards Greek farming than there is under the present common agricultural policy and I greatly fear that the next common agricultural policy will be even worse.
We consider that the insurance system, however it works, will have its pros and cons, but we consider that the participation of the European Union in financing is very, very small and I think that we should be more generous on this point.
In addition, I would like to say that particular importance needs to be attached to fruits, which are sensitive products and which have greater need for protection.
Similarly, we have seen over recent days a large rise in fuel prices which, for numerous agricultural crops, will result in a ruinous increase in costs.
Additional measures which we need to see to attentively and carefully are that, in times of crisis, storage and processing and promotion need to be stepped up, as do voluntary cutbacks in production.
We consider it particularly important for the entire system to be subject to speedy intervention.
To close, I have to say that, in the particularly globalised environment to which we have brought our agriculture, if we do not support it, it will be ruined and we shall have no European agriculture.
Â Â  . Mr President, the report by MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf discussed here today identifies clearly and concisely the shortcomings and flaws of the risk and crisis management system in European agriculture.
For many years, the common agricultural policy protected farming and farmers in Europe.
While recent reform has made farmers more market-oriented, it has also forced them to shoulder the responsibility for risk management.
Subsidised European agriculture removed the mechanisms for preventing and insuring against risk.
Few farmers can plan for crisis situations today and unfortunately few of them can afford insurance in a climate of free competition and low profits.
Non-agricultural undertakings, traders and insurance companies have created a whole portfolio of insurances, to cover even such sophisticated situations as exchange rate fluctuations or income loss due to political circumstances in the case of foreign investments.
Both the Commissionâs communication and the rapporteurâs excellent report show just how far behind this issue has fallen in the European Union.
A farmer-entrepreneur running a farm on the free market after the reform and in the face of enormous competition is risking everything, without having even the insurance fallback that is available to the investor or trader.
A large or highly productive farm will be in a position to cover the cost of insurance and the cost of risk, but millions of small and family-run farms in Europe cannot afford to pay for insurance to cover their own homes, let alone their production.
If a crisis arises, these farmers have to rely on help from their neighbours or on State aid.
What European farmer is going to take out insurance against income loss in the event of borders being closed by Russia, against reform of the market in sugar and the need to destroy plantings, or against the dumping price of fruit and vegetables imported from China?
Who will comprehensively insure a farmer-investor and the risk of financing investments, the risk of fluctuations in the price of produce, the price of fertilisers, feeds and fuel, the risk of global climate change, soil degradation, drought, hurricanes, flooding and storms?
Who will provide insurance to cover imbalances in supply and demand, epidemic diseases and genetically modified food?
As a sector of the economy, agriculture requires a special legal and organisational framework for its insurance needs.
Agriculture is too fragmented and weak as a sector to set up its own insurance schemes.
Even the richest countries of the European Union are not in a position to take on this task on their own.
This means that a common and universal insurance system must be set up to include all Member States and all farmers as part of a reinsurance scheme.
The 1% from modulation proposed by the Commission will not be sufficient for a reinsurance scheme, let alone setting up a system of prevention and indemnification.
Spain has the most effective insurance system currently in place in Europe.
I therefore call on the Commission to universally apply this system as rapidly as possible and to adopt it as a standard model in the European Union.
Only then should discussions be opened with major insurance companies and national governments about an appropriate system that would be universal and compulsory, solvent and low in cost, fair and based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and for rightly mentioning the exclusion of the new Member States from the 1% modulation, and proposing an alternative funding scheme for these countries to the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ GraefeÂ zuÂ Baringsdorf, for his work on the report on risk and crisis management in agriculture.
We live at a time when a lot of damage is caused as a result of natural disasters ranging from major floods to drought and fires.
Also fresh in our memories is the huge amount of expenditure incurred by Europe as a result of infectious diseases in animals and efforts to eradicate and combat these.
We wish to continue with the liberalisation of the EUâs agricultural policy in the current WTO negotiations.
The CAP reform was a large and important step in that direction.
I do not, however, think that the Commission has shown a sufficient sense of urgency about coming up with proposals for eliminating or reducing risks and for averting crises and outbreaks of disease that we could well do without.
Who is to cover the losses due to future outbreaks of disease?
How is the market to be regulated and managed, especially in those areas of the EU that are not affected by disease but that are nonetheless hit by no longer being able as easily to export foodstuffs?
Why has the Commission not put proposals on the table concerning the provision of insurance cover by private and mutual insurance companies â something requested by the European Parliament as long as two years ago?
The many different insurance facilities that exist are used in agriculture and by the food industry on a daily basis.
This area must therefore be investigated very quickly with a view to devising cover for the large losses that the agricultural budget will not in future be able to cover.
Finally, I should like to say very clearly that we do not want to go back to the State aid or disguised State aid of earlier times.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture has a major credibility problem.
The committee takes decisions that often have only one purpose, namely to grab more money for itself and its friends.
However, all of us in this Chamber share responsibility for the European Parliamentâs plenary again and again adopting the resolutions presented to us by the Committee on Agriculture.
Today, it is crisis management and insurance schemes that are at issue.
The subject is in itself a useful one to debate, and the report contains a lot that is constructive.
However, it also contains some bad things, and it is those on which I want to concentrate on this occasion.
Firstly, crisis management and insurance schemes should be funded by the industry itself.
I have been told that the spokesman for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fought hard for this to happen, but that he was in a minority in the committee.
What is more, crisis management and insurance schemes should have to do with genuine crises.
I find it commendable that farmers everywhere in Europe should show solidarity with each other if their farms are hit by serious diseases such as BSE, foot and mouth disease or avian influenza.
When, however, the Committee on Agriculture defines trade liberalisation in the WTO as a crisis situation, that is not a sign of healthy prioritisation.
It is a sign of the Committee on Agricultureâs patent unaccountability.
I very much hope that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested a split vote so that we might have this notion removed from the resolution.
Finally, I expect support for the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for a split vote with a view to removing the committeeâs demand for aid for offsetting high oil prices.
That is emphatically the worst thing in the report.
It is depressing to see how often Members of the European Parliament, who otherwise work to bring about a green Europe and to forestall disaster where the climate is concerned, go no way towards discovering what goes on in the Committee on Agriculture.
It is nothing less than appalling that the proposal concerning aid in connection with oil can reach plenary at all.
This is something that the groupsâ spokesmen on environmental and climate issues should have nipped in the bud.
What, however, is, in the end, required to get the Committee on Agriculture to act in a less self-centred way?
I do not, unfortunately, believe that anything will happen until the European Parliament obtains real influence over agricultural policy and until we get rather more people with farther-reaching visions of Europe in the committee.
Â Â  â Mr President, risk and crisis management measures need to be introduced in the agricultural sector.
This need relates not only to protection from natural risks but also from the breakdown and gradual abolition, through the review of the CAP and WTO agreements, of mechanisms which, even if not terribly satisfactory, do protect farmers' incomes.
Similarly, farmers also need protection both from the introduction of new technologies and, more importantly, from genetically modified organisms, which harbour unpredictable negative repercussions on the environment, public health and farmers' income, as the rapporteur notes in his report.
Nonetheless, all the proposed scenarios are predicated on the fact that they will not encumber the Community budget and that the appropriations needed will be deducted from appropriations for differentiation.
In fact, private insurance companies are considered to be a basic mechanism for implementing the proposed measures.
However, we all know that, even in such cases, some companies do not insure certain categories of risks because they are unprofitable.
In addition, the report accepts the incentives set by the Commission, relating mainly to reinsurance, which needs to be free or with reduced reinsurance premiums by national agencies or by introducing reinsurance premium subsidies, in order to safeguard the companies' profitability.
I do not agree that natural and commercial disasters, especially for small- and medium-sized farms, should generate profits for insurance capital.
At the same time, it is accepted that compensation should not be paid for losses of less than 30% of the average over the preceding three years.
In other words, the following injustice is being promoted: small- and medium-sized farms will sustain losses from natural disasters and commercial crises, in the best case scenario of at least 30%, while insurance capital's profitability will be guaranteed.
Even if we accept that measures need to be introduced which will cover all the losses caused to farmers' income by various natural disasters and commercial crises, we cannot, however, agree with these proposals, which create an additional burden on small- and medium-sized farms; instead of improving their income, in our opinion they reduce it.
Â Â  . Mr President, it seems to me that the biggest risk that farmers face every year is that agriculture, and ultimately their livelihoods, are controlled by the European Union.
The debacle that Britain suffered during the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001, is eloquent testimony to what happens when crises are managed by the EU.
It is not widely known that the strategy for dealing with that disaster was managed by the then Commissioner for Agriculture, and what a complete pigâs breakfast he made of that.
Millions of healthy animals were needlessly slaughtered in an orgy of killing and burning that shocked the world.
Furthermore, the roots of the disaster lay with the EU and its destruction of local slaughterhouses through excessive regulation.
I am gratified to see that the report acknowledges that the CAP has âencouraged the development of non-sustainable production methods heavily dependent on water and energyâ.
But, judging by this weekendâs newspaper revelations that the EU has a surplus of four billion bottles of wine, costing the taxpayers a billion a year, not much has been learnt in that area.
I would ask Members to reject this report, until a study has been made of the practical implications and the cost of implementing its recommendations.
It seems to me that trying to protect farmers against everything, including weather aberrations such as storms, as this report indicates, will be extremely expensive and possibly fruitless in the end, because who can predict the unpredictable?
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on tackling the very important question of managing risk and crises in the agricultural sector, and taking the situation of the new Member States into account too.
I also welcome the Commissionâs concern for farmers having to face up to the crises caused by the liberalisation of agricultural markets, export restrictions and animal diseases, not to mention natural disasters.
I would like to take this opportunity to say, Commissioner, that fuel payments and biofuel production are of particular interest to Polish farmers.
Biofuel production will boost income and make farmers feel more secure.
It will also lessen dayâto-day anxiety and worry caused by the fluctuating price of pigmeat for example.
Â Â  MrÂ President, market regulation and price support used to do quite a good job of protecting the agricultural sector from risks.
Agricultural reform has now turned much of that over to the market, and in principle that is quite right too.
However, farming is in a unique situation: even though farmers have to cope with climate change, livestock epidemics, natural disasters and global sectoral crises, much of which they cannot even predict, let alone plan for economically, they still need planning security.
More market thus also means a need for more private-sector involvement in the management of agricultural risks and crises.
The report provides some very positive proposalsÂ âÂ an astonishing number coming from a Green rapporteur.
Despite some imbalances, it is a very welcome sight coming from that part of the political spectrum.
It is primarily producers, associations and private insurers who are called on to provide innovative risk management concepts throughout Europe.
The European Union and the State must take a back seat.
The public purse must be restricted to partial coverage for uninsurable risks such as natural disasters or massive livestock epidemics.
That is why we have to design reinsurance systems, and the European Union must also provide an aid framework that allows both private solutions and public coverage for extreme risks.
However, we must bear in mind that we cannot insure against every conceivable eventuality.
The world's climatic zones are shifting, and this has effects on the geography of farming that call, as a matter of urgency, for scientific investigation.
Europe has a duty to encourage this.
We will also end up having to look into resettlement measures.
These are regions that are being affected by ever worsening and more frequent droughts or floods, so that farming there is simply no longer worth it.
In this context we must also recognise the realities of additional risk insurance, and thus also provide aid for resettlement and structural change.
That, too, is a political responsibility of the European Union!
Â Â  â Mr President, first I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for his report, for the proposals which he has tabled and for accepting many of the proposals tabled by the political groups and, on the other hand, I wish to thank the Commission itself and Commissioner Fischer Boel for their balanced communication in this sector and for the alternative scenarios which they present, scenarios in which each Member State, depending on the structure of their insurance systems and the peculiarities of their agriculture, can find their own level.
However, I should like to say to Mrs Fischer Boel that you need to put far more pressure on the Council so that future Councils of Ministers follow an integrated policy in this sector and the Agriculture and Fisheries Council does not confine itself simply to a sectoral perception of management policy, such as for example, in the fruit sector, because, as far as the fruit sector is concerned, insurance policy funds will come from the sector itself and will have nothing to do with cofinancing or financing from the fluctuation mechanism.
As you all know, we are in what I believe is the most sensitive development of the common agricultural policy, a development which is being judged by global trade itself and by the corresponding European Union agreements.
On the other hand, we have the financial framework which is being set at the negotiating table between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission with the guillotine of the common agricultural policy review clause.
Above all, however, what we have to hope for, as Parliament, is that there will be a full guarantee of farmers' incomes and of agricultural production in the European Union.
Within the framework of these objectives therefore, by 2013, the crisis management policy, with the creation of a security index for farmers' incomes, will be one of the basic priorities of the European Union and will need to identify with and be combined with our policy to strengthen the fluctuation mechanism.
I should like to stress, for the benefit of my honourable friends worried about competitiveness, that a great many of our international commercial competitors have applied the price security index even at the level of loss of income due to changes in commercial pricing policy, a policy covered by WTO agreements.
European producers therefore need to fight with the same mechanisms and the same weapons in international trade.
Commissioner, I should just like to mention to you a combination, as it were, of measures which are needed: reinsurance, private insurance and state insurance.
The management policy system â and here I disagree with the rapporteur â will not be the subject of state subsidies, because this will be the greatest distortion for future agriculture.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that farming has become subject to increasingly serious risks and crises in recent years, caused by climate change and natural disasters such as flooding, drought and fires, and to the damage caused by animal diseases which are being spread more rapidly at international level.
Although the Commission has put forward a number of options for managing risks and crises, its proposals do not take account of the problems facing small and medium-sized holdings and family farming, which are under threat from an unfair common agricultural policy and from World Trade Organisation negotiations.
The upshot of this is the destruction of thousands of small holdings, the strangulation of the rural world and the desertification of vast sections of the interior of countries such as Portugal, which is also reflected in the increased number of forest fires.
What is more, quite apart from urging the cofinancing of insurance premiums against natural disasters paid by farmers, the Commission is proposing to finance this from just 1% of funds from modulation, which is clearly inadequate.
What is needed, as we have been proposing, is a public insurance scheme financed by the EU, with a view to creating a better policy framework for risk management and crisis prevention, which is crucial for family farming.
As the rapporteur points out, the Commissionâs proposals do not take sufficient account of the level of risk and probability of crises.
It is therefore crucial that the Commission carry out a more detailed assessment of the instruments and measures that could prevent collapses in prices, market crises, farmersâ income losses and all obstacles standing in the way of their continuing to farm.
I note, Commissioner, your willingness to take on board arguments put forward in this debate, and look forward to seeing this put into practice, both in terms of risk and crisis management in farming, and in the creation of a safety net in relation to the forthcoming reforms of common organisation of agricultural markets, in particular of wine, fruit and vegetables.
What is also needed is to provide for the possibility of granting aid for farmers to purchase fuel when the price has increased sharply.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank MrÂ Graefe zu Baringdorf for his report.
It is good to see the Commissioner here this evening, because the Commission has put forward a flexible approach to crisis management in agriculture.
Animal diseases and natural disasters are going to happen and we must find a flexible approach to these.
The CAP reform is now moving towards offering help for farmers to help themselves.
That really has to be the way forward.
If you take what happened with the foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, the huge sums of money that were needed to eradicate the disease could never have been funded by an insurance company on its own.
We should perhaps look at a form of insurance with the Member State and the European Union as the insurer of last resort, so that they can actually step in when there are huge disasters.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf referred to young farmers in his report.
There is a special case for a certain amount of extra help for those setting up business early on in their career, because they do not have the capital behind them and they need extra support.
If Mr Titford had still been in the Chamber, I would have liked to take him up on his comment that Commissioner Fischler and the European Commission were to blame for the mishandling of the foot-and-mouth crisis.
Had he been part of the inquiry here in the European Parliament, he would have found that was not the case.
I have to admit to you that the blame lay with the UK Government and a Prime Minister who was hell bent on calling a general election and wanted to get the disease under control.
He had a huge contiguous cull of millions of animals that was completely unnecessary.
We could have used vaccines, which were also ruled out.
I would have liked to put Mr Titford right on that and other points.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, recent years and in particular the past year have provided eloquent examples of the variety of risks and crises facing Europeâs farmers.
In 2005, at the same time as thousands of hectares of forest were being destroyed by fire, with the loss of human life, and when a number of parts of southern European were stricken by drought, a number of countries of Central Europe were afflicted by devastating floods.
In both cases, the magnitude involved was without historical parallel.
What is more, animal diseases and the inexorable liberalisation of trade have particularly exposed farmers to fresh risks and uncertainties.
The Commissionâs initiative underpinning this report is therefore a welcome one.
It falls short, however, of what is actually needed.
I therefore share the rapporteurâs view in most of the points raised and suggestions made, with particular regard to agricultural insurance and mutual funds, although I regret the timidity â I have chosen this word with great care â of his approach towards coverage against income crises, particularly given that some of our main trading competitors have such safety measures at their disposal.
I also feel that this report is an important tool in a broader approach that the issue merits, not least as part of the ongoing debate on the solidarity fund, the forestry strategy that we will certainly discuss, along with the own-initiative reports on natural disasters being drawn up by various committees.
I hope that Parliament will adopt coherent positions with regard to this range of instruments.
This is the best contribution it can make towards the Union being in a position to provide adequate, urgently-needed protection for its farmers, firstly to prevent the occurrence of crises and risks, but also to rectify them if it proves impossible to prevent them.
Â Â  Mr President, the report on risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector is welcome and could not be more timely.
There has been a radical shift in agricultural activity, brought about by the agricultural reforms of 2003, and the opening-up of markets as a result of the WTO.
While benefits have undoubtedly flowed for farmers, there has been â as has been said repeatedly this evening â a greater and real increase in the risk factors.
Under the new CAP, the risk and crisis measures that we had all become used to were dismantled and the onus on the protection, prevention and management of crises has shifted squarely onto the farmersâ shoulders.
Open markets and product mobility increase the possibility of the spread of disease.
Climate change is happening very quickly, so that reorientation will be inevitable.
The depletion of oil stocks means that fertilisers, pesticides and machinery will all be affected in due course and, by extension, agriculture will be affected and will have to adapt.
In Ireland, the nitrates directive, for example, is beginning to bite and having such serious consequences that the farming organisations have withdrawn from the government-sponsored social and economic partnership talks.
Farming is in transition as never before.
It is in transition because of a variety of factors and the transition will continue.
Farming is confronted with more risks than ever before.
Good farming practice and a stable and experienced farming population are the best guarantee for what Europe needs, which is a safe, secure and healthy food supply.
Farming is a difficult life: long hours, hard work, high investment and many risks.
In many cases it is a whole family transaction.
It deserves the protection against risks proposed by the rapporteur in this report.
I commend the rapporteur and his report.
I support him completely, particularly in relation to optionÂ 2, and I welcome the Commissionerâs comments this evening.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for tackling the problem of risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector.
This is an enormous task, given the significant number of issues that have to be dealt with.
The latter range from limiting the impact of natural phenomena such as droughts, floods, fires and hail, through diseases and epidemics, to the risk of income loss resulting from falling demand for agricultural produce or rising prices, for example for fuel.
Risk insurance, reinsurance and producer payments are just one aspect of reducing the risk of running the business we call agricultural production.
For us to really manage, or in other words to reduce, the risk involved in agricultural production, we need to manage that risk.
This implies a different approach to the concentration of production, dispersal, reinstating the natural environment, introducing new methods and new technology such as biotechnology.
A number of these actions have already been taken.
Together, they will make it possible to eliminate adverse phenomena and reduce production risks.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is always good to belong to one of the larger groups, because you get more time.
Commissioner, in my first speech I placed the emphasis on not succumbing to the risk of relapse, and spoke of the social balance that must be involved in a new system of this type, but now I would also like to focus on preventative crisis management.
All of the crises that have been mentioned here, including the fires, were, in part, caused by human beings and human action.
Even the BSE crisis was not sent down from on high, but was caused by cows being fed to cows, completely contrary to any sense in good farming practice.
If we plant maize and eucalyptus in dry areas, we should not then be surprised when damage by fire and drought is the result.
When we talk about liberalisation, on which one Member has expressed rather different ideas, we should not be surprised â if we look at it as an end rather than as a means â that many people go out of business and fall into major crises, including income crises.
We must therefore ensure that proper arrangements are made, through the WTO, for qualified market access.
I would point out that many smallholdings and organic farms have created a higher value, high-quality market by keeping genetically modified organisms out.
If we now botch coexistence, it will turn into a Trojan horse, and then these good, high-quality markets, including the wine market, will have gone.
Then we will lurch into crises that we could have prevented, and insurance will be the last of the things we need to talk about.
However, Commissioner, I am also talking about the possibility of economic development in rural areas and the fact that, when it comes to the second pillar, we are now threatened with financial exhaustion.
We should then not be surprised if many farmers who have entered these higher-value markets are prevented from pursuing this development by exhaustion and are on the point of getting out.
General agricultural policy therefore also has to fulfil a preventative function.
I would also remind you that fossil fuels are going to run out in the not too distant future, and that we must prepare farmers for the need to convert to other energy sources and, perhaps, help them to benefit from them.
We can operate crisis prevention in this context, too, and I would like these preventative considerations to play a role in the legislative proposal by the Commission â which is currently in the brainstorming phase this year.
To MrsÂ Batzeli I would say that, when I talked about management responsibility, I did not simply want to blame the crises on the incompetence of the farmers, but I did want agriculture to have an influence on policy in the way I have described, so that the crises do not arise in the first place, and so that in future farmers are guaranteed a decent income.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate.
Many of the points mentioned in the report are covered by the ongoing studies that the Commission has initiated, for example, proposals 2, 5, 7, 19 and 23.
Regarding the safety-net provision â proposal 8 â the discussion in the Council has not produced a clear mandate for introducing a general safety clause in all COMs or for trying to finance this insurance out of the modulated money.
However, I am ready to examine the introduction of targeted risk and crisis management provisions in other COMs and, as mentioned by Mr Gklavakis, in the fruit and vegetable sector, which we will also discuss here in Parliament at the end of this year.
I completely agree with your rapporteur, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that basic coverage against income reduction is not a solution.
It is quite clear that, if or when we face structural problems, they must be solved through policy changes.
That is obvious and I am very happy about Mr Graefe zu Baringdorfâs clear support for it.
As a safety-net for income, I consider the CAP reformâs decoupled direct payment to the farmer to be essential.
I am positive about the content of proposals 18, 24 and 26.
I also take this opportunity to draw your attention to the review of the state aid guidelines adopted by the Commission on 8Â February.
The Commission proposes to include compensation for bad weather and animal and plant diseases in the present exemption regulation for state aid within the agricultural sector.
This is hopefully a simplification.
It would also speed up the implementation of state aid in such situations, so that we can react extremely quickly.
The Commission has looked into a number of options for encouraging the development of risk crisis management tools and providing an improved response in the event of a crisis.
My intention for the communication was, firstly, to have a comprehensive orientation debate in the Council and here in Parliament before tabling any legislative proposal.
The discussions we have had so far in the Council have not, as I said, produced a clear mandate to introduce a general safety clause.
However, the Commission is ready to proceed further if there should at any stage be a clear mandate from the Council.
Since I consider crisis and risk management an important issue for the future as well, even in the situation of an absence of a clear mandate from the Council I am prepared to examine the introduction of a crisis management provision, as I said previously, on a case-by-case basis.
There was a question about the position of the new Member States.
It is quite clear that the new Member States will not be excluded from risk management measures.
As we have pointed out in the communication, we could envisage identifying a comparable envelope in rural development, just as we do for the old Member States â a clear signal to the ten new Member States.
With the political agreement on the CAP reform and the implementation that has now taken place in all the Member States, we want European farmers to try and seize the market opportunities.
There is a strong responsibility for the farmer, but there is also a need for solidarity when crises arise.
Listening to the discussions in the European Parliament as well as in the Council, it seems to me that the approaches are fairly different.
My conclusion is, therefore, that we need to study the options carefully and discuss them before taking a final decision on the instruments to be used.
I agree completely with Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf that prevention is usually better than cure and my personal view is that the conference on coexistence to be held in April is necessary in order to avoid GMOs being mixed with organic production.
I am therefore particularly looking forward to that discussion.
As for your views on fossil fuels, I do not think that we should wait until we have used up those fuels; we should start now to look at what can be done on renewable energy.
I am thinking specifically about our recent discussions on bioethanol and the possibility of taking full advantage of agricultureâs contribution to this future way of reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.
This has been an interesting discussion and I thank the rapporteur for what I consider to be a balanced approach to this very important issue.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Kindermann on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the implementation of a European Union forestry strategy [2005/2054(INI)] (A6-0015/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kindermann, on a very well-balanced report.
The Commission believes that the main issues and challenges in the European forestry sector are well reflected in the draft opinion.
In particular, we appreciate the overall support given to the Commissionâs proposal concerning the preparation of a European action plan for forestry.
In our view, the action plan should provide a coherent, verifiable and practical framework for the implementation of this strategy.
It could become a major instrument of coordination between Community actions and the forestry policies in the different Member States.
For that reason, we consider the development and implementation of the action plan a dynamic process, which should involve the Member States and the stakeholders and should be accompanied by regular monitoring and reporting.
The ideas are very well expressed in the draft opinion and we fully share the rapporteurâs view on the need to develop the action plan in close cooperation with the Member States and the stakeholders.
I think we have already made progress in that respect.
The action plan will be based on the overall principles of the European forestry strategy, which are sustainability and subsidiarity.
There are three specific issues that I would like to highlight.
First, the need to enhance the competitiveness of the forestry sector, in line with the Lisbon objectives.
There is growing concern about the economic viability of sustainable forestry in the European Union in the context of globalisation.
Competitiveness is a key pillar of sustainable forest management and it is of crucial importance in maintaining the multiple benefits that forestry provides to society, including employment opportunities in rural areas where there is nothing else.
Forestry can deliver a wide range of products and services to society and we should try to develop this potential in the future.
The second issue is that the forestry sector has to respond to social demands concerning the protection of the environment and the natural heritage, in accordance with the Gothenburg objectives of sustainable development.
The forestry sector as a whole will prosper best if it fits snugly into wider society.
Actively contributing to major European objectives, such as biodiversity, conservation or climate change mitigation, will offer new opportunities for forestry.
In relation to a previous discussion, the possibility of biomass for energy is a clear example of how forestry can contribute.
The last issue is the global importance of forestry for sustainable development and the need firmly to continue our support for international commitments for the protection and sustainable management of forestry worldwide.
That also involves measures to combat illegal logging and related trade in forest products.
Those issues are well addressed in the report and I can assure you that they will be reflected in our action plans.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, in May 2005 the Agriculture Council called on the Commission to work in close cooperation with all those involved to draw up an EU action plan for sustainable forest management by mid-2006, which should turn the various elements of the EU's forest strategy into reality.
With its own-initiative report on the EU forestry strategy, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has made an early entry into the discussion, and we want this report to take the process we have initiated further and deeper.
Which of our considerations and demands ultimately end up in the action plan is, of course, purely up to the Commission, but the quality of the cooperationÂ âÂ for which I am very gratefulÂ âÂ leads us to believe that, on the essential issues, we are thinking along the same lines.
The starting point for our own-initiative report was the Council resolution of 1998 on a forestry strategy for the European Union, which offers a whole range of possibilities, but has no specific targets and no coherent structure.
In accordance with the various starting points, and alongside some general remarks, we have identified a range of strategy elements.
I would just like briefly to go over the most important points.
First: Until now, there has been no uniform legal basis for forestry activities at EU level.
In our view, an objective assessment would be desirable despite all the concerns of those involved.
Secondly: There are various definitions of forest both internationally and in each of our 25 countries, and we therefore ask the Commission to consider drafting a European definition, in order to make the European Union's measures in this domain transparent and comparable.
Thirdly: In order to improve coordination, communication and cooperation, we propose strengthening existing structures such as the Standing Forestry Committee.
In addition to horizontal coordination, the exchange of information between the levels of the hierarchy within the Commission must be improved using the new Inter-Service Group.
In our opinion, this vertical coordination should have a dedicated unit in the Secretariat General.
Fourthly: Europe's forests must be protected from forest fires and air pollution, and also from soil and water pollution.
Illegal logging outside the EU must be combated by means of appropriate coordinated international measures, and the EU can play its part in this.
Fifthly: Forests can help us to slow down the greenhouse effect and climate change, but only if we make greater use of their various products.
The EU should therefore promote the use of environmentally friendly wood products and give renewable energy from forests a greater place in its energy supplies.
Sixthly: In order to promote the competitiveness of the sector, and thus employment and income in rural areas, Europe needs to address itself more effectively to such tasks as the mobilisation of timber resources, the removal of obstacles to the use of wood, overcoming structural problems in forestry, and the diversification of forest ownersâ income.
Seventhly: since forestry-related research and development have a major role to play in connection with the Lisbon Strategy, key forestry research projects should therefore be included in the Seventh Framework Programme of Research.
Eighthly: European training and further training programmes such as Leonardo and Erasmus should be put to more use than hitherto in the forestry sector.
In this connection, the Member States are particularly called on to provide those affected with more information on the opportunities available.
Finally: What contribution can the forestry sector make to Lisbon and Gothenburg?
We think that Europe's forests, unlike those in other regions of the world, are underutilised, not only with regard to timberÂ âÂ we use only 60% of the quantity grownÂ âÂ but also with regard to services that have previously been unmarketable.
We want the European forestry sector to improve its competitiveness in this way, because only a vibrant and competitive forestry sector can contribute to Lisbon and Gothenburg and thus to the wellbeing of Europeans.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I should like to emphasise that forests are incredibly important to our continent and that they affect a very large number of people.
In Sweden, forests and forest management account for nearly 30% of the economy, and there are more than 15 million forest owners in Europe.
What we decide here in Parliament is therefore of great importance to a lot of people, both at home in Sweden and in many parts of Europe.
I know that there is great anxiety about the EU interfering in forestry issues and beginning to take decisions and about Brussels starting to meddle in this area.
I can understand that concern, for such interference would not be helpful.
There are huge differences between an olive grove in southern Italy and an industrial forestry business in northern Sweden.
Decisions about forests should be taken locally and close to those who are familiar with the forests and who use and own them.
I wish, however, to reassure those who fear such a development.
I believe that the Commission is extremely clear in its statement: forestry policy should be based on subsidiarity.
This is the starting point for those of us in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
That does not, however, mean that the EU does not have any responsibility for forestry.
On the contrary, the EU has a big responsibility, namely that of taking account of the forests in all its decision-making.
Now already, the EU takes a great many political decisions that affect European forests either directly or indirectly.
We in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety find, however, that coordination between the various proposals affecting our forests is almost non-existent.
This state of affairs both makes for inconsistency between different environmental objectives and affects the basic conditions under which forests are managed.
I wish, therefore, to emphasise that, in my opinion, the Commissionâs most important task in the future is to coordinate existing policy and monitor how it affects forests.
Moreover, preliminary assessments able to take account of the ways in which different political decisions affect European forests and forest management must be carried out in good time.
In conclusion, I should like to emphasise the importance of forest management.
It is probably the branch of industry that most clearly creates both economic and environmental value.
As the Commission points out, EU forestry does, however, have problems being competitive in the global, open market, and that is something that has a price in terms of environmental value.
My and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safetyâs message to you today is, therefore, that, by taking account of our forests, the Commission should be able to create sound and stable conditions for forest management and thus give Europe both a better economy and a better environment.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank MrÂ Kindermann for his wise and balanced report, as he has put a great deal of commitment and empathy into achieving a compromise and drafting a balanced text.
We are in favour of the forest strategy, Commissioner, but against market regulation, and that is something we want to make quite clear.
We are in favour of subsidiarity in forestry policy and are convinced that we should continue to go down that path.
We certainly should pay much more attention to this sector.
If only 85% of the forested area in the European Union is managed, we must do our level best to bring the other 15% into the economic cycle; and if, as MrÂ Kindermann has indicated, only 60% of the wood grown is used, it is all the more important to draw attention to it: it is only if they are used that these forests can be protected.
Let me also say that the fairy tale of the dying forests of Europe we have been told for decades really was a fairy tale, a tale told more for political effect than for any other reason.
If there is growth of 450Â thousand hectares a year, then the forests are certainly not dying, but expanding.
It thus only remains for me, Commissioner, to ask you to incorporate into your work as much as possible of what ultimately remains binding in the text following tomorrow's vote, and I am pleased that you have already agreed to do so at the end of your speech.
Â Â  . â Commissioner, the European forest, and its economic, social and environmental importance, is a subject in which we have a shared interest.
We must never overlook the fact that forests account for 35% of EU territory, 3.5Â million jobs, 15 million owners and a production value of over EURÂ 350Â million.
These figures illustrate the importance of the issue and the importance that the European institutions should be attaching to it.
This is especially true at a time when various factors â be they natural or man-made â pose such a threat to forests.
In a particularly complex international context, the Union urgently needs a fresh approach to the energy question, whereby biomass is duly brought to the fore, and this is borne out by the priority that the Commission and the Austrian Presidency have been attaching to the issue.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs communication on the implementation of the strategy and commend MrÂ Kindermann on his report.
I welcome much of the report, which represents an excellent contribution from Parliament to the formation of Europeâs forestry strategy.
Furthermore, there are a number of proposed amendments which I believe will help to improve upon and complete the report.
The fact that the report acknowledges the vulnerabilities of the forest is a welcome contribution to the ongoing debate on natural disasters.
The Commission will hopefully, therefore, adopt an integrated approach to this vitally important issue, an approach that sees the problem, as we do, as a whole.
In this way, the contributions of the various instruments now on the political agenda can help to improve the situation for Europeâs forests.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a balanced one.
Although it does not endorse the idea of a common forestry policy, it does stress the need for coordination.
The report acknowledges that Member States vary in their definitions of what is meant by the word âforestâ, which makes it difficult to offer a definitive assessment of important Community forestry measures.
I, for one, am disappointed that the proposal to set up a European observatory has not been adopted.
Such an observatory would have led to the use of reliable, retrievable data.
That aside, I support the proposals calling on the Commission to improve coordination between the various Directorates-General concerned with forestry issues and to strengthen the role of the Standing Forestry Committee.
I tabled an amendment calling on the Commission to make proposals to the Member States based, in particular, on tax arrangements and designed to encourage forest owners to plant indigenous species in order to maintain biodiversity and reduce fire risks.
The spirit of this proposal was echoed in the report, which recommends the adoption of measures for the prevention of fires and desertification, afforestation with native species, the promotion of diversity, the sustainable management of natural forests and the promotion of environmental services, particularly with a view to protecting water systems and combating erosion.
The implementation of these measures entails investments on the part of forest owners.
As they provide benefits to society, they deserve to be duly compensated.
Lastly, the report takes account of my hopes and fears for the sector.
It sets out the priority axes for a policy that will be global, yet will cater specifically for each region, taking account of the economic, social and environmental potential of the forestry sector.
Thank you, MrÂ Kindermann, for your work, which I believe will secure a large majority in tomorrowâs vote.
Â Â  . â The undoubted need to maintain forests and to preserve their multifunctional nature requires effective management and support measures that take account of the range of forests and their specific problems.
I therefore do not accept the idea of emphasising a one-size-fits-all concept of the forest, when we know that there are internationally accepted definitions underpinning reports on, and periodical assessments of, the state of forests in Europe and the rest of the world.
Whilst we welcome an EU Action Plan for the sustainable development of forests, we do not endorse a number of the proposals put forward in the report before us.
We regret the rejection of a number of proposals that we made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, aimed at warning of the situation in the forests of southern Europe, which face fires on a yearly basis, and which in some years are stricken by drought; such was the case in Portugal last year, where some 300Â 000Â hectares of forest burned, with enormous costs and serious consequences for the forest, biodiversity, farmers and the populations of vast areas.
We therefore call for a proper medium and long-term forest-fire prevention strategy, a specific regulation and a dedicated budgetary heading with a view to protecting the forests against fires, taking account of resolutions that have actually already been adopted by Parliament and of what happened to the previous specific Community regulation, which was regrettably removed by the Commission.
We also feel that the next Action Plan should cover seven years, so as to correspond to the next financial perspective.
The Plan should include a programme for the protection of cork-oak forests, and a contribution towards the rearing of livestock and cork production, which is of vital importance for rural development across vast areas of countries in the south.
We trust that the Commission will take on board the proposals â not contained in the report but which we once again wish to stress â to make the Action Plan a proactive instrument in the protection and promotion of the range of forests, including those in the countries of the South where the climate is most conducive to forest fires.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, the figures that characterise forest structure in the 15 countries of the old European Union in terms of forest cover are very good and amount to 35% of the total land area, with a significant majority in the hands of 15 million private owners.
However, with forests divided to this extent among private owners, the question arises as to how economies of scale can be achieved in forest management.
I am not against private forest ownership.
In my home country, Poland, the majority of forests are state-owned, the exact figure being 82%, with 2% of this accounted for by national parks.
By comparison with other EU countries, the structure of our forests is much richer and older.
The Polish forestry model is efficient and effective.
State-owned forests are a self-financing, profit-making institution.
However, what European Union aid for forests in Central Europe provides is substantial funding to train people who plant trees on their own private land, and funding for payments.
Support is also needed for areas that are not exploited commercially, national parks and reserves.
The infrastructure linked to forestry needs modernisation.
I call on the Commission and Parliament to draw on the experience of forest management in Poland.
Western Europe can learn from experience too.
Not everything that is private is always best.
Non-private forests also need support.
The wealth of Polish forests benefits society across the entire European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, what I have to say also concerns the problem facing Polish forests mentioned by the previous speaker.
Polandâs forests are a significant resource, but unlike in most EU countries, the majority â more than 80% of the total area â are state-owned.
This is the result of a long historical process and at present there are no reasons for a radical change in the structure of forest ownership in Poland.
Public opinion in Poland is largely in favour of forests continuing to be state-owned.
The problem is that the EU has thus far discriminated against state-owned forests, denying them support.
I am pleased that MrÂ Kindermannâs report contains one amendment that holds out the hope that the situation will change and that EU support will be given to forests irrespective of how they are owned.
This is something we very much need in Poland and we trust that the Commission will demonstrate understanding of the situation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to our rapporteur for his very balanced report, for he has taken a very balanced approach to the three pillars of sustainability â the economic, the ecological and the sociocultural.
This report reflects the European model of forestry: multifunctional forest management, predominantly private ownership of forests and a close entwinement with agriculture, leisure space for citizens and living space for plants and animals.
The report also refers to the regional characteristics of forest management: in the South, for example, as has already been mentioned, the problems of forest fires and cork oaks; in Central Europe the high utility of the forests alongside their considerable importance for relaxation, tourism and vital protective functions, particularly in Alpine areas; and in northern Europe primarily the market orientation of timber production.
It also emphasises the importance to climate policy of wood as an energy source and building material to replace fossil fuels and building materials.
I would like to thank the Commissioner for making specific reference to this.
I see sustainably managed forests as being a sort of green lung.
This report particularly emphasises the need to coordinate forestry-related policies at EU level and to take joint measures, agreed by vote to achieve additional effects for European forestry, whilst safeguarding subsidiarity.
It follows, then, that what we are talking about here is a European forestry strategy.
I would like to make quite clear my opposition to market regulation of forest management, which has been put up for discussion time and time again.
Once again, many thanks for this report.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, tomorrow the European Parliament will approve the report by MrÂ Kindermann and, in doing so, it will be sending the Commission and the Council a clear message about the approach we want the future action plan for our forests to take.
Of all of the ideas on which we have worked in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to stress the innovative nature of the proposals relating to the ban on changes in use of burnt land.
This measure, which we are already applying with considerable success in my country, Spain, has the great virtue of discouraging those people who destroy our forest heritage whose sole motivation is then to speculate with the land.
I therefore believe that the future European forest plan must opt clearly for a policy for preserving our forests and enhancing and making the best possible use of the immense resources obtained from forest soil.
I would also like to say, however, that for a long time we Spanish Members of Parliament and many Members from countries of the South have been calling for a common forest policy to serve as an instrument for managing this heritage, which benefits the whole of the Union.
I therefore believe that we must not take the wrong approach: the protection of forests is good for the North and good for the South.
We would have liked some of our suggestions about the Mediterranean forest to have been taken into account.
We all agree that the forests play a fundamental role and provide us with resources that are closely linked to the future of the Union and to the objectives we all set in Lisbon.
The multifunctional role of the forests must be enhanced on the basis of a common approach.
We would therefore urge you, Commissioner, to consider common regulation of what we see as an asset and a heritage for the whole of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the rapporteur, MrÂ Kindermann, has drafted an excellent report on the implementation of a European Union forestry strategy.
My sincere thanks go to him for that.
I also wish to thank him for the excellent cooperation he showed in preparing the report.
As we have already said, in the European Union forestry employs 3.4 million people, and the value of its output stands at EUR 350 billion.
In many countries, such as Finland and Sweden, its importance to the economy is crucial.
Aside from production, forestry provides employment for a cluster of industries related to it, among which is the very considerable metal and electrical engineering industry.
Its importance will only grow as new possibilities for producing energy are sought.
The EU, however, has no common forestry plan, although many areas of policy, such as rural development and environmental policy, impact greatly on this sector.
It is therefore appropriate to undertake a comprehensive assessment of action on forests.
The report makes the assumption that, even in the future, forestry policy itself will fall within the competence of the Member States.
The tone of the report suggests that there is no desire to create new bureaucracy similar to the European Unionâs agricultural policy.
The report supports the Commissionâs project for an action plan for sustainable forest management in the EU.
The very fact that this area of policy is so fragmented makes this necessary.
There have to be better guarantees for the success and future of a sector of industry that employs sustainable, renewable natural resources.
The report is not in favour of setting up a separate forestry agency.
This is quite right.
We in the EU need to learn to rationalise our policies so as to be able to perform new tasks with the resources currently available, without always establishing new agencies.
I await the Commissionâs new proposals with interest.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst thanking MrÂ Kindermann for his report, I would like to stress that the EUâs forestry strategy should have one single goal, namely a systematic extension of the land area covered by forests, particularly large forests.
Only in forests covering more than 500 ha can the biodiversity of plant and animal species be restored.
The afforestation policy can be implemented most effectively in the new Member States, particularly in Poland.
This is because of Polandâs very effective model of ownership and the right to work and exploit forests.
The evidence for this is that in 50 years Poland has increased its forests by almost 50% and the only virgin forests in the Union are in fact in Poland.
Large-scale hunting for deer, boar and elk goes on in Polish forests.
Everyone has access to the forests and those who hunt in them are involved in their management.
Allocating more funds to afforestation in the new Member States is not the best strategy.
Supporting and promoting the Polish model of forest management is, in my view, desirable.
The EU should treat state-owned forests at least as well as privatelyâowned ones.
It follows that state-owned forestry undertakings should have the same right to financial support as private ones.
Any kind of discrimination against state-owned forestry undertakings makes no economic sense.
Most importantly, it makes no sense either from the ecological point of view.
Â Â  Mr President, the EUâs forests are characterised by their great diversity.
The conditions for preserving their multi-functional role are also diverse.
This means that forest management must be well-planned and sustainable in order to maximise a forestâs protective and social functions, which are no less important than its productive functions.
Forest owners play a major role in forest management.
Studies and reports show that management is at its best in state-owned forests.
Unfortunately, in contrast to privately-owned forests, state-owned forests cannot rely on significant assistance from EU funds.
It is therefore necessary to reconsider whether the existing forestry strategy is appropriate, and whether state-owned forests should not also come within the scope of EU assistance.
We must remember that when all is said and done, what matters to people is the forest, not who owns it.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Commissionâs report before us sets out the main conclusions of the analysis of the European forestry strategy and the emerging problems affecting the forestry sector, and suggests measures that might be taken in the future.
Experience has shown that the forestry sector can help deliver the Lisbon Strategy objectives of sustainable economic development and competitiveness and the Gothenburg objectives, including the safeguarding of Europeâs natural resources.
The Commission is proposing to develop a European Action Plan for forest management that will be able to provide a consistent framework for implementing measures in the field of forestry, and in so doing help to make the most of the sectorâs potential for Europe.
The Treaty establishing European Union does not, however, lay down a legal basis for a common forestry policy.
What is more, neither the sectoral Community policies on the forest, nor the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies, have ultimately been sufficiently efficient to combat the deterioration of forests.
I wish to remind the Chamber of the tragedy of the forest fires and the drought which have laid waste to southern Europe in recent years, and which have unfortunately hit Portugal particularly badly.
I realise that some may see this situation as nothing more than a distant problem, but I should like to draw your attention to the major difficulties that the forestry sector in southern Europe is facing, and the problems endured by the citizens who depend on the sector.
In view of its serious nature, this problem needs to be tackled, and a committed and far-reaching approach adopted, as a matter of urgency.
A common forestry policy is, more than ever, of vital importance.
I therefore believe that the Member States should think very carefully about the environmental, social and economic benefits of introducing a common policy within the context of the future Constitution.
I therefore call on the Chamber to support Amendments 7, 8 and 9, to which I have put my name, along with MrsÂ Herranz Garcia and others.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe this report to be very positive and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague MrÂ Kindermann, most warmly on his work.
We Spanish Socialists identify in particular with this text because it recognises the importance of the forest sector in the European Union, on the basis of broader criteria than the purely economic and also because it highlights the need to produce a single interpretation of the concept of forest.
Furthermore, because it makes particular mention of fires and the management of disasters, which are the two great problems facing the Spanish forests, and because it supports the general approach and the results of the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, which is a process in which Spain plays a very prominent role, since it is one of the four States that are leading it.
Furthermore, because I believe that the report by MrÂ Kindermann provides new elements which deserve to be taken into account, such as â and I believe this to be very important â the need to facilitate coordination and cooperation, both amongst the units of the Commission and between the units of the Commission and the Member States, and enhancing the fields of research, training and communication to the public, fields that are in line with the Spanish forest plan.
I would like to thank MrÂ Kindermann very much for having accepted my amendment, relating to the fundamental role played by forests as regulators of the water cycle, but I would still like to see an express mention of the importance of Community intervention in contributing to the maintenance and remuneration, where necessary, of the environmental services that forests provide for the whole of society.
In this regard, although I believe that we should take account of the importance of the economic and environmental aspect, I would like to say to the Commissioner and the rapporteur that I will continue working to achieve a genuine Community policy in this field.
Â Â  â The EU does not have a common forestry policy.
However, the importance of forestry has prompted the creation of the EU Forestry Strategy, and the Commission is preparing an action plan for its implementation.
The EU forestry sector is incredibly diverse in terms of forest types, sizes, ownership structures and social-economic conditions.
Around 60% of forests are private.
The 10 new Member States have more state-owned forests than the former EU15.
In Lithuania, 50% of forests are state-owned, 33% private and 17% are reserved for the restoration of ownership rights.
In Lithuania, forest management is the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment.
State and private forests are managed by different sections of the ministry.
Three thousand workers work in state forests, while private ones are run by just 120 officials.
Not only is forestry management complex, there is also a gap between timber growers and processors.
The question arises whether it would not be better if forests were administered by an independent Forestry Ministry?
Perhaps the Commission could provide some examples of good practice experience in forestry management?
Â Â  â (Mr President, speaking today in the debate on the EUâs forestry strategy, I would like to draw your attention to two facts I consider to be very important.
In Poland, the State Treasury owns over 80% of the countryâs forests that are managed on its behalf by the State forestry undertaking, .
Their management, which has spanned a period of several decades, has been acknowledged in World Bank and EU reports as a veritable model of forest management.
Secondly, the European Union allocated around EUR 5Â billion for forestry measures from rural development funds in the period 2000-2006.
Unfortunately, despite the efforts of a number of my fellow Members, state-run forestry cannot benefit from these funds.
Consequently, my appeal to you, Commissioner, is that this critical shortcoming in the financing of the forestry strategy be rectified in the next seven-year period, namely 2007-2013.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, allow me, too, to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, MrÂ Kindermann, for his excellent report and to endorse all of his demands.
In these times of empty coffers, some people are pulling their hair out when they hear about the new things that the EU is doing and spending money on.
However, the EU forestry strategy and the drafting of an EU action plan for sustainable forest management are not new activities and expenditure.
Forestry policy is not a Community matter, although it cannot be denied it, and forest management too, are increasingly influenced by policy in other areas such as the environment and agriculture.
Ever increasing social demands and environmental standards are also pushing the forest and timber industry to the very edge of profitability.
If they are pushed over this edge, the managers will withdraw from the fray.
We see the EU action plan as an opportunity to improve the framework conditions for forest management in the enlarged European Union.
I think there are two key aspects to this: first, improving communication and coordination structures at EU level, and secondly appointing a structural unit within the Commission to take primary responsibility for implementing forestry action plans and strategies.
There are three things that we do not need: firstly, European regulation of the timber market, secondly, more bureaucracy, and thirdly, particularly in the current financial situation, I reject EU aid for communal or state forests.
Forestry in Central Europe is characterised by multifunctionality.
We hope that social, ecological and economic sustainability will continue to be exemplary in the European context, and that European forestry will remain competitive.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must first commend our rapporteur, MrÂ Kindermann, for his outstanding report.
It is crucial that the importance of forests in the EU be taken into account, in compliance with the subsidiarity principle, on account of the area that forests cover in the rural environment, their position in the rural economy as a complementary sector of activity to agriculture and their role in landscape planning, for example in preventing, and limiting the impact of, natural phenomena such as flooding and erosion.
There are several reasons why an EU forestry strategy would make it possible to establish sustainable development in forests.
Firstly, it would help mitigate climate change and would contribute to sustainable energy supplies, in particular biomass.
In this regard, I welcome the agreement reached at the Ecofin Council authorising the application of a reduced rate of VAT for the production of heat and refrigeration from wood.
In practice, such a reduction should encourage the development of this renewable energy source and of new outlets for the wood sector.
Furthermore, forestry activities also create wealth and jobs, whether this beÂ âŠ
Â Â  â First of all, I want to thank my colleague Mr Kindermann for preparing the report on the implementation of the EU Forestry Strategy.
The draft of this report was also debated in Lithuania and was well received by the Forest Owners Association of Lithuania.
In Lithuania, forests are by tradition an important part of our way of life, culture, mentality and economy.
This subject is doubtless relevant to the whole of the European Union, in which 60% of forests are managed by 15Â million private owners and the average size of a privately-owned forest is only around 13 ha.
All of the EU Forestry Strategy is important, but today I would like to talk specifically about the eighth strategy element of the report, that is, the stimulation of competitiveness, employment and profitability in the forestry sector, and more precisely its 25th point, which states: âcalls on the Commission and Member States to include in the EU Action Plan for Sustainable Forest Management effective action measures to avert dangers and cope with serious disasters (fires, storms, insect infestations and drought)â.
The report correctly underlines that a large part of the European Union's assistance for forest fire prevention is now obtained from rural development funds, and that it is necessary to consolidate the coordination of regional and national programmes by preparing Community strategic guidelines, which would help to coordinate preventive measures implemented by different state institutions.
Within this context I would like to draw your attention to the trial project for battling against natural disasters, which, thanks to the efforts of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we incorporated into the EU 2006 Budget.
It has been allocated EUR 6.5 million.
The trial project is aimed at funding preventive measures to fight natural disasters, including forest fires and droughts.
I am confident that the funding of preventive measures is a much more effective means of implementing the Forestry Strategy than battling with the consequences of fires and droughts and awarding compensation from the EU Solidarity Fund for the caused damage.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank my colleague, Mr Kindermann, particularly for successfully probing into the issue of what European policy on forestry is and what it should be doing.
I would especially like to focus attention on the multi-use aspect of forests and the use of wood in new, innovative ways.
Wood as a raw material has many properties which remain unexploited.
For example, wood can be used instead of plastic, thus saving non-renewable raw materials.
The chemical industry could exploit wood as a raw material, and the properties it has, in totally new ways.
There is a lot of potential in the foodstuffs industry; for example, in the production of healthy foods.
All this, however, requires new research and knowledge.
I therefore suggest that we should consider establishing a top-level research unit in Europe for the forest and wood sector to address this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is my view that the Union needs a common forestry management strategy.
I fully agree with the principles on which this strategy is based, particularly the recognition of the multifunctional nature of forests and their significance for the economy, the quality of life, environmental protection and the protection of biodiversity.
As a member of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I also welcome the fact that the report, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur, calls for support for the production of biomass from wood.
Many parts of the report show the need to look at forestry management in the context of other common policies, such as environmental protection or energy.
In order for the strategy to be effective, however, it must also comply with the financial instruments of the EU.
In this context, I should like to point out that current regulations on financial support from the Union virtually exclude all mention of forests owned by the state or state enterprises.
It is possible for these forests to receive aid only in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters, but no longer for everyday requirements such as investment.
This is a key issue, particularly for countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland, where more than 50% of the forested land is in state hands.
I am pleased that the report states that EU support should not be made dependent on the form of ownership of forests.
Surely a forest is a forest, whether owned by private individuals, the state or local authorities.
Is its significance altered in any way by the form of ownership?
European law should apply the principle that all forms of ownership are equal and enjoy the same legal protection.
I hope that this report will contribute to raising the profile of the forestry sector in the EU and will encourage the Commission and the Council to devote more attention to this area.
A start could be made, for example, by setting up specialist working groups or platforms for exchanging experiences and harmonising national strategies.
It is necessary to bring about a situation where national experts in the area of forestry management will be able to view EU institutions as discussion partners.
Â Â  Mr President, the implementation of a common forestry strategy in our countries will as usual be linked to the provision of funding for these measures.
This will not be a problem for many countries, because most forests are public or privately-owned.
What, however, can be done in countries such as Poland where most of them are owned and managed by the state?
The number of my fellow Members from Poland speaking today is testimony to the magnitude of the problem.
However, I do not share their view and believe that until such time as a balance is struck between state and private ownership, funding should go only to privately-owned forests.
The number of funding applications for new forests has already exceeded the funding allocated for the purpose.
In the first year of the programme, new forest plantings amounted to about 6Â 000Â ha.
This is an opportunity to change the structure of ownership, lower the cost of timber production and implement a common forestry policy in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased that the key issue of forestry is being debated in Parliament and that it is also the concern of other EU and international institutions.
The Commission submitted to Parliament a communication on the implementation of the forestry strategy to date.
It also sets out the issues to be included in the Unionâs action plan for sustainable forestry management.
Its setting is general and succinct and it identifies the way forward to a true balance between the economic, environmental and social functions of forests within a model of sustainable forest management.
The Natura 2000 ecological network is in place in the European Union.
However, the success of this initiative will depend on the proper functioning of the funding mechanism for the network.
The rules for funding biodiversity, which is the main objective of Natura 2000, should be the same for every form of ownership in the Natura 2000 network, whether private or public.
Funding for forestry-linked programmes must come from funds allocated for this purpose in the Union budget, and should not be dealt with in the context of rural development.
European taxpayers will be happier funding forestry or the environment than the common agricultural policy.
Forests cover one third of Europe and provide a whole range of environmental, social and economic benefits to the community.
Cross-sectoral relationships must be better understood and citizens of the Union better informed about the problems and needs of the forestry sector.
Our main objective should be to get forestry and the community to work together.
The forestry sector can make an important contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives.
Forests have an influence on scenic and cultural values and serve as a base for other kinds of activities such as hunting and tourism.
They are also a source of raw materials for renewable energy.
It is important to remember that preserving the natural and environmental functions of forests that are needed to safeguard and balance the ecosystem requires money as well as know-how.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have been greatly encouraged by the very engaged and highly interesting debate on this important issue, and I should like now to refer to some of the questions that have been raised during our discussion.
On vertical integration in the Commission, two main points must be noted.
Firstly, the Commission has very recently set up a new unit in its Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development with a much stronger focus on forestry.
This unit is presently coordinating the preparatory work on the EU forest action plan and chairs the meetings of the interservice group on forestry.
Secondly, the interservice group on forestry, which was established in 2002 to facilitate cooperation and coordination of forestry-related work between relevant Commission services, has proved to be an effective tool of coordination and is working very satisfactorily.
Its membership has increased and now comprises 11 Commission services.
It is very actively involved in the preparation of the action plan and will have a very important role in its implementation.
Regarding the legal basis, several legal studies have been carried out in the Member States concerning the creation of a separate legal basis for forestry in the Treaties.
In our opinion, unless the position of the Member States changes, the added value of further legal studies on this issue is questionable.
Regarding the concerns raised about the establishment of a European forest observatory, I believe that this should be discussed primarily among the Member States, which have the main responsibility for our forestry policy.
They can assess the added value of such an initiative in the light of the current structures and existing international institutions.
I am aware of the importance of the problem of forest fires in the European Union and the need to continue to prevent these situations from arising.
I had the opportunity to see the horrible consequences of these forest fires last year during a visit to Portugal.
The current Rural Development Regulation provides support to the Member States for important forest fire prevention measures, such as fire breaks, water points and preventive sylviculture, as well as for the restoration of the forestry production potential in forests that have been damaged by fires.
I should like to indicate that these actions will be continued during the period 2007â2013 under the new Rural Development Regulation, and Member States will, therefore, have the possibility to include forest fire prevention measures in their rural development programmes.
The rural development measures will be complemented by the actions that will be undertaken under the LIFE+ programme for the next financial period.
In this respect, following an initiative of the European Parliament, the Commission will launch a study to examine the main causes of forest deterioration in Europe, including forest fires, and the efficiency of the current measures, as well as possible future options to improve the situation.
Quite a few honourable Members mentioned state-owned forests.
It is clear that the main objective for rural development is to revitalise rural areas and not to finance public authoritiesâ activities.
This is why the main target group of beneficiaries of the rural development measures related to forestry is the private sector, notably farmers, foresters and, under axis 3 in the rural development policy, the broader rural society.
However, there are derogations concerning the exclusion of state-owned forests from support under the new Rural Development Regulation in order to take into account the specific situations of certain regions and the characteristics of particular measures.
Finally, I shall make two comments on the content of the action plan.
Firstly, the action plan will be designed in accordance with the key principles of the European Union forestry strategy.
The main responsibility for forest policy lies with the Member States, and actions at Community level will continue to be based on the principle of subsidiarity.
Our intention is to concentrate Community actions on those areas where there is a clear added value.
The second point is that the action plan will also identify Community instruments that can be used by the Member States for the implementation of the proposed actions, for instance, the new Rural Development Regulation, the LIFE+ instrument or â as was also mentioned here â the seventh Research Framework Programme.
In this respect, the action plan will strengthen the overall visibility of forestry and increase the complementarity of different Community actions in support of sustainable forest management.
Concerning the specific proposals in the report, the Commission welcomes the recommendations contained in paragraphs 1, 4, 7, 11, 12, 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26 and 29.
There are a number of recommendations, notably paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 22, 23 and 30, which are addressed also to the Member States, and the Commission will discuss these specific proposals with the Member States when we elaborate further on the action plan.
The Commission has also taken good note of recommendation 9, and we will look into it: coordination is certainly an issue to be addressed.
Finally, there are a number of recommendations, such as 2, 13, 15, 25, 27, 28, 30 and 32, which will go beyond the key principle of the European forest strategy or may not be completely in line with the regulations already adopted.
Once again, I thank you for an extremely interesting and very good report and also for this engaged discussion, which has been very supportive.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Â Â  â The purpose of the forest action plan is to consolidate the core principles of the forestry strategy, namely sustainable forest management and strengthening the increasingly multifunctional role played by forests, highlighting their economic, social, cultural, recreational and environmental dimensions and complying with the subsidiarity principle.
It is right not to go down the road of setting up a common forestry policy.
That being said, we could have gone further by setting up a structure specially tasked with coordinating, on the one hand, national and Community policy and, on the other, all those working in the forestry sector.
Forest owners are also among the guarantors of biodiversity.
The management of animal species goes hand in hand with the management of habitats.
Forests have a substantial capacity for hosting wildlife, and the species that naturally colonise these habitats deserve to exist.
What is more, the management of forest damage does not necessarily entail the reckless destruction of animal populations.
There must be coordination and dialogue between forest owners and hunters if biodiversity is to be fostered and if the right balance is to be struck between forests and game.
Â Â  The next item is the report byÂ MrsÂ McGuinness, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Decision on Community strategic guidelines for Rural Development (Programming period 2007 2013), [COM(2005)0304 C6-0349/2005 2005/0129(CNS)] (A6-0023/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my thanks to Parliament for the support it has provided over recent months in our common goal of further establishing rural development as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
I am convinced, as I am sure you are, that it is a policy that really adds value to the European area.
Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, our rural development regulation was adopted last autumn.
The strategic guidelines which are before you today are an essential element in taking further the process of developing national strategies and rural development programmes in the different Member States.
I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs McGuinness, for their help in bringing the opinion forward in a very timely manner.
We are still well on the way to delivering our rural development programmes on time.
Our strategic guidelines for rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 are meant to guide Member States in the development of their own national strategies and programmes.
I am convinced that our policy will offer many opportunities to make the rural development policy a success, but we will have to use it in the right way.
We must use it to help unlock the innovative capacity of our agri-food and forestry sectors and the economic, environmental and social potential of our rural areas and the people who live in them.
It is an extraordinary potential and it is our responsibility to do everything we can to mobilise it.
The Community strategic guidelines will be a first step towards achieving this, firstly by identifying and agreeing the areas where the use of European Union support for rural development will create good added value.
Secondly, by making the link with both the reform of the common agricultural policy and the necessary restructuring, the strengthening of the second pillar provides opportunities both for farmers and for jobs and growth.
I have made it very clear that rural development should contribute to the Lisbon and GÃ¶teborg strategies, and I think we are doing just that.
Thirdly, consistency with other European Union policies will be ensured, in particular in the field of cohesion and environment.
Let me now say a few words about the amendments.
The report proposes many helpful suggestions and I am very grateful for this.
In my view, many of the amendments tabled by Members reflect important issues that are not reflected adequately in the Commission proposal.
These can be taken either wholly or partially into account.
On the other hand, there are a number of proposed amendments which we feel are already dealt with adequately in the current text.
I see this as a clear indication of the very broad consensus between the Commission and Parliament about the aims of our rural development policy.
Let me conclude this introduction, therefore, by expressing my agreement with the issues raised by the rapporteur in her report: the role of modernisation measures, the need for measures to help to encourage young farmers and farming families to stay in rural areas, and the importance of putting the heart back into our villages, sustainable farming and preservation of the rural heritage.
Above all, a vibrant, commercial and sustainable agriculture is essential for the development or our rural regions, in which we have a huge common interest.
Â Â  . Mr President, at the outset I should like to thank all those who have assisted with this report and the colleagues who put forward amendments, which were extremely helpful.
In my past life as a journalist I had the great pleasure of reporting on the many success stories of rural development, which, as you said, Commissioner, unlocked the potential of rural areas.
I mention, in particular, those under the Leader Programme.
Rural development in action is much more interesting than the theory behind it.
However, we need to have rules, and that is why in this report we have set out strategic guidelines to allow Member States to plan their programmes from 2007 onwards.
I believe that the guidelines offer the flexibility that Member States need in order to draw up those programmes.
Each Member States has different needs because rural areas differ right across the 25Â Member States.
We talk about the two pillars of the CAP â agriculture and rural development.
Some people speak of two different policies, but it is important to remember that it is a single policy with two different pillars.
I am glad to hear you say, Commissioner, that agriculture is still of huge importance.
We should not ignore the reality that a vibrant, commercial and sustainable farm sector is a vital component of rural life.
Of course, rural development has a much wider remit: it provides for restructuring of rural regions and it allows for environmental protection and for measures to improve the quality of life for rural people.
Just last week I presented certificates to mature students in Tullamore, a town in the midlands of Ireland.
These courses were promoted by the local Leader group.
Each and every one of the students spoke about what a great value it was to them and how it had improved the quality of their lives and that of their community.
Benefits will flow from that.
It is another example of rural development in action â and it does work.
Rural areas are different from urban areas, but the policy priorities for rural regions have to fit in with the overall objectives, as you have set out, of competitiveness and economic growth, environmental sustainability and quality-of-life issues.
Because of time constraints, I will not go through all of the details. However, improving the competitiveness of agriculture, forestry and food is a priority.
We need ongoing investment in research and development across all of the range of activities in rural regions.
In the report, we stressed the importance of job consolidation and maintenance, just as we stressed the importance of job creation.
When we reform agriculture there will be changes in employment in rural areas.
A quality environment is key to the future of rural regions. So, too, is the ongoing restructuring of the agriculture sector.
Where we have measures in place to try to encourage young people into farming, we must ensure that they are sufficient to do just that.
Across the European Union we hear of young people not wanting to farm.
We may regret that in the future, as it has implications, not just for food production, but also for the quality of our rural environment and landscape.
We want young people because we want a living countryside.
Without people, we have very little else.
We also allow for regional specialities to be promoted; organic farming by traditional means is provided for as well.
Once again, the priority is to ensure that these measures and this production are market led and that the measures we put in place under rural development programmes add value to these local products.
Non-food uses are also very important, and other reports discussed here tonight spoke of renewable energies and biomass.
Ensuring that the rural communities have access to basic services, such as childcare and education, is also very important.
We need to talk about the quality and affordability of those services.
A key requirement in rural regions is access to information technology: to IT training and broadband.
I spoke earlier about the great success of rural development in the town of Tullamore but, in case you think all is wonderful in rural Ireland, in terms of broadband penetration, we are unfortunately languishing in 17th place in the European Union.
Broadband, in my view, is just as essential as electricity to rural regions, and yet many parts of rural Europe do not have this basic facility.
It means that they cannot provide jobs and that small and medium-sized enterprises are held back.
With regard to the budget, we did not have access to the final details when this report was being drawn up.
We now know that there is a reduction EURÂ 20Â billion in funding for rural development for the period 2007 onwards, compared with what the Commission had forecast.
It is a bad signal to send to rural areas.
I have huge concerns about the possibility for Member States to cut 20Â % of market support measures and direct payments and to allocate it to rural development.
That is robbing Peter to pay Paul.
It is, in my view, a renationalisation of agriculture policy by the back door.
It is also unworkable in its current form.
It now emerges that Member States who opt for this voluntary modulation can spend the money in any way they choose, without regard to the rules or indeed national cofinancing; this is regrettable.
We must make rural development work for people and the places in which they live.
In so doing, we will continue to see the fruits of the policy and ensure that rural development has a future beyond 2013.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the thanks of the Committee on Regional Development are due to Mrs McGuinness, not just for the quality of her final report, but also for her close cooperation with us in producing it.
Although the original Commission proposal contains much of value, we have concerns about certain aspects.
These include, in particular: the need for more recognition of the diversity of rural areas; greater clarity on the activities to which the individual axes are addressed; fuller attention under Axis 1 to forestry, the fuel chain and renewable energy resources; additional detail under Axis 2 as to the environmental goods to be promoted, including preservation of the cultural, as well as the natural, heritage; and a heavier emphasis under Axis 3 on measures to improve the quality of life and social inclusion in rural areas in parallel with, and as an aspect of, maintaining and developing employment.
On a broader level, the committee wishes to stress the promotion of both sustainability and territorial cohesion with the need for an integrated approach that would embody appropriate spatial planning and foster coherence between the actions engendered by all sources of European funding.
In that context, we emphasise the importance of the partnership principle and of the broadest possible involvement of all competent authorities and appropriate bodies in developing strategies at regional and/or national level as appropriate to the Member State concerned.
We are delighted by the extent to which the report addresses our concerns and commend its content to the Commission, recognising, with thanks to the Commissioner, that she has already touched on some of these issues in her introduction.
We commend it to the Council and to Parliament as a whole.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would very much like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ McGuiness, for her report.
As the Commissioner has already said in her introductory remarks, this report looks at the strategic guidelines as a bridge between the provisions of the Council regulation on rural development and the implementation of those provisions in the Member States in the form of national strategies and programme planning documents.
One major problem is the lack of the Financial Perspective.
I know, Commissioner, that you are not happy with the Council's decision in December to reduce funding for rural development, but we need to finally set up the financial framework so that the programmes can be started on time in the Member States.
The greater flexibility in relation to the priorities is important for us all.
The Community strategic guidelines form the basis for establishing national strategies.
An important aspect in this is that, on the one hand, the EU's priorities have been taken into account but, on the other, the Member States have been left with sufficient room for manoeuvre.
This is not just about creating new jobs, but also about safeguarding existing employment opportunities in agriculture and forestry and safeguarding all related industries, which are very important to the employment situation in our rural regions, so that we can achieve the goals that MrsÂ McGuiness talked about so decisively.
Our aim must continue to be to work together to achieve the objectives of Lisbon and Gothenburg.
Â Â  . Mrs McGuinnes has done an excellent job with this report.
I would like to thank her for the excellent cooperation, as in the report she had taken into account all the comments of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
I am extremely delighted that this report is in full agreement with the earlier report of MrsÂ Schierhuber.
I know that the issue of rural development is extremely important to the Commissioner.
We all talk about the fact that rural development has been the greatest loser of the seven-year budget.
It is shocking that while all of us â both the Commission and Parliament say that rural development, the second pillar, ought to be given more money, exactly the opposite is happening.
And this is why the report of MrsÂ McGuinnes is so important, because if there is no more money in the system, and in fact there is less money, then the system should at least be more flexible, and it should express the diversity of Member States better.
In this respect, this report is very good and very useful.
Incidentally, as an MEP from a new Member State, I deeply regret that the rural development fund of old Member States has been decreased by 15-20%, but the rural development fund of new Member States has only been increased marginally, to a very modest extent, even though everybody had said that they would be compensated by an increase for the long, protracted phasing-in period agreed in Copenhagen.
Well, there has been no compensation, and unfortunately, the rural development fund of old Member States has been drastically reduced, perhaps forcing them to apply modulation, but obviously, this is no consolation.
The issues raised by MrsÂ Schierhuber are very important: jobs should not only be created, but also preserved.
And in this respect it is very good that the McGuinnes report supports activity diversification.
In other words: we should not just give money to clear an apple orchard, but also to enable the farmer to plant a marketable crop in its place.
This is a very important issue in this report, because it facilitates the preservation of jobs.
The strengthening of quality products and of local products is also very important.
At this moment in time we still have an excessively market-profit-oriented view.
We would like to thank Mrs McGuinnes that the transitional regulations currently in place in new Member States will continue to remain in effect.
By the way, my experience as a future rapporteur for integration issues of new Member States (these issues will be debated in the second half of this year) is that these are very much required in the new Member States.
I support the report of Mrs McGuinnes.
Â Â  . Mr President, the rapporteur, MrsÂ McGuiness, has drafted an excellent report on the Commissionâs proposal on guidelines for rural development.
My sincere thanks go to her for that.
More than half the population of the EU live in the rural areas of Europe, and these regions generate almost half the Gross Value Added in the EU.
These regions, however, lag behind others when certain indicators are applied.
For example, unemployment is greater in these areas.
The European countryside faces big changes.
A comprehensive reform in agricultural policy has been initiated, and as a result agriculture is becoming less able to employ and sustain the population in rural areas.
Special action is therefore needed to restore the vitality of the countryside.
The Commission is proposing several different possible solutions.
The strategic guidelines are based on the EU Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the text of which was adopted last year.
In it three axes are defined, as well as a Leader Community initiative.
The report in many respects improves on the text submitted by the Commission.
The debate on the report is nevertheless overshadowed by the Councilâs terrible proposal for the EUâs financial perspective for the next seven-year term.
The Council has cut the figure for appropriations proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament by a full EUR 19 billion; in other words, more than 20%. It is therefore completely wrecking the great efforts that Parliament and the Commission have made to establish a policy on rural development and sustaining rural populations.
As a consequence, we have to wait until this issue is revisited in the finance negotiations between Parliament and the Council, and the situation is corrected as is only right and proper.
We must insist on this.
It is not just the need for general development of the countryside, but also greater self-sufficiency in energy for the EU, and other challenges, that depend on this.
Â Â  â Mr President, I congratulate my colleague on this report.
I agree with many of the proposed amendments and with the overall direction, but I have some concerns.
Firstly, I am disappointed that the minimum allocation for the Leader axis in the budget will be reduced to 5%.
It is proposed in the financial perspective that Member States can increase the rate of modulation by up to 20%.
Given the ongoing difficulties in the agricultural sector, more resources are required.
If the rates are increased, as I hope, we must ensure that ample money is allocated to axes 3 and 4, as well as 1 and 2.
Concerning diversification, not all those leaving farming and/or rural dwellers are entrepreneurs, or interested in being so.
There needs to be provision for helping people into employment and this should be reflected in the guidelines under point 3.3.
Also, although support for renewable energy is highlighted in points 3.1 and 3.3 of the guidelines, it is futile to provide support for renewable energy at a local level if national policy is prohibitive to the development of the sector.
We must therefore coordinate these.
It is imperative that the guidelines highlight the need for consultation with those involved at local level in the preparation of the national guidelines and also in the subsequent preparation of rural development programmes.
Lastly, I should like to say to the Commissioner that in Ireland it is hard to take her recommendations on organic farming seriously, when she will not allow us to declare the island a GMO-free zone.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I congratulate MrsÂ McGuinness on her excellent report on an extremely important issue.
In recent times, the Union has tended to neglect rural and agricultural problems.
We have often heard, even in this House, that it is not worth spending nearly half of the Unionâs budget on helping rural communities and farmers who account for barely 6% of society.
The strategic guidelines now hold out the hope that rural and agricultural problems will receive better treatment in the future.
After all, the development of rural areas is not just a matter for farmers.
It concerns society as a whole.
Without rural development and support for farming there can be no food security, sustainable growth or effective environmental protection.
I am hopeful that the future of rural communities and farming in Europe will be well-served by the document we are debating today, particularly in the new Member States which are in greatest need of support for their rural areas.
Â Â  The Strategic Guidelines of the Community for the area of rural development in the 2007â2013 programme period constitute a worthwhile and necessary document.
I support the amendments of our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as they enhance the Council proposal.
I also admire the good work done by Mrs McGuinness, the rapporteur.
According to the strategy, rural development should accompany the implementation of a new, market-oriented common agricultural policy, and should support the key role of the market within this policy.
This is all very well.
The budget cuts proposed for the CAP in the Financial Perspective, however, are causing justifiable concern over the real benefits of rural development.
Further concern results from the course of negotiations in the WTO, where it appears that European farmers could be put at a disadvantage in their competition against the rest of the world.
There are also risks, however, arising from the restrictive nature of ongoing reforms, as was the case for sugar reform, as well as other reforms that are in the pipeline.
Studies also suggest that there is a risk of the rural economy being weakened because of the transition to single payments per farm, etc. It goes without saying that the above risks are greatest in the new member countries.
For example, in my country, Slovakia, following the transition to single farm payments, agricultural output is expected to fall by a further 17%.
These are dramatic figures, since we have increased the importation of food by a half over the past two years due to the discriminatory influence of the CAP in the new Member States, and the export-import balance in Slovakiaâs agricultural sector trade has deteriorated by one-third.
The worst-off are the most backward, typically rural regions that are falling behind virtually in front of our eyes.
At the same time, all of the EU resolutions have stated that our policies should be working to narrow the gap that the more backward regions are facing.
According to the findings of the Slovak non-governmental organisation âRural Parliamentâ, the countryside depends entirely on the prosperity of agribusinesses for its development.
Rural areas develop where agribusinesses flourish.
Where business is slow in the countryside, entire rural areas are on the decline, and rural development becomes impossible.
The problem of the new Member States is therefore that of a deficient rural economy resulting from the uneven effects produced by the role of the market as embodied in the CAP.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking MrsÂ McGuinness for the excellent work she has done in her report.
In the new Union it is important to ensure a strategic approach with regard to intervention policies.
This approach should be translated into clear objectives, incisive measures and appropriate action, the results of which can be assessed objectively.
The identification of priority actions to be undertaken must not, however, result in an inflexible programming exercise and in a restriction for the Member States.
On the contrary, it is important to guarantee the Member States some flexibility, which enables them to make decisions about how they will intervene on the basis of what is actually happening at national, regional and local levels.
It is crucially important for the purposes of rural development that we revitalise, and restore the competitiveness of, our agricultural production when compared with that of the other countries, which have significantly lower production costs.
In that context, moreover, it is important to foster accompanying measures that facilitate innovation, research and development.
The emphasis placed on the areas of excellence and quality of agricultural products, particularly those produced locally and regionally, is consistent with the Communityâs overall strategy.
Quality must be understood not only as food safety and consumer protection, but also as value added to the competitiveness of businesses and as the expression of local traditions and of the cultural heritage of rural communities.
One need only think of local crafts, environmental protection, agricultural specialities and the related traditional production techniques.
These objectives clearly need to be coordinated with the need to help young farmers and women enter the rural professions, by passing on traditional knowledge and skills to them, and by improving the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of services and infrastructure.
Lastly, we must welcome the crucial aspect of bringing the experience gained through Leader to the system of local governance, building on the best practices of earlier programming exercises.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having analysed the report by MrsÂ McGuinness, whom I wish to commend for her work, I should like to highlight certain points.
Firstly, it falls to us to ensure that the EU's rural strategy is formulated and interpreted as the benchmark for any Community policy or programme relating to rural areas.
The Commissionâs proposal, sadly, limits its ambition to the implementation of the future regulation on rural development and accordingly makes it impossible to integrate rural, regional and social development policies.
As regards the Lisbon Strategy, the rural strategy ought to make a greater contribution to socio-economic and territorial cohesion for all rural communities.
Local conditions must be improved and supported, in particular by strengthening existing knowledge-exchange networks, or setting up new ones, and by improving the living conditions of rural communities.
These conditions should not, however, encourage migration from cities to the countryside.
Mr President, I feel that citizen involvement should be encouraged and citizenship fostered.
These issues are crucial to the construction of a democratic local identity in the areas concerned.
Lastly, the Commission should establish a forum for dialogue with the existing European networks and support their activities without undermining their independence.
This would boost relations with the stakeholders on the ground.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and her excellent cooperation.
Personally, I am adamant that the rural economy, SMEs and rural networks should play a real and meaningful role in achieving the Lisbon goals.
Rural development is not just an adjunct; it is not just an add-on to compensate for falling numbers in agriculture, though it may well help to achieve that.
In its own right, it must contribute to increased prosperity in rural areas.
In that context, I agree fully with the rapporteur that funding for rural development should not involve robbing the first pillar to pay for the second pillar.
Rural development should stand on its own two feet.
I am happy about the inclusion of my amendment on the necessity to ensure consultation, cooperation and, where appropriate, compensation for farmers when their activities are restricted owing to the enhancement of landscapes and habitats.
I have always believed that if the EU requires that of farmers, it must pay compensation.
Finally, I have one minor quibble with the rapporteur when she says that agriculture must remain central to the economies of rural areas.
While food production, using the European model and food security, are of paramount importance, this should not sideline the contribution of rural development.
Rural development has an increasing role to play in the maintenance of farmersâ livelihoods and farm family incomes and incomes of rural dwellers, so we need to build a sustainable income stream to complement agricultural income.
That has a life of its own and needs an adequate fund of its own; hence my disappointment at the cut in the budget for rural development.
Â Â  Mr President, in the European Parliament I represent Poland, which is home to six of the ten poorest regions in the Union.
Five of these regions are located in the eastern Poland.
They are characterised by a poorly developed infrastructure, a fragmented agricultural structure and high unemployment, some of which is hidden on peasant family farms.
The additional funds in excess of EUR 800 million earmarked in the 2007-2013 budget for eastern Poland are not a solution to the backwardness of this region.
The support we need must be at least equal to the aid given by the Union to marginal and sparsely-populated regions in the old Member States.
As well as financial assistance, eastern Poland, which includes the poorest Lubelszczyzna region, needs a stable agricultural policy and protection for its farmers.
It is high time that provision was made for its development.
Â Â  Mr President, funding for rural development is a key issue.
It should not, as the rapporteur has said, involve robbing the first pillar in order to fund the second.
Nor must we lose sight of the fact that the core and single most important component for the development of rural regions is the maintenance of sustainable agriculture at the very heart of their economies.
Thus a funding formula reliant on a smash-and-grab raid on the single farm payment through excessive modulation is simply not acceptable, particularly in circumstances where there is no necessity for matching national funding.
There are four particular points that I want to support: first of all, the use of funds to encourage new entrants, to assist the essential transition of farm families from one generation to the next; secondly, the prioritisation of funding to allow for the modernisation of farms and help with meeting higher animal welfare and environmental standards; thirdly, maximum regional flexibility on the implementation of the rural development programme must be secured and built upon; and fourthly and finally, the proposal for village renewal and the preservation of rural heritage is vitally important in revitalising and sustaining the rural communities.
This is a good report.
It is obviously the product of hard work by the rapporteur and I congratulate her on her efforts.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on an excellent report.
The future of the rural economy depends on the success or otherwise of our future policy from 2007 to 2013.
I must say I am concerned that there will not be sufficient funds to achieve a positive outcome to sustain the future under the second pillar.
Rural society has been on a downward spiral for many years, and you do not need me to rehearse the problems again.
All I know is that there are no easy solutions and we cannot wave a magic wand.
The rural economy has evolved over the years and there is now a heavy reliance on environmental projects.
This can be a help, but on its own is no panacea for all the problems facing the rural dweller.
I believe there is now too much emphasis placed and too much pressure put on such projects.
There is no doubt of the need to diversify, but there are not many new ideas out there.
Yet we must persevere and try to achieve our targets and we require a greater vision in the projects we support, because in the past too many projects in rural areas turned out to be white elephants.
As far as we in Northern Ireland are concerned, we will not see any change unless we achieve a totally different approach from our planning services.
They are living in the past, looking through rose-tinted glasses and looking back to a time that no longer exists.
If we are to achieve anything in this, we must be adventurous and innovative; we must encourage the development of more small and medium-sized enterprises and more micro-industries in rural areas.
If a farmer, his son or his daughter has an opportunity or an idea to develop their farm or to diversify, they should be encouraged to do so and to expand and not be forced into the nearest town or village.
This is the way forward.
We cannot afford to live in a time warp.
One other concern of mine is that some Member States will give these proposals good support and others, including my own, will do what they have always done with such initiatives: nothing!
The way forward for rural development is one of vision and confidence; above all, we must look to the future!
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner and the rapporteur, MrsÂ McGuinness, the report that we are debating today contains the guidelines to be followed by the Member States in drawing up the national strategic plans.
MrÂ Castiglione said something very clear: that the actions mentioned in its annex will provide a guide that will allow criteria to be unified, and this unification of criteria is going to promote the harmonious application of the new rural development Regulation, but it is also going to enable each Member State to take its own decisions on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity.
We Spanish socialists are satisfied with the reference to the multi-functional role of agriculture and we are also pleased that the conservation and protection of soil has been included as a priority.
Soil is actually an environmental resource which must be considered together with water, air and biodiversity.
This consideration is necessary in order to curb the processes of erosion and desertification, which lead to the kind of disasters that have been mentioned here this evening, such as forest fires and floods.
Furthermore, this care of the soil will allow us to maintain good agricultural and environmental conditions.
I am particularly pleased, MrsÂ McGuinness, that the incorporation of women into the labour market is taken up as a horizontal priority, and expressly referred to as such.
I am also pleased that the consolidation of existing jobs has been added to the reference to the creation of new jobs.
With regard to the need to establish services to maintain the population and to receive new inhabitants, we Spanish socialists agree that this may be the case and, furthermore, we agree that a fair proportion of the Structural Funds should be allocated to these areas in order to guarantee the balance between the development of rural areas and that of urban areas which is so necessary.
It is clear, Commissioner, that good investment in infrastructures would contribute to an improvement in the quality of life of these areas and to countering depopulation.
I live in a rural area, I have been Mayoress in a rural area and I can tell you that nothing could be more necessary or more motivating for the inhabitants of these areas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent work and on her excellent report.
I welcomed and approved, among other things, the emphasis given to young farmers, micro-businesses and crafts.
The task awaiting the European Union at a difficult time for the agricultural sector â which is made all the more critical by the health threats and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the WTO negotiations â is one of focusing primarily on young people and of doing everything in its power to ensure that they are not forced to abandon the countryside.
It is therefore crucial to diversify economic activities, to create new job opportunities in rural areas, to support local initiatives such as farmersâ markets and to focus on high-quality and niche products, in addition, of course, to crafts.
As MrsÂ Attwooll, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, sharply underlined, we also need to ensure the sustainable use of water resources and to put the emphasis firmly on training by investing sufficient funds in this area.
Lastly, I agree with the bottom-up approach used by the Commission in its proposal.
Indeed, rural development must not ignore the specific characteristics of the various regions, the strategic positions of local actors who set the guidelines for each area or, particularly, the development model for towns, which represent the real driving force of the entire regional economy.
Â Â  ( Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of rural development problems in the new Member States.
In Poland, rural areas became a kind of shock-absorber for the economic transformation that took place in the 1990s.
These areas saw a considerable influx of workers after the mass closure of workplaces that occurred at that time. This means that Polandâs rural regions need enormous financial support and a number of instruments to create employment in that environment.
I am pleased that it is proposed to allocate more than EUR 80 billion for this purpose in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, and that some 10 to 20 billion of this should go to Poland.
This policy must, however, go hand in hand with rational measures within the context of the common agricultural policy to stabilise traditional farm livelihoods, since only a stable livelihood on farms will enable the latter to make effective use of the support that is available from rural development funds.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, in common with all Members of this House, I agree on the objectives of the new rural development funds and on the need to strengthen the second pillar of the common agricultural policy.
I should like to add my voice to the congratulations offered to the rapporteur and welcome the input from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I am particularly grateful to MrsÂ Attwooll for helping to clarify a text that strikes me as decidedly overladen and not always easy to understand, not least by those who will have to implement it on the ground.
The experience of the ongoing Leader programmes is a salutary lesson in the dangers of an excessively fussy, nit-picking set of guidelines.
I personally wanted to emphasise the need to take territorial cohesion into account.
In order for this to become a reality, a balance must be struck between territories in line with the principle of equality among all citizens of the EU no matter where they live.
Rural areas must not be defined in terms of the difference between them and urban areas.
On the contrary, the relationship between the urban and rural environments needs to be strengthened by developing, , public services and in particular complementarity and transport accessibility.
The quality of life required to sustain an active population in the rural sectors entails cooperation and the joint implementation of essential financial resources.
Lastly, new territorial indicators are required to improve the process of evaluating and deciding upon measures to strengthen territorial cohesion.
In addition to gross domestic product, there is also a need to include employment rates, the decentralisation index and the level of public-service provision.
We await the Commissionâs proposals in this regard, and not solely from you, Commissioner.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I must first congratulate MrsÂ McGuinness on her outstanding work, and I wish to commend her for her willingness to listen and her openness.
This new strategic approach on rural development is designed to channel resources along well-defined priority axes. I feel that this will help to improve the effectiveness of measures in rural areas and coherence between the Member States.
It was also important to reaffirm the importance of rural development policy as the second pillar of the new common agricultural policy.
Nevertheless, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the financial perspective, I am dismayed to note that the sum proposed for funding rural development policy, some EURÂ 20Â billion, represents a sharp drop in relation to the Commissionâs proposal.
The solution put forward by the Council to address this significant reduction is the optional supplementary modulation transfer of up to 20% from the first to the second pillar, and this is left entirely to the discretion of the individual Member States.
This proposal raises a number of concerns: firstly, this modulation is technically impossible for market expenditure; secondly, it would mean drastic reductions in direct aid; lastly and most importantly, the fact that this optional modulation would comply with neither the EAFRD regulation already adopted by the Council after seeking an opinion from Parliament, nor the strategic guidelines on which we shall be having our say tomorrow, would be unacceptable.
As with the EAFRD funds and the funds based on mandatory modulation, there must be national cofinancing and compliance with rules on minimum spending per axis and integration with national strategic plans.
Â Â  Each region has its own natural features, so every country needs to make its own strategic plan for rural development.
However, the Communityâs strategic guidelines should provide some general support and guidance for individual countries in this respect.
The countryside is one of the key factors in preserving the cultural, ethnological and natural heritage through which our lives are enriched.
Since we wish to preserve and develop the countryside in the future, we must ensure that the working and living conditions do not lag behind those of the urban centres.
This demands greater investment in education, a reduction in the bureaucracy involved in new investments and the provision of an appropriate infrastructure.
Preserving the cultural landscape is an extremely important task, so we cannot simply leave it to chance and to those increasingly rare individuals who, despite the low incomes, are prepared to involve themselves in this.
Our forebears worked the land not simply for survival, but also out of love for it.
Today that is no longer enough.
Young people must see the prospect of advancement and a decent income, as well as adequate social security.
There is still very poor provision of social security for women, and it is equally unacceptable that mothers employed on farms still do not have the same rights and benefits as women employed in other sectors.
