. (ES) Mr President, the Council is deeply concerned about the sectarian violence in Indonesia, regardless of the religious or ethnic origin of the victims.
The Council has expressed this concern to the Indonesian Government and the Union' s other partners, as well as the United States, on several occasions.
The Council has urged the government to prevent more members of Laskar Jihad from reaching Malaca and central Sulawesi and ensure that those who are already there leave those areas.
There is still work to do and the Council will continue to take advantage of the cooperation and frank dialogue it has established with the Indonesian Government on these issues to work for an improvement in the situation.
I wish to thank the Spanish Presidency for its answer.
I also want to take the opportunity sincerely to welcome Spain to the European Parliament as the country holding the presidency of the European Union for the first half of this year.
I nonetheless want to ask a number of follow-up questions.
Does the Council believe that the Indonesian authorities have taken the necessary, adequate measures for dismantling the Islamic terrorist group, Laskar Jihad?
Is it the Council' s view that Laskar Jihad is continuing with its terrorist activities, or is any form of de-escalation now to be seen, with the prospect of a cessation of this violence against innocent people, mainly Christians in the Moluccas?
Last of all, I wonder if the Council considers there to have been close cooperation between the United States and the European Union in combating this Muslim terrorist group.
. (ES) Unfortunately, Mr SacrÃ©deus, the measures taken are never sufficient to beat the terrorist threat.
Naturally, the Laskar Jihad organisation can be classed as an organisation of this type.
Therefore, I do not believe that the threat has been contained and nor do I believe that the Indonesian Government, however many measures it has taken, is able to deal with the threat to Indonesia posed by this very large organisation.
You ask me whether the European Union and the United States should cooperate.
I believe that this cooperation is at the heart of all the political declarations made since 11 September.
The European Union and the United States now have a common front in the fight against terrorist threats in any part of the world where they may take place and we are holding dialogue with the United States precisely in order to help Indonesia to contain the threat posed by this terrorist organisation.
Question No 10, by Guido PodestÃ , which has been taken over by Mrs Sartori.
Question No 10 by (H-0969/01):
Subject: The situation of women in Nigeria - the case of Safia Husaini Tungar Tudu The case of a thirty-year-old Nigerian woman, who was married at the age of 12 and has four children, the last of whom was conceived as the result of rape, for which she has been sentenced to death by stoning, arouses serious concerns regarding the situation of women in many African countries, including Nigeria.
According to Sharia law a married or divorced woman is guilty of adultery if she has sexual intercourse with another man, even if, as in this case, she is the victim of rape.
The political and military power established under undemocratic regimes entails control over the private lives of those subject to it. This control extends to the birth of children and hence women are more exposed to punitive and often inhumane laws.
Can the Council say what new steps it intends to take to ensure the abolition of practices which violate fundamental human rights?
Can it also say what steps it intends to take to promote a process of democratisation and secularisation in countries such as Nigeria, where the interpretation given to religious law (which in fact distorts the true meaning of the religion concerned) adversely affects the rights of women in particular?
What action will the Council take as soon as possible to ensure protection for the life and dignity of the Nigerian woman referred to above?
Mr President, the Member States of the European Union and the European Commission have decisively supported, in a coordinated fashion, the international efforts in favour of Mrs Safia Husaini.
The European Union has studied the possibility of taking formal action in the event that the Islamic Court of Appeal, the Sokoto Sharia, confirms the sentence.
The European Union has already expressed its concern at sentences passed in accordance with Islamic criminal law, the Sharia, during the 57th sitting of the UN Human Rights Commission in 2001.
The Member States of the Union and the European Commission - in coordination - have decisively supported international efforts in favour of Safia Husaini, in accordance with the meeting organised by the European Union' s Heads of Mission in Abuja on 23 January.
The Spanish Presidency proposed to the Member States that we make a representation to the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister, in order to express the European Union' s new position in the field of the application of the death penalty.
This representation was formally approved by the Council of Ministers of the Union, which took place last Monday, and has been carried out by the Presidency of the Council of the Union to the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
With regard to the broader issue of respect for fundamental rights and specifically women' s rights in Nigeria and the rest of Africa, the Council is determined to pursue the policy which it has long been implementing in this field and, in particular, by means of the following instruments: the Cotonou Agreement, Article 9(2) which lays down the parties' obligations, their international commitments, in relation to the respect for human rights, and reaffirms the equality between men and women, the Cairo declaration and action plan approved at the Africa-Europe Summit held in Cairo in April 2000, which insists on respect for human rights, the Common Position relating to human rights, democratic principles, the Rule of Law and good government in Africa 98/350/PESC and Council Regulation (EC) 965/99, which establishes the requirements for the application of Community development cooperation actions which contribute to achieving the general objective of development and consolidating democracy under the Rule of Law, as well as respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and specifically Common Position 01/373/PESC on Nigeria, which expressly mentions the respect for human rights.
Thank you, Mr President, for your comprehensive response to our question.
The events of recent days compel us, however, to call for a further Council initiative, for, as you will know, not only has another woman, in addition to Safiya Yakubu Hussaini, been sentenced to death by stoning - Aishatu Abubakar, whom the same court in the same region of Nigeria condemned to a similar sentence on similar grounds a few weeks ago - but the news has arrived today that, in the Sudan, a young 18-year old Christian woman named Abok Alfa Akok, who does not speak Arabic, has also been sentenced to stoning by what is, in this case, a civil, not a religious court, without being permitted a defence and without being given a linguistic translation either.
Well then, I believe that the undertakings assumed by the Council are important but that, alongside them, there should also be constant protection in individual cases.
I therefore place in your hands these two new cases as well as that of Safiya.
I fully agree with you that the Council must continuously monitor all these humanitarian cases which affect individuals and countries with which the European Union has a preferential relationship by means of the Cotonou Agreements, in this case Sudan and Nigeria.
I take very good note of both cases which, naturally, I am unaware of. But I will do what I can to obtain all the necessary information through the services of the Commission and through our own diplomatic services.
I assure you that the Presidency of the Council of the European Union will make the Member States aware of these facts, we will take the necessary measures and we will take immediate diplomatic action to protect the rights of the two poor women you have mentioned.
President-in-Office, the justice minister of Afghanistan recently announced that the new interim government would maintain the Sharia law sanctions of stoning women to death for adultery and of limb amputation for theft.
The latter penalty was even supported by Prime Minister Karzai in a statement made at a press interview in America.
The EU has just pledged EUR 1.5bn in aid to Afghanistan over five years at the Tokyo Conference.
Should this not be made conditional on the disapplication of internationally unacceptable, cruel and unusual punishments such as those I have just referred to?
In fact, our aid to Afghanistan, for the development of the country, and the payment of the significant sums you have mentioned, which were laid down at the Tokyo Summit, are conditional from the outset, according to the Council' s declarations, upon respect for human rights in Afghanistan and in particular the application of equal treatment between men and women.
I believe that in the case you have mentioned, the European Union must state that, although we respect the traditions and the religion of Afghanistan, we also demand that human rights be respected in that country.
And the execution of Islamic sentences is not compatible with our notion of respect for human rights.
Nevertheless, I would like to remind you that it is common practice in all Islamic countries to apply the Sharia, the Islamic law.
Afghanistan is not the only country where these violations are committed.
We have already heard what happens in some African countries.
It would take a very long time to list all the cases of application of Islamic sentences in other countries of the Middle East which there are genuine violations of human rights and in particular the rights of women.
I believe that the European Union must be a pioneer in terms of defending these rights, but we must take the necessary precautions not to offend religious feelings since, as you know, there is currently a debate about the clash between the Islamic and Christian civilisations and we need to apply the necessary prudence.
However, the case you mention must be taken into account and I will certainly raise it in the Council and the Commission so that it may be monitored and we will try to prevent this sentence being carried out.
Question No 11 by (H-0971/01):
Subject: Turkish ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name Human and democratic rights are systematically and persistently violated in Turkey, a country which is a candidate for membership of the EU.
One such instance is the ban on the foundation and operation of parties with the word 'communist' in their name based on the antiquated provisions of Article 96 of the Law on political parties, which dates from 1920.
The Socialist Power Party of Turkey was founded in 1993 and operates legally.
It has fought vigorously for democratic rights and takes part in elections.
At its last congress, it decided to change its name to the Communist Party of Turkey but, because of the abovementioned undemocratic law, it is in danger of being banned.
At the moment, the Turkish Parliament is in fact debating amending the law on political parties, which may provide an opportunity to abolish the undemocratic ban.
What is the Council's view of the ban under Turkish law on the foundation and operation of communist parties?
Does it consider that Turkey can become a member of the EU without first having lifted the ban?
Will it raise the question of amending this undemocratic and reactionary law with the regime in Ankara so that the Communist Party can engage freely in political activity?
In fact, Turkey is drawing up a draft amendment of the law on political parties.
However, the truth is that we do not know the exact content of this draft law because it has yet to be submitted to the Turkish Government.
We therefore only have references.
The Council is not aware, even from these references, that the activities of the Turkish Communist Party are being hindered nor that there is any threat to ban it on the basis of an obsolete provision of the former law on political parties.
In terms of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Turkey more generally, the Laeken European Council concluded that Turkey had made progress towards complying with the criteria set for accession, particular by recently amending its Constitution, and that there was therefore now more possibility of opening accession negotiations with that country.
Turkey is being encouraged to make more progress towards compliance with the accession criteria - the famous Copenhagen criteria - particularly in relation to human rights.
The Council is closely monitoring the efforts for institutional political reform currently being made by Turkey and is especially focussing on whether those reforms will lead to real improvements in relation to human rights and fundamental freedoms in that country.
As we all know, this situation is still highly unsatisfactory in many respects.
The Council will be sure to question Turkey in the event that the intended amendment of the law on political parties in any way threatens democratic freedoms.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am astounded that the Council knows far less about this than the Turkish press.
For example, it is a known fact that the relevant committee of the Turkish National Assembly has submitted a bill on parties in which no changes have been made as regards the ban on the word 'communist' .
I also find it hard to understand why the Council does not know that members of the Communist Party of Turkey are being prosecuted, given that 150 members have been arrested and their offices have been raided, all from the day it opened for business.
But apart from all that, there were one or two quite specific points in my question, to which I have not received a reply.
Does the Council consider that Turkey can be a candidate country, or rather can it become a member of the European Union without first having lifted the ban?
I did not receive a reply to this specific question.
. (ES) I think I have made it clear, Mr President, that the Copenhagen criteria are absolutely fundamental before we can think about starting any type of negotiation on any hypothetical future Turkish membership of the Union.
I think I have made that clear. I am sure that the Member who asked the question is perfectly aware of the Copenhagen criteria and I therefore believe that this statement by the Council makes it absolutely clear that our view is that no type of negotiation can begin with Turkey until the Copenhagen criteria have been fully respected.
Question No 12 by (H-0001/02):
Subject: European Council support for a United Nations Convention on Disability Has the European Council discussed support for the proposed United Nations Convention on Disability, and which Member States are expected to vote in support?
Will the President-in-Office arrange for this issue to be tabled for further discussion at the High Level Group on Disability?
And will he use the Office of the Presidency to promote support in third countries outside of the EU?
Mr President, the European Council did not debate the issue mentioned by Mr Howitt.
The Commission has taken no initiative in this area in relation to the Council.
I would also like to remind Mr Howitt that the high level group on disability does not belong to the Council but to the Commission, and it would therefore be both more practical and more appropriate for the Commission to provide information on its debates.
In it contacts with third countries, the Presidency will raise all the issues it considers important and appropriate to deal with.
Mr President, I do not think that is the most helpful answer a Member of the European Parliament has ever been given in this Chamber so perhaps I can ask the President-in-Office whether he could give me a little more encouragement.
Is he aware, for example, of the request from 37 million disabled people in Europe and many outside our borders that the United Nations should enforce better rights for disabled people?
Is he aware that next year is going to be the European Year of Disabled People, and is he taking an interest in that?
Is he aware that since 1996 we have had a rights approach to disability that would suggest that we should support such a Convention?
In his answer he has given no evidence whatsoever that he is aware of those facts.
Given that he has admitted to this Chamber today that he and his colleagues have not even discussed this issue, at the very least will he respond to the request from this Parliament that he should table such a discussion?
If the members of the high level group on disabilities convened by the Commission are all members of the Council, it is within his power to do that if he wishes.
Perhaps he will now answer the point.
I feel I have given you a clear answer to your question, Mr Howitt.
This does not in any way mean that the Council has no concern for disabled people.
But you asked me whether the European Council has discussed this issue and I have told you that it has not.
I have simply said that it has not discussed it, which does not mean that it is not going to discuss it or that it has no desire to, but simply that it has not yet done so because it has not had the opportunity so far.
This does not mean that the Council is unaware of the problems of disabled people or the coming events and international meetings on the disabled in which Member States and the European Union itself will have to adopt a position.
I have suggested that you address this question to the Commission, which, since it leads the high level group on the disabled, will be in a better position than me to give you a concrete answer.
As we all know in this House, disability rights feature prominently within the Spanish system.
Indeed, in many areas of disability rights Spanish law is a model that other Member States could usefully follow with regard to integration, access and equal treatment.
Following on from that, could I urge firstly the President-in-Office to use his good offices and his benign influence on his colleagues within the Council to ensure that there is a strong European Union voice and presence at the United Nations Convention on Disability?
Secondly will the Spanish presidency guarantee that it will put equal access and equal rights for all disabled people in the European Union at the top of the agenda?
Thirdly and finally, in preparing for 2003 as the International Year of the Disabled, will it also give extra support to the Special Olympics, which will take place within the European Union in 2003?
I simply want to reply to the honourable Member that I have taken good note of his suggestions to the Presidency and that we will always be prepared to contribute to the European Union taking on an increasingly active role in relation to disabled people and, in particular, in relation to the United Nations Convention on disability.
Question No 13 by (H-0005/02):
Subject: Appearances before the European Parliament and involvement in its business on the part of Spanish ministers during the Spanish Presidency The year 2002 has just begun and Spain has taken over the rotating EU Presidency.
The previous incumbent was Belgium and during its six-month term of office not only the country' s Prime Minister and other government ministers, but also the government leaders and ministers of the various Belgian regions, appeared before the European Parliament and chaired some of its meetings.
Since it is laid down in the Spanish Constitution that the Kingdom of Spain is a state comprising autonomous communities which have exclusive powers that in certain cases are similar to and even greater than those of Belgium' s regions, would the Spanish Presidency say why no plans have been made for representatives of any of Spain' s autonomous communities to appear before the European Parliament and to take part in its proceedings?
The Council would remind Mr Ortuondo that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Union lays down that "The Council shall consist of a representative of each Member State at ministerial level, authorised to commit the government of that Member State" .
Apart from this provision, it falls to each Member State to decide the composition of its representation and, therefore, it falls to the Presidency to establish, in its capacity as such, how it will be represented in its appearances and parliamentary acts.
This decision will inevitably depend partly on national constitutional provisions, which differ from one Member State to another.
It therefore follows that the Council cannot make any comment on the decisions taken by the Presidency in relation to its representation, and in particular, to the contacts it maintains with the European Parliament.
I would firstly like to thank you for your answer to the previous question on this same subject.
As you will have realised, the reply just given by the President-in-Office of the Council is the same as the one he gave to Question No 6.
I would like to point out that Article 203 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities speaks of 'ministerial rank' and, both in the meetings of the Councils of Ministers and during the Presidency, there is quite naturally participation by representatives of the Belgian regions or autonomous communities, or whatever you want to call them, and also - as the MEP who spoke about this said earlier - the region or nation of Scotland, the German LÃ€nder or the Austrian States and other such examples within the Community.
In this regard, I would like to ask whether you consider the Spanish Government' s action in this respect to be appropriate.
When talking about, for example, economic and financial affairs, or a plan for budgetary stability, it reaches agreements with the other governments of the Union, but when the same is to be raised on the level of the Spanish State, you impose it by law, instead of seeking agreement and consensus with the Communities which have exclusive competence in these areas.
I can only reply be repeating my previous answer on this issue.
It falls to each State to organise its representation in the Councils of Ministers and in Parliament in accordance with their own internal laws and constitutions.
Mr Ortuondo gives some correct examples and some less correct ones, because it is true that there may have been some Belgian representation or, in some cases, some representation from a German Land, but I do not remember ever seeing Scottish Ministers in any Council.
Perhaps he is confusing the Scottish Secretary, who is a Minister of the Central British Government, with a representative of the Scottish Government.
That is a great mistake.
There should not be any confusion on this issue and I would like to make it perfectly clear that it is the governments which decide on their representation and there is therefore nothing more to say on this issue.
With regard to Mr Ortuondo' s question, there are two aspects which I would like to mention.
The first is the invoking of the constitutional foundations of a State, which are constantly being called into question by Mr Ortuondo' s party, demonstrating its irresponsible and destabilising attitude.
The second is the curious analogy we have heard about other States of the Union, Belgium for example, when it is well known, except amongst those displaying ignorance or bad faith, that the territorial organisation of the Belgian State obeys a very complex and unique system, involving the interlinking of cultural and linguistic communities with political communities, and a system of compatibilities between federal responsibilities and regional responsibilities which is completely different to the situation of the Autonomous Communities in Spain.
In this context, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know whether you agree with the view that this rich diversity in the territorial organisation of the States making up the Union is something which stimulates, enriches and strengthens European democracy, which prevents homogenising reductionism - despite what Mr Ortuondo seems to think - and that, of course, it must be fully respected by the Community institutions.
Mr President, I have nothing to add to what I have already said.
I believe that the diversity of the Union is guaranteed by the respect for the constitutional systems of each country, and each country organises its presence in Councils, and during its presidency, and in other institutions, in accordance with its internal laws and constitutional provisions.
Mr Vidal-Quadras said that the party I represent, and I myself, want to subvert the Spanish Constitution.
The positions we advocate have nothing to do with subversion.
According to the Spanish Constitution, the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, to which I belong, has certain exclusive competences in certain areas.
On tax issues, for example.
Decisions are habitually made in the Council of Ministers of the European Union on fiscal issues while the interested parties are not represented there to defend themselves, as is the case with our Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and the Autonomous Community of Navarre.
We do not feel represented by the Madrid government because we have frequent differences on the issue of sovereignty; a sovereignty which has not been granted us as a result of the generosity of the Madrid government, but which originates from the historic rights of the Basque people.
I would ask Members not to enter into debates on situations relating to their respective countries, but rather to put questions to the Council.
On the other hand, all opinions have the right to be expressed in this House as long as they end with a question, as has been the case with Mr Vidal-Quadras and other Members.
All I ask is that the Rules of Procedure be respected; otherwise, the danger is that, during the Presidency of a particular country, questions will focus on problems and debates specific to that country.
As the author is not present, Question No 14 lapses.
Question No 15 by (H-0010/02):
Subject: Biological and toxin weapons On 15 November 2001, Parliament adopted a resolution (B5-0708/2001) on negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks.
At the fifth review conference of the Convention held in Geneva last November, the US delegation was the only one of the 144 countries represented which refused to recognise the legal commitments ensuing from the Convention. Will the Council, therefore, say what steps it will take in response to Parliament's resolution to secure multilateral disarmament and the non-proliferation of biological and toxin weapons by way of a legally binding protocol?
Do not worry, Mr President, I am pleased to answer this question.
As Mr Papayannakis no doubt knows, the European Union has been playing an active role in the negotiations with the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons and in the 5th review conference, held in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001.
This activity was based on the common positions adopted in 1996, 1998 and 1999 and on the conclusions of the Council of 11 June 2001.
The European Union therefore regrets that, after six years of negotiations on the basis of a unanimously agreed mandate, the 5th review conference of the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons has not managed to adopt either a final declaration or a document with concrete measures to strengthen that Convention.
To strengthen the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is still one of the Council' s priorities in the field of health.
In accordance with the conclusions of 10 December 2001, on the repercussions of the terrorist threat on the European Union' s non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control policies, the Union intends to actively promote the global and effective application of multilateral instruments in the field of non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control.
With regard to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons, the European Union confirms that the mandate of the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention is still valid.
The Union has decided to continue its work towards a successful conclusion of a 5th review conference of the Convention, newly convened for November of this year.
Thank you for your reply, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and for your statements as to what the Council and the Union intend to do about these terrible weapons.
However, the problem which we are up against, Mr President-in-Office, is this: the United States wants out of the agreement because it is legally binding.
You say that we shall keep trying to achieve something more specific in the future.
My question is this: what talks are you holding with the United States, what can you do to make them change their mind and what information do you have on the matter?
Because everything else depends on this.
I do not question your good intentions, what I do question is the analysis of the situation which the President-in-Office's statement appears to contain.
In fact, we have one particular hope: that in November 2002 we may have an agreement at this 5th review conference of the Convention.
But that agreement will not naturally be complete if the United States does not participate, and this issue is therefore one of the issues included in the current dialogue with the United States, with a view to the preparation of the summit between the European Union and the United States which is expected to take place before the end of the Presidency - certainly in June, if not in April, since the date is yet to be decided.
Our argument with the United States is that, not only would the non-participation of the United States in this 5th review conference of the Convention and its new agreement damage the credibility of the whole international effort, but that to have a clear position on the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons is also one of the agreed actions which can be carried out jointly by the European Union and the United States in order to implement measures to combat the terrorist threat.
Because it is well know that these biological and toxin weapons may be used for criminal purposes by international terrorist organisations.
Therefore, the more committed the whole of international society is to this issue, and the United States in particular, - since it is one of the top producers of biological and toxin weapons - the better.
I believe that this is being included in the dialogue we are holding with the United States in the Senior Level Group and in the agreements we want to reach with the United States at the summit between the United States and the European Union, which is going to take place during this six-month period.
As the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 16 to 37 will be replied to in writing, apart from Question No 36 which deals with an issue which is on the agenda.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was adjourned at 7.15 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Management of regional policy and the Structural Funds (continued)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5-0006/2002) by Mr Pohjamo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the management of regional policy and the Structural Funds (2001/2066 (INI)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this own-initiative report is concerned with analysing problems in the use actually made of the Structural Funds and with submitting proposals as to how their management and effectiveness could be improved, not least with a view to the next pending revision of post-2006 regional policy.
The rapporteur has succeeded both in highlighting the improvements achieved in the wake of the 2000 reform of the Structural Funds and also in drawing our attention to difficulties in their application, especially the problems in connection with the delayed implementation of the programme.
It is these to which I wish to give particular attention.
Although it was an essential objective of the pre-2000 reform of the Structural Funds to avoid repetition of mistakes from the beginning of the 1994 planning period, but rather to get fully involved in the first year, this has only partly succeeded.
Negotiations on the programme still took up too much time.
The guidelines set out by the Commission were not always understood in the regions.
Negotiations were often delayed through the pace at which the Commission worked and through slow response times, which were sometimes contingent on new requirements imposed by the Commission.
It is reported from the regions that these in turn were seen there as merely petty.
On the other hand, the Member States were not always prompt in sending in the programme documents and the additional items of information that had been requested.
All these things, Mr President, are facts - facts of which I had warned when I was the rapporteur presenting an own-initiative report in the same terms, appealing urgently for the start of a new planning period not to again be delayed as it had been in 1994.
Let us then now draw the right and necessary conclusions for 2006, or else reports of that sort will in fact be nothing more than wastepaper.
There should be no gaps occurring between programming periods.
That is why I support the rapporteur's proposal that we should also examine whether in future there should not also be separation and limitation of the periods for which project-oriented programmes and Community initiatives run.
Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Mr Pohjamo' s resolution included some amendments tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and some tabled by Mr Fava and myself.
I would like to draw your attention to two amendments which I feel to be important: the amendment on the principle of additionality and the amendment clarifying the concept of cross-border region.
Additionality is essential so that Structural Funds appropriations supplement national funds rather than replacing them.
I would add that Parliament cannot and must not be a spectator in the management of structural expenditure.
In this respect, I would put forward two guidelines: firstly, the reform and modernisation of the public administration; and secondly, the establishment of development banks consistent with PEP and SPD parameters.
I will end by calling upon Commissioner Barnier to take note of the fact that there needs to be some flexibility in the application of automatic decommitment in that the process must recognise those who are working successfully in the same Member State.
It is right that the idle should not be allowed to get away with it, but it is also right that those who benefit should be the best, the most far-sighted and the most modern.
Mr President, Parliament must make an assessment of the quality of projects according to the results achieved a priority, and the Commission must ensure that Parliament is in a position genuinely to carry out careful monitoring.
In this sense, the proposed informal working group will be useful.
Sometimes, however, the Commission does not respond within the time allowed and certain States are guilty of this too, particularly in the negotiation phases.
It is therefore appropriate to pause and take stock of the situation in order to enable the Commission to provide responses more quickly, to achieve uniformity of provisions on the different funds as quickly as possible, to ensure that we progress along the road of streamlining bureaucracy - making increasing numbers of regions and local communities accountable and providing them with consultancy services - and to speed up the automatic decommitment mechanisms so as to allow swift reallocation of funds and the drawing up of an annual detailed, specific report which will make it possible to proceed with full knowledge of the facts from evaluation to programming.
Moreover, a bridge programme should be envisaged allowing certain States, including Italy, to make use of the unused funds from the 1994-99 programming period, similarly to what happened at the end of the 1993 programming period.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Structural Funds were designed to support the effort that the Member States put into their regional development policy and thus to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the European Union.
It must be noted that the aid provided by the Structural Funds to the most disadvantaged regions is absolutely vital and that the contribution of these funds has become essential in enabling certain regions, which are lagging behind in development, to catch up, particularly the outermost regions, which I know well.
The start of the new 2000-2006 programming period has once again shown us the problems in the practical implementation of the Structural Funds, with the Member States regretting the time taken by the Commission to approve the general programme guidelines and the Commission criticising the time taken by the Member States to submit their programming plans and the additional information requested.
It is essential that the next programme negotiations are kept within strictly limited, precise and binding time limits, so that the Member States and the Commission respect the rules laid down.
The time that elapsed between setting up the programmes is, without doubt, one of the reasons that explains why the initial figures on their execution are so disappointing, but this is, of course, not the only explanation.
Following Agenda 2000, the processing of the funds was decentralised and each Member State gained overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and ensuring the efficiency of the structural interventions on its territory.
As for France, I wish to formally appeal to the prefects of the regions that are eligible for Objectives 1 and 2 to make every effort to mobilise and encourage those responsible for the projects and to give them all the necessary technical support to enable them to carry out the programmes more successfully.
Unfortunately, it is often difficult to involve businesses in Community programmes, since the management of the projects appears complicated and the procedures appear slow.
This is an aspect that the national authorities must focus on, without fail, in order to enhance the attraction of Structural Funds in the private sector.
Lastly, to conclude with a firm proposal, I think that one of the ways to simplify and lighten the administrative burden would, in fact, be to introduce a single regional development fund in 2007.
Mr President, Commissioner, we are debating the own-initiative report on the management of regional policy and the Structural Funds presented by Mr Pohjamo, whom I would like to thank for his good work.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has tabled five amendments because we want to highlight some of the aspects relating to the issue we are dealing with.
Firstly, while we agree that cooperation with other agents - other than State and regional governments, that is to say, with local communities, NGOs, private bodies, etc. is beneficial in terms of achieving the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union, we do not believe that that cooperation has been satisfactorily respected in all the Member States, but that it has been applied in an unequal fashion.
We therefore affectionately urge the Commission to try to ensure that socio-economic and environmental cooperation be applied equally in all regions receiving Community Funds and to ensure that the programming of projects is subject to consultation with the parliaments and governments of the constitutional regions which have legislative powers.
We also demand the creation of clear indicators intended to assess the application of this cooperation principle.
Furthermore, within the framework of the guidelines for the intermediate evaluation of September 2002, we want the Commission to define indicators for the efficient allocation of the reserve which, as well as financial management, take account of other aspects of management, such as cooperation, additionality and the quality of expenditure.
At the same time, we ask that, in the event that unspent resources are reallocated, the appropriations which are not used be directed towards the least-favoured regions which are most active and innovative, as well as measures in favour of sustainable development.
Finally, in support of the rapporteur' s idea - with regard to including the quality aspect in the annual monitoring of programmes subsidised by the Commission - we propose an assessment of their contribution to the implementation of the Union' s strategies relating to sustainable development and employment.
We hope that our amendments will receive the majority support of Parliament, since they will serve to improve our Community economic and social objectives.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Pohjamo for his excellent report, for the interest he always shows, as do the other members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and its new chairman, Mr Caveri, and as did the previous chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, for their collective efforts to make the management of regional policy and Structural Funds more straightforward and more efficient.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it is very important for the Commission to receive both encouragement and constructive criticism.
I have been listening very closely and with great interest to each of the speakers and, if I may, I would like to write to some of you within the next few days in order to clarify a number of points.
Mr Pohjamo, the Commission supports your comments regarding the financial execution, particularly the very severe and very strict n+2 rule that is to be applied, as well as your remarks on monitoring and control and also on the quality of the programmes and projects.
Like you, we have seen that there are some difficulties in the management of funds.
In the few minutes that I have, I would like to make three comments to clarify or explain the work of the European Commission.
My first comment concerns the new rules for the 2000-2006 period, which were laid down for a new working method and which also defined new responsibilities for those involved in the management of Structural Funds.
Each of the persons involved needed time to prepare and get up to speed.
In the case of our Directorate-General, these changes came about at the same time as the internal reorganisation of the whole institution.
I am not looking for excuses; I simply want to give an explanation.
These new regulations were also drawn up from much stricter requirements regarding the quality of programmes.
I am thinking, for example, of the provisions governing the ex-ante appraisal.
In this area too, the various players needed time to understand and grasp these new requirements.
There are also areas where this change required a choice to be made between several objectives.
I shall give an example that you yourself, Mr Pohjamo, mentioned. You quite rightly pointed out that the negotiations on the programme documents took an average of eight to twelve months to complete, instead of the five months scheduled by the legislator.
The truth, and I want to be honest about this, as I always am before this House, is that a five-month deadline to draft a document that is intended to cover a seven-year period was not realistic, when you understand the tough challenges involved and the amounts involved in the Structural Funds.
A choice had to be made between completing the job rapidly, sometimes even in a hurry, and quality.
The Commission, I must say, and I think that you will acknowledge this, decided to put the quality of the programme documents before all else.
Given the excessive number of months taken to complete the programming - and I repeat, Mr Pohjamo, that I took careful note of your comment, and I may come back to this point later when we discuss the report by Mr Musotto - I decided, in future, to propose that the Commission anticipate, as far as possible, the presentation of its proposals on the new regional policy, namely, the new agenda beginning in 2007, so that we can begin programming and implementing projects at the very beginning of the agenda, rather than two years later, because I share your sentiment.
Second, within the limits of the room for manoeuvre that these texts allow, the Commission is already committed to responding to certain problems that you have raised, Mr Pohjamo.
I would firstly like to reiterate our desire to approach the management of Structural Funds in a transparent manner, and the communication that the Commission adopted on 5 July on the results of the programming of funds for Objective 1 between 2000-2006 is evidence of this.
The Commission has also recently simplified the procedures for handling programming complements, which was an area of criticism.
I heard many regional chairmen and ministers voice this criticism.
I also decided to set up, in order to study all the areas where we could simplify matters, a working group between my office and the Directorate-General on regional policy, so that we could make specific progress with simplification.
Remember that the commissioner speaking to you, ladies and gentlemen, is speaking to you using a wealth of experience and hindsight that I have gained, and cannot forget, from being chairman of a local authority in his own country.
Therefore, I understand very well this need to reduce bureaucracy and excessive complications.
The only boundary that I have, to tell the truth, and which I will not exceed, is that I must supply accounts, accurate accounts, sometimes very detailed accounts on several thousand euro, both to the budgetary control authority - in other words, the European Parliament - and to the Court of Auditors.
It is my personal responsibility, that of the Commission, to provide fair accounts when they are requested.
As regards the sensitive question of natural or ecological disasters, which you mentioned in your report, Mr Pohjamo, I wish to point out that changes can be made to the programmes, as we have done in the past, with the Italian, Portuguese and Greek programmes, for example, when there were earthquakes between 1997 and 1999, or, more recently, in France, because of the hurricane.
That does not, of course, take into account the freedom that the national and regional authorities have within the programmes adopted by the Commission to finance projects that they believe to be most applicable and, if necessary, to re-deploy or re-programme appropriations.
My third comment is that I naturally want to reiterate that everyone, myself in particular, must comply with the regulations that the legislator wanted in order to supervise the management of the Structural Funds.
It is in the light of this reminder that I must examine certain proposals that you have put forward, Mr Pohjamo.
Therefore, your proposals on imposing penalties for infringing the additionality principle or for cutting short a programming period are to be taken into account in the current debate on the future of the cohesion policy.
I took note of these proposals and the comments for use in the debate and I will take them into account.
But beware of proposals that could involve modifying the legislative framework, or even amending the Treaty itself, such as the idea of creating a single regional development fund.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst respecting the competences and the responsibilities of our respective institutions, I would like to reaffirm to you that the Commission is at your disposal and is willing to loyally fulfil its duty to keep Parliament informed. It will do this by regularly reporting back on the use of the Structural Funds, including by objective, as I have started to do for Objective 1 and as I will do for Objective 2; by systematically informing the House of our work by means of reports, including reports which provide assessments, and by coming before the committees on a regular basis, such as the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and the Committee on Budgetary Control.
In fact, I shall be doing this in a few days' time.
I think that together this forms a solid basis for a genuinely transparent, sincere and ongoing dialogue between our institutions.
Lastly, I would like to confirm the links that I am establishing between the report by Mr Pohjamo and the next report, and that all these comments on improving the management of Structural Funds will be very useful to me, to us, in drawing up the Commission guidelines on the future regional policy.
I believe that better management of appropriations, provided in a timely fashion, for useful projects in each of our regions, that the proper use of Structural Funds during this period, will be evidence and an argument for pursuing, or even stepping up all our actions by revamping regional policy in the next agenda.
That is why, Mr Pohjamo, I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for the time that you have taken, for your initiative in drawing up this report on the current management of Structural Funds.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Economic and social cohesion
The next item is the report (A5-0007/2002) by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the second report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on economic and social cohesion (COM(2001) 24 - C5-0527/2001 - 2001/2207(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it must be pointed out that this report is being tabled before Parliament at a particularly important historical and political moment in European integration, namely just before the start of the Convention which is to lay the foundations of the new Europe, a Convention of which Commissioner Barnier is an important member.
We are therefore especially glad that he can be here today.
It must be said from the outset that cohesion policy is a major success story in terms of Community integration. Indeed, it is, has been in the past, and will continue to be, one of the cornerstones of that process.
Consistently with the Commission' s second report, we have noted that between 1988 and 1998 per capita GDP in Objective 1 regions rose from 63% to 70% of the Community average - and this is a great success - moreover, the benefits of cohesion have not been limited to direct recipients of related funding but have also extended to countries which are net contributors in terms of exported goods and services.
Of course, the process has not yet reached its conclusion.
Much still remains to be done and there are difficulties to address and overcome, including, in particular, the scourge of unemployment, which, I am sad to say, is affecting many regions where the unemployment rate has not dropped at all.
We need infrastructural investments in order to eliminate the marginalisation caused by geographical location and the remoteness of the islands and the most outlying regions; accessibility is a determining factor in terms of the competitiveness of an area and it needs to be improved, although without incurring excessive environmental costs.
In future, cohesion policy must be recast, first and foremost to cater for the changed circumstances which enlargement will bring for all of us, but it is also vital that the future regional policy should be based on the results of Commission documents, particularly the most recent document issued a few days ago, known as the periodic report.
I am afraid to say that the gap between rich and poor will grow as, after enlargement, one sixth of the Community population will have an income of barely 40% of the Community average.
Preaccession instruments such as ISPA and the Sapard programme have been set up to assist the candidate countries, to enable them to prepare for the new situation of which they will have to become a part; these have been essential tools for the transition from candidate countries to Member States.
However, we need to promote a genuine regional development policy. In this regard, I feel that the European spatial development perspective can serve as an important technical source of major integration and development.
There are two key objectives to pursue: solidarity towards the new Member States and avoiding penalising, indeed protecting, those currently benefiting from cohesion policies.
A major effort therefore needs to be made in terms of solidarity - especially political solidarity ensuring that all the peoples are involved and are provided with the requisite information - in economic and financial policy.
The 'statistical convergence' must not be mistaken for 'real convergence' by the current beneficiaries, who will certainly not automatically become richer simply as a result of the accession of poorer regions.
We need administrative methods which will improve efficiency; we need to streamline, clarify and facilitate the demarcation between the role of the Commission and that of the regional and national levels; it will be necessary to simplify procedures increasingly and we need greater subsidiarity and more decentralisation.

It will also be essential to rationalise the support instruments by reducing the number and size of funds and better coordinating Community policies and cohesion policies.
Regions which continue to lag behind in terms of development, measured in terms of unemployment and other criteria in addition to per capita income, must be maintained under Objective 1.
Lastly - and this is a point of contention which prompted wide debate - the allocation of financial resources must be increased or, at least, revised and brought up to a sufficient level: the threshold of 0.45% is an absolute minimum below which it is impossible to go.
We hope that Parliament and the Commission will both call for a increase in the budget dedicated to the future resources of cohesion policy.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (DE) Mr President, the Commission's report and Mr Musotto's are laudable, the one for its analytical description of the situation and the other for its supplementary proposals, although the observations of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs were taken into account only to a somewhat modest extent.
Further to them, though, I would like to elaborate, from my Committee's point of view, another issue which has almost been pushed into obscurity.
Commissioner, we have learned essential lessons from the difficulties we have had in raising poorer regions or suffering former industrialised zones to the level within the European Union; they should spur us on to improve things and should serve as a benchmark for the process of enlargement.
It is above all the poorer industrial zones in the future Member States whose need for massive restructuring measures causes me great concern.
I refer above all to coal and steel regions; the steel industries in these countries are absolutely incapable of competing with our own, and the collieries are a potential problem.
I do not want to go at this juncture into what will happen if we are unable to give our new friends sufficient aid.
I will only observe that, as the ECSC's expiry is imminent, we no longer have a suitable instrument in this field.
I reiterate that now because the ECSC continued to be of excellent service to us in recent years, no cofinancing is needed and the system of financing could in any case have been adapted.
We also have to make solidarity payments to the applicant countries.
I reiterate that now because the new States will not have adequate access to financing.
I have touched on this issue now because the Commission played a considerable part in changing this instrument without envisaging the difficulties in the process of enlargement or even giving them some thought.
Do something about this problem, Commissioner!
The problem is not a small one.
We do not have enough instruments suited to the processes of adaptation while enlargement is going on.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when considering the report we are now discussing, on the future of cohesion after enlargement, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities unanimously approved the following fundamental principles:
firstly: cohesion policy, as defined in the Treaties, is a crucial pillar for the future of European integration and must not, therefore, be renationalised;
secondly: the active promotion of a policy of equality between men and women is a prerequisite for achieving real economic and social cohesion;
thirdly: the fact that disparities between the richest and poorest regions are predicted to double following the planned enlargement to a further ten countries and a significant fall in per capita income makes it crucial that the sum currently spent by the Union on cohesion polices is at least 0.45% of GDP, and for the sake of coherence, this amount must be increased.
I should also like to draw your attention to the objective laid down at the Lisbon Summit of achieving, in the European Union, in 2010, a 60% rate of female employment, because this increase in women working is essential not only in order to increase the European GDP, but also to finance the future of social security and to bring about an increase in tax revenues.
I therefore ask the Commission to consider gender equality as an integral part of the Community polices that contribute to economic and social cohesion; to include the aspect of gender and equal treatment between men and women in cohesion policies and assess, on the basis of precise indicators and quantified objectives, the contribution that economic and social cohesion makes to achieving the Community strategy for equal treatment and opportunities between men and women.
Mr President, I must congratulate Mr Ãusotto on his report, which is a job extremely well done.
We must look, first, at what conclusions we can draw on the basis of progress so far and, secondly, at the challenges facing us.
As regards what conclusions we can draw from the policies applied so far, what we can say is that we have clearly made progress, but that this progress has varied from one Member State to another.
In some Member States there have been very positive results and a great deal of progress, while in others such as my own, unfortunately, the results have not been as positive as they might have been.
This means that governments need to get the message, especially in the light of the new regulation now being applied, which is more decentralised than the previous regulation, and do what they can to bring about the results which other countries have achieved.
Secondly, the question of enlargement is now a factor, bringing with it even greater demands.
Because numerous poor countries are joining, this will, as we all know, artificially inflate the income of numerous regions in comparison with the Community average.
Because of the statistics, numerous regions will cease to be covered unless they take measures during a programming period.
Consequently, 0.45% of the Community GDP earmarked for the Structural Funds must be the lower limit.
We cannot drop any lower and have reliable policies.
Many of my fellow Members disagree with this view and they do, of course, have every reason to put forward their arguments.
But what we have to ask ourselves, especially those of us who really believe in the European Union and its prospects, is just how much money we are spending from the Member States' GDP in order to achieve the ambitious objectives set by the European Union.
Is it because we are spending so much money that we object every time the Community budget increases?
At some point we must realise that ambitious objectives cannot be achieved without the necessary funding.
Mr President, I wish to start by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done, which has enabled us to make out a good basis for the years to come.
I would also like - and I think this might be permitted me - to say a word in praise of our own group, whose discussions, which were highly intensive and also sometimes rigorously conducted, produced uniform outcomes, something I consider to be very important in this area.
I want to deal with those essentials that are of significance to us.
The first point I wish to make, Commissioner, is that we join with you in rejecting the renationalisation of regional policy.
That is for us of primary importance.
Efforts are being made in certain Member States to reclaim this policy for the national level.
We here are quite united in repudiating this.
Cohesion policy makes clear European solidarity, which we do not want to lose, but rather to emphasise in the future.
On this we, Parliament and Commission, stand shoulder to shoulder.
My second point is that we seek greater coherence - between regional policy on the one hand and, in particular, the common agricultural policy on the other.
We could perhaps engage in a dialogue, even with Commissioner Fischler, on how we might manage this, without which our goals for rural areas, and the agricultural policy's goals for rural areas, will not always be found in the same direction, and this is something we must work on.
It is also beyond dispute that going below the 0.45% level imperils the cohesion objectives, so we just have to become more efficient, as has also been made abundantly clear by Mr Pohjamo's report, which we were discussing earlier.
Now to my final point. We need to achieve a balance between the candidate countries and the regions we have supported to date.
I think it is not at issue that we must make enormous efforts for the candidate countries, that there must also be a cohesion instrument to help them, and this was also mentioned in the interim report you presented last week.
We must also, though, give thought to the need to continue to bring the regions we used to support up to the EU average.
If we manage this balancing act, I believe we will gain Europe greater acceptance.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish, on behalf of my group, to congratulate Mr Musotto on his report, which calls attention to some pertinent matters.
The measures to achieve economic balance have been insufficient: they have been heading in the right direction, but they have been insufficient.
Regional and social differences in terms of prosperity have even increased in the present Member States.
In future we must pay attention to strengthening rural vitality and diversity in regions which are unfavourable in terms of geographical location and natural conditions.
Additional costs resulting from difficult conditions, for example in island regions and mountain areas, must be compensated for with combined efforts and precisely defined regional policy measures.
Furthermore, the sharp disparities in unemployment rates and structural problems must be taken seriously in planning regional structural policy.
The commitment of SMEs and skills and know-how to projects is an important priority.
Aid action under the Structural Funds must also be better coordinated with national employment targets.
GNP alone is inadequate as a criterion in determining eligible areas.
We have to equally consider permanent problems associated with climatic and geographical conditions.
For example, extremely sparsely populated areas, long journey times, and cold and hot climates mean additional costs, which will also be there after enlargement.
An effective cohesion policy requires that sufficient financing is safeguarded.
There are actually rather different views in my group regarding how that can be addressed.
Whatever the case, it is important to have improved coordination between the various forms of aid granted out of the funds available.
The enlargement of the Union requires a reinforced cohesion policy.
Enlargement must not go ahead at the expense of the worse-off regions, but through joint efforts.
It is important to ensure that all the Union' s resources are spent effectively, and that includes the most remote regions.
We have to ensure together that the whole area of the Union is included in the single market and derives benefit from it.
For that reason, cooperation with the peripheral areas is more important than ever.
Mr President, my first point is that this is where one normally praises the rapporteur.
I cannot, unfortunately, do that on this occasion, as the rapporteur did not succeed in developing a discussion in the committee that would lead to a common position by Parliament on the Commission's proposals, nor, indeed, did he make the effort to do so.
I see this as a great pity, as a core report and a core position on the part of Parliament are just what is needed.
The Greens, by contrast, have a clear position.
They reject all attempts to protect vested rights and the exceptions to them.
Solidarity between regions must remain the supreme imperative, whilst there must not be such a thing as first and second-class Europe.
In consequence, the Structural Funds must primarily benefit the poorest regions, which just happen to be in the East.
That means that a phasing-out is at the same time an important instrument, and it also cushions the present regions in receipt of support.
Option 2 highlights the problems and offers a solution, and hence it is Option 2 that enjoys our full support.
At the same time though - and this is my next point - our group objects to the Commission's tactic of involving the candidate countries in the management of the Structural Funds at too late a stage and then making a saving at the end of the day.
Last week' s proposal strikes me as scandalous.
It economises on the cohesion policy rather than introducing it earlier, in the pre-accession process.
That is why we urge that a start be made now, with the candidate countries, on phasing-in, on setting up the payment agencies, on training in the management of Structural Funds, in order to make decentralised structural policy, rather than centralised project-based policy, the objective of the Structural Funds.
Future coalition policy must be characterised by sustainable development and participation by local actors, and we must make a start on this now.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mrs Schroedter, I regard the final result of the Committee's vote on Mr Musotto's report as a success.
The report demonstrates, firstly, a balanced assessment of the disparities within the European Union, which continue to be marked, secondly, the challenge thrown down by enlargement, and thirdly, the need for improvements in the area of the EU's structural and cohesion policies.
I would very much like to highlight four fundamental points.
The first is that there must be no renationalisation of Structural Fund policy.
I can save myself the effort of justifying this, as Mr Duin has already done that for me.
Secondly, a polycentric model of space would be a sensible approach to counteracting the disparity between the centre and the periphery.
Thirdly, there is a need for improved coordination among the Structural Funds as well as of structural policy with the other Community policy areas, especially the common agricultural policy and fiscal and economic policy.
Fourthly, consistent application of the bottom-up and partnership principles at every stage - planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation would not only promote closeness to the citizens, but also the subsidiarity principle.
What is imperative, quite apart from the need to continue with aid for the underdeveloped regions of the present Member States, is that the soon-to-be Member States of the European Union must enjoy our full solidarity with them, which means the involvement of these countries, with equal rights, in EU structural policy, without allowing the present Member States to fall by the wayside.
Serious shortfalls in development make it, in my view, already perfectly clear that even 0.45% of Europe's GDP will not be sufficient to do this.
Provision of support and transnational cooperation in the border regions will be of great significance as enlargement takes its course.
Justice has not, in my judgement, been adequately done to this in the report.
The course for the Structural Funds, with their criteria and indicators for support, must be set in such a way that economic and social cohesion is also reflected in falling unemployment figures.
My own country, the Federal Republic of Germany, is setting a bad example in this respect, for unemployment in the 'Objective 1' regions is rising dramatically.
We have a rate of over 20%, but this figure is, fortunately, not as high in the more developed regions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Title XVII of the Treaty establishing the European Community, particularly Article 158 thereof, includes among the Union' s political priorities the promotion of the Community' s 'overall harmonious development' , aiming at 'reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions, including rural areas' .
Personally, I feel that it is necessary to continue to pursue this objective with a coherent, continuing, sustainable policy.
The second report on EU cohesion presented by Commissioner Barnier depicts a situation which has improved but which has certainly not been resolved.
It is clear that the progress made has not been uniform and that severe regional disparities remain which - as rightly pointed out by the rapporteur - are increasing rather than diminishing.
With regard to the objectives, I fully support the position of my fellow member, Mr Musotto.
The criterion for deciding which regions are eligible for receiving aid lays down the threshold of 75% of average Community per capita GDP.
My personal feeling is that, as of 2006, it would certainly be more appropriate to use the unemployment rate as a measure, for the entry of poorer regions which are in greater need of aid will certainly not raise the level of the regions currently under Objective 1.
Mr President, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union gives this debate on economic and social cohesion a special dynamic.
Indeed, it is evident that when the candidate countries join, the current system will prove to entail too heavy a financial burden.
This forces us to make choices.
The Commission has already indicated a few options, but we must give this matter some more thought.
We believe that, in some cases, a policy in support of economic and social cohesion that also supplements national policy is useful and desirable.
The Structural Funds have a special and relatively broad task in this respect.
The Cohesion Fund, on the other hand, pertains to one particular aspect of economic cohesion, namely participation in EMU.
In our view, this should also be at the heart of cohesion policy: helping Member States meet the convergence criteria, both before and after enlargement, without drawing a distinction between old and new.
In that way, not too much will need changing.
The reports of the Commission have also proven that the current system works.
The Cohesion Fund is intended to provide economic stimuli on the basis of transparent, clearly defined criteria.
As far as we are concerned, this is how things will remain, because otherwise we run the risk of losing our way in a structure of soft criteria, and the European and Monetary Union cannot survive on soft criteria.
That is why I have tabled a number of amendments to which an honest but plain approach is central.
I hope that fellow MEPs will give this matter serious thought.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry considers this report to be quite positive. It feels that the indicators in euros paint a more reliable picture than the current measurement and eligibility criteria and also considers that the unemployment indicators are important because in some regions, only 44% of people of working age are in employment, although disparities in production are also significant.
The Committee on Industry also takes the view that the concentration of the Union' s economy in a triangle which is twice or four times as productive as the outlying regions is one of the problems accentuating these disparities and making it difficult to correct them, and is of the opinion that future programming must make a qualitative assessment of the various indicators.
With regard to enlargement, we must allow greater flexibility in the way funds are used, in line with the specific characteristics of each State.
The Committee on Industry supports an increase in the Union' s financial effort for cohesion policy, specifically by making competition tougher and by adjusting the budgets of Community policies. It takes the view that any policy that is given greater financial resources than cohesion policy could neutralise it and that the most developed countries grant production aid that almost equals the Community budget.
The lack of tough competition favours neither cohesion nor integration and is one reason for ongoing criticism within the WTO.
The Committee on Industry urges the Commission to guarantee the creation of a European energy and communications market that respects universal service, prioritises energy efficiency and research, energy saving and the use of renewable energies.
The Committee considers it essential to complete infrastructures in the fields of accessibility and transport in order to reduce the effects on the competitiveness of the current outlying regions, without which the efforts for cohesion that we have already made will suffer.
The Committee wishes to draw attention to the effects on the price and the taxation of energy in the outermost and overseas regions. It recommends that endogenous energies should be developed as well as clean and safe technologies for the use of coal, nuclear energy and hydrocarbons.
Mr President, Commissioner, congratulations first to Mr Musotto on a fine report, and I say this against the backdrop of the harsh criticism by the Greens, whose attitude I do not share.
I would like, in my contribution to this discussion, to focus on the future of regional policy.
Reference has already been made several times this evening to the reconciliation of two fundamental needs with each other, which must be possible, with a high degree of solidarity towards the new Member States on the one hand, but also, on the other, solidarity with those regions that are at present lagging behind or undergoing economic transition.
To put it another way, even if it is generally acknowledged that the regions in all the applicant countries must be supported as a matter of priority, the 'Objective 1' regions of the present fifteen Member States, which will, in the course of enlargement, lose their eligibility for support only because of their relatively high standard of living in an enlarged EU, that is, only by dint of the cosmetic use of statistics, should not overnight be excluded from any opportunity to be supported.
Commissioner, it will be necessary over the coming months to discuss how to guarantee equal treatment of these regions, which have yet to complete the process of economic convergence, with the areas being embraced by enlargement.
Political and economic considerations mean that future cohesion policy must not concentrate exclusively on regions whose development is lagging furthest behind, but it must also take into account the advantages and disadvantages in urban areas, in areas undergoing socio-economic change, in regions with permanent natural disadvantages and also the cross-border dimension.
The financial means this policy needs must of course be made available.
The present threshold of 0.45% of Community GDP must therefore not fall any lower - that too was mentioned several times this evening - in order that cohesion policy may not be jeopardised.
At the present time, we have in any case not yet exhausted the possibilities open to us.
Everything else must be tested by reference to the new financial framework and in the light of the results of enlargement.
I therefore think it inappropriate to be already, as a precaution, articulating demands for the replenishment of funds.
Ladies and gentlemen, in discussing Mr Musotto's report, we obviously want to express our concerns about the future of political cohesion in the Union, given that, if the gap between the rich and the poor is to narrow and they are to feel that they belong to the same European body, they need to converge economically and socially.
Of course, our starting point is fundamentally contradictory.
We want much greater enlargement, but without providing the corresponding funds and we invent lower and lower cohesion targets along the lines of "if the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then let' s take Mohammed to the mountain".
Be that as it may, we face a very tricky problem and we are required to resolve it in less than optimum circumstances, while keeping up the fight to improve those circumstances.
Obviously, we do not want a twin-track Europe, as previous speakers have stressed, but we want a multi-track Europe even less.
So our objective must be to help the new regions where they need help, but without abandoning the old regions which also need help, when they need help.
So I think we need to state that 0.45% is inadequate and that the Cohesion Fund and other Community initiatives need to keep functioning as they have done so far, given that they have proven to be extremely efficient.
And of course we must take a very careful look at the future of political cohesion, in conjunction with the policy of sustainable development and agricultural policy. It is our duty here to avoid stop-gap, hasty solutions which might prove to be the undoing of our farmers, whom we need for the countryside, for the environment, for our very existence.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European regional policy includes a differential element, which is dictated by geography and which defines the outermost regions.
They are distant, isolated, fragmented and are highly dependent on the outside, and they have been experiencing inconsistent development since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which allowed the application of specific measures to correct their backwardness.
Over recent days, the authorities of these regions have been meeting in the Canary Islands to analyse, together with the representatives of the European Commission and the three States involved, the situation of these special regions in relation to social and economic cohesion.
I am sure that, as well as asking for special treatment, they will have requested some of the measures which Mr Musotto is asking for today in his report - and I congratulate him also - in which he stresses the need to differentiate between statistical convergence and real convergence, as well as the suitability of using alternative indicators to per capita income, such as unemployment, the lack of infrastructures, the lack of transport and energy, double insularity, the training of human resources and the levels of ozone in the outermost regions.
In this way, I am sure that their economic and social development will not be restricted and Europe will have clearly demonstrated its solidarity with its people.
Mr President, the Musotto report is a good report.
The overall thrust is quite correct.
The purpose of Cohesion Funds is to counteract the natural centrifugal forces of a large single economic and monetary unit, which is what the European Union and the euro zone are, by helping the less advantaged regions come up to the level of the more prosperous ones.
This is the point: if the less advantaged remain less advantaged, the Cohesion Funds will have failed in their purpose.
But that is why, contrary to what Mr Mussotto and the Committee on Regional Policy demand, we should stick to the 75% of average Community GNP as a graduation point.
Having reached that level the pump will have been adequately primed and the graduating region, with a suitable transitional process, should be well able to continue up the escalator to 100% and higher.
Surely it is only reasonable that at that point these Cohesion Fund resources should be reallocated to those regions which lie further behind.
That is why I will vote against recitals O and R of Mr Musotto's report.
There must also be financial discipline.
An open-ended honey pot is not conducive to encouraging self-help and self-reliance.
This is why I cannot countenance leaving open-ended the possibility of an even higher percentage of European Union GDP being committed to cohesion policies.
0.45% should be quite adequate and will make us hone our priorities and procedures, even in the context of enlargement.
So the second half of paragraph 57, or any compromise of similar effect which leaves the amount be made available open-ended, is not acceptable.
Given these small but significant changes I will be very pleased to support Mr Musotto's report as an important contribution to the future well-being of all parts of our European Union.
Mr President, I would like to thank the many Members who have helped to enhance this resolution with over 50 amendments.
I would also like to make three brief suggestions to the Commission, for - like many other Members - I am convinced that cohesion is not a financial obligation but, first and foremost, a resource, and that if we do not have a Europe of equal opportunities we will never have Europe.
That said, I will turn to the first two suggestions, which, moreover, have already been put forward this evening.
I feel that it would be appropriate to reflect on the parameters, for the gross domestic product may well be in danger of becoming inadequate as an indicator of the real state of well-being or distress of our countries.
We therefore need to assess other factors as well such as the rate of unemployment, the quality of infrastructure and the cost of labour.
My second suggestion is this: since I feel that politics should always prevail over arithmetic, I would call upon Parliament and the Commission not to concentrate on the effects of enlargement as portrayed by statistics, although I do believe deeply in enlargement.
Indeed, we will strive to ensure that no government can see it as a handicap, for it will certainly be a great political asset for Europe.
That said, we would like to avoid certain regions unexpectedly finding themselves in a state of wealth for purely statistical reasons.
Politics must continue to take precedence over arithmetic in this sense.
Here is my third suggestion: we should reinvigorate the strategic profile of our cohesion policy, learning to invest in non-material resources such as training, knowledge and information.
We feel that this is the road to take if integration is to have any practical meaning.
Mr President, last week this debate was dominated by some unfortunate news for cohesion.
In committee we saw the discharge of the 2000 budget, with an execution of 56% of objective 1, 4.5% of objective 2 and 0% of Community initiatives.
We are not talking about the cohesion funds.
The Commissioner, as he told us, wrote a letter to the Presidents of the various countries, reminding them of the 'n+2' rule, that is, that funds may disappear after two years of not being executed.
That is by way of a precaution, amongst other things, and I think it is correct.
The Commission proposed 0.14% of the budget to solve the problems of enlargement.
In any event, I am very pleased with the report by Mr Musotto, in which he makes an enormously positive assessment of regional policy and cohesion policy.
It is a successful policy which is going to ensure that soon there will be almost no Objective 1 regions amongst the Europe of the 15.
The messages of Mr Musotto' s project are clear: procedures must be taken seriously.
I am pleased that the Commissioner has maintained what Parliament proposed: that the programming period be brought forward two years to the next financial perspectives.
He also sends a message relating to the quality of investments and participation, and the implementation of the partnership, which has not yet happened.
But the star has been enlargement: enlargement itself, the effect of enlargement on the other regions that currently receive aid and the absence of a reply to the four questions, Commissioner.
An apparent absence of a reply, since you can give us a satisfactory reply through good work, which is easy if done with common sense and if we believe in cohesion.
Mr President, I will end by saying to the Commissioner that Parliament trusts that the Commission will obtain that response which we all need.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Musotto on his excellent work.
It is difficult to not repeat points which have already been made by other speakers at this stage in the debate.
I will be brief.
One: cohesion policy has proved to be a policy that works, and the report confirms this.
It may not work as well as we would expect or like it to, but it is a policy that yields results.
What is more, in many regions, for many of our fellow citizens, it is sometimes the only practical, positive, friendly aspect of the European Union that they see.
This is an asset which increases the spirit of European citizenship and overall cohesion.
My second point is a fact: we can try to postpone it, ignore it or put off dealing with the issue, but it is still a fact.
In practical terms, enlargement will upset the balance and distort the statistics on which we have built this cohesion policy, for we have based it on what is certainly a statistic, the number of inhabitants and the average income disparity which will be created.
I feel rather hesitant about advancing proposals on this issue, Commissioner, but I would invite the Commission to be less reticent.
Starting to think about the way cohesion policy will have to change in the face of enlargement does not mean placing a question mark over the entire policy of enlargement.
My suggestion is that this debate could, perhaps, focus on three factors: resources, as has been said, for it is unthinkable that resources should remain at their current level; the tools, for I feel, for example, that, while the Structural Funds are a tool which is suitable for a cohesion policy which differs greatly from region to region, it may be that the Cohesion Fund, which is less selective, should be rethought, at least in terms of the way its funds are allocated; coordination of the policies.
In many cases, where there are no additional resources, coordinated policies could be of benefit such as, for example, tax discounts, which it is still not possible to apply to some regions because of a rigid Commission policy on State aid.
Mr President, I also want to address a rigid Commission policy.
As a result of a recent competition policy decision, over EUR 1 billion of much-needed UK regional regeneration investment in poor urban areas and derelict sites has been cut by 75%.
Following the conclusions of the Belgian informal meeting in October, the Commission must now undertake a review of the operation of state aids and regional regeneration policy.
Can the Commissioner please state what follow-up action has been taken?
Can it also reassure us that competition policy will not continue to undermine the legitimate efforts of regional and cohesion policies?
Secondly, unlike my Conservative colleague, Mr Purvis, I do not believe that we should take a rigid view of the reform of funding post-2006 at this stage.
Poorer regions such as Merseyside in my region, and in the rest of the EU 15, may continue to need Objective 1 funding, but more importantly than that, today a delegation of trade unionists from Manchester came to Strasbourg to fight to save 650 jobs threatened due to industrial restructuring.
Last year 9 500 jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector in the region alone.
Can the Commissioner therefore tonight give his support for the continuation of a strong role for European assistance post-2006 for our urban and industrial restructuring regions as well as our poorest regions?
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it is impossible, in two minutes, to discuss the countless issues concerning cohesion, which have, furthermore, been dealt with very thoroughly in the report we are now considering by Mr Musotto, whom I should like to congratulate on the excellent work he has undertaken, I should just like to express a few ideas on the implications of enlargement for the European Union' s economic and social cohesion policy.
The first idea is that if we want to have a viable European Union which has good prospects for the future, we will inevitably have to improve economic and social cohesion policy.
Eastern Europe must feel the same level of European solidarity experienced by countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece and Ireland following their accession to the European Union.
Improving cohesion policy is necessary, however, not only to counter the huge regional imbalances that will result from the entry of scores of least-favoured regions in the current candidate countries, but also to continue to deal with the backwardness that still exists in the current Europe of fifteen countries, particularly in the outermost regions.
This is all the more important because eastwards enlargement will probably accentuate the lack of economic and social cohesion in the current Europe of Fifteen, in other words, regional asymmetries could increase within the current European Union as a result of the dynamics created by the enlargement process, particularly in the relationship between the outermost regions and the centre of Europe.
In other words, countries such as Portugal could become further consigned to the edges of Europe and the current centre and could become even stronger because it will then be the centre of a Europe which is economically integrated from its western almost to its eastern borders.
By this I wish to state that following 2006, we will need a cohesion policy which does not only look eastwards, but which also considers the still existing cohesion deficit in the current Europe of Fifteen and the new problems it will face as a result of enlargement.
The reading of the second cohesion report demonstrates that the Commission is aware of this problem.
We feel sure that the third report will provide appropriate and fair solutions.
Mr President, Commissioner, with its membership increasing from 15 to 25 countries, Europe is at a turning point and must face up to the challenge of its size.
History commands us and we have commitments to do this.
The fact remains, nonetheless, that there will be numerous question marks, when we realise that a Europe with 25 Member States will have 30% more inhabitants, 30% more territory, but only 10% more wealth.
Along with enlargement, Europe is therefore in need of greater solidarity.
But how are we going to manage to show more solidarity with the same amount of money?
It is impossible.
There is no use in continuing to bury our heads in the sand.
Europe must decide to provide the necessary resources for the radical transformation that will bring about enlargement and must reformulate the criteria for granting structural aid so that the poorest populations are not adversely affected.
We must therefore pay particular attention to the outermost regions, which are amongst the ten poorest regions of today' s Union.
In this respect, I welcome the recent proposal by the Spanish Presidency to set up a permanent forum specifically for these regions.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has chosen cohesion, and therefore solidarity, the price of which is the coherence of our common project.
Mr President, Commissioner, one of the recitals of this report states that extremely large regional differences constitute both a political and economic threat to the EU.
That is quite correct.
We must hold an enlarged Europe together.
I want very briefly to emphasise a number of points.
Enlargement is very important for the whole of Europe, and it is not the poorest regions which should pay for enlargement.
There must therefore be sufficient budget resources for the whole of this process.
At the same time, we must use the money in the most effective way, which is why the EU' s agricultural policy should be reformed and coordinated with regional policy so that it promotes rural development, that is to say promotes differentiated economic life in agricultural areas too.
Each Member State must also have its own policy of solidarity and cohesion, and all growth policies must effectively favour justice for the regions.
That applies especially in the fields of education, research, employment and transport.
Finally, I wish to say that future cohesion policy must pay attention to regions with pronounced, permanent geographical disadvantages, for example long distances and a sparse population.
The whole of the EU has an interest in its being possible to be resident, and earn one' s living, throughout the EU.
As the last speaker I have two points to make and one question for the Commissioner this evening.
The first point is about making sure that the poorest regions of Europe do not pay the price of enlargement.
I disagree with what Mr Purvis said.
Areas such as South Yorkshire and Merseyside in the United Kingdom must continue to benefit if they need it, and if they are shown to need it.
The second point is to retain some kind of aid for areas undergoing industrial restructuring.
My question is about competition policy as well, and about coherence between competition policy and cohesion policy.
I am getting a lot of complaints about the way competition policy is being applied, particularly, recently, about voluntary and community sectoral organisations being treated in the same way as private sector organisations and being told that for projects they cannot receive more than 50% in total in public sector intervention.
I want to know whether it is Commission policy to treat the voluntary and community sector the same as the private sector.
Does that apply to other public sector organisations?
It is an extremely important point because if this is the Commission policy, a number of projects which are going ahead in some our most deprived regions will simply cease to go ahead.
It is not what the Commission worked for many years.
Regional policy pushed to put these projects in the hands of the voluntary sector and now they seem to be disadvantaged.
I would like to know what the Commissioner's position is.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you can imagine, I am deeply committed to the regional and cohesion policy, not only because I have the honour of directing this policy on behalf of the Commission and in conjunction with my colleagues, Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou, but also for another, more political reason, which is that I believe, as several of you have said, that the cohesion policy, which has grown in importance over a 15-year period, symbolises a certain concept of the European Union.
It is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket where we quite simply rely on the laws of supply and demand and on fiscal transfers in order to ensure solidarity or to avoid a two, three or four-speed development. It is the proof that we have agreed that we should share our financial resources and redistribute them in a regulated manner, and also to work with greater coherence.
This policy is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket; that it will, one day, I hope, be a political power and that it must remain a community that stands together.
This is the profession of faith that I wanted to give to you at the beginning of my answer.
In this spirit, I feel that Mr Musotto' s report is an extremely worthwhile and useful contribution, as you have all said, to the debate on the future of the cohesion policy that I unveiled to you in January 2001.
And since I am speaking about a concept of Europe, I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the debate on cohesion, which I launched a year ago and which I will be seeing through to completion, in a genuine and decentralised manner, with the Member States - you can count on me to do this - the debate will be part of the other wide-ranging debate on the future of Europe.
Depending on how the Heads of State and Government respond to the question of cohesion, depending on whether we maintain, or even extend, the cohesion policy, whether we scale it down or take it apart, we will somehow answer this broad question - one of the subjects to be tackled by the Convention, which we will also be attending - on the future of Europe.
What do we want to do together?
I think that this contribution, Mr Musotto, is also important because it brings together the points of view of five parliamentary committees after an in-depth discussion has been held.
And then, finally, you will adopt this report in a few days and only after the Commission has published the first interim report on cohesion, which I released last week.
I will also be coming to present this interim report to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on 20 February, as I pledged to do.
For all these reasons, I am pleased - in spite of the criticisms or questions, which I feel are constructive - to note in your report, Mr Musotto, a genuine convergence between Parliament and the Commission, on four essential points at least.
First of all, in the future, the main priority of the cohesion policy must be aid to regions that are lagging behind in their development, in other words, the poorest regions.
On this point, there is agreement, including amongst the Ministers that I met in Namur during the Belgian Presidency, and you confirm this agreement, that the poor regions, which are lagging behind in their development, are located in the future Member States (and they make up almost all of the regions of the future Member States) or in the Member States of today' s Union.
Therefore, our priority and focus is on the regions that are genuinely lagging behind in their development.
The second point of convergence is that cohesion, as many of you pointed out, is not an aspect of one single policy, but of all Community policies, which must, as stipulated in the Treaty, contribute to the cohesion between European countries and regions.
This applies to the CAP, which has not been effective, to transport - Mrs de Palacio is here and she could explain this better than myself - to energy, competition, research, employment and many other policies.
Each of these policies, even more than before, must contribute to increasing economic and social cohesion, if only because of the question marks that enlargement will raise, which, as we note in our second interim report, will increase gaps and inequality.
The third point is that we must strive to have more than a minimalist cohesion policy and reinvent a policy which applies to all the territories of the Union that are experiencing difficulties.
In other words, I note our consensus on the idea that the future regional policy will, after 2006, take into account all European regions, to varying degrees, of course, depending on whether the region is lagging behind in its development or is in a more prosperous region.
This policy should contribute to the integration of all regions in the Community and promote territorial cohesion.
To do this, it must be more simple, more decentralised and, at the same time, more specific (this is one of the questions that I raised in the cohesion report), specific, for example, on the urban question - half of European citizens will live, already live, in towns; specific on the regions that are undergoing industrial restructuring that you mentioned; specific on the regions that have lasting or definitive natural handicaps, mountainous regions or islands; or even specific on thematic objectives, such as the information society.
On this issue too, I await your ideas, but I have explained my outlook.
The fourth point of convergence is that we need resources in order to meet all these challenges and, for the next cohesion policy, resources which meet the needs of a larger Europe.
The current threshold of 0.45% of GDP, which I myself quoted last year in reference, is the absolute credible minimum below which, I feel, it is impossible to go without jeopardising the very essence of the cohesion policy.
In my view, the fact that Parliament and the Commission are tonight giving a joint response to these four points is an important and worthwhile political element in the debate on the future of the cohesion policy. Not everyone, as yet, shares this ambitious vision.
This applies to certain Member States, where some political leaders - whom I respect and to whom I listen - are talking of the deterioration of politics and one is talking of renationalisation. We therefore have to show, time and again - and I am thinking of Mr Izquierdo Collado' s earlier comments - the merits of the cohesion policy, we must aim to convince and to show that this policy has been worthwhile, that it has helped to bring about greater coherence, but that we still need more.
I cannot prove this single-handedly.
You can count on me to do this at Commission level, with the help of all my colleagues, but I will not be able to do this if the regions, the Member States and Members of Parliament do not contribute to this task.
It is also natural for us, at this stage, not to have total agreement on all the subjects raised in Mr Musotto' s report.
There are points that we must debate or discuss, such as the instruments of the future cohesion policy, the place occupied by Community initiatives, that of the Cohesion Fund or a possible single regional development Fund.
All this will, of course, depend on the level of our ambition towards this policy.
Another point of discussion is the choice of eligibility criteria.
The Commission chose, and made this choice a long time ago, the criterion of GDP per capita and per region for determining which regions are lagging behind in their development.
I think that this is a reliable, straightforward and transparent indicator that all the Member States accept, and it is so that we can maintain an objective approach and a certain impartiality that we are not, at this stage, proposing to add other criteria to the criterion of per capita GDP.
Ladies and gentlemen, this does not mean, however, that the Commission will not listen to appeals by the regions which may be affected, either by enlargement or by the so-called 'statistical effect' that several of you have mentioned, by a mathematical decrease in the Community average of per capita GDP or the drop, also mathematical, of the eligibility threshold, which means that some regions that are still having serious problems (not only those in southern Europe, but also in East Germany, in England and elsewhere) are mechanically and artificially situated below this threshold, although they are still experiencing real difficulties.
I will say once again that I am committed to proposing, at the appropriate time, a fair, Community-wide solution so that we can continue to assist the regions which are situated just below the new eligibility threshold.
Furthermore, if we maintain a genuine cohesion policy, which does not only cover regions that are lagging behind in their development, we should be able to take into account other criteria and move, as some of you have pointed out, towards making greater qualitative investment in people, in training men and women and in the information society.
I also note that, in the current programmes, - those that I approved and which have got off the ground - there are more programmes based directly on quality, rather than quantity, than in the previous period.
Lastly, I am not forgetting and will not forget the particular attention that must be given (not only in accordance with Article 299 of the Treaty, but also because the real problems they face, and their unbearable levels of unemployment) to the seven outermost regions of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that these brief clarifications may help to increase even further the degree of consensus between Parliament and the Commission, so that together we can preserve and promote the model of European society, the core of which is cohesion.
One MEP touched upon the subject - and this will be my final point - of the appropriations that you were proposing to grant to the countries which will join the Union, most likely in 2004.
I do not share the very harsh judgment that Mrs Schroeder expressed earlier and I do not think that it is fair.
We proposed a phasing-in process.
These countries already benefit from the Cohesion Fund, and they are experiencing (I regret that Mrs Schroeder is no longer in the Chamber to hear my response) great difficulty in using up the appropriations.
And this is why I suggested, along with my colleagues, for this genuine reason, that we adopt a progressive approach to the cohesion policy.
I am not trying to trick anyone or create an effect.
I do not want to see money that has been earmarked by Europe for the candidate countries, which will join the EU in 2004, to stay in Brussels or be returned to Brussels.
That is why we are being quite ambitious and going further than the proposals set out in the Berlin Agenda for the first year of membership and why we are proposing more money. But we want to avoid a situation where this money cannot be used by the countries that do not yet have the necessary administrative structures in place to manage these appropriations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall end here.
Lastly, I confirm that the Commission is due to adopt the third cohesion report in December 2003 and that the report should set out the Commission guidelines for the next agenda.
This should, therefore, be done earlier than usual, so that we can, as I said before, begin to turn the new programming period into a reality on the ground, as soon as the new Agenda begins in 2007, rather than two years after that.
We still have a few months to stimulate and make a success of the political debate on cohesion policy. If we succeed in stimulating this debate (and I need you to help me to do this), a decision will be taken, at the appropriate time, by the Heads of State and Government, which will not only maintain cohesion as the heart of a specific model of European society, but will enable the Heads of State to commit, on a budgetary and financial level, to fulfilling the political and strategic choice that they made when they decided to undertake reunification of the European continent, through extensive enlargement that will take place very soon.
We shall support the new Member States and I hope, personally speaking, that the Agenda, in 2007, will enable them to benefit, like all the other Member States, from every aspect of the cohesion policy.
Speed limitation devices
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0012/2002) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community (COM(2001) 318 - C5-0267/2001 - 2001/0135(COD)).
Mr President, this proposal for a directive seeks to extend speed restrictions, which already apply to some commercial vehicles, to other categories of passenger and goods vehicles, i.e. to lighter commercial vehicles than those to which the restrictions already apply.
In other words, to category Ã2 and Ã3 passenger vehicles and category Ã2 goods vehicles.
The European Commission's proposal makes provision for speed limitation devices to restrict passenger vehicles to 100 kph and goods vehicles to 90 kph. And basically, I agree with the European Commission's proposal.
A study carried out in Holland and brought to our attention by the European Commission demonstrates that it stands to reap profits in the order of EUR 40 million a year and benefits to society in the order of EUR 89 million a year from the transport sector alone.
If we extrapolate these figures, we stand to gain something in the order of EUR 3 billion.
But I do not want to dwell on this study because others may dispute it. I should like to dwell for a moment on common sense.
And common sense tells us that, if we restrict speeds, we stand to gain, first from road safety, because there will be fewer accidents; secondly, we stand to gain in the environmental protection sector and, thirdly, we shall ensure there is fair competition between companies because we shall have the same limit everywhere, throughout Europe; at the same time, companies will not be able to force their drivers to drive very fast, putting human lives at risk for the sake of their profit margins.
That is why the amendments which I have proposed do not differ in any great respect from the text of the European Commission's proposal.
I should like to comment on two amendments accepted in committee.
The first concerns the exemption, which we propose should be 5 years from when the directive enters into force for category Ã2 and Ã2 vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes.
What we are proposing here is that the directive should apply five years after it enters into force and, secondly, that the European Commission should submit a study eighteen months after the directive enters into force on so-called intelligent speed adaptation systems so that we can see if we can use these systems to differentiate speeds depending on the circumstances and, of course, if we can have even lower speeds in urban areas.
The European People's Party has tabled an amendment for category Ã2, which includes vans, calling for the speed limit to be raised from 90 to 110 kph, because they are a different type of vehicle; they are lighter vehicles and I think that we can be more flexible here.
Some fellow members voted against this and explained their reasons.
They have ideological, political reasons and they do not think that the European Commission, or rather the European Union, should intervene here.
I should like to thank them, I understand their reasons and, even though I disagree with them, I respect their position.
But I should like to ask them, given that there are some amendments which make the European Commission's proposal more flexible and bring it closer to their own position, to examine these amendments constructively and, if they can, to vote for them, because it is my prediction that, their position notwithstanding, this directive will, at some point, become European law.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen - at least those of you who are still here - the PPE-DE group supports the entire content of Mr Hatzidakis' report.
We take the view that we may well support the Commission's proposal in principle, but that we do want to bring about some changes on a few points.
The traffic safety issue is, of course, decisive, and we need this regulation because traffic safety is not bound by national borders and heavy goods vehicles do, indeed, cross them.
In principle, we also need speed limitation devices for smaller vehicles, as we have had good experience of speed limitation devices in heavy lorries.
It is because these HGVs travel across borders everywhere that we need European regulations.
However, Madam Vice-President, we have to introduce the regulations in a slightly refined form and with longer time limits, for we are dealing here with major economic burdens laid on small and medium-sized enterprises.
We should therefore be more generous in the transitional provisions, in order that the burden on the economy may not be allowed to be too great.
Let me conclude by appealing to the Social Democrats and Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, who is herself a great expert on traffic safety.
As our Amendment No 12 demands, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, we need different speeds for small and large lorries.
So we are again asking you to support our Amendment No 12, so that we can permit a speed of 110 kph for smaller commercial vehicles.
If we impose the same speed limit on all HGVs, we are pre-programming traffic jams into the motorway system.
If we are to ensure traffic flow, we must make it possible for smaller vehicles to overtake.
With that in mind, Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, I ask you to support our amendment.
We will then have a great piece of legislation!
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for the considerable openness and readiness to compromise that have characterised his work on this report.
The transport of both goods and people on the roads is ever increasing.
Movement on the roads is international and cross-border, and so too, therefore, must be the rules we lay down.
A shining example is the legislation on speed limitation devices.
When it came into force in 1994, it had met a certain amount of resistance both from the industry and from the drivers themselves, but this evaporated when the advantages became apparent.
In a Europe in which more than 40 000 people lose their lives in road accidents, all kinds of methods must be tried in order to make the roads safer.
Once speed limitation devices had been introduced, it was no longer possible to build speeding into systems under which the heaviest vehicles operated.
This new proposal will lead to speed limitation devices also being used in lighter commercial vehicles and buses, and this will have further positive repercussions.
Recently, there has been a marked increase in the frequency of accidents involving lighter commercial vehicles.
Those of us in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support the amendments in favour of a longer transition period.
One issue which, however, recurred in the debate on this directive, and which Mr Jarzembowski addressed, is that of whether there should be different speeds for different categories of vehicle.
It was argued that identical speeds create congestion and bottlenecks on the roads.
I do not believe that is the case.
The fewer speed differences there are, the smoother the traffic flows, in actual fact.
There are mathematical calculations to show this.
It is enough to imagine a road on which vehicles are maintaining the same speed.
In that case, the traffic flows more smoothly.
That is why I demand that Amendment No 12 be rejected.
Mr President, I am quite sure that we all accept the premise that an inappropriate speed by any vehicle can cause accidents.
But more often than not accidents are attibutable to the manner in which the vehicle is being driven, or the carelessness of drivers failing to be vigilant, especially in bad weather for example.
Accidents are also caused by drivers crawling along at a snail's pace on motorways and in some cases they could be avoided by having a minimum as well as a maximum speed limit.
There has to be recognition that there is a world of difference between motorway and urban driving.
Whilst clearly agreeing with the Commission and my colleagues, including Mr Hatzidakis, that we must do all we can to improve road safety across the European Union, I cannot agree that the way forward would be the introduction of this directive, which advocated a one-speed-fits-all approach.
It is recognised that the United Kingdom has the best safety record in the EU.
It is equally true to say that it was one of the first countries to fit speed limiters on coaches, for obvious reasons.
In addition, this directive is also meant to improve the environment and congestion and again I would refute that claim.
To extend this directive to those categories of vehicles included in the proposal, and to impose the upper speed limits as outlined, would be a mistake.
It is bad enough struggling along motorways when two heavy goods lorries are running parallel because one decides to overtake on a hill and clearly cannot accelerate.
If this directive comes into play I believe that congestion and environmental pollution will increase.
Finally, the right way forward would be to seriously consider advances in technology, for example the proposed voluntary agreement on pedestrian protection.
In addition, there is also the possibility of ISA and I would support a study by the Commission along those lines.
Nevertheless, ultimately, it should be left to the discretion of the Member State to decide what would or would not be appropriate.
With the exception of a couple of amendments, my delegation will be unable to support this report.
Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Hatzidakis for his sound preparation of this report.
Traffic safety is rightly one of the core themes of the White Paper.
The number of people who are killed each year in the European Union is still far too high.
These fatal accidents are often caused by speeding.
With a view to reducing the road accident toll, speed limitation devices for lorries are an effective instrument for improving road safety.
Indeed, lower speeds lead to fewer road accidents and fewer victims.
Furthermore, benefits can be expected in the fields of maintenance and of a cleaner environment.
In order to ensure that speed limitation devices cannot be interfered with and in order to guarantee that they are maintained in proper working order, reliable inspection is needed.
Annual compulsory inspection seems best suited for this purpose, in my opinion.
But in that case, an adjustment to the European General Periodical Car Inspection Directive is necessary in order to bring about a level playing field.
I should like to draw your attention to the issue of intelligent speed adapters, a very important point in my view.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission, at the earliest possibility, to conduct a study into the possibilities which this system could offer.
It could contribute to greater safety on the roads, less irritation and a greater sense of security on the part of drivers.
In general, I should like to ask the Commission to give an extra boost to technology which should make intelligent road and traffic control systems possible.
This is with a view to the expected growth in demand for transport, as a result of which the benefits of this directive in terms of road safety will be lost.
The level of safety will go down once again, the build-up on roads will increase again and the beneficial impact which we are pursuing by means of this directive will be cancelled out.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hatzidakis, for his fantastic work on this directive, a report which fully supports the Commission' s proposal and which incorporates numerous amendments which improve the text of the proposal without changing its objective.
The purpose of the proposal is to extend the scope of the obligatory installation and use of speed limiters to vehicles in lighter categories than those currently affected by these limitations.
This measure represents the realisation of the priorities formulated in March 2000, within the framework of the Commission communication on road safety, which also received the explicit support of this Parliament.
The proposal will contribute to an increase in road safety, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of conditions of equal and fair competition between all operators within the European Union.
I would like to make some comments on the report we are dealing with here.
There are several amendments which we can support: Amendments Nos 4, 6 and 7 can be accepted in their entirety; Nos 5 and 10 are acceptable in principle, although the dates need to be altered, and the same is the case with Amendment No 6, which I referred to previously.
The Commission would prefer the following timetable: two years for new vehicles, three years for international transport and four for national transport.
I believe that this answers some of Mr Jarzembowski' s questions on the effects on small and medium-sized businesses, which are the most frequent users of this type of vehicle.
There is an adaptation period and, if we bear in mind the rotation of this type of vehicle, the time of the entry into force of the directive, etc., we see that it is not so out of place.
With regard to Amendment No 9, the Commission could accept a study in the context of road safety towards 2010, as long as it does not involve a separate report.
In any event, the time limit of 18 months is excessively short to carry out such a study. We need two years as a minimum.
In this regard, I would like to stress the great importance the Commission attaches to intelligent speed restriction systems and great attention will be paid to the study of this issue.
The concepts behind Amendments Nos 8 and 11 are unacceptable to the Commission.
The acceptance of greater maximum speeds for a limited period of time not only raises technical problems for which there is no solution, at least at the moment, but would also hinder the implementation of the measure.
The Commission believes that, for the moment, there is no advantage in applying this directive to M1 and N1 vehicles.
Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12, which Mr Jarzembowski advocated, amongst others, because the triple objective of the directive - road safety, environmental protection and competition under equal conditions - cannot be achieved unless all vehicles are bound by the same speed limit.
Finally, we will carefully study Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, which refer to the textual differences between linguistic versions, in relation to the definition of vehicles.
I would once again like to congratulate the rapporteur and all the Members who have spoken in this debate.
I hope that, through the application of this directive, road safety will improve, which is the intention, since the figure of 42 000 deaths per year is completely unacceptable to all of us.
The debate on this report is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Excise duty on rum, liqueurs and eaux-de-vie
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as a Member for one of the outermost regions, I welcomed the opportunity to draw up the report we are now discussing.
I am pleased because the Commission' s proposals to reduce the special rate of excise duty on the consumption of certain alcoholic drinks produced in Madeira, the Azores and the French overseas departments are yet another measure giving form and substance to the principle of remoteness, enshrined in Article 299(2) of the Treaties.
We should bear in mind that this legal basis, endorsed by the Treaty of Amsterdam, provides for the adoption of specific measures in various fields, especially that of tax legislation, in accordance with the very particular geographical, social, economic and cultural situations of these European regions.
In short, the European Union can give these territories special treatment in line with their very specific situations, and the only limit on this special treatment should be the integrity and coherence of the Community legal system, including the internal market and common policies.
Only by providing this specific treatment will we ensure that these regions can become involved in the dynamism unleashed by the internal market, by Economic and Monetary Union, by the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, and even by the phenomenon of globalisation.
Only by providing this special treatment will we ensure that these regions can offer genuine equal opportunities for our citizens living in the outermost regions.
The measures to reduce the special rate of excise duty on rum and liqueurs produced and consumed in Madeira, on eaux-de-vie produced and consumed in the Azores and on rum produced in the French overseas departments are crucial to offsetting production costs and thereby guaranteeing the survival of traditional activities of considerable economic, social, historic and cultural importance for these regions.
One hundred and forty jobs are at stake in Madeira and the Azores and 40 000 in the French Overseas Departments.
At stake are also elements related to the specific identity itself of these regions, particularly in the French Overseas Departments, where activities linked to the planting of sugar cane and to the production of sugar and rum are an important part of the economic and social history of these territories.
All of these activities are, therefore, linked to the sugar cane, sugar and rum industries, which depend on this tax measure, in a context marked by the revision of the COM in sugar and by the dismantling of customs barriers for exports to the Community market of spirits from third countries.
Indeed, without the tax measure now being proposed, how will rum production in the OD be able to remain viable, when production costs for rum are considerably higher there than in neighbouring Caribbean countries, when rum from the Caribbean is able to enter the Community market without duties in 2003?
We should bear in mind that Community rum producers pay between four and six times more for sugar cane and three times more for their work force.
Here, costs arising from adapting rum production units to environmental standards, in order to comply with Community regulations, are increasing.
I shall close by emphasising that, despite the permanent nature of the specific characteristics that justify the special treatment granted to the outermost regions by Article 299(2), these tax measures are not only limited in terms of time - they are valid for seven years - but are also limited in quantitative terms.
They are, furthermore, subject to periodic evaluation, in order to assess whether the reasons which justify the granting of the tax derogation still exist.
Before us, therefore, lies a well-drafted and balanced proposal by the Commission, to which we should all give our support.
It responds, on the one hand, to the need for special treatment for the outermost regions and, on the other, safeguards the integrity of the Community' s internal market.
This is also the type of measure that creates and promotes European citizenship in territories far from the centre of Europe such as the outermost regions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the cane-sugar rum sector provides almost 40 000 jobs in three of the four French overseas departments.
By allowing producers in these departments to supply only the French market with a limited quantity of 'traditional' rum for a seven-year period, we are giving these businesses the means to fight against stiff competition from some third countries and, in doing so, we are protecting the future of thousands of jobs.
However, I personally deplore the fact that, despite the request made by France, the Commission has not stated that it is in favour of a longer derogation period, which would have been a more appropriate way to reflect the economic logic of this matter as well as the letter and the spirit of the notorious Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
Despite the fact that some progress has been made, the implementation of this article for now only partially meets the expectations that it raised.
We must, however, take ambitious measures and do so quickly.
The people are asking us to do this, and it is our political responsibility to respond.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, this debate concerns a specific issue, which is of limited reach and importance in the Azores, not wishing to make any comparison with the situation in the overseas territories or even in the autonomous region of Madeira, just two days after the Las Palmas summit of the Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which was attended by representatives of the Member States and the Commission.
I should, therefore, like to welcome the conclusions of that summit and call on the Council and the Commission to take them into consideration.
This year is of particular importance to the Azores where fisheries are concerned, since important initiatives such as the revision of the common fisheries policy, the revision of Poseima-Fisheries and the quotas policy for groundfish are to be approved.
These are areas in which it is crucial to fully understand the realities of the Azores and to take account of their specific situation.
The Commission proposals on quotas for fishing groundfish cause us the greatest concern from this point of view.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am pleased to note that Mr Marques' s report fully supports the Commission' s proposals.
According to these reports and the Commission' s proposals, these measures are essential in order to maintain the local production of rum, which is traditional in French overseas departments, and of rum, liqueurs and eaux-de-vie, which are traditional in Madeira and the Azores.
These traditional activities are very important for the economy of these regions and it is essential to maintain them in order to ensure an economic, social and territorial balance for these regions of the European Union.
I would like to say something relating to the legal basis of the proposals, since there has been controversy about it, which the rapporteur, Mr Marques, has mentioned.
Both are based on the application of the second paragraph of Article 299 of the EC Treaty, which is precisely the one relating to the outermost regions.
This provision allows the Council to adopt specific measures, which may repeal other fundamental provisions of the Treaty, laying down the conditions for its application in regions which - we must state this very clearly - have very different specific characteristics owing precisely to their condition as outermost regions.
I would like to point out, ladies and gentlemen, that this provision was included in the Treaty of Amsterdam with the purpose of creating a common legal basis for actions in favour of these regions.
These actions must allow for the complete integration of these regions into the Union, while recognising their own characteristics, such as their great distance from the continent, the dependence of their economy on a small number of products, many of them relating to traditional and small-scale activities.
Therefore, the Commission considers that this second paragraph of Article 299 of the Treaty is the appropriate legal basis for these proposals and any others which may arise in the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Galileo Joint Undertaking
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0005/2002) by Mr Glante, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of the Galileo Joint Undertaking (COM(2001) 336 - C5-0329/2001 - 2001/0136(CNS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and above all, you interpreters who are assembled here in such numbers for so few of us Members, it is always a pleasure to be able to discuss such an interesting and exciting topic at such a late hour.
I hope that the lateness of the hour will not downgrade the project.
I refer to the Galileo satellite navigation system, the first great project to be shaped jointly by the European institutions and the ESA.
In technical, economic and political terms, it is eminently comparable with such projects as the Airbus and the GSM mobile telecommunications standard.
This system will to some degree be in technological competition with the existing American GPS system, which is a good thing for European technology, but it will also be compatible with GPS - at least I hope it will, and that is something by which we set store - and be able to supplement it.
I have been told that the United States is seriously concerned about developments in Europe.
That cannot be a bad thing, and can mean only that we are on the right road and that we will make technological progress in Europe by the use of this system.
It is certainly in competition, in technological terms, with the existing GPS, but there is also the possibility of their interacting.
We are working towards the system being able to use the same receivers for GPS and Galileo signals.
That will increase the utility of both systems.
I would also like, at this point, to refer to the coordination between GPS, Galileo and EGNOS.
Most discussions fail to do justice to this point, but I think it too is important.
After 11 September and during the Afghanistan conflict, the United States had apprehensions about the security aspects of what is a civilian project, but these will be safeguarded.
Both the civilian character and the public control of the Galileo project make disruption, interference and misuse impossible.
A certain levy on receivers will mean that broad use will be free of charge.
Broad use of GPS is free of charge, and so will Galileo be.
More exact services of a higher order will have to be paid for in order to guarantee the refinancing of the running and development costs.
The service will, however, be permanently available.
This afternoon I had the pleasure of a conversation with the US Government's representative in Brussels, who again expressed his concern about the project's development.
I was able to reassure him, but not in the sense that we would unreservedly submit ourselves to the GPS system.
I made it clear to him that we are building our own system, that we are working towards cooperation, but that we will carry on with development and not let ourselves be led into some kind of technological dependency.
I think that these informally expressed wishes and these remarks show that we are still on the right road.
The Member States have delayed taking a decision for a long time, and I hope that they will enthusiastically endorse this project in March, despite certain problems that they have with the Price Waterhouse study - indeed, I get indications from various Member State governments that they will.
I hope that we will get to that, and believe that it is high time we did.
We are already a couple of months behind, but will be able to make up for them.
I would like to again express my gratitude to the Commissioner for the conversation we had and also for providing these documents, which again explain what Galileo is about and can allay any suspicions or misgivings.
Let us turn now to the report itself and to the proposal, which is not uncontroversial.
I think there is, as there was in the past, overwhelming agreement that we want this project and that we want it to be a civilian one.
As a result, though, of events last year and in recent months, we are also agreed that it needs to be available to some degree to our troops who are sent out to maintain the peace.
That will be feasible, technically feasible, but it will also be politically desired and feasible.
It is, though, to remain a civilian system, as it was before.
There were great problems in discussions about how private enterprise was to be involved in this undertaking.
The Commission proposal works on the assumption that private firms will be involved, including financially.
Financial participation is - shall we say - a symbolic act.
It would be enough to finance the development stage by means of public funds alone, but industry is to be involved.
That is what I want too, but I have had no clear indication from industry that they are becoming amicably disposed towards the Commission proposal and getting on board the Joint Undertaking.
My proposal that the development company should be established, coming into being in parallel with the Joint Undertaking but dovetailing closely with it, offers a compromise, a way out of the dilemma.
Indications from the business world are variable - some are rejecting this proposal, while others have a very open mind about it.
I have endeavoured simply to use this proposal to reduce to some extent the inhibitions that businesses have, and I hope that they will participate in the development company.
In so far, I hope for broad support tomorrow.
Unfortunately, I cannot support the European People's Party's proposals, which date back to the Commission proposal and thus, in my opinion, give industry another argument against joining in.
, draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you also, Mr Glante, for your efforts at producing this report in this form, and thank you for what you have said.
Mr Radwan, in his capacity as your shadow rapporteur, will further enlarge on the PPE proposal that you feel unable to support.
Having its own satellite navigation system has been one of Europe's concerns for many years now, but it exists only as an aspiration.
No decision on it has as yet been reached.
It is in connection with Galileo, of all things, that everything is weighed in the balance a thousand times over, every euro is examined closely, whereas in other areas the European purse-strings are much looser.
What I reproach the Member States for is the way they delay and defer, hang back and hesitate, and that is what could stick in the minds of Europe's citizens.
That is also what Europe's image threatens to become if we are not careful.
I, however, want Europe to be modern, technologically on the ball, quite literally the worldwide Number One.
This is where Europe can play its trump cards - economic strength, a talent for innovation, technological capacity and vision.
I do not want to make apocalyptic predictions, but I am convinced that, without Galileo, Europe could completely lose its position in an important sector and will fall back so far that it will, at the end of the day, be quite impossible for it to catch up.
If we do not manage to get Galileo started and at last open the doors to new technologies, if we do not manage to make the necessary funds available, then we will become a laughing-stock across the world, and in outer space as well.
Why am I telling you this?
We need now, at last, a resounding 'yes' to Galileo and a competitive alternative to GPS!
The Council wanted industry involved in Galileo as early as possible.
The Commission submitted a proposal which Parliament put to the acid test, and which received - and still receives - severe criticism from different sides, and I do think there were omissions on the Commission's side as well.
Our Committees have identified a number of problem areas.
Industry involvement in the Joint Undertaking - whether direct or via the development company - must not, though, be made so hard to reach that Galileo's failure becomes a possible result.
Europe needs Galileo, or, as the Commission puts it in its information note, Galileo is indispensable to Europe.
That is why I hope Parliament will speak with a clear voice and that there will be a large majority tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of an opinion on the Galileo proposal, I would like to focus essentially on two financial aspects of the Commission' s proposal, leaving the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the task of discussing its merits.
The Commission has presented a proposal for the setting-up of a Joint Undertaking to complete the development phase of Galileo; this would provide a single management structure with legal personality which would be flexible and capable of concluding the necessary contracts.
The founding members would be the Commission and the European Space Agency, which would contribute a maximum of EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million respectively.
The European Investment Bank and any private company providing a minimum sum of EUR 20 million could be further members.
The cost of this phase is estimated at EUR 1.1 billion, to be split equally between the European Community and the European Space Agency, with an extra EUR 200 million coming from the private sector, pledged through the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2001 by representatives of the main industries concerned.
The Community' s financial contribution will come from two budget lines: from B5-700 - Trans-European Networks - and from a token entry under the B6 Research chapter pending a final decision on the 6th Framework Programme.
Out of the amount financed by the European Space Agency, EUR 50 million would be paid in cash and EUR 500 million in kind, as stated in the European Space Agency' s Statutes.
I have tabled two amendments in my opinion: the first concerns the possible future participation of the candidate countries in the development phase of Galileo, as called for by Parliament in its resolution of 3 October 2001.
I have called for instruments to be identified in the budget which will allow them to participate, not least in order to avoid further widening the existing gap.
The second amendment concerns the role to be conferred on the Budgetary Authority; I therefore call upon the Commission to inform it on a regular basis on the implementation of the development phase of Galileo, and for the annual report on the activities of the Joint Undertaking to be sent to Parliament and the Council and not only to the Court of Auditors as proposed by the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to thank the rapporteur at the outset for his close cooperation.
All of one mind, we are on track to make Galileo a reality.
I would also like to start by thanking the Commissioner, who repeatedly and doggedly pleads, and indeed fights, for Galileo at Council level.
Economically, technologically and politically, Galileo is a strategic project for the future.
That has already been said several times.
Here in Europe, we should remember how it was explained to us decades ago that we did not need the Airbus, we did not need a missile industry.
They would do all that for us, and it would be for the best.
Where would we be today if, for example, we had not developed the Airbus ourselves?
Now, though, I have two practical observations on Mr Glante's report. I consider it essential that industry should today already be actively involved in Galileo.
There is no use in describing Galileo's importance in fine words; we need industry to make a clear commitment to Galileo.
We must make a start right now on developing services to get products onto the markets of the future, products which would enable Galileo to be self-financing, which is what both sides of this House want: hence we need absolutely clear support for the Commission proposal to this end.
We should, though, perhaps give thought to some reduction in the 'front-loading' .
I see Galileo's political dimension as a second important point.
We want Europe to have a common foreign and security policy.
We have the Rapid Reaction Force, and we want, in the future, to send our soldiers to troublespots.
Here, too, we need to assume responsibility for our soldiers, which means that we have information systems of our own and are no longer dependent on third countries.
What this means is that Galileo is, to some extent, necessary if we are to grow up in the way we approach external policy.
Tomorrow should, therefore, see Parliament send a clear demand, for the sake of Europe's future, that the Council should decide in favour of Galileo!
Apart from that, we propose, as an alternative, that, if the Council proves to be Galileo's undoing, we might well have to have thoughts about the defence budgets, and I am very definitely of the opinion that it is our primary duty to ensure that Galileo remains a civilian product.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to express my regret that we have engaged in a battle over amendments after the enormous success of Mrs Langenhagen' s report.
I think that divisive forces have also been at work in the European Parliament, but I am convinced, from what I have heard, that they will not succeed.
I hope that, however we vote on the amendments, tomorrow' s vote will be an overall majority in favour of the Galileo report.
The most important thing is that Parliament does not become divided, and that it continues to show its support for Mrs de Palacio and the Commission on this extremely important project.
We cannot merely focus on accounting and notarial-oriented matters when discussing a subject of this importance, when the Americans are pouring millions of dollars into their aerospace and space industry.
We are today facing the acid test.
Either the European Union is capable of launching a space programme as modest as Galileo, forty years after the daring innovations of Airbus and Ariane, or - as some Members who are sitting on other benches have said - we show that we are incapable of doing this.
If we have to show that we are incapable of this, I do not want Parliament to take any responsibility for this and I hope that the Commission and Parliament will, in future, display a united front when showing the Council what its responsibilities are.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance takes a positive overall view of the report by Mr Glante.
It is not a question of deciding whether or not to approve the Galileo project.
This has already been decided in the report by Mrs Langenhagen, as she herself has just pointed out, and I myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
Our objective is now to decide how to manage the project' s development phase.
We agree with the rapporteur' s proposal to create a Joint Undertaking whose shareholders would be the European Union and the ESA, an undertaking which would be dissolved once the development phase is completed.
We also agree with his proposal to create, alongside that, a development company in which the private sector will participate.
It will enable conflicts of interest to be avoided whilst drafting the specification and the tendering procedure during the deployment phase.
The Undertaking will not therefore be judge and judged.
We do not believe that the proposed monitoring committee will serve a useful purpose, since the Member States are already represented in the Joint Undertaking.
However, we are in favour of setting up a committee with an ethical purpose, whose opinions will be consulted and which will ensure that Galileo is used properly and in accordance with the principles laid down by Parliament.
Lastly, we do not agree with the amendments tabled by Mr Radwan, which reintroduce the concept of Galileo being used for military applications, even occasionally, on the pretext that this could be done for humanitarian ends.
If this amendment received a favourable vote, we could not vote for the report thus amended.
To sum up, if the use of Galileo for military applications is not reintroduced by any means whatsoever, we will vote in favour of the report by Mr Glante, in its current form, unless the monitoring committee concerned, which we recommended setting up in the first report, does not have an ethical purpose.
Madam Commissioner: the PPE-DE broadly supports the Galileo project in principle.
We recognise the case for a complementary and alternative satellite radio navigation system.
We recognise the importance of maintaining European technological capability for space activity.
We welcome the emphasis on a civil project intended ultimately to be commercially viable in a number of fields such as communications and Earth observation, as well as position - finding.
The difficulty lies in determining how to fund a venture until it becomes self-financing, particularly in view of the large sums of upfront investments required.
We want to see industry fully involved in the planning, specifications and preparatory stages to ensure a better chance of technical success.
That is why we have reintroduced amendments to lower the entrance fee for business to be part of the Joint Undertaking.
We see no particular merit in the proposal for a development company at this stage which duplicates the Joint Undertaking structures.
We are mindful of the difficulties of funding such a large-value infrastructures project solely from the private sector, which is why we have put forward the amendment enabling some funding to come from defence budgets provided it is used only for peacekeeping purposes.
This merely supports the comments made in Annex 1 of the Commission's own information note concerning strategic considerations.
In closing I would say that it is a great pleasure to be here as the other half of "les deux gilles ciel et espace" club, with my colleague, Mr Savary.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Glante for the report he has presented.
I would also like to thank Mr Savary and Mr Chichester, the whole of the Sky and Space team and all the MEPs who backed a document supporting the Galileo programme with a view to the European Council at Laeken.
Unfortunately, we were not able to achieve it on that particular occasion, but we hope to do so next time.
We must not be discouraged and we still have time, although not much, to try finally to move ahead with a project which seems to me absolutely crucial to Europe and which furthermore is going to be a measure of Europe' s real will to have a presence on the international stage.
I will just focus on three aspects which have been referred to here in relation to the report.
We all feel that the participation of the private sector is crucial.
Our differences lie in how and from when, if I have understood correctly.
I wish to say in this respect - as Mr Savary and Mrs Langenhagen have said - that, regardless of the result of the amendments relating to Mr Glante' s report, I hope that the report, in the form it takes after the amendments or without them, has the greatest possible support, regardless of my preferences for one formula or another.
We believe that the private sector should be incorporated from the outset, not only because of the limited funds which it is going to provide during the development phase of 2002 to 2005, but because in the medium term it falls to that sector to contribute substantially during the following phase, not only in the implementation phase, but also in the operative phase.
The substantial increase in the financial participation of the private sector is an essential condition if we are to achieve, within the framework of the future financial perspectives, the necessary public funding in the latter phases.
The participation of the private sector should not be improvised, but rather it should be prepared from now, and that was expressed in the resolution of the Council of Ministers in April of last year.
The Commission' s proposal, which is being presented today, simply puts this principle into practice.
It is true that there is a suggestion, raised by Mr Glante, which replaces that direct participation with the creation of a Joint Undertaking, with the creation of a promotion company in parallel with the Joint Undertaking, which does not seem sufficient to us, as I have pointed out.
We believe that participation must take place within the undertaking and furthermore that there is a clear will, not only in the space sector, but also in the applications sector, to go ahead with this phase, with this public or private participation.
I would also like to say that, by participating in the capital of the Joint Undertaking, industry is now beginning to accept a minimal risk, and I think that is appropriate, because it must also participate in the final definitions of the architecture of the whole system.
Some in the Council and in Parliament fear that conflicts of interest may arise.
In my opinion, these days, national legislations provide formulae which prevent this type of conflict of interests.
As I have said on previous occasions, we are giving aid and funding programmes, while there is a bank acting as financial adviser on the aid, while, linked to that bank, there is a non-governmental organisation, which carries out the programme and while, also related to that bank, there is a study group which is assessing the reality of the programme.
And we say that all of that is correct and that there are sufficient barriers to guarantee that a conflict of interests is not possible.
I believe that, in this case, there are even more concrete and clear ways, the famous Great wall of China, which would allow us to prevent this type of problem.
Article 9 of the Statutes says that, in the proposal we are making, in the field of contracting, the executive committee must act totally independently from the management board in which the companies participating in the Joint Undertaking would be represented, that is to say that the executive committee acts independently of the companies which may participate in tenders.
To prevent concerns, there are formulae which may offer greater guarantees.
With regard to the role of the States of the Union, we fully agree with the approach taken in the report by Mr Glante, that is, the creation of a monitoring committee made up of representatives of the Member States, so that those States may closely and continuously monitor the activities of the Joint Undertaking.
We have therefore proposed to the Council, and they have approved it, that in the Regulation, not in the statutes of the Joint Undertaking, but in the Regulation, a monitoring council should be established made up of representatives of the States.
This council should meet before each meeting of the management board of the Joint Undertaking to offer its opinion on the positions the Commission intends to advocate in relation to the different points on the agenda.
These operating rules seem to us to be the most appropriate for achieving our objective, since they maintain the operating autonomy of the undertaking while allowing the States to control the activities of the Commission, which represents the European Community on the management board of the Joint Undertaking.
With regard to the military dimension, ladies and gentlemen, I will say that Galileo is a system designed for civil purposes, which will have to be managed by civilians and that, furthermore, that is one of its essential differences when compared to the GPS.
Having said that, it is true that there is a service reserved for public administrations, which is intended for applications such as fire services and security, which at certain times can be used for other purposes, but at the moment the open GPS is being used for certain applications and for certain military uses.
It is inevitable that they will carry equipment which is synchronised with Galileo.
By this, ladies and gentlemen, I mean firstly that this type of system always has a double use.
Secondly, as you know, there is a free access signal, which is totally free of charge, and another access signal, pre-paid, with services, codified, but which is also free.
And a third signal is reserved for the public sector, but - I insist - is intended not for military uses but for civilian uses such as those I have indicated.
Ladies and gentlemen, in relation to Galileo, all the elements for taking a decision are on the table in the Council of Ministers, and the funding for the whole of the development phase, without any State of the Union having to give a single euro more in order to implement the project.
We must make it clear that the current financial perspectives cover the whole of the development phase of Galileo.
No State should have to put in another additional euro.
Galileo is essential to European industry, to technological capacity, to European space technology, but also for a series of other factors, such as autonomy, sovereignty and the capacity to offer an alternative service to GPS, which would strengthen the latter, since, as we have often said, Galileo will be and should always be, compatible with the GPS, both should be mutually strengthened, and, in the event of the failure of either of them, the other should serve as an alternative for all users.
It only remains for us to see whether or not there is political will and I believe that this is one of those occasions which will demonstrate whether or not there is political will to move towards a Europe which counts in the world.
The ball is in the Ministers' court and we hope that they decide that there is that will.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.35 p.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, with regard to yesterday' s vote on the Olsson report, Paragraph 1, second part, states that I abstained from the vote.
I actually voted against.
I would appreciate it if this were corrected.
We take note of how you voted, which will be corrected.
Due to an error, the proposals of the Conference of Presidents on the appointment of Members of Parliament to bureaux of delegations to joint parliamentary committees do not appear in yesterday' s Minutes and they will, therefore, be included in today' s.
(The Minutes were approved)
Mr President, I wish, on the record, to thank France and Belgium for the guard on the buildings having now been markedly stepped up.
Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig. We take note of your observation.
Mr President, at the last sitting, we were all horrified at the possibility that Safiya Husseini might be executed in Nigeria.
I was going to ask for the floor, but Mr Corrie asked for it and I felt that he was representing me when he asked the President to intervene.
There is currently a mobilisation in my country, because it appears that the execution has been brought forward to this Saturday.
This horrifies us even more, because the case of this woman, like that of many others, is a display of savagery.
It is horrendous that a woman is going to be executed for having had a daughter, which is her fifth child, whatever the circumstances of the child' s birth.
We should make a final effort to prevent this execution which the authorities have brought forward to this Saturday in an attempt to avoid the international pressure on them not to carry out what I consider to be a murder.
Mr President, I would ask you to make the appropriate representations.
Mrs GonzÃ¡lez, the whole House shares your feelings and, as far as our institution is able, we will take all possible measures to ensure that such an atrocity cannot be carried out.
Mr President, I should like to make a comment on today' s agenda.
It strikes me that today' s debates will finish around 5.30 p.m., while the votes will not start until 6.30 p.m.
We have had this situation for a long time now.
It means that for many of the Members, it is just too late to return home at the end of the debate, and they therefore have to stay on until tomorrow, or return home sooner.
In my view, it is an excellent thing that we are here, even if we have to burn the midnight oil as far as I am concerned, if we have something to discuss.
If that is not the case, then we should not be required to sit here drinking coffee for an hour.
I would therefore ask you if you could perhaps put it to the President to see whether this problem can be solved in such a manner that Members need not at any rate stay on any longer than is necessary.
Yes, Mr Maaten, but we have an agenda established.
Within the bounds of this agenda, we will try to take your concerns into account as far as possible.
Women's rights and equal opportunities in Mediterranean countries
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0022/2002) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on EU policy towards Mediterranean countries in relation to the promotion of women's rights and equal opportunities in these countries (2001/2129(INI)).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is a political vision and a vital project for the EU.
But it is not just a sound method of promoting its economic interests; the main objective is to create an area of peace, security, stability and prosperity.
The history of European unification teaches us that, unless there is prosperity for all, men and women alike, there can be no zone of peace and stability.
At present, the role of women in this process of cooperation is marginal or focused on the economic sector, with negligible results as regards improving their standard of living, whereas our committee believes that such a political vision should consider women to be instrumental in promoting cohesion, peace and sustainable development.
The aim of this own initiative report is to assess policy to date, to urge the European Union to implement all the necessary policies to promote the social, political and economic rights of women in the Mediterranean and to urge the partner countries to assume their responsibilities and rise to the challenges inherent in this objective by all possible means.
Assessing the situation is no easy task, because there are considerable variations from one country to another.
There is a lack of statistical data broken down by gender, an absence of studies by the European Commission and the national governments effectively evaluating the impact of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on the promotion of women' s rights and a special regional Mediterranean programme has yet to be applied.
Generally speaking, unemployment also affects women with a university education and illiteracy is on the increase.
Early marriage and other entrenched customs mean that girls often drop out of school.
There is evidence of entrepreneurship in the Maghreb, but the lack of financing and credit facilities tends to block women's initiatives.
Violence, poverty and poor health among women are also commonplace, as is their absence from or under-representation in decision-making posts and, hence, their absence when Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is being negotiated and planned.
Tradition and religious stereotypes affect legislation, the ratification of international agreements and the application of such agreements.
Our committee calls for the effective implementation of what has already been laid down in the Barcelona Declaration regarding progress towards democracy and respect for human rights and for the gender dimension to be incorporated in the three pillars of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
It also calls for association agreements to incorporate an explicit provision on protection forwomen's' rights and also to provide for a policyfor monitoring suchprotection.
We are delighted that the study and the first regional Mediterranean programme for women have already been decided and we call on the Commission to take a global political approach, rather than confining the programme to vocational training, and to provide all the tools needed so that the issue of sexual equality can be dealt with in the broadest possible context, as it is in the countries of the European Union which apply this principle.
The European Commission and the Commissioner, who is present here, are experienced in drawing up and applying this sort of programme in the Member States and candidate countries and we believe that this experience will stand them in good stead when it comes to drawing up the regional Mediterranean programme.
Similarly, our committee is in favour of supporting women's organisations in the partner countries and of networking them with women's organisations in the Member States of the European Union.
We predict even greater potential for cooperation with women's organisations and social agencies in the candidate countries and the Balkans because the entire region is responding to the challenge of stability and peace by mobilising civic society.
In addition, having noted that the European Investment Bank has no budget for financing and supporting women's activities, we are in favour of a study into the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank for the Euro-Mediterranean zone because we feel that this will give women and women's organisations a chance to develop and obtain facilities and credit.
We are also in favour of setting up a database and observatory to monitor this progress and the compilation of data used to assess and plan future policy.
We also paid close attention to the problems of women immigrants from these countries in the European Union and we call for the red tape and other obstacles to legal immigration into the Member States of the European Union to be lifted, because we believe that they result in poverty, marginalisation and the exploitation of human and, more specifically, women's lives.
These phenomena have been denounced repeatedly, both by our committee and by the European Parliament as a whole.
This report is the result of excellent collaboration with the other political groups and I should like to thank my fellow Members for their amendments and for working with us and to ask you to endorse the report in its entirety.
Mr President, Commissioner, as members of this Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, we are extremely concerned about the situation of women in the Mediterranean countries, which was so well described by Mrs Kratsa in her report.
Widespread illiteracy - especially in certain countries, as the percentages she presents indicate - early school leaving, without achieving a level of study which prepares them for later life, and a lack of participation in the labour market - especially amongst young women - are factors which, together with poverty and marginalisation, above all affect women in the majority of cases.
This is the case despite the cooperation agreements, which contain many clauses, but never make it very clear that the situation of women should be taken into account amongst the objectives, and that the promotion of women and their access to better levels of personal well-being and to the labour market must also be amongst those objectives, so that they can pursue their own professions.
In these areas, health problems are one of the most serious situations they face, not only through a lack of healthcare, but also because of a lack of prevention.
These problems affect the whole population in general, but particularly women.
This is particularly surprising, given that we know the MEDA programme has had problems in this House, because not even half of what was intended has been implemented.
The MEDA programme, which is aimed at cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean areas, in particular the Southern Mediterranean, would be a wonderful instrument for creating specific programmes for women, aimed at promoting the role of women and increasing the living standards of women, which would be an advantage to the whole population, since we all know how important women are in the least-developed societies and, in particular, in traditional societies, where women bear the greatest responsibility for the family which, furthermore, usually includes a large number of children.
By means of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum of Women Members of Parliament we are well aware of the situation of these women, and we know what they expect from Parliament and the European Union.
We therefore have the obligation to draw attention to these facts so that their needs may be met.
Mr President, this is unfortunately the story of a so far unfulfilled commitment, which I will comment on later.
I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa, for being so willing to incorporate all of those amendments and issues which we in the Socialist Group have wanted to raise in order to supplement this excellent report.
In reality, the work in committee has been a complete collaboration between all the groups, and I hope that the House will reflect this in its vote this morning.
We have managed to achieve compromises on almost all aspects of a problem which has become very serious, because it affects the great majority of women in the associated countries of the Mediterranean.
It is true that there are slight differences between the various countries, but, in general, the situation of women in these countries is of great concern: illiteracy, early school leaving, unemployment, violence against women and health problems, originating from their reproductive health and the lack of adequate services for women.
The report exhaustively describes all these situations.
The European Union and the Member States must renew their commitment to the women of the Mediterranean countries.
In very many cases, cooperation agreements do not fulfil the commitment to deal with the special situation suffered by these women.
It is what we call "the transverse introduction of the gender perspective", because the situation suffered by women is not the same as the situation of men and therefore it is necessary to analyse what this situation is from the outset, in order to provide the tools necessary to resolve it.
Unfortunately, the regional programme within the framework of the MEDAs has once again been delayed and therefore this report is going to see the light of day long before this regional programme is implemented.
I hope that by then we can take up the fundamental ideas contained in this report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot continue to lament the situation suffered by women in many countries of the world, especially in this region which is so close to us, without taking action.
It is an urgent issue and we must promote the necessary mechanisms in order to ensure that the lives of women in these countries really becomes better and easier.
We must restate this commitment because there is no more time and we have to act.
Mr President, there is of course a tendency for its only to be women who take part in the debate whenever we have issues concerning women on the agenda.
I should therefore like to begin by saying that there are in fact two men from my group who have submitted to Parliament an appeal for equality that will also be forwarded to the President.
This appeal, entitled 'Enough is enough' , calls upon all the groups to consider what real progress they have made with equality and actively to take initiatives to improve the situation.
Next, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her brilliant report, which deals very well with an area in which some time needs to be devoted to the position of women, and I would pick up on a couple of individual points which I should like to emphasise.
First of all, I think it is incredibly important that we should acquire statistics, and I would urge the Commission to look at how we can improve the statistical base, for any discussion about women, men and inequality is a non-starter if we do not have the necessary statistics.
Whether there is to be a supervisory body or data bank, or whatever, is less important.
What is crucial is that we obtain statistics.
The second thing is that, in my view, it is entirely right - and this is also related specifically to this appeal - that the Commissioner should ensure that women participate when the association agreements are negotiated.
We are well aware that we very often only have men around the negotiating table.
When that is the case, women have already been reduced in status, and their position does not become a topic of central concern.
The third thing I should like to highlight is the issue of programmes.
It is crucially important to investigate what practical programmes we can offer to secure better education for women so that they themselves will also be in a position to do more to promote equality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens and European Free Alliance congratulates Mrs Kratsa on her excellent report.
I should also like to emphasise that we were pleased with the constructive manner, namely by cooperation between the groups, in which this report came about.
We concur with the rapporteur' s view that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is, politically speaking, of crucial importance for Europe.
Not only is this cooperation a safe way of promoting Europe' s economic interests; its key objective is to establish an area of peace, security, stability and welfare.
In order to accelerate this cooperation, a better understanding between the European peoples and the peoples of the partner countries is necessary, as well as an active mainstream society which is capable of taking part in this process.
In all of this, women occupy a key position.
They must be encouraged to acquire their own political identity and for this purpose, they must be given the opportunity, via education and awareness-raising, of making up for an unfair disadvantage that has built up over the centuries.
Women must no longer solely be regarded as mothers, no matter how important their role in bringing up children may be.
They must also be seen - provided they gain access to education - as fully-fledged partners in the labour market and in politics.
With a view to enlargement, women from the South must conclude a solidarity pact with women of the North, and they need to support each other in their justified demands.
In this respect, Europe should function as a driving force.
Our Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, headed by an inspiring chairperson, Mrs Karamanou, has an important role to play in this.
Mr President, I feel that this whole report - for which I thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - lacks something, that there is a taboo throughout, that there is a word it avoids mentioning. I understand the sensitivity of the subject but, if we do not mention this word, we will not be able to address the root of the problem or cooperate with groups of women who are fighting in these countries for their freedom.
The missing word is 'religion' , in other words Islam and the political abuse of Islam by the ruling power.
