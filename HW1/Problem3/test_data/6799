Pakistan is facing turbulent times and we must stand with it.
Just one further point.
I have real concerns regarding the way in which what actually happens in this House is being distorted by some sections of Pakistan's media in their reporting, particularly the news channel GEO.
This House has always argued for a free and fair media.
We stand by that and I ask them: please do not abuse the freedoms we hold dear.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I understand very well the concern shared by many, including you and Bernard Kouchner, to send an election mission to Pakistan.
It is actually one of the only ways left to us of exerting pressure on Mr Musharraf, but we should realise that this observation mission would take place under very special conditions.
We usually study and make observations before, during and after.
Regarding what has happened before, we already know how many things have been rigged.
Benazir Bhutto, with Mr Latif Khosa, had written a 160-page report on the possible rigging of these elections, particularly using computers, a report that she was going to give to two American congressmen the evening of the day she died.
Do we currently have the ability to check for computerised rigging in election observation missions?
If not, we could then decide that even though the 'before' was more than a little dubious, the 'during' has been regular even if there has been fraud.
Consequently I would ask for a very special observation mission, and I ask that we do not declare these elections to be democratic when we cannot check this.
(RO) Benazir Bhutto repeats the tragic destiny of her family, started by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
The assassination of Mrs Bhutto was intended to put an end to the democratisation of Pakistan and to undermine the stability of this country which, as we should not forget, is our main ally in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan.
Let me remind you that 25 European Member States currently have civilian or military representatives in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani army is involved in important operations for maintaining a military balance on the Afghan border, particularly in the provinces of Zabol and Helmand, where we are represented mainly by British, Lithuanian, and Romanian troops.
In this respect, it is very important to discuss responsibility for Mrs Bhutto's assassination, it is very important to discuss the democratisation process and its continuation, but it is equally important to discuss the issue of maintaining a military balance on the Afghan border and who might act as guarantor of this balance, because, Mr President, any failure in Afghanistan owing to instability in Pakistan would be a disgraceful moment for the free, democratic world that we stand for.
Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to reply to Mr Howitt under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, because he was incorrect in what he stated.
I was referring to the Indian State and the Pakistani State and the governments of both countries - not the peoples of the countries or the people of descent of those countries who live within the Member States of the European Union.
I was referring to the polities, not the people, so I would like Mr Howitt to withdraw his comments.
I can give you thirty seconds to conclude.
That is very kind but I think I have already said it all.
I was just simply stating that in my speech, I was referring to the fact that India is a secular democracy which respects human rights, does not shut down the media, does not actually persecute Christians or Ahmadi Muslims, and allows the people to express their views and practice their religion.
Regrettably, Pakistan, over the last 50 or so years, has had troubled periods of military dictatorship and repression of religious minorities and ethnic minorities.
That is to do with the state and the governments, not the peoples of either country.
Similarly, I do not in any way doubt that people of Pakistani and Indian descent in London, which I represent, would share EU values.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I will be brief.
There were a few questions regarding the investigation, several calls for an independent or international investigation and a few questions for the Council regarding its opinion.
I would like to stress that the Council did not discuss this question, so we cannot talk about the Council's position.
However, I can express the firm belief of the Presidency that the investigation will be carried out in accordance with international standards.
In this respect, we are pleased that at least one Member State, the United Kingdom, is already cooperating by providing appropriate expertise to the appropriate Pakistani authorities.
Regarding the elections, I would like to remind you of the statement published by the Presidency on 3 January of this year, where special emphasis was placed on the need to do everything at this time to maintain, strengthen and continue the process of democratisation and the democracy and democratic process in Pakistan.
In this connection, I would like to welcome again the European Commission's decision to reinforce the election observation mission in Pakistan, and I would like to repeat our appeal to the Pakistani authorities to use the remaining time leading up to the election to improve the situation and the conduct of the elections.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me begin by making some general remarks following this very interesting debate.
I know that some will always argue that stability and democracy are somehow incompatible in Pakistan.
Let me say I think that, without a return to democratic governance and the consolidation of fully accountable civilian institutions, there cannot be enduring stability in the country and the extremists will be the main beneficiaries.
For that reason, it is very important that we are there, that we accompany this country to more progress.
Even though there was this terrible tragic death of Benazir Bhutto and of many other victims, I continue to believe that Pakistan has a chance to make real progress towards stability and a more inclusive form of democracy by electing a new government which enjoys broader popular legitimacy.
For this to happen, the elections will have to be democratic and transparent.
This is a crucial time for Pakistan when President Musharraf should demonstrate to his country and to the world that he is committed to ensuring that these elections will be held democratically and transparently, in accordance with international standards.
What are the best conditions for carrying out elections?
Other than political and security conditions, as I have already outlined in my opening remarks, the following key elements need to be there for a proper election environment.

Firstly, the election administration to operate in a transparent and consultative manner to promote confidence among voters; secondly, that all polling station results and all levels of result consolidation are publicly displayed; thirdly, the counting and tabulation process needs to be fully open to scrutiny; fourthly, media freedom and, fifthly, an independent framework for a complaints and appeals procedure.
Concerning the public publishing of polling stations, it is well known that they will be the same polling stations as the last elections.
So that is clear.
Concerning the question that some voting lists have been destroyed, we know that there were some individual cases, but, fortunately, they were all stored on CDs with the Electoral Commission and the destroyed ones will be restored.
Therefore, they will be available.
Concerning independent exit polls, this is not an essential element for the elections.
However, it is increasingly the practice in many countries that this should also be there.
These are some of the detailed matters:
Let me now turn to the investigations.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, an investigation is under way in the country, which is being assisted by Scotland Yard.
We should await the outcome of that investigation and we should also trust that, with its experience, Scotland Yard will be able to help the Pakistani authorities.
Of course, it will be necessary to give them full access and support in doing that job.
After the elections, there might be a role then for an international group of eminent persons, but first we have to see what the inquiry will bring.
I think it is too early to take a decision now.
There was only a brief discussion in the Council working group, which was not conclusive.
Having said that, let me also say that it is highly important to help Pakistan in its fight against terrorism, and all the other requests mentioned in the debate, such as the release of all detainees, will be crucial.
I also stated very clearly that for a country like Pakistan it is important that there is a better focus on education.
We have been doing that for some time, and it will take time - we are there for the long haul.
But if we want democracy, this is something where we really have to make a difference and, therefore, I would like to maintain my cooperation projects, particularly in the most difficult areas, i.e. the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, Waziristan and so on.
I would again like to say that with Mr Gahler, your colleague, the Chief Election Observer, I think we have a person who has already shown in those very difficult days in Pakistan how responsibly he has been taking on these things, with 52 long-term observers and with 11 people of a core team who are looking at all the detailed questions of the election observation mission.
It will be a very specific one and it will be a good opportunity for you to tell President Musharraf yourself what you think.
Therefore, it is good that you see him in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
- (CS) Mr President, may I please ask you how a decent woman should draw attention to herself by means of the 'catch-the-eye' method when she is sitting at the far end of the House?
I would like to know whether I have been included in the list, or how ladies should go about it here.
Mr President, on a point of order, I was probably the first person to apply this afternoon under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure.
I do not know why you denied me the opportunity to speak.
Indeed, you gave an extra opportunity to one of my colleagues who had already spoken in the debate.
You then gave him more time!
I had no disagreement with what he said.
It was just the procedure that you followed, and I think it was quite wrong that you denied me the opportunity to speak.
I wanted to make the point that we need a stable and reliable government in Pakistan.
?- Mr Van Orden, I was informed that you had already spoken today under the catch-the-eye procedure and, therefore, having regard to the rules which were drawn up to ensure that Members' speeches covered as broad a spectrum as possible, I took my decision which obviously left you out this time.
I would, however, remind you that there will be other occasions when you will have the opportunity to speak.
In any case, you have been placed on the list and that will certainly be respected.
We must continue, otherwise we shall not have time for questions.
I am sorry, but we cannot continue this dialogue.
Therefore, the next item is questions to the Council.
Mr President, what you have just said is incorrect.
The previous 'catch-your-eye' opportunity was because there was no one else that wanted to catch the eye, so it seemed to be an opportunity.
I had specifically asked to speak in this Pakistan debate.
I put it in writing and I indicated throughout the debate that I wanted to speak.
There was no excuse, therefore, for denying me that opportunity, and I had important comments that I wanted to make.
I am afraid that I am very disappointed in the way that you have conducted this particular meeting.
Your protest is noted, Mr Van Orden.
Question Time (Council)
The next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2008).
The following questions have been submitted to the Council.
Subject: Youth Working Party
How does the Council intend to implement its priorities in the youth field which were presented at the Council's Youth Working Party in December 2007 and in particular the role of volunteering in this area?
President-in-Office. - (SL) With your help we will certainly succeed more easily.
Regarding the answer to the question by Ms Harkin, I would firstly like to draw attention to the Council's latest initiative relating to her question.
It concerns the resolution on voluntary youth activities adopted by the Council on 16 November 2007.
The purpose of this latest initiative is to confirm and consolidate the suitability and validity of common aims concerning voluntary youth activities which were defined back in 2004.
In addition, this initiative stresses the intersectorial and transversal character of voluntary activities and the importance of encouraging companies to support such youth activities.
In principle, the result confirmed the guidelines for action with which the Member States should comply in invigorating the realisation of common aims in the area of voluntary youth activities.
The resolution invites the Member States to choose from the above-mentioned guidelines for action, by September of this year, those on which they intend to focus particularly, and to define national strategies and concrete measures for the implementation of those guidelines.
Consequently, the Presidency is convinced that the issue of voluntary youth activities will remain among the priority political tasks of the Council and the Parliament.
We are also relying on the Member States to complete the scheduled activities pursuant to this resolution by the given deadline, i.e. by September of this year.
Mr President, my thanks to the Slovenian Presidency for its answer.
President-in-Office, I too wish you well at the start of your Presidency.
I am pleased to see that you are following on from the Portuguese Presidency - and indeed into the French Presidency - with your emphasis on volunteering, and in particular on youth volunteering.
I hear what you say about Member States responding by September, but in the mean time, throughout the next six months of your Presidency, I believe you are looking at issues like youth inclusion and education to improve the employability of young people through volunteering, and looking at intercultural exchange.
I just wanted to ask specifically if you have any plans at all to further inter-generational volunteering.
Older people have a lot more time on their hands - we are living longer - and the whole aspect of inter-generational volunteering offers many positive opportunities.
Do you have any initiatives on that?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Ms Harkin, at this moment I cannot offer you more concrete or more specific initiatives.
We have concentrated on implementing the adopted resolution.
It may be proper to invite the Member States at the appropriate time, i.e. to remind them of the set deadline.
You are right: a range of activities in other areas will in any case offer an opportunity for additional topics and for the additional incorporation of issues regarding voluntary activities, including in the intergenerational sense.
One of those activity channels is certainly an intercultural dialogue.
In any case, we will consider your remark, i.e. we will take it into consideration when planning our activities in the next six months.
- (LT) I would like to enquire about other measures to protect young people from addiction.
In Parliament we discussed a European Commission strategy to combat alcohol-related damage.
This is particularly damaging to young people.
What measures besides voluntary activity could reduce that damage and protect young people from addiction?
Does Slovenia have any experience of this?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Certainly, care for the young will be one of the important topics of the Slovenian Presidency, particularly within the framework of the Lisbon strategy, which is a strategy for increasing growth and creating jobs.
The Slovenian Presidency will pay particular attention to the issues of youth, especially in the context of education and their qualification for more effective inclusion in the labour market.
This is all I personally know in detail of the more specific initiatives which the Slovenian Presidency is planning for its term of office.
On the other hand, there is a whole range of activities in the area of health and the problem of the fight against alcoholism.
I am convinced that, within this framework, appropriate attention will be paid to protecting the young from alcohol abuse.
Subject: Multilateralism and bilateral agreements
Does the Council believe that the proliferation of bilateral trade agreements being signed by the USA, the EU and other international players is compatible with the multilateral principles which underpin the World Trade Organization?
President-in-Office. - (SL) The European Union is committed to multilateralism in many forms, including the World Trade Organisation, which in our view is an excellent example of a multilateral organisation.
Many decades prior to the actual founding of the World Trade Organisation, Europe called for the creation of such an organisation for trade.
Later, the European Union had a key role in the creation of the World Trade Organisation within the Uruguay round of negotiations.
Actually, if I may say so, it had a key role in that last round of the negotiations, which is why the support the European Union gives to multilateralism in trade cannot be doubted.
Similarly, the EU had a key role when the agenda for development was adopted in Doha at the 4th Ministers' Conference of the World Trade Organisation in 2001.
During the negotiations which followed, the European Union purposely decided to direct all resources and political will to concluding that round of negotiations.
Prior to that round of negotiations or at the time of the actual negotiations, there were no parallel negotiations concerning bilateral trade agreements.
In October 2006, the European Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a report entitled "Global Europe, competing in the worldâ.
The report discusses recent changes resulting from the globalisation process.
It offers suggestions for the European Union's response to that process on the basis of the updated Lisbon strategy, especially in respect of trade policies.
On the basis of the report, the European Parliament adopted a resolution and the Council made decisions.
The Council's decisions clearly show that all future bilateral agreements on free trade are going to form the basis of future multilateral negotiations and, what is possibly even more important, they will be complementary to the World Trade Organisation platform.
Under the terms of the negotiation directives adopted by the Council in the spring of 2007, negotiations on free trade agreements were started with the member states of ASEAN and with India and Korea.
Those negotiations are ongoing and each individual decision will be finalised in due course.
(ES) Mr President, I think that the Slovenian Presidency responded correctly to the question I asked, with its typical clarity, and I am grateful for the attentiveness shown.
I have an additional question relating to the relative failure of the Lisbon Summit with the African countries.
It appears that some African countries agreed with the European Union's proposals and others did not.
Based on the disagreements seen in Lisbon, does the Council Presidency think that it will be necessary to continue with this policy of differentiation?
In other words, are we going to insist on multilateralism, or do you think that the Lisbon Summit will force us to continue further along the road of bilateral agreements with different countries, for example, in the continent of Africa?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Our commitment to multilateralism continues.
I would like to stress two points, should any bilateral agreements be concluded.
Firstly, the agreements in question are complementary to the multilateral platform, and secondly, by the nature of things, the agreements in question have a bridging character until we manage to resolve these issues within a multilateral framework, the World Trade Organisation, this being the European Union's preferred framework for resolving such issues.
- (DE) Mr President, my question is as follows: how will increased food and energy prices affect the WTO negotiations?
We do know that the biggest stumbling block so far has been subsidies and the Farm Bill in the United States and that Europe has of course suffered under increased world market prices.
Are there new opportunities here for adjusting quotas and duties accordingly?
Is the Slovenian Presidency planning an initiative for bringing the WTO negotiations to an end?
(ES) Mr President, I agree with the Presidency that we should prioritise or attach greater importance to multilateral agreements than to bilateral agreements but, in the meantime, it is now many years since the Uruguay Round began, and the Doha Round before that, and the World Trade Organization is not reaching any serious conclusions, or at the very least it is putting it off too much.
In the meantime, the United States, for example, has concluded free trade agreements with various South American countries.
I would like to ask about this: what is the Council's view regarding the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which has been so long awaited?
President-in-Office. - (SL) The ever-increasing cost of energy, especially fuel, and of food is a global problem and therefore also a problem for the European Union.
It will most certainly affect relations among those participating in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation.
In that sense it might affect the adaptation, i.e. adjustment, of certain positions.
At the moment, from the perspective of the Slovenian Presidency, it is difficult to speculate on the nature of those effects, but they are very likely and must be expected to arise.
The Slovenian Presidency is not planning any initiatives of its own, but we will study and support appropriate initiatives coming from the Commission, which is of course responsible for the operational management of this process.
As regards the fate of multilateral negotiations so far, the Slovenian Presidency is one of those who regret the fact that there is still no multilateral agreement within the World Trade Organisation.
We will continue striving to bring it to fruition.
In this context, we will debate the trade agreement with the Mercosur countries as well, which also present an opportunity for discussion at the fringes of the summit between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
We are planning a special meeting between the European Union troika and the Mercosur countries, which will take place in May at the fringes of the summit between the EU and the LAC countries in Lima, Peru.
Subject: Measures to promote family-friendly policies
What measures will the Council take to promote family-friendly policies and how does it intend to support the European Alliance for Families decided on by the Council in March 2007?
President-in-Office. - (SL) The European Union should take advantage of the decisive contribution offered by the European exchange of good practice, in view of the fact that it is the Member States which are responsible for the shaping of appropriate and sustainable family policies.
These exchanges may reinforce social cohesion and in that way contribute to the realisation of the Lisbon strategy objectives, among others.
Therefore, the Presidency is of the opinion that the Alliance for Families is a very useful forum for the exchange of opinions and good practices, as mentioned above.
The Presidency is also convinced that the Alliance for Families reflects the obligation of the European Union and its Member States to discuss, in the light of demographic changes, the issues relating to family-friendly policies.
The Alliance enables the Member States to exchange information and experiences and in that way to help each other in the search for appropriate political responses.
At the same time, the Presidency is of the opinion that there is no need for any new structures at the European level, but we will strive to capitalise on the existing instruments and structures.
Last May the Council adopted extensive decisions on the practical working of the Alliance for Families.
The Council prepared these decisions together with the Member States, thereby respecting the important role of the Member States in this area.
The Council re-emphasised its commitment to the Alliance for Families through the decisions relating to the balanced roles of men and women, recently adopted on 5 December 2007.
- (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Slovenian Presidency for their reply and to ask, in addition, what specific exchanges of technological experience it has discovered so far and who is responsible for the management of these provisions of technical assistance.
President-in-Office. - (SL) These changes are implemented not by the Presidency but through the Alliance for Families.
That is why I do not have the details you are asking about.
However, I may enquire and inform you later.
Mr President, I would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency the best of luck at the start of their Presidency and their first Question Time.
Concerning the question raised by my colleague, three things immediately arise with regard to family friendly policies.
Firstly, children and the rights of children too often are seen as separate from what should be family policy.
Secondly, the whole issue with regard to how we actually encourage - we all have the idea of balancing work and family life - greater participation within family life.
Thirdly, most importantly of all, those people that are forced out of their homes because of migration or being refugees and also the issue of family reunifications.
Are there any proposals coming from the Slovenian Presidency with regard to that?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to reiterate that the Slovenian Presidency is placing particular emphasis on youth employment, especially for young parents.
This is part of the answer to the question.
The Presidency will pay special attention to creating new opportunities for the harmonisation of work and family life: shorter working hours, flexible forms of work, exercising of fathers' rights, and so on.
Another special area is the stimulation of intergenerational solidarity.
This is a particularly topical idea, especially in those regions where the older generation already represents the majority, which is the case in most of Europe.
Of course, such an incentive will only be effective if it is supported by policies covering different spheres of activity that will stimulate the positive aspects of social life.
In short, there is a whole range of measures which are being planned in various fields of EU activities and which are important for stimulating family-friendly policies.
It would be difficult for me to list all these activities, but they can be found among the many spheres of activity planned by the Slovenian Presidency.
I have just mentioned some of the fields concerned.
Thank you for your reply.
I am really pleased to hear that the Slovenian Presidency is particularly interested in putting forward family-friendly policies.
You yourself mentioned demographic changes.
Of course, because of the fact that we are living longer, it will mean an increased need for carers.
Most carers tend to be family carers.
You spoke about exchange of best practice.
We have competence in the area of employment, for example.
While most carers are unpaid, in that particular area, does the Slovenian Presidency have any initiatives to put forward on the issue of carers and, in that context, family-friendly policies?
President-in-Office. - (SL) No, I do not think that at this moment we are considering a concrete suggestion aimed at protecting the interests of the category of people you are talking about.
However, your question gives cause to consider whether that should be one of the fields.
Naturally, as the Presidency, we are prepared to give it some thought.
Subject: Initiatives by the Slovene Presidency regarding a new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy
A new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy is one of the initiatives adopted by the Slovene Presidency.
In view of the intrinsic link between these two policy areas in the context of EU strategy regarding energy autonomy and independence from neighbouring countries, can the Council indicate how it intends to structure the actions envisaged?
More specifically, how does it view future relations in the wider Balkan area in the field of energy?
President-in-Office. - (SL) In answering this question I will focus on the energy aspects, because that is how we understood the question.
In March 2006 the European Council adopted the energy policy for Europe.
The three principal political objectives of this policy are: firstly to increase the reliability of supply, secondly to secure the competitiveness of the European economies and the availability of energy at affordable prices, and thirdly to encourage environmental sustainability and strive to solve the climate change problem.
In accordance with these three policy objectives, within the scope of the external energy policy, the Council is cooperating closely with third countries on the implementation and further development of its energy programme.
The international energy policy is also one of the priority policy areas defined by The European Council in its decisions of March 2007.
The European Council stressed at that time that full advantage should be taken of the existing instruments to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the European Union with all suppliers.
As regards the western Balkans, the main existing instrument in the field of energy cooperation is the Energy Community Treaty.
The purpose of this treaty is to widen the energy market already existing in the European Community to include the countries of that region, i.e. to the countries of the western Balkans.
In addition, every Stabilisation and Accession Agreement concluded between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans foresees close cooperation in the area of energy.
The Council is also planning to take full advantage of the existing instruments of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
In short, when developing new initiatives in the area of energy, within the framework of relations between the European Union and third countries, we are striving to take full advantage of existing mechanisms in the case of the countries of the western Balkans.
I have already mentioned the Energy Community Treaty, and we will also use the existing mechanisms within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
- (EL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, please add my own wishes for a successful programming period for the Slovenian Presidency to the many that have already been expressed.
Today we shall debate the South Caucasus and the Black Sea.
I should like to ask the Presidency whether it intends to give priority to the institutionalisation of cross-regional cooperation between the European Union and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
I would specifically like to ask if intensive cooperation is planned in the energy sector, which is of vital importance for southern Europe.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for the supplementary question and for your good wishes.
Firstly, we fully agree with the assessment that the Black Sea basin is a very important region as regards the energy policy of the European Union, and above all as regards the external dimensions of the policy.
Secondly, in reply to your question whether it is possible to institutionalise relations with that region in the future, the answer is "yes, it is possibleâ.
Perhaps it could be done in the same way it was done with the countries of the western Balkans, i.e. with the Energy Community Treaty, or maybe in some other way.
In any case, the Slovenian Presidency considers the Black Sea basin, the Black Sea region and the Black Sea synergy as one of the important priorities within the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Mr President, may I complement the President-in-Office on the start of the Slovenian Presidency - and of course on the Slovenian Presidency tie, which is actually quite trendy.
My congratulations on that.
My question is more broadly on energy and that is, firstly, what is the Slovenian position on increasing nuclear inside the borders of Europe?
Secondly, what is the position of the Slovenian Presidency on increasing nuclear power on the neighbourhood side?
Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Slovenia on this day and to ask a question about this so-called North Stream gas pipeline.
As you know, this pipeline will connect Russia with Germany and some other European states; as you know, there are some problems concerning the environment, among others.
How does the Presidency evaluate this project?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for those supplementary questions.
As regards the use of nuclear energy, the Presidency is of the firm opinion that the decision on the introduction, further use and possible increase in the use of nuclear energy is entirely up to the Member States.
The Presidency will adhere to that position.
The second part of your question, Mr Stubb, related to Slovenia.
Slovenia is known to be one of the countries that uses nuclear energy.
There is a possibility, but no decision on the matter, that the use of nuclear energy will increase, i.e. that Slovenia will resort to it in the future as well.
As regards the North Stream project, it is not an EU project but a project of the directly participating countries.
The EU, the Council and the Presidency do not hold any positions regarding this particular case.
However, the EU holds a general position regarding projects which we, as the EU, would like to see realised.
In this respect I would like to mention above all the Nabucco gas pipeline.
This means that we have an opinion about this project because it is an EU project and our opinion is positive.
It is the opinion that the European Union, wishing to develop its energy policy at the European level, must continue with such projects, and, as the Presidency, we will support them.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: EU Peace-keeping Mission to Chad and Central African Republic (CAR) - short on helicopters and medical facilities
Can the Council say whether EU Member States have made further equipment available for the EU Peace-keeping Mission to Chad and the CAR including helicopters and medical supplies, so as to prevent any unnecessary delay in the deployment of Irish and other EU troops to this region?
According to General Henri Bentegeat, the head of the EU's Military Committee, the present mission still needs transportation in the theatre of operations including helicopters, medical support and logistical assets.
After the 'force generation' conference which took place in Brussels in November, have participating Member States and others come forth with extra equipment and troops?
Can the Council bolster the will among Member States to secure increased humanitarian aid to this region at EU level?
What is the Council doing in relation to Chad's own domestic instability given the recent gun battles in Eastern Chad on 26 November where the Chad army supposedly killed hundreds of rebel fighters?
How is the Council ensuring that the ceasefire gets back on track and that the peace deal between Chadian rebel groups and President Idriss Deby's government is restored?
Subject: EU peacekeeping mission to Chad
Can the Council state when the exact timing for the overall deployment of EU peacekeeping troops to Chad will take place and what the make-up of this troop deployment will be?
President-in-Office. - (SL) There have been already five conferences in Brussels about the shape of the forces: on 3 November last year, on 1 December last year and, most recently, a few days ago on 11 January this year.
As in every operation of this kind, the difficulty of shaping forces has again been demonstrated.
However, I am pleased to inform you that the fifth, i.e. last, conference on the shaping of the forces was successful and the European Union now has all the necessary capabilities at its disposal.
The decision on the starting date for the mission is expected to be adopted at the session of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council at the end of this month, 28 January 2008.
The initial operational capability is expected to be reached by the end of January or at the beginning of February.
It will include special units with some infantry units and a selection of technical, logistic and medical means to prepare the ground for major deployment.
General deployment of the peace forces is foreseen for May, before the start of the rainy season.
In this phase, the EUFOR units in Chad should amount to 4000 troops.
As regards the recent military conflict between the rebel and Chad governmental forces in western Chad, the Council deeply deplores the attacks by the rebels which led to the present fighting.
In the decisions of 10 December, the Council expressed its deep concern and called on the Chad government to cooperate with Sudan and Libya in creating the necessary conditions for reaching a lasting political solution based on the Sirta Peace Agreement.
The Council called on the Chad and Sudanese governments to fulfil the obligations they accepted in the Treaty of Tripoli and, in particular, to stop assisting the armed movements that are causing the instability of this region.
In view of the fact that the rebel forces are carrying out their actions from Darfur as well, the Council is reminding the Sudanese government of its responsibility to prevent armed groups from crossing the border with Chad.
The Council is aware of the fact that lasting results may be reached only through political solution, and it is therefore emphasizing the importance of the political agreement on consolidation of the democratic process in Chad, signed on 13 August last year.
I would just like to wish the Slovenians well in their Presidency over the next six months and to thank them for the reply.
In relation to the decision which was taken in mid-September by the EU Council to make an EU force available, I am a bit concerned that the timescale has been allowed to lapse.
I am just wondering whether there is a lesson that we should learn from this: that, before we give a commitment, we have the operation ready to move, because of certain things that have occurred since.
The second part of my question was in relation to humanitarian aid.
We gave humanitarian aid to Chad in 2007.
Are we going to increase that level of aid for 2008 now that we have a direct involvement in it over the next 12 months?
Mr President, I would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency every success for its term over the next six months, and also to wish a safe and successful peace-keeping mission to the EU forces that are going to Chad.
I am very proud to say that this mission is being headed by a fellow Irishman, Lieutenant-General Patrick Nash, and I wish him well also.
Does the Council agree that the EU peacekeeping missions must continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations and that the deployment of EU peacekeeping forces should take place only when a United Nations resolution supports such a mission?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Firstly, Mr Burke's question.
Certainly it is one more lesson in the long line of lessons which perhaps teach us mainly one thing: it is easier to adopt a decision in principle than to ensure its implementation.
Nevertheless, we were successful in that process.
It took a while, but I think that not only the agreement, but also the agreement regarding the implementation itself, was reached at the right moment.
As regards the second question, I would like to say that it is one of principle, which should of course be resolved pursuant to international law and the United Nations Charter.
Naturally, it is proper that peace-keeping and peace-making operations are about cooperation under the patronage of the United Nations.
This does not mean that the European Union is not also capable of independently adopting decisions regarding its own missions of a different nature.
- (PL) Mr President, this will be more of an opinion, I think.
Poland provides 10% of the armed forces in Chad, which means about 400 soldiers, so I would like to appeal to the Slovenian Presidency to do everything it can to ensure that this mission ends successfully.
It must be a well-prepared mission, one which is very well equipped, and we know that the initiator of this mission was France.
I would therefore like to ask Slovenia, as holder of the Presidency, to be very exacting with France, the leader of this mission.
Logistically, this has to be ... or rather, I would once again emphasise that Europe must not compromise itself.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Only to express gratitude to Poland and, of course, other countries that are contributing forces to this important operation.
Subject: Protection of EU citizens in Muslim countries
In November of last year, a British teacher was accused of insulting Islam while teaching in Sudan after allowing her class of seven-year-olds to name a teddy bear Mohammed.
If convicted she could face 40 lashes, a large fine or a jail sentence.
What can the EU do to give better protection to innocent EU citizens in Muslim countries who find themselves in terrible situations such as this?
President-in-Office. - (SL) The case referred to in Mr Mitchell's question is the case of a woman of British citizenship who was in a third country and came under the jurisdiction of the national legislation of that country.
On the basis of her citizenship, the above-mentioned citizen was guaranteed consular protection by the country in which she is a citizen.
As we know, the British citizen was released in the meantime and returned to the United Kingdom.
It follows from this that such cases are resolved through bilateral relations between the Member State in question and the third country.
Naturally, cases may arise where additional political measures are appropriate and where EU representatives are asked to get involved in matters of this kind and in resolving such bilateral issues.
In specific cases, this may lead to official statements and initiatives by the European Union.
I would like to reiterate that, in principle, as in this particular case, it is an issue which is usually resolved at the level of relations between the third country and the EU Member State of which the person is a citizen.
I thank the President-in-Office for the reply and wish him well in his Presidency.
The President-in-Office will no doubt be aware that every citizen of an EU Member State is also a citizen of the Union.
My expectation would be that, if an EU citizen was visiting some state where he or she could have his arm or leg amputated, then the Union would see the horror in such a thing.
Does the Union not also see the horror in somebody being treated in this way, potentially sentenced to 40 lashes and also perhaps a jail sentence?
Will the President-in-Office take steps to try to ensure that EU citizens visiting these regions are aware of the sort of cultural change they are entering into, and will the Presidency also try to ensure that the states we do business with expect us to expect of them better treatment for our citizens and for them not to be treated in this way?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you, Mr Mitchell, for your supplementary question.
It is a question of consular protection for citizens.
Such protection is still the domain of the Member States and it is up to the Member States to warn their citizens who are travelling to third countries about the dangers and traps they have to be aware of.
On the other hand, on the principle of solidarity we already have a guarantee of help from other Member States which have diplomatic, i.e. consular, representation in a third country and which guarantee consular protection for the citizens of other Member States of the European Union which do not have their own consulate in the country in question.
I think that is one important advantage of our Union.
I have already said that, if required, it is certainly very probable, most probable, possible that the Union will also be involved in resolving cases such as the one mentioned.
Luckily, in this case it was not necessary and the case was solved between the two countries, which we are happy about.
- (DE) President-in-Office of the Council, you have rightly pointed out that bilateral contacts can help in resolving problem cases such as these.
The Council has, however, signed the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights with the President of this House and the President of the Commission.
In it we refer to human dignity and the ban on degrading and cruel punishment.
Would it not therefore also be the Council's duty to assert this claim throughout the world on behalf of the European Union?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I repeat that it is still a duty of the Member States which possess the levers of consular protection.
However, it is clear that the European Union gives a framework within which the Member States - and I am going to mention the principle of solidarity again - help each other in this area on the basis of the principle of solidarity.
In any case, the Council, and I am sure other institutions, would not hesitate to do all they could at their level if the need arose.
In other words, that does not exclude the fact that for the time being this protection is offered by the Member States and does not exclude additional action being taken by an individual institution of the European Union.
What follows from the case presented in Mr Mitchell's question is only that the case was resolved between the two countries, although that does not mean that it would not have been tackled at a higher, even European level, had the need arisen.
Subject: Biodiversity and climate change
According to the IPCC fourth assessment report, during this century 'the resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded by an unprecedented combination of change in climate and other global drivers' (e.g. spread of infectious diseases).
The IPCC estimates that roughly 60% of evaluated ecosystems are currently utilised unsustainably and show increasing signs of degradation.
This alone will likely cause widespread biodiversity loss.
At the EU level, the Commission's Green Paper on Climate Change Adaptation reminds us that: 'approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species in Europe (assessed so far) are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5-2.5 degrees C'.
What concrete actions will the Slovenian Presidency take to prioritise the Gothenburg target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010, and to combat widespread biodiversity loss due to climate change and other global drivers?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I am convinced that Ms Doyle is familiar with the intention of the European Union to contribute to the ambitious outcome of the 9th Conference of the Signatories to the Biodiversity Convention.
It will take place in Bonn in Germany in May 2008, i.e. during the Slovenian Presidency.
The preservation of biodiversity is high on the list of priorities of our Presidency.
The Council had already stressed the urgency of continuous and committed efforts at all levels to reach the target of perceptibly slowing down the decrease in biodiversity by the year 2010, and at the same time to reach the target mentioned by Ms Doyle in her question and set by the EU at the session of the European Council in GÃ¶teborg.
In addition, the Member States are introducing concrete measures for implementation of the action plan to reduce the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond.
The plan makes provision for measures relating to biodiversity and climate change at the level of the European Union as well as at the global level.
In its efforts to reach the target to slow down the decrease in biodiversity by the year 2010, the Presidency stresses the need for synergy between policies and activities in the areas of climate change and biodiversity, especially in respect of biodiversity in fresh water and marine environments, as well as biodiversity in forests.
These targets, together with other targets for biodiversity preservation, have been set in the declaration entitled "Countdown to 2010â.
Meetings of Council working groups will be organised during the Slovenian Presidency.
One will be among experts in forestry, climate change and biodiversity, and another among experts in international marine policies, fisheries and biodiversity.
Equally, at the informal meeting of environment ministers in Slovenia in April, the biodiversity of forests will be presented as a challenge and an opportunity to prepare measures to alleviate climate change and to adjust to it at the European level.
The Slovenian Presidency will also strive to improve cooperation as well as the implementation of appropriate decisions in various environmental agreements at national and regional levels.
The European Commission amended its communication "Halting the Loss of Biodiversity by 2010 - and Beyondâ with the commitment to include the private sector in partnerships for the preservation of biodiversity.
Recently, in November 2007, there was a high-level conference in Lisbon which debated the economy and biodiversity within this framework.
The outcome of that conference, which included the Lisbon report on the economy and biodiversity, will be debated at the aforementioned 9th Conference of the Signatory Countries, which will take place in Germany during the Slovenian Presidency.
It will also be discussed at the 5th World Congress of the International Alliance for the Preservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which will take place in Barcelona during the French Presidency.
Thank you, President-in-Office, and best wishes for a very successful Presidency.
It is the countdown to 2010 that concerns me.
There is plenty of talk but no action in this area, and it is one of the great deceptions we have that we are actually going to show any change or any impact on the ground by 2010.
I mean, I agree with synergies between different policies, but protection of biodiversity can help limit atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations because forests, peat lands and other man-made ecosystems and habitats store carbon.
Do you think that monitoring change needs the best data available?
We need better information on the whole effects that climate change is having on Europe's biodiversity.
If we make any progress towards 2010 we have to improve the indicators and measurements we use to know exactly how serious the situation is.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Ms Doyle, thank you for your added comment.
I fully agree that we have to have the best possible indicators to establish the status of biodiversity.
The Presidency will take into consideration your comment on the need to think about the necessity to improve these indicators and will reflect on it.
2010 is really close: we have less than two years.
You are right that in a field such as biodiversity it is difficult to imagine that, especially after a period which seems not to have been used to its best potential, this short time that remains will be enough to reach the set targets, namely the slowdown in the loss of biodiversity.
However, this is not to say that it is impossible.
We will do our best.
Slovenia is one of the countries where biodiversity is of enormous importance because the level of biodiversity in our country is still high; this is well known, if for no other reason because of our bears, which we export to a large part of Europe.
In brief, you can rely on the Slovenian Presidency to do its utmost to reach the target, regardless of the fact that there is very little time left.
Could I just ask the Council to comment on the fact that the Commission is now reviewing the targets for biofuels, because what we thought might be good for climate change is now having unintended consequences when it comes to global food security, and indeed biodiversity.
Is this not one of the difficulties for us human beings in tackling climate change: that we may get it wrong?
President-in-Office. - (SL) This is proof that, perhaps, certain matters did not receive our due attention in the past.
It is clear that the totally unsupervised and unrestrained production of biofuels must have possible negative consequences for the environment, biodiversity, food prices, and so on.
I think it is fitting to devote special attention to that aspect too.
In other words, we should encourage the production and consumption of biofuels to reduce rather than increase the burden on the environment.
I think that should be a major guide for the Union in its policies to encourage the use of biofuels.
Subject: Moving beyond GDP
Could the Council indicate how it intends to work with the Commission proposal to move beyond GDP as an indicator of regional cohesion, and could it say whether it has arrived at any definitive measures to be included in the future, to provide a more accurate measure of a region's performance?
Mrs McGuinness takes responsibility for this question originally asked by Jim Higgins.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to apologise to Mr Higgins and Ms McGuinness for my answer, which cannot be anything other than very short, because the Council can only discuss these things on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
Such a proposal has not been put forward, nor has a proposal for any other changes regarding regional cohesion indicators.
Therefore, until such a proposal is made, the Council is unable to discuss it and take a position on any other regional cohesion indicators.
Mr President, can I apologise on behalf of Mr Higgins, who is unwell this evening and cannot be here.
I thank you for your short answer.
I presume this will be linked with plans to redefine disadvantaged areas in Member States as well.
Could I just suggest that, when you do have some information on some of the indicators, you might supply it to Mr Higgins.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I will try, thank you.
I reiterate that it depends primarily on the Commission and maybe, maybe, but really only just maybe, there will be an opportunity, but not necessarily, to consider the indicators as well as the review of the cohesion policy which is being planned by the Slovenian Presidency at the moment.
That depends on the Commission and not the Council.
Of course, we would be interested to know what will be the contribution of the Commission to the debate on the review of the cohesion policy, which is one of the important tasks for our Presidency.
- (DE) Mr President, even the European Parliament respects the Commission's right of initiative, as the Council has just expressed it.
However, we shall therefore always let the Commission know what we believe is particularly important.
Criteria such as unemployment or greater migration would certainly be subjects that could be introduced into the discussion here.
Because you talked about the Slovenian brown bears in the previous question, as a Styrian I would like to say thank you for this export and I hope that the open Schengen border will lead to even more immigration.
In terms of more accurate measurements of a region's performance, one must seriously question whether GDP is the right measurement of performance.
Has any consideration been given, or will you be giving consideration (as you have only been in office for a week), to measuring GDP versus GNP versus GNI?
The big difficulty at the moment is that we are not measuring like with like, so it is very hard to measure performance across different regions - and across different countries, it is not just across regions alone - because the bases or indicators are not standardised at the moment.
President-in-Office. - (SL) It would be very difficult for me to speak in the name of the Commission and I have no ambition to do so, because I would not be equal to the task.
However, it seems that, at least for the time being, the Commission has not yet found a better indicator than GDP.
I believe that, had the Commission found a better indicator, it would have proposed it.
I would like to repeat my previous remark that the cohesion policy review gives an opportunity to consider your question too.
There are going to be even more opportunities when the complete reform of the European Union budget is discussed, which, as we already know, will be done on the basis of the total analysis to be conducted by the European Commission itself in 2008 and 2009.
Subject: Investigation into care homes in Bulgaria
The BBC recently broadcast a documentary entitled 'Bulgaria's Abandoned Children' which depicted the shocking conditions experienced by the children living in a care home in Mogilino, Bulgaria.
The producer of the programme has publicly stated that this home is not the worst case in Bulgaria.
There is a perception that even though a problem evidently exists in relation to institutional care for children and young adults with disabilities, it does not appear to have been effectively addressed.
Given the EU's adherence to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the fact that we have just left behind the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, can the Council make a statement on this very sensitive matter?
President-in-Office. - (SL) The Council has not adopted any position on the particular case cited by Ms McGuinness.
Nevertheless, I can say with pleasure that on 5 December 2007 the Council adopted a resolution to continue with the European year of equal opportunities for all.
That was 2007, i.e. last year, which according to this decision, i.e. this resolution, will not be a one-year event but will continue.
Said resolution calls on the Member States and the European Commission to strengthen their efforts to prevent discrimination due to disability or for any other reason, to strengthen the fight against discrimination of this kind, to include the question of disability in all relevant policies and to continue the process of concluding, signing and ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.
With this resolution the Council is also calling on the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in the common challenges and look for a solution within the framework of the implementation of said convention, i.e. the UN convention.
Allow me to stress here that the Council and the European Parliament recently received a Commission report on the status of the disabled in the European Union, which included the European action plan for 2008 and 2009.
The Slovenian Presidency is of the opinion that this document should provide valuable guidelines for further endeavours in the enforcement of rights for the disabled, especially disabled children.
The Council is still studying this proposal by the Commission.
President-in-Office, thank you for your diplomacy.
I hope you will understand if I am not diplomatic, because I do not think you realise the extent of anger and upset, particularly in the UK and Ireland, when this documentary was shown.
I think - and I regret to say this - that if this was an animal welfare issue the Council would have a position on it.
We are talking about children who have no voice.
I really believe that it makes the EU look bad in the eyes of Member States and citizens of the European Union that we are slow to act when it comes to cases like this.
I think it would be wonderful and we would get a great reaction from our citizens if we were more swift to act, because this is an unforgivable story.
The pictures spoke for themselves.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I cannot and do not wish to go into the content of this affair, on which you, probably quite justifiably, have a strong opinion.
However, I would like to stress that, in the opinion of the Council, it is important to respect and take into consideration the division of competences between the Union and the Member States.
In this framework I may express myself only as a representative of the Council - and I am not being diplomatic here, but speaking within the limits of my competences and the competences of the Council, and of course out of respect for the movements within these frameworks.
President-in-Office, can I join in expressing disappointment at the inadequacy of your reply?
When Bulgaria was being considered for accession, the treatment of people in institutions was made a live issue.
But the mistake that was made was that, when in December 2006 we came to set the benchmarks - looking back upon how Bulgaria had matched its undertakings - mysteriously, this item was omitted from the benchmarks.
Why was that?
And can it now be reinstated?
If not, what other steps can you realistically take so that the Council and the Community quite properly can look at the flagrant breaches which are afflicting this sector?
The speaker is absolutely right: I thought the answer from the Council was not sufficient.
Before accession, we called on all Member States who wanted to come into the European Union to abide by European Union rules.
I know Bulgaria has signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, but it has not ratified it.
Can you put pressure on those countries that have not ratified that Convention to do just that?
I know the Bulgarian authorities are trying to address this problem, but we need to keep up the pressure.
President-in-Office. - (SL) I strongly reiterate that it is not within the competence of the Council, or even customary for the Council, to adopt a position regarding individual television programmes or their comments.
In no way does this diminish the enormity of the problem you are talking about.
However, I personally see the solution in what you said in your question, i.e. in the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.
That is precisely why, in my initial answer, I mentioned the resolution adopted by the Council in December 2007, which calls on the Member States to ratify said convention.
Subject: Negotiating date for Macedonia
Does the Council foresee the possibility this year, i.e. during the Slovenian or French Presidency of the Council, of setting a date for launching accession negotiations with Macedonia?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I still do not know; sometimes it switches itself on and sometimes it doesn't.
I apologise for these gaps.
Of course, the Council does not and cannot exclude the possibility cited by Mr Posselt in his question.
As we know, in December 2005 the European Council decided to accord candidate status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
In accordance with the Council decisions of 12 December 2005, i.e. a few days prior to the session of the European Council, the country had to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement fully.
The Commission has been preparing progress reports on this basis, and the 2006 and 2007 reports do not contain recommendations for the start of accession negotiations, the argument being that appropriate measures have still not been implemented.
In 2008 the Presidency is expecting the leadership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, from the entire political spectrum, to join forces in strengthening efforts to reach results in all the various fields where progress is needed, and, in view of the events in the country, especially the progress made over the last month, I would estimate that it should be possible this year to come a step closer to deciding on a date for the start of accession negotiations.
The Slovenian Presidency is very keen on it, very keen on that progress, but it does depend on the country itself and on its success in exercising the measures, as well as the progress of reforms.
- (DE) Many thanks for this very good response.
Allow me as an exception to make a personal preliminary remark.
In 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, I was at the independence celebrations in Ljubljana - as the only EU citizen, I believe.
I was also in favour of the Association Agreement during the war in Ljubljana which, thankfully, was brief, and later as rapporteur for Parliament.
I would simply like to say that today is a historic day for me.
I am very happy.
Please forgive the personal preliminary remark.
Now an even shorter question: do you believe that the naming issue between Macedonia and Greece is a bilateral issue, and can a bilateral issue have an impact on accession negotiations?
President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank Mr Posselt for his support since the days of our independence.
Actually, Slovenia has journeyed a long way, as was said by the President of the European Council this morning.
Regarding your question, it is basically a bilateral matter of the name.
However, we all know that for the resolution of this basically bilateral question, there is a mechanism, under United Nations patronage, involving a special representative, Mr Nimec, who is committed to mediating between both sides to bring about a solution.
Slovenia, i.e. the Slovenian Presidency, supports these efforts and expects both sides to cooperate in a constructive way in this process until a proper solution is found.
In the meantime, we are of the opinion that this question should not affect, let alone hinder, the integration of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into international organisations.
I have a question for the Slovenian Presidency.
I know it supports the view that we need long-term peace and stability in south-east Europe and the Balkans as a priority, and indeed economic development goes hand-in-hand with it, but in terms of Macedonia reaching the line to open negotiations on accession - the issue of the name apart (important though it is) - how does the Slovenian Presidency consider Macedonia would rate in comparison with other countries in that immediate area in reaching the accession line?
We want them all in, but some will be more prepared than others.
How do you rate Macedonia's chances for priority accession?
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you very much, Ms Doyle, for your supplementary question.
The Slovenian Presidency classifies countries in the western Balkan region according to the stage they have reached.
In this case, the most advanced country of the region is Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it is the only country which has been given candidate status.
Croatia is excluded because it should be in a different category anyway, namely in the expansion category, because it is already negotiating for membership.
I reiterate that, during our Presidency, we wish for every one of the countries, including the one in question, to make progress on its journey towards membership of the European Union, which will not happen soon, i.e. in a year or two, but will need more time and more effort.
The Slovenian Presidency has placed this issue among its highest priorities.
However, it is important to maintain the European perspective for those countries as well as their rate of progress towards this goal.
I repeat that, as the Presidency, we would be very pleased if progress were to continue during our Presidency.
I would like to repeat that this progress also depends largely on the countries of the region.
- (EL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on his very specific reply and, as a Greek MEP, I should like to say that we have a particular interest in all the Western Balkan States becoming members of the European Union as soon as possible.
The problem, however, needs to be resolved.
I would also like to say that Greece has made its good intentions clear and continues to do so daily in discussions on a compromise name.
In this sense, then, I would say that account needs to be taken of the position of a Member State that displays considerable goodwill in this regard.
President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for your comment.
The President of the Council mentioned this morning the important achievement of the Greek Presidency in 2003, when the Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans was adopted.
This Thessaloniki Agenda remains the foundation of the efforts of the Slovenian Presidency in its endeavour to integrate the western Balkans.
This is why we are particularly counting on the support of Greece in these efforts pertaining the countries of the western Balkans.
Question No 12 has been withdrawn.
Subject: Reduction in VAT rates for environmentally friendly technologies and products
Does the Council agree that Community legislation on value added tax (VAT) should be adjusted so that reduced VAT rates can also be applied to technologies and applications involving renewable sources of energy and energy yield efficiency in addition to existing provisions governing the consumption of electricity and natural gas?
Does a time schedule exist for taking the relevant decisions?
What moves should we expect from the Council in this matter, and when?
President-in-Office. - (SL) As we know, at its session of 4 December 2007 the Council adopted a decision to arrange for a discussion on the economic effect of reduced rates and whether reduced rates of value added tax are a suitable tool for achieving the targets of sectorial policies.
It was agreed that this question would be debated again at some point during 2008, not necessarily in the first half of the year.
At the moment, the Slovenian Presidency is searching very hard for the most effective approach to continuing the discussion about value added tax rates, which are not uniform.
As we know from the Commission report, this discussion started during the Portuguese Presidency.
In this period of reflection, which I hope will be as short as possible, we are unable to answer Mr Vakalis more precisely.
However, I would like to stress that this is an important question, which the Presidency is going to tackle with due attention.
- (EL) Mr President, I consider the reply to be satisfactory, and I would also simply like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on its successful start.
I wish it all the best with the rest of its Presidency.
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex).
That concludes Question Time.

A European strategy on the Roma (debate)
The next item is the debate on:
the oral question to the Commission by Jan Marinus Wiersma, Hannes Swoboda, Katalin LÃ©vai, Adrian Severin and Jan Andersson, on behalf of the PSE Group, on a European Roma strategy (O-0081/2007/rev. 1 - B6-0389/2007)
the oral question to the Commission by ViktÃ³ria MohÃ¡csi, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on a European Roma strategy - B6-0003/2008)
the oral question to the Commission by LÃ­via JÃ¡rÃ³ka, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on a European Community Action Plan on Roma - B6-0004/2008)
the oral question to the Commission by Roberta Angelilli, on behalf of the UEN Group, on a European Roma strategy - B6-0005/2008)
author. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office, many documents, including the 2005 Decision of the European Parliament on the Roma, the 2004 study by the European Commission, the report on Roma women by the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the EUROSTAT action plan of 2003 were clearly drafted in order to solve the untenable situation of European Roma.
Nonetheless, neither the Member States nor the European institutions have really moved forward in promoting the inclusion of the Roma, although it is in the interests of both the European labour market and European societies successfully to integrate Europe's most populous and fastest-growing minority.
The recommendation of the report presented last December by the high-level advisory group set up by Commissioner Å pidla was that a Community action plan should be created.
This action plan must be created, although much stronger and more genuine commitment is needed from the Commission in order to take effective, immediate measures.
This also applies to the European Parliament and civil society in many areas affecting the Roma.
The European Commission and Member States must instigate, fund, monitor and implement aid directly from Union sources for the most disadvantaged groups.
If the financial instruments of the European Union are drawn down, it must show the impact on equal opportunities of the given investment as a material and accountable criterion, that is to say, if development is funded from Union sources, it should be compulsory for bidders to carry out or implement an equal opportunities analysis and measures plan.
If the measures plan becomes a compulsory element of competitions in different development sectors and certain regions, this would contribute greatly to ensuring and encouraging equal opportunities for disadvantaged social groups and those that are falling behind.
It is also essential to create a pan-European crisis map, on the basis of which those areas of the European Union can be assessed where abject poverty and social exclusion most seriously afflict the Roma and non-Roma communities, and through which the European Commission, supporting the Member States, can start the work of desegregation, which the governments have been putting off for decades as a result of different political commitments.
It is important that the Commissioners who are directly or indirectly responsible for the integration and inclusion of minorities coordinate their activities through their education, employment, equal opportunities, regional and development portfolios and, developing into a technical working group, prepare the 2008 action plan for Roma affairs in cooperation with Parliament and civil society, and they must start implementing that plan as soon as possible.
Apart from the fact that we adopted a resolution in 2005 which we now see has in fact had a negligible impact, I also consider it important that dialogue should start between the parties as soon as possible, with the involvement of the Commission and civil society.
I also feel in any case that in 2008 we ought to see action and talks relating to the Roma that are organised by all parties.
I feel it is important and I undertake on behalf of the People's Party to instigate this during 2008.
Thank you.
author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning the report on an EU strategy on the rights of the child was adopted.
One of its priorities is combating poverty and discrimination.
On this point, we decided to devote a special paragraph to Roma children, who are often excluded from health and social provision and from schooling.
It is a well-known fact that a very high percentage of Roma children do not go to school, or attend only occasionally.
Many Roma children are actually forced to attend special schools, if not institutions for the disabled.
Available data show that in some Member States early school leaving by Roma children exceeds 60%.
It is clear that children who do not go to school, who are illiterate or in any case have an inadequate level of education or vocational training, are children who have no future, but are forced to beg or to work on the black market.
In any case, their fate is sealed: in the best-case scenario they will be condemned to poverty and social exclusion, while in the worst-case scenario they will be victims of organised crime.
It is worth bearing in mind, by the way, that the Roma population is very young, with approximately 45% of individuals aged under 16; for this very reason it would be extremely useful and important for the Commission to lay down specific, concrete actions for Roma children, particularly with reference to combating early school leaving and the promotion of appropriate, high-quality schooling.
Without a right to education there is no guarantee of equal treatment and, above all, no right to a future.
author. - (NL) Mr President, we too have put questions to the Commission, and I expect the Commissioner to answer them.
This evening, we are mainly discussing the efforts of the European Union - the European Commission - to tackle the problems of the Roma, a large group of whom became EU citizens a few years ago, and another last year.
These citizens are living in conditions that are in most cases unacceptable.
We are pleased that we are to receive a response from the European Commission in this House today.
We are also pleased that the European Council devoted attention to the situation of the Roma at the Brussels Summit, and asked the Commission to present more specific proposals for what the European Union itself can do to supplement the policy of Member States with large Roma communities, what we can do in the way of coordination and exchange of best practices, and how the available EU resources can be better deployed in those countries via the funds in order to do something about the situation of the Roma.
I say this particularly because, upon the accession of a number of countries - last year, and also in 2004 - we said, 'All right, come on in; one of the things we must do together is tackle the problems of the Roma.'
I myself was rapporteur for Slovakia, and I remember the Slovak Government making all kinds of promises, but I have some doubts about the effectiveness of the implementation of those promises.
This remains an important point.
We would also say that the Roma cannot be regarded as a typical national minority, such as the Hungarians in Slovakia or the Russians in the Baltic States.
They are a typical European minority, for which a special European policy could be developed, together with the Member States concerned, with a separate responsibility for the European Union - as, indeed, was recognised in the pronouncements of the Brussels European Council.
We would ask the Commission, in particular, to ensure greater coordination within the Commission itself.
How can we improve cooperation?
How can we give someone, possibly from the ranks of the Commissioners, central responsibility for Roma policy?
Maybe we should also look at the possibility of recognising the Roma as a kind of European minority in order to get around, to some extent, the principle of subsidiarity currently applicable to Member States' minority policy.
To conclude, I believe that everyone's intentions are good, but that better coordination and more action are required.
author. - (HU) Thank you very much.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that this Parliament drew attention to the lack of integration of the Roma back in 1983.
It also asked the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States in a Resolution of 1994 to do everything in the interests of the social, economic and political integration of the Roma.
As you will remember, in the Resolution adopted by Parliament in April 2005 we asked the Commission to adopt an action plan containing clear recommendations for the Member States and candidate countries relating to the economic, social and political integration of the Roma.
Again in November 2007 the matter of the social integration of the Roma was incorporated into the text of the Parliament's Resolution on freedom of movement, upon my recommendation, as a European-level Roma strategy.
We asked the Commission again to prepare immediately a European strategy for the social inclusion of the Roma, using the integration fund and structural funds.
In amongst all this, we know for certain that Roma children are still forced to study in segregated classes and in segregated institutions in at least ten Member States of the Union, and we, the Roma, are unjustifiably classed as disabled, put into a determined profession and labelled for all time.
Unfortunately it is well known in every Member State what slums and what terrible conditions the Roma live in.
I regret to state that we also know very well that the average life expectancy of Roma in every Member State is 15 years lower than the life expectancy of Union citizens.
We should repeat that the Roma are over-represented among the unemployed in every single Member State.
In amongst all this, unfortunately, not a single month goes by when there is not a racist attack against Roma in any Member State.
We know from the news - or we would not particularly have heard about it - that on the night of 4 January 2008, a slum in the Marconi district of Rome, with approximately 250 Roma living there, was set on fire, and then, three days later, also in Italy, Molotov cocktails were thrown at the local gipsy settlement in Aprilia, directly threatening the lives of several hundred people.
Racist motives were behind the attack in both cases.
There is no room for doubt, the calling to account is justified, there must be a proposal for a Resolution, there must be a European-level strategy, and every Member State must prepare an action plan for integrating the Roma.
Nobody is an exception, nobody can act as if there were no Roma in their own country - whether or not they recognise them - and then what has been said would not be true of any of the Member States of the Union, without exception.
Thank you.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka, Mrs Angelilli, Mr Wiersma and Mrs MohÃ¡csi for raising these issues, which I am dealing with on behalf of my colleague, VladimÃ­r Å pidla, because he is currently in China, and this gives us the opportunity to talk things through on this extremely important subject.
The past year has really shown that both the bodies of the European Union and the Member States themselves are intensifying their efforts to improve the situation of the Roma in the European Union permanently.
We have heard that this is necessary and I agree.
A few important steps have already been taken in this regard.
These range from the European Parliament's decision in 2005 to introduce the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All to the work of the high-ranking group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities and the European Economic and Social Committee as well as the conclusions accepted just recently by December's European Council, to which reference has just been made.
I should say that we cannot really shrug off the difficult issue of discrimination, as members of the Roma experience it, and their exclusion from society and from the labour market.
We have therefore taken the firm decision to use every instrument available to us, such as legislation, structural funds and information and awareness-raising campaigns, in order to improve this situation.
It is obvious that employment and social policy programmes and measures are not being adequately used to promote the social integration of the Roma.
We therefore need to concentrate all our efforts primarily on improving access to these measures with a targeted plan.
It goes without saying that a plan of this kind must be based on an authoritative and long-term commitment by the Member States and the efficient use of Community instruments and policies.
Allow me, therefore, to deal briefly and practically with your questions and outline our proposals for 2008.
The Commission will adopt guidelines this summer on the revised strategy for combating discrimination - follow-up action as it were, to the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
According to the European Council's conclusions of December 2007, these guidelines will for the most part deal with the Roma problem and the recommendations of the high-ranking group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities.
These guidelines will be supplemented by a working paper by the Commission's services, which analyses the progress and effectiveness of these measures achieved for the benefit of the Roma, both at political and at legislative level, and also when planning programmes for the structural funds.
At the same time we are offering to organise a high-level Roma forum, aimed at bringing together representatives of national governments and parliaments, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions as well as leading figures from Roma civil society and other important players.
We are convinced that the rights of the Roma can be strengthened by high-level open discussion and that much more targeted use of resources can be achieved for their benefit.
The staff of my colleague VladimÃ­r Å pidla will prepare the initiatives referred to and then focus on the Roma problem in the areas of non-discrimination, the European Social Fund, employment and social integration.
Since the situation of the Roma relates to several of the Commission's areas of activity, such as regional policy, education, public health and justice, the specialist inter-agency group for Roma issues, which came into existence in 2004, will be providing the information exchange.
Finally, a few weeks ago, the Commission concluded a partnership framework agreement with the European Roma Information Office, the ERIO.
This partnership will establish permanent, direct contact between the European bodies and Roma civil society.
As for the rest, it should be remembered that several initiatives are being implemented both at national and at European level as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which has just begun.
These aim to highlight, and therefore make people even more aware of, the importance of dialogue between cultures and above all the advantages that cultural diversity brings to our society.
In the spring of 2008, the Commission will publish a Green Paper on educational issues in conjunction with pupils who have a migrant background or belong to a disadvantaged minority.
It will also address the major aspects affecting the Roma, such as educational segregation, for instance.
This Green Paper should trigger wide-ranging debate on the subject and maybe lead to a plan of action at European level.
I should also add - to respond directly to a question from Mrs MohÃ¡csi - that the Commission intends to submit the proposal in 2008 for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment beyond employment, i.e. a horizontal directive, as we announced in our work programme.
These are currently the fundamental items we are preparing and I now await the debate with interest, at the end of which I shall perhaps need to add a few comments.
on behalf of PPE-DE. - (RO) I think that the organisation of this debate in plenary session is extremely important as it is necessary to draw up a balance sheet of the European actions on Roma population and to analyse the methods of enhancing the efficiency thereof.
Several recent events proved us that there are still important gaps at European policy level in this field and an update and readjustment thereof is necessary for the current challenges.
Mutual tollerance and multi-ethnical integration are fundamental principles of the European Union and Roma is an important community at European level, having a significant impact on the social and political as well as economic life in several Member States of the European Union..
Therefore, it is mandatory to develop a coherent vision at European level regarding Roma, focussed on their integration and ensuring a common basis of rights and responsibilities.
Although in November I asked the European Commission a question regarding this issue and the answer was that new proposals intending Roma integration would be launched, I hereby ask the Commission to come up with clarifications on these intentions.
Firstly, I would be interested in the way the Commission would approach this issue from institutional point of view so that to ensure an efficient coordination and monitoring of European action for Roma protection and integration.
The role of education, and I would say, the education for tollerance, is not less important as it was pointed out by my colleagues.
From this education all the EU citizens would benefit, it would be an education for tollerance as stimulating factor of Roma integration, interaction and social relation in the European Union.
Their development would make Roma social integration easier and on the other hand it would limit the stigmatization and discrimination against them.
Consequently, I ask the Commission to inform us on the existence of such programmes and the implementation thereof, but especially on wether it intends to consider this issue when drawing up further European policies on Roma.
Thank you and I hope that this debate would result into firm and concrete decisions to improve the European policies on Roma.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for your reply, which met us half-way in at least some points.
You have to understand that we are impatient with regard to these issues because the latest incidents have again shown how pressing the problem is.
Firstly, with regard to the Roma forum: approval from our side.
I believe it is a good idea, particularly with the involvement of the Roma themselves.
It is important, however, to act quickly because I am afraid that, now that the proposal has been made, it will simply be discussed to death and there will be too much dithering.
I believe the Roma forum should be set up as quickly as possible, within the current year.
Parliament will certainly provide assistance.
Secondly, it is also important, of course, to engage the local authorities, because governments are often well-intentioned and make promises, but then the problem ends up with the Mayor or somewhere else in the region and is not actually dealt with.
Thirdly, many thanks for your undertaking regarding the proposals for equal treatment beyond the workplace.
This is an important subject generally, which my Group very much supports.
But for all that, Commissioner, I should like to say on behalf of my Group that these interdisciplinary groups - we are all familiar with them from our own administrations - are all arduous and helpful.
In our view it would be important for there to be one Commissioner responsible for coordinating the subject area, or for there to be at least one authorised representative among the Commissioners whose task it is to carry it through.
I still do not know why the Romanian Commissioner has the job that he has.
If he were at least able to attend to it, this would help.
I don't know.
But we would like to see these matters given great priority.
Things are moving in the right direction.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your report, but a bit more force and a bit more pace would be of great value in the interest of the Roma.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although this debate has been prompted by oral questions to the Commission, in substance it is the natural continuation of an initiative that Parliament undertook some time ago and which it has recently been emphasising. It is clear that we need an action plan to improve the situation of the Roma, given this minority's poor integration into the social and civil framework of the countries of the European Union.
The transnational nature of the Roma, which is one of their special characteristics, gives rise to a requirement, which I personally support, to prepare a European strategy so that they can escape from the worrying degrading conditions in which they live, in many cases bordering on the inhuman, which without doubt is the effect of social exclusion and the trigger for resulting, varied adverse consequences: from alienation from the host country to degeneration into violence, either as a perpetrator or a victim.
As well as guidelines that may help local and national authorities to stem the numbers of Member State minorities descending into social hardship, it is necessary to have adequate funds to back up the actions to be taken.
It is not, however, just a funding problem.
The true goal is to bring about equal access to work, education, housing, health, social services and the environment needed to exercise civil rights, starting with decision-making processes.
All this involves an integrated approach to combining actions to achieve these goals.
This is why I am personally opposed to giving responsibility for the Roma issue to a single European Commissioner.
Two years after the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion (2005-2015) there are still a great many commitments that the governments who supported them have yet to get started and fulfil.
What initiatives is the Commission intending to take on this issue?
I hope that they will begin as soon as possible, straight after the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, in this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, the current situation of the Roma forces me to begin with a criticism, which is that the European Commission has been slow and lazy in dealing with Roma issues in Europe.
Just look at the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which for the past two decades have had offices fully dedicated to Roma issues.
The Council of Europe has produced many specific recommendations on the Roma, and the OSCE has developed its action plan on improving the situation of the Roma in the OSCE area.
I wonder how much attention the Commission and EU Member States has devoted to those documents, and whether they took seriously the joint EP resolution on the Roma, or the Decade of Roma Inclusion action plans.
However, simply criticising is not my political style, and Ms Ferrero-Waldner has given me some cause for optimism.
I would therefore ask the Commissioner to please share the following message with President Barroso and the college when you meet.
First, a European Roma strategy should be created as soon as possible and should primarily focus on improving the living conditions of the Roma in Europe, creating jobs for the almost 90% of Roma who are jobless, combating anti-gypsyism, supporting the education of Roma, bringing health into Roma houses and promoting Roma political inclusion.
Second, to facilitate such a strategy, the European Commission needs a permanent Roma unit, hiring Roma staff to serve that body.
I sincerely hope that the Commission will hire Roma staff on the basis of their skills, rather than their skin, as some Member States have done in the past.
Third, a special European fund for Roma projects should be a priority for the European Commission.
The European Parliament should, of course, also make a contribution towards the joint European 'union of works' to improve the situation of the Roma.
I would like at this juncture to raise again the proposal to have a permanent EP rapporteur on Roma issues, who could give a good overview and make recommendations to this House, other EU institutions and the Member States.
Furthermore, I would like to hear the voice of the Roma more loudly in this House.
Their interests should be represented by their MEPs.
Finally, I would underline that the European Roma strategy should express common political values when it comes to the future enlargement process and the fight against ultra-nationalism and the extreme right in Europe.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for what she has said and for the commitments she has made, which also seem to me to be in line with what the European Parliament has said on many occasions in its resolutions, but these promises to act are not enough in themselves.
I would like to ask what tools the Commission uses and what it can tell us about the use of the funds which, under various expenditure headings, have to date been made available to Member States for Roma inclusion.
Secondly, what checks is it making on the concrete implementation at national level of the directives adopted?
Thirdly, I join with those asking that there be a single figure within the Commission handling all issues relating to the Roma.
To turn to my country, I must stress that we face a very strong wave of racism and stigmatisation, chiefly towards the Roma, particularly since Italy has not fully transposed Directive 43/2000/EC against ethnic discrimination.
What measures does the Commission intend to take with regard to this?
Italian law has not transposed the concept of racial harassment, the issue of the sharing of the burden of proof or protection from abuse suffered as a result of racial discrimination.
Further, I ask the Commission if it knows that in one major Italian municipality - namely Milan - migrant children, who in this case are mainly Roma, whose parents are not in a regular position with the law and do not have a residence permit, cannot attend state schools.
This seems to me to run completely counter to all the EU's documents, to contradict the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and also the resolution we adopted this morning on the rights of the child.
Finally, I would like to point out that the Italian Government is discussing the nth decree-law on an issue which is in fact really to do with the Roma, and that is whether it is possible to include a reference to economic ends among the grounds that may be given to justify the removal of a citizen of another Member State from the country, in this case from Italy.
Behind the general issue of immigration, this decree is in fact directed specifically at the Roma.
I would like to know your views.
(BG) Distinguished colleagues, I, too, take the floor so that it can be heard, finally, in this Chamber, how things really stand and so that the hypocritical statements can stop, at least for a while.
What can we gather from the discussion so far?
We gather that you are concerned for the gypsy population in Europe, which includes also my homeland, Bulgaria.
I can't even venture to imagine that right now you are concerned by the extremely low pensions of retirees in Bulgaria or for the honest, hard-working Bulgarians who become victims of gypsy crime on a daily basis.
Distinguished MEPs, do show some concern for the fact that the Bulgarian Socialist Party buys gypsy votes on a regular basis during elections in Bulgaria.
Do care that the coalition partner of Bulgarian Socialists, the Movement for Rights and Liberties, represented here in the ALDE group, buys all the remaining votes.
Also cast by gypsies.
Do care that the chairman of the Movement for Rights and Liberties, Ahmed Doghan, calls the buying of votes, of gypsy votes, 'a normal European practice'.
Do show some concern for the fact that, in Bulgaria, the gypsy population stands at 3-4%, while the crimes committed by them account for 30-40% of all criminal offences.
And these are not only crimes of poverty, committed because of poverty.
These are extremely shameless and brutal crimes.
Because the rape and murder of a 79-year old woman is not a crime of poverty.
You do agree, don't you?
The huge amounts of money allocated, it is obvious, do not work.
This funding does not work because this money disappears in dubious foundations and non-government organisations.
In our opinion, that of the patriots from Ataka, the solution of this problem is in abiding by the all the laws in each single country.
Abiding by the law, with no tolerance for a specific minority, will bring success.
Because in Bulgaria crimes committed by gypsies are not investigated in detail.
That is a fact.
A fact, and you can see it for yourselves.
The murder of the teenage Belneyski sisters was not investigated.
It was covered up.
These issues should cause our concern.
Because tolerating a particular minority at the expense of the majority will not bring any success but the opposite of success.
Thank you for your attention.
(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to listen to the words of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and I was delighted by the initiatives that can be expected to take place in future.
I feel that this really will help the situation of the Roma substantially, but I must agree with my Dutch fellow Member, who has expressed her impatience.
I am impatient too, along with many others, because the situation really is changing very slowly.
There are 7-9 million Roma living in Europe, most of them in poor social circumstances, and they fight the same problems as they have for years: the problems of exclusion and inclusion, the lack of employment, the question of school segregation and multiple discrimination against Roma women.
The majority of Member States do not regard the Roma as a minority of their country, they do not want to make substantial changes to their situation, and indeed the experiences of the past few years have shown instead a reinforcement of radicalism and anti-gipsyism in both the new and old Member States.
I therefore feel that there is no more time to waste, and we need real changes and a harmonised European Roma policy.
Without a European Roma policy there is no national Roma policy; we have to understand and confront this.
It would be good if we took steps so that the transnational minority status of the Roma is recognised, since it really is a special status.
The European Parliament and, within this, the Socialist Group, has already launched the action plan, and in March we will be doing a tour of Europe and arranging conferences, workshops and visits with the involvement of local Roma, NGOs and governments in order to expose cases of discrimination, and we will draw the attention of European public opinion to the unhappy situation of the Roma and try to remedy it.
Thank you very much.
Mr President, Roma are neither the successors of the ancient Roman Empire, nor the contemporary inhabitants of Rome.
They are neither a nation without a state nor a national minority.
They are an ethnocultural community, still cherishing its tribal tradition, and a pan-European community which was kept in slavery in pre-modern and early modern Europe, which was sent to extermination camps by the Fascist regimes and enclosed in the states turned into prisons by the Communist dictatorship.
They became free European citizens after the end of the Cold War and the first post-bipolar European Union enlargement.
Being marginalised and excluded over the centuries, the Roma community found itself excluded from European wealth and tried to protect itself by challenging the European order.
Today, now that Europe is reconciled with itself, should it be reconciled with the Roma population as well, or should it declare and treat the Roma as second-class citizens who are again to be concentrated in some Member States transformed into Roma ghettos?
To these questions there is a single answer: the Roma issue is a European issue.
It is not a simple issue but a huge challenge - a common challenge which we must cope with jointly.
Otherwise we will be unable to integrate the Roma community into European society and bring it into the European order.
This is a cultural and social matter.
The European Union should mobilise funds, develop programmes and organise specific institutional structures in order to assist the national authorities of the countries where the Roma choose to settle in order to offer this community a decent material life, a proper education, a fair opportunity to compete with others, free of any discrimination, and a cohesive sense of their existence within European civilisation.
We expect the European Commission to take the right steps in that direction and to keep the European Parliament fully informed on the progress achieved.
(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, when we discuss the Lisbon Strategy in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we talk about high growth, a high level of employment, good social conditions, good health care, and one of the things we also say is that the education system and development of skills must be a driving force in achieving these goals.
When we transpose this, all these aims, to the Roma minority in Europe, we find astonishingly high unemployment.
We find social conditions which are not particularly good, health care which is not particularly good, poor housing conditions, a segregated society for them, and even an education system which is segregated.
There are special education provisions for Roma people which do not give them the right to an adequate education.
Yet the Lisbon Strategy is there for everyone.
You had a number of good proposals.
We support them, but it is important that the strategy is followed up by a plan of action.
It is important that we have mainstreaming, but at the same time there must be coordination within the Commission.
It is important that we review our funds so that they take account of the Roma minority.
It is important, when we draw up strategies in the fields of employment and education and in other fields, that we always consider the situation of the Roma so that they are integrated in different strategies.
(HU) Mr President, the European Union does not have a minority policy for Roma, nor for traditional national minorities, nor for migrant minorities.
I include the Roma among traditional national minorities, but at the same time, because of their specific socially disadvantaged situation, they must still be treated as a separate category.
I am delighted that, as the living conscience of the European Parliament, the two Hungarian Members of Roma descent, Mrs JÃ¡rÃ³ka and Mrs MohÃ¡csi, amongst others, have raised this question, because we rightly condemned the events in Italy in November.
It is right that we should continuously return to this question.
What is the duty of the European Union?
I am delighted with what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said.
The European Union also has a duty, but it must make a distinction between what is the competence of a Member State and what is the competence of the European Union.
I also agree fully with Mr Swoboda, who is no longer here, not because of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but because he is right, namely in that it is decided at local level whether or not something will succeed.
Specifically, the Member State must be given a national action programme.
I am proud that we prepared Europe's first medium-term Roma programme under my government department.
Money must be given to the Member State, but everything be decided at local level.
What can the EU do?
It should monitor what the Member States are doing and it should provide a 'best practice' method for the best solution.
It is not only a matter of money, but also of whether there are any qualified experts from the majority and Roma society who want to take this matter further.
The future of Europe depends on minorities.
- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to reject the criticism that Commissioner Å pidla is too lazy to attend to this problem.
I do not think this is the right way to conduct discussions in the House.
It is important that we concentrate on improving educational provision for young Roma people.
We are all familiar with the system of compulsory education and I believe that language and literacy, and numeracy skills - quite simply, things that are necessary for a good life - should be made compulsory.
On the other hand, I do understand that not everyone wants to be integrated, of course.
Of course we do have to offer initiatives to all those who do not wish to integrate into our society.
I believe the concept of an open approach to these problems is the main solution for the future.
Mr President, this debate has highlighted a number of the problems which the subject we are debating raises.
It seems to me, Commissioner, that rather than us devising a strategy and telling others what to do, it would perhaps be wise to ask representatives of the Roma community.
We currently have two Roma MEPs.
I remember, too, a very famous Spanish Socialist Member of this House, elected in 1989, who was particularly engaging and informative on the whole question of Roma culture.
That culture is part of our culture and part of European civilisation, and reflects what kind of a people we are.
It would perhaps be wise to look at the history of the Roma people, to speak with representatives of the Roma culture and to ask them how we can best further their prospects, rather than telling them how they can integrate into our society and how we can best accommodate their social needs.
Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, may I sum up once again: it was an extremely interesting debate and we all very clearly see the need to respond to this.
I understand, of course, that you all want the fastest possible response.
I should tell you that there is also a directive, Directive 2000/43/EC, which already guarantees the application of the principle of equal treatment, with no differentiation between race or ethnic origin in the employment, social, and educational sectors and in access to and supply of goods and services, which also applies to the Roma.
I believe this is also fundamental here.
This directive also makes positive measures possible in the Member States.
However, it is true that the Member States are not obliged to incorporate these measures into their national legislative provisions.
The European regulations do have to be applied, however, and I should say that we at the Commission have made the firm decision to ensure that they are implemented.
The Commission has in fact initiated infringement procedures in the past year against 22 Member States that have not implemented the European regulations properly, including Italy, Mr Agnoletto.
As regards the integration of people in the job market, the European Social Fund is also our most important instrument for this.
A substantial proportion of the measures targeted to improving the employability of the Roma can be co-financed by the European Social Fund.
Between 2000 and 2006, approximately 275 million euros, for example, were earmarked for projects targeted specifically at integrating the Roma.
The high-level group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities has pointed out that certain projects supported by the ESF, such as the Acceder programme in Spain, for instance, are excellent models of active integration of the Roma.
I should therefore like to renew an urgent appeal to the individual states to make use of this opportunity.
I agree with Mr Swoboda that it is not just the bodies of the nation states, of course, that play an important role here, but also often local organisations, of course.
As we all know, the social exclusion of the Roma is a complex phenomenon and a consistent approach covering all the important aspects of their lives is therefore needed to tackle it.
This includes education, employment, health, housing and infrastructure.
This approach requires efficient coordination at the level of the European institutions.
I am convinced that real progress will be made over the next year with the help of these measures.
I have, of course, heard that many of you - not all - would like a certain Commissioner to take on this subject and I shall, of course, convey this to my colleague, Mr Å pidla.
But there is a wide variety of different subjects involved here and the most important thing, therefore, is effective coordination.
You can certainly talk to Mr Å pidla once again about the other issue.
I should like very briefly to single out a few items that were raised specifically during the debate.
These included the question of how dialogue with civil society and also with the Roma themselves is going.
I believe that dialogue such as this - and specifically on the course of action for the Roma and their children - is very important for guaranteeing the principle of non-discrimination on the one hand, and combating unemployment and promoting the social development of the regions in which the Roma live on the other hand, as well as toppling the barriers found mainly in the heads of the majority so that the Roma are recognised as a genuine part of this European culture.
I am in agreement here with all those who have raised this issue.
I myself - and all those who know me know that this is perhaps a kind of hobby of mine outside politics - have always advocated human rights education.
It is an education in tolerance.
I can only say that I shall therefore certainly be including the issue of human rights education, which I regard as hugely important, in these guidelines.
Mrs de Groen-Kouwenhoven, I have to say here that the Commission is perhaps slow, but certainly not lazy.
When you see that the European Council and in particular the OSCE have set up numerous programmes, mainly with the support of the European Commission, then you become aware that to all intents and purposes there are some very positive approaches to this.
My final comment applies to the issue of the trans-national minority.
Here I would simply like to say that consideration should be given to the fact that the European Union does not have the authority to define minorities in the Member States themselves.
You also know that it should be borne in mind in this context that social policy measures are not geared to ethnic origin, but always to individual needs.
But as you know, the Member States in particular have a very different idea of what a minority is and how a minority is defined.
This issue can therefore still not be resolved very quickly.
In other respects, I am happy to pass on your comments.
You will certainly be receiving guidelines on this soon.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 31 January 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - It is clear the Roma is a neglected minority in the European Union; we cannot allow this to continue.
I fully support my colleagues in calling for the Commission to take more action on this issue.
We have a situation whereby there exists a group that is considered the largest ethnic minority group in the EU, living in less than substandard conditions, that we have difficulty in protecting and aiding.
Concrete and swift action from the Commission to assist the integration of the Roma community in all aspects of society, be it economic, social or political, is desperately needed.
The EU needs to take the lead on this problem.
A more effective EU policy for the South Caucasus - A Black Sea Regional Policy Approach (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
the report by Lydie Polfer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a more effective EU policy for the South Caucasus: from promises to actions, and
the report by Roberta Alma Anastase, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a Black Sea Regional Policy Approach
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on International Trade, and above all my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who have actively contributed to shaping this report, which we wanted to be balanced, and which in the end was adopted unanimously.
Yes, there is great interest in the three countries in the Caucasus.
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, all three of which came out of the collapse of the USSR, are still suffering from the legacy of those times today, especially through the unresolved conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, which are poisoning the atmosphere between them and their neighbours and have set off a damaging arms race.
Nevertheless, these three countries chose to adopt European values, in the 1980s, by becoming members of the Council of Europe and, later, by signing partnership and cooperation agreements with the European Union.
Their geographical proximity and situation as a transit area between Iran, Turkey, Russia, the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea mean that we have an interest in helping these countries to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in this region and to set up a viable framework for regional cooperation and development that permits political stability.
This is particularly important because these countries, though they have experienced strong growth, still have high levels of poverty and unemployment.
We have analysed the possibilities for taking action in different sections that I will briefly summarise.
Firstly, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, we have insisted upon a differentiated approach based on individual merits, while making regional cooperation a key objective.
We are asking the Commission to extend these contacts with civil society, and we particularly support the initiative of undertaking a feasibility study on a free-trade agreement with Georgia and Armenia and of supporting Azerbaijan in its process of accession to the WTO.
Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are obviously a fundamental part of this and we commend the efforts made by Armenia following the constitutional reform, but we encourage it to continue with the establishment of an independent judiciary and civil service.
Regarding Azerbaijan, although we are concerned by the deterioration of the human rights situation and media freedom, on the other hand we commend the presidential pardon that has enabled several journalists to be released, and we ask for an investigation into allegations of police violence.
As for Georgia, which has undertaken wide-ranging reforms since 2003 and experienced the turbulence we know about, we are pleased that the presidential elections went off peacefully, but the very tense climate and allegations of human rights abuses lead us to ask the authorities to set up an inquiry into the complaints lodged, without delay.
We also ask the opposition forces to behave responsibly and respect the election.
To sum up, we are asking these three countries to guarantee freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the media as well as fair and honest access to the media for the opposition, and we are asking them to step up the fight against corruption and establish a favourable investment climate.
As regards the negotiations to come up with procedures for granting visas to Georgia, we can only recommend the Commission and the Council to launch them in view of what is happening in Abkhazia and Ossetia.
As for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts, this is obviously the condition sine qua non for lasting stability in the region.
We have dealt with this, I believe, in a balanced way.
I will not go over it again in detail; I will simply mention - as we pointed out - that the contradiction between the principle of self-determination and territorial integrity has up to now contributed to the perpetuation of the conflicts in the region, and that this problem can be overcome only through negotiations on the basis of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act.
Let us hope that the latest proposals from the Minsk Group will help to bridge these rifts.
This would be the best present for the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who are suffering cruelly from this situation.
Finally, as regards cooperation on energy and transport, although it is clear that the new initiatives increase the possibilities for openness, it is becoming increasingly evident that Armenia's isolation is only worsening.
In conclusion, I would like to recall that the sole objective of this report is to show our sincere interest in the South Caucasus region, its inhabitants, their history, their goals and their hopes, and that we would like to get to know them better so we can better help them to achieve them.
Rapporteur. - (RO) A year ago, in January 2007, in this very room, we were celebrating Romania and Bulgaria's accession. We were reflecting then on the new opportunities available both to the two new Member States and to the European Union as a whole.
Active and consistent involvement in the Black Sea region, along with the development of a genuine regional cooperation policy, comparable to those related to the Mediterranean and the Northern Dimension, were necessary and obvious requirements.
Now, in January 2008, as rapporteur for Black Sea Cooperation, I have the privilege of opening this plenary debate to discuss Parliament's recommendations on developing synergy in the Black Sea area, proposed in April by the European Commission.
These recommendations are the result of a broad process of reflection and consultation with all interested colleagues as well as independent experts and civil servants.
The report emphasises the strategic importance of the Black Sea to the European Union while defining with extreme clarity the objective of the cooperation policy in this area: creating a common space of security, democracy and prosperity.
The report stresses the importance of regional cooperation in mobilizing ten adjoining countries towards dialogue and joint action, bringing together their diversity and their enormous potential, which we cannot ignore.
Consequently, a primary responsibility for the European Union is to take the lead in promoting active regional cooperation in the Black Sea region.
The key question that this report attempts to answer is the following: how can we strengthen and effectively implement the European policy of regional cooperation in the Black Sea region in order to achieve the objective of creating a common space of security, democracy and prosperity?
First of all, we need firm, coherent, and results-driven action on the part of the European Union.
In this regard, the report identifies three fundamental issues: mobilizing all the relevant financial instruments, enhanced cooperation with other institutions and bodies in the area, and, not least, monitoring actions to ensure their continuity and effectiveness, and devising an action plan.
The report also recommends that the European Union should focus on five priority areas.
The Black Sea region arguably is of strategic importance for the security and diversification of energy supply in the European Union and requires a comprehensive approach with that in mind.
However, it is imperative that the European Union should not confine itself to economic cooperation, but rather aim to create a region where stability, democracy and good governance prevail.
The EU's Black Sea policy will only be complete when the European Union commits to resolving existing conflicts, and civil society development, personal contact and good relations between neighbours are essential in this regard.
Since we are also discussing Mrs Polfer's report on the South Caucasus, and countries in that region are part of the wider Black Sea area, I welcome the drafting of this report.
It is important that the two reports concur in their main ideas and in stressing the importance of cooperation and dialogue among all States as a premise for development and prosperity, as well as in stressing the need for consistent involvement on the part of the European Union.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all the contributors to the report on Black Sea synergy.
I appreciate the cooperation and unanimous support of my colleagues from all groups.
I hope that the same spirit will guide the European Union and the Black Sea countries in their joint effort to develop regional cooperation in this area.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I say that I will be slightly longer, because I am answering on two reports.
They are two excellent reports that bring to our agenda today, on the one hand, the complex area of the neighbourhood policy and, on the other hand, the question of the Black Sea region.
Reading the reports has indeed reinforced my conviction that, while bilateral differentiated relations remain the cornerstone of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP), many of the challenges and opportunities before us require, I think, a response at subregional or regional level, as we have already said.
Now let me speak first on the South Caucasus region.
We concur with most of the opinions contained in the very good report on the South Caucasus.
The inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in our neighbourhood policy will, step by step, bring all three of them closer to the European Union on the basis of shared European values.
The Commission will publish in spring its progress reports on the implementation of the three ENP action plans, providing an update on the current state of play in our joint undertaking.
We know that much remains to be done.
Compliance with democracy, human rights and the rule of law is still fragile and needs improvement.
Today, for instance, I had an exchange of views about these countries with Mr Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe.
We remain concerned about human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan.
Recent political events in Georgia show that the freedom of expression of political views through the media is essential for stability and, for instance, despite progress in Armenia, further efforts are needed to fight corruption and fully comply with human rights standards.
Notwithstanding rapid economic growth, poverty is still widespread in the region and we continue to promote economic reforms, steps to improve the business climate but also to strengthen the rule of law.
And I also agree with the need stressed in Ms Polfer's report for more regional cooperation activities, in particular in the areas of energy, transport and the environment.
It is our hope that the European Union will be able to take a more courageous and more proactive stance in supporting conflict settlement in the region.
As mentioned in the recent ENP communication, the European Union could provide even more help by working around the conflict issues by tackling the underlying causes and, indeed, by building trust on both sides of the boundary lines.
As stressed in the report, concrete steps undertaken by the Commission to spread aid and information can at least serve these purposes.
Addressing the challenges I have briefly described remains, therefore, a main priority of my Commission for the South Caucasus in the coming months.
To do this, we will continue to employ the whole range of appropriate EU financial assistance programmes.
The upgrading of our delegation in Armenia and the opening of a delegation in Azerbaijan in early 2008 will certainly also allow us to increase visibility and operate more efficiently.
Let me make a special comment on the present presidential elections in Georgia.
As you know, the international election observation mission, to which the European Parliament has contributed, has confirmed that the elections were, overall, in line with OSCE and Council of Europe standards.
However, the international election observation mission has identified several irregularities and shortcomings.
And the most urgent task now is to address these problems: to investigate all electoral complaints and to create the proper conditions for the upcoming legislative elections.
We stand ready to continue supporting Georgia in carrying out these duties in a speedy and in a thorough way.
Regarding the Black Sea, I find myself in agreement with much of the report on a Black Sea regional policy approach as well.
It provides valuable political impetus for our April communication on Black Sea synergy and I think it is significant that, after the Council conclusions last May and the present discussion in the European Parliament, all the key EU institutions will have reaffirmed the need to implement a regional and a comprehensive approach to our policies applied in the Black Sea region.
The timing of Parliament's report is very appropriate.
As a result of our initiative, EU foreign ministers will meet in less than one month's time in Kiev with their Black Sea counterparts at a Black Sea synergy meeting.
I will, of course, personally attend this meeting.
International and Black Sea regional organisations will also participate and we look forward to discussions that would welcome and endorse increased EU support to Black Sea regional cooperation and determine the priority areas for coordinated action.
Let me mention just a few of those.
The Commission promotes a Black Sea dialogue on energy security, making use of the INOGATE structure.
We continue to encourage legal and regulatory harmonisation through the Baku process.
Our intention is to carry on working closely with our partners in the construction of new energy infrastructure, developing a trans-Black Sea energy corridor.
And Black Sea cooperation will improve coordination between TRACECA, the pan-European transport access programme, and the transport programmes of our partners.
We are also about to initiate a regional dialogue on Black Sea maritime policies and the establishment of regional fisheries coordination.
The Commission is working on strengthening the Black Sea-Danube connection and we intend to join the Black Sea Commission, which deals with environmental tasks.
So the Commission has been developing some proposals for regional schemes to combat climate change and we have also begun the implementation of our Black Sea cross-border cooperation programme focusing on civil society and on local authorities.
There are a number of proposals under discussion with our Black Sea partners in the areas of the fight against organised crime, trade and culture, and we have developed contacts with Black Sea regional organisations, notably with the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.
Concerning the funding for Black Sea synergy, cofinancing will be the main rule.
The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument will certainly be at the heart of the EU's financial contribution, but other EU instruments, including thematic ones and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, in the case of Turkey, will be used as well.
The Kiev ministerial meeting will provide a forum to discuss and bring forward and coordinate EU initiatives with ideas coming from our partners.
And it is our expectation that the Black Sea regional context will open up a new space for cooperation based on equal partnership with all eastern ENP countries and important partners like Russia and Turkey.
Our engagement in the Black Sea region can develop into a long-term endeavour with clear potential to enhance stability, progress and prosperity in the whole region, and Parliament's support is extremely important for that success.
rapporteur for the opinion of INTA. - (BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, the Committee on International Trade congratulates the European Commission and the rapporteur on their timeliness and on their balanced approach to the Black Sea and the region.
The Black Sea is a border of the European Union, a geostrategic crossroad and a transit region, an area of cooperation trade, fishing, tourism, shipping, a strategic area in the European energy policy.
The Committee on International Trade calls for a better coordination of cooperation through a separate Black Sea strategy and brings to attention the participation of the Union in infrastructural projects related to the transmission of energy resources.
It is important to promote investment in environmental protection, risk prevention, disaster recovery and rescue operations in case of accidents such as the Kerch Strait ones and the shipwreck of the Bulgarian vessel Vanessa.
To ensure open procedures and high standards in the region, the European Parliament needs to list the Bourgas - Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, together with the rest of the gas and oil transmission networks, since it involves European Union Member States.
Congratulations to the European Union on the responsibility with which it addresses 'the Black Sea challenge' and the responsibility for the people who live in this region.
Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Polfer, for a very precise analysis of the problems of such a sensitive region as the South Caucasus as well as the proposals and measures presented, which we are considering today.
Traditionally, EU policies in the South Caucasus region mostly evaluate the energy and transport aspects in economic terms.
I would like to draw your attention more to the significance of effective EU trade policy in this region, because it enables the economy to be restructured more quickly, business to be developed and the poverty rate to be reduced, whereas countries do not always find energy projects helpful.
When talking about effective EU policies, which is very important in the South Caucasus region, I would like to emphasise two points. Firstly, we still await the Commission's feasibility study evaluating free-trade agreements with both Armenia and Georgia that are as broad as possible and we also encourage the Commission and the Council to implement measures that would help the countries of the South Caucasus to benefit as much as possible from the Generalised System of Preferences.
Rapporteur for the opinion, Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Through the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the Union has become a major player in the Black Sea area.
The region has geostrategic importance for the Union's security and diversification of energy supply, due to its closeness to the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and Central Asia.
The Union's principles cannot be promoted solely on the basis of political values.
It is necessary to foster open, transparent markets in the region.
The ITRE committee stresses the importance of the Nabucco project for the diversification of supply, and calls on the Member States to ensure its implementation, together with their partners.
We welcome the appointment of a coordinator for this priority project of European interest.
In order to ensure international trade and the transport of oil and gas in the area, it is essential to develop the infrastructure of community ports on the Black Sea coast and the Danube.
The ITRE committee deplores the lack of coordination of investment in energy, transport and tourism projects in the area and draws attention to the risk of pollution in the Black Sea.
While acknowledging the importance of the Black Sea Forum and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation , the ITRE committee recommends that a European dimension be established for the Black Sea, based on the model of the Northern Dimension.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we cannot discuss the South Caucasus without thinking of our former fellow Member Ursula Schleicher, who cared about this region in a special way and to whom we are grateful for the fact that the colonialist expression 'Transcaucasus' has been replaced by the term 'South Caucasus'.
The region comprises three very different countries with ancient cultures, which have nevertheless suffered in the recent past under colonialism and neo-colonialism.
We must therefore approach this region with great sensitivity.
Armenians in Western Armenia were victims of genocide, which means that even today, Turkey thinks of the Armenia of today - that is, Eastern Armenia - in terms of an unacceptable blockade.
Georgia was a colony of Russia and the Soviet Union in a particular way, which means that today separatist powers in Georgia are still being used and abused by Moscow in order to destabilise this country.
Azerbaijan is in a similar situation.
For all these reasons, we in the European Union must have a strong role in this region, as this was once a region where, for once, it was not us Europeans who were spearheading misguided developments, but others.
We therefore have a unique opportunity to mediate, democratise and stabilise here and we must reconcile conflicting principles and interests.
These naturally include stable borders, but also the peoples' right of self-determination.
We have to support the rights of minorities to the fullest extent possible, but at the same time prevent destructive separatism.
We have to preserve commodity interests and geopolitical interests, but at the same time we must see that these are not colonies, but partners, with their own interests and their own dignity and deserve to have their dignity acknowledged at last.
Therefore, the Polfer report does justice to this difficult challenge in a distinguished manner and I also thank the Commissioner for the enormous effort she is making on behalf of this region.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the South Caucasus is a region of utmost importance, not only for the European Union, but for most of the global players.
I believe that the European Union should define its interests in the region.
Basically, those interests consist in having a peaceful and stable place in the South Caucasus, in having a large enough free and integrated market, in having an open area for the safe transit of strategic merchandise, and in having institutions and legislation that are interoperable with European Union ones.
In order to promote our interest, the European Union should develop appropriate nuanced and specific bilateral relations with the Member States of the region.
The substance of the bilateral relations should result from our regional strategic approach, and not the other way round.
Since we cannot offer the South Caucasus countries European Union membership, we must offer them the European Union model and assist them, in a substantial way, to enhance it.
The European Union should not hesitate to use all its means in order to reach its regional goals in South Caucasus.
At the same time we must acknowledge that the other international operators have an interest in the region and we have acknowledged the fact that the European Union could not possibly move its priorities without cooperation with the other global actors.
Some of the unsolved conflicts in the area are, in fact, part of a broader coherent problem which is linked to the post-Soviet status of Russia.
Therefore, the European Union should courageously address that problem and try to find a negotiated solution concerning the way in which Russia, the European Union and other global players must share responsibilities for guaranteeing the sustainable regional and global stability and security.
On the other hand, we must admit that principles of territorial integrity and self-determination are clashing in the South Caucasus.
My opinion is that one could overcome this clash of principles by combining regional integration following the European Union communitarian model with an appropriate use of the internal self-determination, devolution and autonomy.
This would require good-faith negotiations, political will, a pragmatic spirit and respect for international law provisions.
It is the right time for the European Union to pass from promises to action in the South Caucasus.
I hope that this will indeed happen.
Madam President, I wish to refer to the previous speaker's concluding words.
What this is about is making transport routes for gas and oil through the Black Sea a reality.
All of us in the European Union say that these are strategic projects, and the Nabucco project is a strategic project.
We have been saying this for years, only nothing is ever done about it.
The question is this: why, if there are such difficulties, can we not make use of some fund or other, as was done with the Galileo project, to turn this project into a reality?
If no practical and visible moves are made in this regard, the Russians will soon build their own gas pipelines through the Black Sea, and the result will be that our extensive programme of diversification of transport routes all comes tumbling down.
This is also about something else.
That something else is Europe obtaining supplies from the whole Caspian Sea region.
Azerbaijan alone can supply Europe for five years with one third of the gas that Europe currently takes from Russia, but there is also Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
However, in order to run gas pipelines from those territories that do not pass through Russian territory, we would need to resolve the problem of the status of the Caspian Sea; in other words we would have to make a final decision on whether it should be treated as a lake or as a sea.
A much more sensible and helpful way forward would appear to be to go for general recognition that the Caspian Sea is a sea, because that would make it very much easier to build gas pipelines or other pipelines through its waters, be it from Turkmenistan or from Kazakhstan.
In this connection, then, may I urge the European Union authorities to cease the continual reiteration of the statement that the Nabucco problem and the Odessa-Brody-GdaÅsk pipeline problem are important problems for the European Union.
We need to start acting, or else others will get in there before us.
Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Polfer on drawing up this excellent report.
Our discussion today is on the subject of a region that is of particular importance to the whole of the European Union, a region that is of unusual significance with respect to EU energy security.
The title of the report - A more effective EU policy for South Caucasus: from promises to actions - bears clear witness that the European Union has been unusually passive in recent years where this region is concerned.
However, this is a region that is an arena for competition between the most important international players; not only the European Union, but also Russia, the United States and China.
It is a region of uncommonly rapid economic growth.
Suffice it to say that in 2006 economic development in Azerbaijan exceeded 35%.
This year, however, may be the watershed; 2008 may be a year of crisis.
Let us not delude ourselves: the example of Kosovo may be used by Georgia's northern neighbour as a pretext for infringing the territorial integrity of that country. I hope, therefore, that the European Union will not allow Russia to support separatist strivings in Abkhazia and Ossetia.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, congratulations, first of all, to our two rapporteurs.
The report by Mrs Polfer comes just at the right time because, with the events in Georgia, we can see firsthand the difficulties of building democracy.
This report is balanced, and sets out the major geostrategic challenges of the South Caucasus.
It is important to remember that the neighbourhood policies commit us to supporting and accompanying these countries.
We have a political and moral responsibility towards them, but they also have one towards us, particularly as regards human rights and freedom of expression, as you pointed out, Commissioner.
For these three countries our support should also be more concerned with resolving the conflicts.
Currently, the EU is only managing them.
Without a political compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, without a peace plan between Georgia on the one hand and South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other, these countries will not be able to restore relationships of trust or establish lasting stability between themselves and with their larger neighbours.
As regards supporting democracy, we are doing this every day.
Unfortunately, the events that shook Georgia pushed it into a political crisis that it has still not found a way out of, with the opposition taking to the streets to challenge the results of the first round of the presidential elections.
Of course, by responding to the call for the President to resign, Mr Saakashvili caught the opposition unawares, leaving it very little time to organise the elections.
Of course, this election campaign was not fair because two candidates were able to deploy considerably greater resources than the others.
Of course, the campaign was marred by allegations and revelations of the orchestration of a post-election coup d'Ã©tat by an opposition candidate, but nevertheless it should be noted that on election day - and we were there as observers - no major incidents were reported by the observers, and there had never been so many of them in such a small country to observe elections.
With the international community and national and international NGOs, we were able to witness the freedom of expression of citizens generally, even if many irregularities and much intimidation were noted, though nothing systematic.
In our conclusion, we stressed the obligation to continue the legal proceedings, to take all the complaints into consideration and not to consider the results definitive until all the disputes had been looked into, and dozens of polling stations were thus cancelled.
Today, however, the situation has not been settled at all, and we must continue to appeal to Georgia's leaders, on all political sides, to resume and continue the dialogue; we must appeal to the authorities to hear the opposition's claims; and we must appeal to the opposition, which gained credibility during these elections, to assume its share of the responsibility for suggesting compromises, because Georgia really needs to get back to where it was before, the place it occupied after the Rose Revolution, that of a country that has turned the page on violence and instability.
That is what Georgia's people are demanding, and that is what they are also asking of the European Union today, and we must stick by them.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, I would like to express our great unease about the developments emerging in this region inhabited by millions of workers of dozens of different nationalities.
These developments greatly endanger them because of the intensification of imperialist clashes between the United States of America, Russia and the European Union in relation to energy sources and control of markets and of transport routes for energy.
The rest is rhetoric.
Unfortunately, the expansion of ÎÎÎ€Î to include countries in the region - and the impending affiliation of Ukraine and Georgia - are yet more factors contributing to destabilisation in the region.
Also contributing to instability are foreign bases and armies stationed in sensitive locations of intersection, as if preparing for serious new military conflicts.
The recent news that 3 000 US soldiers are expected to be based in the region of Burgas in Bulgaria, from where the new Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline starts, confirms all that we are saying and is a cause for great concern.
Similarly worrying is the information on preparations for the permanent presence of foreign naval forces in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea from countries that do not belong to the region, such as the United States.
Commissioner, the impending independence of Kosovo, supported by the United States and the European Union, will open up a Pandora's box for a whole series of similar issues in the region we are discussing: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Transdnestria and Nagorno-Karabakh, and other minority issues, whether already existing or heralded by disputes.
The policy of double standards that you are adopting will wreck the region and will give rise to further bloodshed.
You are merely pretending to be interested in the territorial integrity of Georgia and Azerbaijan.
As the European Union is interested only in finding ways to infiltrate the region, it is proposing the organisation of a 'three-plus-three' conference on security and cooperation in the South Caucasus, involving participation by the three-plus-three states: the three of the South Caucasus plus the European Union, the United States and Russia.
This is really a proposal for the legalisation of the US presence.
We believe that you have no right to involve the peoples of Europe in opportunistic plans serving the interests of multinationals, which are making a fortune in a bid to pocket greater profits from the pumping of oil.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the importance of the South Caucasus as an energy corridor for the European Union cannot be underestimated.
What will otherwise become of our objective of energy diversification?
Thus, we are entirely in agreement with the line of Mrs Polfer's report.
The analyst Vladimir Socor expressed this corridor function of the South Caucasus succinctly, saying that the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey railway would break Russia's monopoly on rail transport from Kazakhstan and other Central Asian states in the same way as pipelines through the South Caucasus eliminate Russia's monopoly on the transport of oil and gas from Central Asia.
We can add to this the Azerbaijani energy supplies necessary to implement the Nabucco project.
If the European Union wants to draw maximum benefit from the South Caucasus as an energy corridor, it is above all essential for internal political stability to prevail in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Regrettably, there is no social consensus on this in these countries.
This presents the EU with a direct task.
The desirability of political stability also applies at regional level.
Brussels is entitled and obliged to engage Turkey, a candidate country, on this issue, as an outbreak of military confrontation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a very real possibility in the long run, given the quadrupling of Azerbaijani military capacity and the increasing external assistance Baku is currently receiving with this.
- (PL) Madam President, we are following the situation in the Caucasus with great concern and interest.
Armenia and Georgia are countries that are very close to Europe, not only geographically, but also in terms of civilisation.
I wish to express my support for all the democratic forces in these countries and for initiatives aimed at supporting democracy and economic development for the peoples of the Caucasus.
Stabilisation in this region is in the interests both of all countries in the region, and of their partners and neighbours, including European Union countries.
It is in our interests to support all the peoples of the region, not least in the spheres of human rights and freedom of the media.
I hope that the authorities in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia will ensure freedom of speech and freedom of the media in the run-up to the elections that the region is looking forward to in 2008.
In recent days Georgian citizens have had the opportunity to express their democratic will in Presidential elections.
Although President Saakashvili has come out on top in this plebiscite, I am disturbed by the large-scale protests from the opposition, which is trying to undermine the election result, and also by recent events in Georgia that ended in the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations, closure of independent media outlets and the introduction of a state of emergency.
I also wish to express my doubts concerning the deteriorating situation of human rights and freedom of the media in Azerbaijan.
Let us not forget the small and historic peoples of the Caucasus, the Abkhazians and Ossetians, whose right to self-determination should be taken into account in the framework of multilateral dialogue with the Georgian authorities.
Mutual understanding and dialogue are also required in the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, where the independent aspirations of the Armenian section of society should be taken into account and reconciled with the expectations of the Azeri populace and nationality.
All sides should realise that their future and wellbeing depend on the potential to come to an understanding and build mutual relations based on peace and mutual trust.
(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President.
We regularly dedicate attention to the situation and development of the South Caucasus region.
The gradual implementation of the document on interparliamentary cooperation and strengthening the ENP, and of the action plans, will result in positive development.
I would like to show all my appreciation to Mrs Polfer, who has done a good job of summarising and formulating concisely and resolutely these very complicated problems.
The report she has produced clearly sets out the objectives: building up the market economy, supporting economic development effectively and creating energy security, in addition to creating democracy, the rule of law, welfare and security.
Economic growth is faster from one year to the next, but it is true that the effect it should have on the economic and social conditions of the population still cannot be observed.
