The resurgence of democracy we are seeing in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and Africa means that the European Union and the USA must coordinate their action to promote democratic values, to monitor free elections, to encourage the formation of political parties, trade unions and independent civil society organisations and to defend the freedom of the media.
In this new global era, we need a new vision of an international political order based on democracy and human rights.
At this moment in time, both the United States and the European Union must avoid a repeat of the genocide and ethnic cleansing that has taken place before the eyes of the whole world.
A new agreement is needed to achieve this goal.
Its aim should be to bring about closer cooperation between the European Union and the United States in support of freedom, peace and security.
Wherever necessary, it should also provide for joint preventive action to forestall humanitarian or environmental disasters.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our resolution echoes the United Nationsâ Millennium objectives.
The United States and the European Union are jointly committed to implementing this vital programme to reduce world poverty.
The US and the European Union co-manage the Bretton Woods institutions.
This shared responsibility is based, in particular, on that tradition, that tacit agreement which allocates management responsibility for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to Europe and the US respectively.
We should not forget that the IMF was created to preserve the stability of the international monetary system.
It has a very different role today.
All developing countries are effectively dependent on the IMF, on its loans and its benevolence, for the finance needed for their sustainable development.
We cannot ignore the outcome of this policy.
Apart from the fact that the IMF has partly failed in its role of monitoring global economic stability by failing to anticipate â or indeed by actually provoking â a number of regional and international financial crises, we need to assess with the US the negative impact of the conditions, based on the Washington consensus, which the IMF imposes on countries requesting its assistance.
Finally, in the area of global reform of the multilateral system, the agenda for the transatlantic discussions should also include the return of the Bretton Woods institutions into the United Nations system.
Â Â  Mr President, the debate has shown that there are numerous challenges to be faced, jointly and with solidarity, by the US and the European Union.
We also know that there are still many problems in defining better-coordinated positions.
These have been mentioned.
With regard to global warming, our positions are still a long way apart and we know that, without the US, the Kyoto agreement is doomed to failure.
This is therefore something to be discussed with the Americans, with the aim of finally getting them to share this multilateral approach to global warming.
Reform of the United Nations system is another thorny issue, and no true UN reform is possible without US support.
In terms of development policy â as we have already heard, in part, in relation to the Bretton Woods institutions â the Americans, with the Europeans, can really change course and move towards the Millennium objectives in order to generate a new momentum.
A lot of work still has to be done in all these areas.
However, we have made considerable progress in dealing with major crises and serious international problems such as the Middle East, Iran or Sudan.
These are all areas where progress has been made through joint action by Europe and the US in searching for solutions.
I also noted a remark made by many of you that we should, nonetheless, perhaps be thinking about developing the framework for transatlantic relations.
It is slightly curious that two partners who, in principle, are so close to one another, do not have a framework, but rather, in practice, base their relations and cooperation on a mere declaration.
Is this possibly because they such close partners?
That is perhaps a point worth further reflection.
However, I believe that in future we must seriously consider whether it is time to provide a more precise and defined framework for transatlantic relations.
In any event, it is clear from your debates that the forthcoming summit is an important meeting, a meeting which must consolidate the progress made, which must continue to develop our relations in those areas where we have so far been unable to find common ground, and which must also cement the improvement in transatlantic relations which we have seen since the start of this year.
The Luxembourg Presidency, in any event, attaches great importance to this summit and we are very keen for it to be a success â a success for Europe.
This is important because Europe also has to prove to the Americans that it is still capable of action and that internal problems are not restricting its ability to act in the international arena.
Â Â  .
Mr President, as I have said before, there is a reinvigorated willingness to strengthen EU-US relations. This stems from both sides of the Atlantic.
In the political field we have seen cooperation on issues dealing with Iraq, Iran, Sudan, the southern Caucasus, Central Asia and Belarus, not to mention the broader Middle East and the Mediterranean.
On the economic front, much is in place already, but clearly more can be done and we are working together to move in that direction.
It is true that difficulties arise in the field of trade, but it is also true that our difficulties can hopefully be solved more frequently through dialogue.
With regard to the Boeing-Airbus issue, it is unfortunate that last week the United States decided to leave the negotiating table and request a formal dispute settlement procedure in the WTO in respect of alleged subsidies provided to Airbus.
In turn, we decided to resume action in the WTO on the subsidies given to Boeing.
Commissioner Mandelsonâs preferred solution since he took up office last November has been to settle the dispute through negotiations.
A negotiated solution may still eventually be reached following the WTO rulings, but at this point in time the Commission has to protect the interests of Airbus against Boeing.
Despite the regrettable escalation of this dispute, I am confident that recent developments will not affect our bilateral and multilateral cooperation.
On the issue of security measures, both the EU and the US have taken many steps to increase security.
However, we must try to minimise their impact on trade and travel by developing global security standards and enhancing our customs cooperation.
At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Mann for her explicit support for the Commissionâs communication and the study on EU-US relations which we commissioned.
On your repeated call for a transatlantic market to be completed by 2015, the Commission very much shares the objective of further enhancing our already flourishing bilateral EU-US economic relationship.
Indeed, through the 1998 transatlantic economic partnership and the 2002 positive economic agenda, the Commission has been pursuing the same goal, i.e. identifying and possibly eliminating obstacles, particularly in the field of regulations, and ensuring the smooth functioning of this relationship.
Equally, the recently published communication aims to boost EU-US trade and investment, and the creation of a regulatory cooperation forum foreseen by the communication would address regulatory obstacles.
A transatlantic market is already an economic reality, while the elimination of obstacles to trade and investment is an incremental process and we are taking steps in that direction.
On globalisation, we intend to commit ourselves to concluding the Doha Development Round Agenda within the next 12 months at the EU-US summit.
On visas for the citizens of the ten Member States not benefiting from the US visa-waiver programme, I can assure you that we are continuing to urge the US at all levels to recognise the new economic, social and political realities in the ten Member States which acceded to the European Union last year and which should be treated the same as the other Member States.
We welcome in this context the new US visa roadmap for Poland and the planned extension to the other Member States which joined at the last enlargement.
This is an important step in the right direction.
On climate change, we are negotiating with the US on an environment declaration.
We would like to see a substantial commitment to working towards a long-term international regime on climate change post-2012.
We will, therefore, be working to relaunch a high-level EU-US dialogue on the environment.
With regard to your call for an EU-US partnership agreement, I acknowledge that we maintain Treaty relations with the majority of third countries around the globe, yet have no such treaty with our most important partner.
Because we already have solid cooperation, we do not see a need for a transatlantic agreement that would involve long formal negotiations without changing much in substance.
It needs also to be stressed that the transatlantic difficulties of the past were political and not institutional in nature.
The elaboration and defence of consistent EU positions vis-Ã -vis the US do not depend on the existence of a treaty-based structure.
That being said, there is a strong case for reviewing our existing structures and revamping and modernising the new transatlantic agenda of 1995 to adapt it to current needs.
Finally, and in conclusion, I should like to underline again that you are fundamental actors in this strategic alliance and we rely on your support to implement our common agenda.
The communication encourages the setting up of a transatlantic assembly.
Such an assembly could be held in conjunction with the summit.
Â Â  Â I have received five motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Uzbekistan.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Uzbekistan remains extremely serious, with President Karimov continuing to reject calls for an international inquiry into the recent tragic events.
According to the various reports, over 500 Uzbek refugees are still in Kyrgyzstan.
The European Unionâs efforts are currently focused on two aims, namely to put pressure on President Karimov for an international inquiry, and to assist the refugees in Kyrgyzstan.
In the longer term, however, we cannot neglect the need to promote democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the region, as well as to push ahead with internal reforms in Uzbekistan.
At the start of the events in Andijan, the Presidency published a statement, dated 14 May 2005, expressing serious concern at the situation and inviting the parties to refrain from violence and to find a peaceful solution.
The Council followed developments in Uzbekistan closely and discussed this issue at the highest level.
On 23 May 2005, it adopted conclusions on the situation in eastern Uzbekistan.
These conclusions sent an urgent, clear and relevant message to the Uzbek authorities.
The Council expressed its grave concern at the latest developments in eastern Uzbekistan and roundly condemned the excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces.
The Council urged the Uzbek authorities to comply with their international obligations in terms of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
It also invited them to allow the humanitarian agencies and other international organisations immediate and unfettered access to the region concerned.
Additionally, the Council stressed the need to deal with the underlying causes of instability in the country through in-depth internal reforms to be implemented by the Uzbek authorities.
The Council will coordinate its action with the OSCE and other members of the international community such as the Russian Federation and the USA, in order to provide its support to the reform process.
The Councilâs message to the Uzbek authorities is therefore clear: we stand ready to help you, but only if a peaceful and lasting solution can be found to the present situation, and if internal reforms are implemented to deal with the deeper causes of the countryâs instability.
On 1 June 2005, the local British presidency in Tashkent approached the Uzbek Foreign Minister, Mr Ganiev, asking him to request the Uzbek authorities to reconsider their rejection of an independent international inquiry and to draw his attention to the countryâs international obligations.
The invitation by the Uzbek authorities to EU ambassadors resident in Tashkent to observe the national investigation into the events in Andijan, an inquiry to be conducted by the Public Prosecutor and the Uzbek Parliament, is not acceptable as a valid alternative to an independent international inquiry.
The Secretary-General/High Representative, Mr Solana, decided to send his personal representative on human rights, MrÂ Matthiessen, to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
His mission had to be aborted because the Uzbek authorities refused to grant him a visa.
The Council views this episode as a very disappointing â indeed worrying â development in relations between the European Union and Uzbekistan.
Despite President Karimovâs continuing refusal to demands for an independent international inquiry into events in Andijan, the Council will continue to insist and, in conjunction with the OSCE, the UN and other international organisations will coordinate the operational procedures for such an inquiry, in the event that the Uzbek authorities reconsider their decision.
The Council will take appropriate measures in the light of the reply from the Uzbek authorities and the results of the possible inquiry.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission fully subscribes to the Council declaration which clearly and unambiguously sets out our concerns over recent events in Uzbekistan.
We have been shocked by the appalling loss of life.
We are concerned by the resulting movements of people away from the violence over the border with Kyrgyzstan and by the reported excessive and disproportionate use of force by the Uzbek security forces.
It is clear to the Commission that the people of Uzbekistan urgently need to work towards a peaceful and sustainable solution to the present situation.
The Commission notes the suggestion made by the Uzbek authorities in relation to the international inquiry contained in the letter of 31Â May from President Karimov to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, a copy of which was sent to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
It is essential that the Uzbek authorities immediately allow a full independent international inquiry into the recent events.
The Commission considers it important that dialogue is maintained and that it is possible for diplomatic envoys to transmit messages to Uzbekistan.
Even before the shocking recent events, the Commission was working to bolster Uzbekistanâs fragile reform process.
We have to be realistic about what can be achieved, but I believe that working, for example, with the Uzbek Parliament to help create a modern legislature is crucial to improving the lot of the Uzbek people.
What we have seen in Uzbekistan in recent weeks, following the events in Andijan â not only the appalling loss of life, but the response by the authorities to international criticism and the reported crack-down on human rights groups and defenders â only underlines how important it is to keep the reform process alive.
This would be the worst possible moment to pull out or to isolate the country.
At the same time, however, this does not mean business as usual.
The Commission has already sent a delegation of officials to Uzbekistan to investigate what more we can do to support reforms and importantly, to improve living conditions in the Fergana Valley.
In the coming weeks, we shall be finalising our proposals to be implemented under the TACIS programme.
Our existing poverty reduction programme for the Fergana Valley works in all three countries â Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan â amongst which the valley is divided.
There is some scope within our existing resources to do more and the Commission is determined that the opportunity is not missed.
In the meantime, we will continue to work to the TACIS technical assistance programme to promote social and economic reforms, both at the governmental and grassroots civil society level.
While pushing for a fully independent investigation into the events that have already taken place, we must not lose sight of how those who took part in the unrest may yet be treated.
It is clear that the authorities regard all participation as criminal.
In this context, the Commission is looking at a range of projects, including improving the management of prisons and treatment of detainees.
The Commission commends the cooperation between the authorities in Kyrgyzstan â who have been faced with a very difficult humanitarian situation â and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
We therefore welcome the recent decision to relocate the asylum seekers, who currently number 475, away from the border region.
Â Â  . Mr President, much as I welcome the response from the Council presidency and from Commissioner Borg to the effect that they want to exert more pressure on the Uzbek Government and that they also want to target aid more directly towards Uzbek refugees, that cannot conceal the fact that the explosion of violence and the uprising in Uzbekistan are the result of a mixture of abject poverty, heavy political pressure on the part of the state and Muslim fundamentalism.
The brutality with which the Uzbek Government has responded is setting the earth smouldering in Uzbekistan.
In that light, the European Union cannot afford to remain on the fence, for we, including the European Parliament, have a solid relationship with that country.
After all, we also have a cooperation delegation for Central Asia.
Every year, the European Union spends EUR 10 million in aid to Uzbekistan, including a sum for the Uzbek parliament.
In the 2005 budget, I tabled an amendment against this with the intention of freezing part of the budget.
Unfortunately, the amendment was rejected by a majority of one vote. That is odd, since the majority of political parties in Uzbekistan were forbidden to take part in the parliamentary elections.
What is now needed is for the European Union to exert more pressure to get reforms implemented and the legal structure improved.
In addition, all aid that passes via the government or parliament should be frozen, for European resources should not be used to fund state repression.
Civil society and NGOs also need to be supported, and the freedom of the press and religion guaranteed, for it is too crazy for words that churches, among others, should be obstructed and harassed despite being completely unconnected with religious fundamentalism, let alone terrorism or anything else.
In the long run, the political pressure will need to lead to more political freedom and fresh elections.
This is essential, for Uzbekistan, albeit still a poverty-stricken country, has a growing economy.
It is crucial to stability in the region that economic growth should go hand in hand with true democracy and freedom of expression of opinion.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support Parliamentâs motion for a resolution, which echoes the Councilâs position of 23 and 24 May of this year.
I shall not revert to the account of recent events in Uzbekistan, but I should like to reaffirm the need for a rapid and determined response by the European Parliament to the extremely serious situation for the local population, and particularly for the refugees.
In view of the tragic events in Andijan, I would firstly stress the overriding need to set up an international commission of inquiry as soon as possible, to clarify what happened and oblige the Karimov government to face up to its responsibilities.
Additionally, the Union must act with the NGOs and the office of the High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that refugees on the Kyrgyzstan border are well treated.
The European Parliament must also urge Uzbekistan to implement in-depth reforms and put the country on the path to true democracy and economic development for the benefit of all of its citizens.
The proliferation of arbitrary imprisonment and the use of torture and execution must stop, once and for all.
Respect for freedom of expression, and freedom of the press, but also freedom of NGOs, are preconditions for the smooth running of our partnership and cooperation agreements.
I should like to emphasise that the ferment of popular demonstrations and confusion in Uzbekistan is rooted in depressed economic and social conditions, in poverty and in powerlessness in the face of corruption.
Should we use a stick and carrot approach?
If the Tacis programme, with scrupulous monitoring of the allocation of funds, is to continue, we can remind the Karimov government that partnership and cooperation agreements are subject to strict compliance with the clauses on democracy and respect for human rights.
Â Â  . I will speak now as a member of the ALDE Group and as president of the Central Asia delegation.
Honourable Members, today I urge you to show your support for a general resolution condemning the particularly violent reprisals undertaken by Uzbek President Islam Karimov [against protesters] in Andijan.
The President ordered the shooting of people who merely wished for true democracy and real change.
In actual fact, this is a recurrence of the events at Tiananmen Square, and we must present a fair and adequate evaluation of these events.
The nations of Central Asia suffer continuous violations of human rights, and restrictions imposed on the activities of the opposition and mass media.
The development of a civil society in that region is insufficient.
Uzbekistan is a country with the most stringent authoritarian regime in the region.
The country lacks an independent and fair system of courts and freedoms of expression and religion; the activities of opposition parties and civil society are prohibited, the freedom of press is banned and reprisals and torture by the militia are widespread.
Although the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan raises some hopes for a long-term democratic process, the latest events in the Uzbek town of Andijan and the following reactions of neighbouring Central Asian republics are a matter of great concern to us.
The events in Andijan are the expression of the resistance of the Uzbek nation against oppression.
The European Parliament cannot stay aloof.
We need to know what has happened and what is happening now in order for adequate measures to be taken.
We demand an independent investigation of the events.
We urge America to renounce the deployment of its military forces in Uzbekistan, which requires huge payments that essentially contribute to the further strengthening of President Karimovâs regime.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: the priorities of our Parliament should continue to target the prevention of violence and bloodshed.
We must spare no efforts in strengthening civil society and the freedom of speech.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Schmit, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, on 13 May, insurgents and protesters were on the receiving end of brutal treatment from the Uzbek army.
The human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, having interviewed 50 witnesses, all of whose statements concurred, described the result as âa massacreâ.
The extent of the shooting was so enormous and its character so random and disproportionate, that it would not be unreasonable to describe it as butchery.
I am in total agreement with the remarks of both the Council and the Commission, and certainly with Mr Borg when he says that we cannot continue as if nothing has happened, as if it were âbusiness as usualâ.
We in the European Union must give a strong message to this dictatorial and highly authoritarian regime, and so I agree with those Members who insist on more political pressure, on speeding up reforms, on stopping aid from passing via the government or parliament and allowing only grant aid via NGOs; this international enquiry must be mounted, otherwise we cannot simply continue the cooperation and partnership agreement we have concluded with Uzbekistan.

Â Â  Mr President, Uzbekistan is the most populated and culturally the richest of the five central Asian post-Soviet newly independent states.
Uzbekistan has no historic traditions of democracy or good governance, having been ruled in the distant past by Khanates, followed by Tsarists and Soviet Russia, only to find itself unexpectedly a sovereign state in 1991, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
Inevitably the then existing Uzbek nomenclatura filled the power vacuum; hence the composition of the current regime.
There can be no doubt that President Karimov has ruled in an authoritarian way and human rights abuses have been common, particularly against the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of the then Taliban in Afghanistan but now largely defeated or replaced by the nominally peaceful, although still fundamentalist, Hizb ut-Tahrir, which rather surprisingly has offices in the European Union to gather funds and recruit supporters.
During the recent debate on the Coveney human rights report, I tried to strike a balance between the stick of Uzbekistan-bashing and the carrot of more dialogue with the Uzbek President if he continues to cooperate with fighting international terrorism and delivers on his commitment to give independence to the judiciary, freedom to the press and punishment to those responsible for torture and human rights abuses.
Sadly, no sooner had we adopted this report than the Andizhan tragedy occurred.
The full story is still very confused.
Who were these 23 prisoners bounced out of prison by armed insurgents?
Who took civilian hostages to negotiate with the regional governor?
Who called the crowds out to protest?
And who gave the orders for the troops to shoot innocent protestors?
I of course deeply regret Mr Karimovâs refusal of an international inquiry and so I call upon the OSCE to involve the little-known Moscow mechanism last used with Turkmenistan, also an authoritarian regime, to impose an international inquiry and to report with or without Uzbekistanâs consent.
This method, to my mind, is more likely to produce a result than any other.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I welcomed the Council and Commission statement, I would like to say immediately that, in the joint motion for a resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow, I have found an unacceptable paragraph acknowledging the role carried out by Uzbekistan in the fight against international terrorism.
I find the very idea that the West and Europe consider Islam Karimov an ally to be genuinely concerning, because no one who uses terrorist methods against his own people can be considered an ally.
I believe that Parliament and the Commission ought to firmly insist on the creation of an international commission of inquiry that can clarify who was responsible for the massacre.
I believe that the dispatch of official international observers on the ground should also be called for, with the aim of preventing or, at least, impeding continued acts of repression, opposition arrests, attacks against journalists and terrorist violence of the State against the civilian population.
Europe has to be able to clearly distinguish itself in the eyes of the Uzbek people, both from the reason of state of the Russian and Chinese Governments, and from the outright cynicism of Washington, which continues to pay out millions of dollars to Karimov in exchange for military bases.
Â Â  This is not the first time such tragic events have occurred in Uzbekistan, and we must make every effort to ensure that they will not be repeated.
If this does not succeed, it could lead to destabilisation not just in Uzbekistan, but also in the wider region of Central Asia.
Demands for an independent international investigation have already been expressed by the UN through the High Commissioner for Human Rights, by the European Union through its Council and by the OSCE through the Chairman-in-Office of that organisation.
In this light we can of course merely support the decisions of the European Council.
The European Union and others that wish to participate in resolving this extraordinarily complex and challenging issue must be entirely clear about the causes, the course and the consequences of these tragic events.
I believe that alongside the investigation that has been demanded any number of times, there must be a comprehensive analysis of the sources of any further potential destabilisation in Uzbekistan.
I am convinced that the exceptionally complex state of affairs cannot be attributed simply to terrorism or religious fundamentalism.
We should not allow ourselves the luxury of superficial diagnosis, since that could lead to mistaken policies.
Certain other elements of instability have already been mentioned here today.
What is essential for the European Union is that we should make every effort to ensure that within a democratic framework Uzbekistan can arrive at stability and introduce reforms, which would lead to a simplification of the internal political dialogue and then take the country to a higher level of democracy and economic progress.
Â Â  Mr President, it is vital that this country, with its enormous wealth, particularly in terms of gas, should not be destabilised.
That is not in our, or anyoneâs, interest.
We have to concede that there are fundamentalist elements in that country, but they must not be used as a pretext for keeping the Uzbek people in a straightjacket, because that is precisely what is happening.
The government of President Karimov uses this spectre, this more or less genuine threat from fundamentalists, as a way of keeping his oppressive regime in power.
I believe that we must keep up the pressure on the Uzbek Government and on President Karimov.
We must urge him to accept an international inquiry and clearly show our solidarity.
From that point of view, the resolution you are about to adopt is important.
We must make it clear that the European Union will not tolerate the attitudes and policies seen in recent weeks.
Far from destabilising the country, this solidarity must be a way of stabilising it in order to foster democracy, because that is our aim.
I believe that no other pretexts, even serious ones, such as the issue of fundamentalism, can prevent us from bringing strong pressure to bear on that government, one of the most dictatorial regimes in the entire region.
Â Â  . Mr President, we need to remain engaged with the Uzbek authorities if we are to seek reforms in the areas of human rights and democracy.
The Commission also remains active in the humanitarian situation.
We are in close contact with the UNHCR in order to have an assessment of the situation with those who have fled to the border area.
ECHO is monitoring the situation on the ground and, should the need arise, the Commission would be able to quickly mobilise humanitarian assistance.
As I said in my introductory remarks, we believe that we must remain engaged with TACIS programmes, which deal essentially with democratic and economic reforms, these being at the root of the problems that have arisen.
The Commission has already allocated EUR 3 million of assistance to the Uzbek enclaves in Kyrgyz territory for poverty reduction, cross-border cooperation and avoidance of an escalation of tension in this volatile area.
We will keep up the pressure on the Uzbek authorities to institute necessary reforms and establish a democratic society.
We will continue to call for an international inquiry into recent events and to press President Karimov to reconsider his position.
On the issue of the partnership and cooperation agreement, it is our belief that any suspension of this agreement would only serve to cut off the institutional contacts with the authorities.
Whilst we are convinced of the need to keep up the pressure on the Uzbek authorities to allow an international investigation and to take real and concrete action in the field of human rights and democracy, we believe that we must remain engaged in a channel of communication in order to remedy the situation effectively.
Â Â  Â I have received six motions for resolutions(1) tabled pursuant to RuleÂ 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the oral questions (B6-0241/2005 and B6-0232/2005) to the Council and the Commission by Bart Staes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on cooperation within the budgetary authority on the allocation and possible use of the monetary payments resulting from the agreement Commission â Member States/Philip Morris to combat fraud.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr Schmit, Mr Borg, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to explain the background to these two questions by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
The European Union and Member States lose many hundreds, if not billions, of euros every year due to the loss of excise, VAT and customs revenue from the illicit black market trade in tobacco products.
Every container of smuggled cigarettes is costing the European and national authorities lost income to the tune of EUR 1.5 million.
During 1995 and 1996, the European Parliament took the lead in the fight against this type of fraud and set up an enquiry committee, which, with John Tomlinson as chairman and Edward Kellett-Bowman as rapporteur, catalogued the problems that occurred during transit and proposed solutions to them.
The enquiry committee went to the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam where it carefully studied the fraud techniques which criminal organisations, often of a Mafia-like nature, used to evade normal tax obligations.
Let me reiterate that these practices are characteristic of the Mafia, and, over the past few years, they have claimed peopleâs lives; murders have been committed, officials intimidated and bribed, and in some cases, politicians were working hand in glove with the criminals.
The excellent work by the enquiry committee, the research work of our anti-fraud services Uclaf and Olaf, the Cigarette Fraud Task Force and the careful cooperation between customs and police services are now resulting in major networks being rounded up.
In November 2000, the Community lodged a civil complaint before the Court of New York against Philip Morris and Reynolds on account of suspected involvement in the smuggling of cigarettes into the European Union.
Ten Member States joined this lawsuit between January and April 2001.
The bare facts that were brought during the debates before the court against Philip Morris forced the tobacco giant to sign a settlement with the European Commission.
This multi-annual agreement was signed on 9 July 2004 and aims to fight the smuggling and counterfeiting of cigarettes in an effective manner.
At the same time, it puts an end to the legal dispute between the European Union and Philip Morris.
The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris will be paying considerable amounts â as high as USD 1.5 billion â into a bank account managed by the European Commission over a 12-year period.
It represents a departure in terms of anti-fraud policy and ensures that Philip Morris and the European authorities can combine their efforts and work together more closely.
It is likely that this innovative approach will lead to similar agreements being concluded with the other two main tobacco giants 'British American Tobacco' and 'Japan Tobacco' within the not too distant future.
The budgetary authority in the European Union has two arms, namely the Council of Ministers and Parliament.
As Members of Parliament, we are extremely anxious about the way in which the Commission and Member States will handle this unexpected, but considerable windfall.
According to high-level officials within the Council, the lionâs share of Philip Morrisâs funds will end up in the coffers of national Member States.
Apparently, 10% will go to the Commission, while the ten Member States that joined the lawsuit will receive 90%.
Can the Council and the Commission confirm this distribution?
In this context, it does indeed look like the Member States are behaving like grasping opportunists and mediocre accountants.
To me, the 10%-90% split seems to underestimate the efforts on the part of the Commission and Olaf, for what will happen with those funds?
In actual fact they should mainly be used to combat fraud.
I am very aware that the so-called earmarking of certain funds for specific activities is considered undesirable by the budgetary authority, but it strikes me as only fair that the Council and the Commission make the political commitment to this Parliament to using a considerable proportion of this sum to fight fraud and counterfeiting.
Is the Commission prepared to suggest an action plan and a proposal for a budget line to tackle this issue?
So much can be done, including more cross-border cooperation, more computers at borders, more and well-trained inspection staff, reinforcement of customs services, investments in tracing and tracking, more effective follow-up policy and extra manpower for Olaf.
Let us therefore focus on spending funds and not solely on splitting them up.
This is not just about whose money it is; we should also look for value for money.
I am also expecting a progress report from the Commission, possibly behind closed doors, about the negotiations with British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco.
Finally, only on this basis and on the basis of the agreements we conclude can we continue the debate.
From the Council, we expect ideas that transcend the bookkeepersâ mentality and proposals on spending this money wisely.
What is the response to this from the Council and the Commission?
Â Â  Firstly, I should like to point out that the Council attaches great importance to the protection of the European Union's financial interests.
I can also confirm to the honourable Member the Councilâs full agreement with the need to step up the fight against all types of contraband which have developed in recent years.
In that context we should also welcome the agreement between the Commission, ten Member States and the Philip Morris company.
However, with regard to the allocation and use of the amount you refer to, and which appears fair to me, I should point out that this is an agreement entered into by the Commission and ten Member States, which means that the Council, as an institution, is not a party to the matter.
However, I can tell you that discussions between the Commission and these ten Member States on the allocation of the funds have already begun.
I can assure you that, in the excellent spirit of cooperation between our institutions, the Council will ensure you are kept fully informed of developments on this matter, on the basis of information supplied to us.
You raise the question of allocating part of that amount for the benefit of the Community budget.
If part of the funds reverted to the Community budget, the amount involved would have to be entered as revenue, in accordance with applicable budget procedure.
If these funds were used for actions to combat fraud, as you are proposing, it would be up to the Commission, if it felt it appropriate, to submit proposals on which the European Parliament and the Council â the two branches of the budgetary authority â would have to give a view once that proposal was submitted.
The Council has noted, as you emphasised, that the agreement includes the possibility for Member States to use these funds to finance actions to combat fraud.
The Council would like to point out that â since we are dealing with the combat against national fraud using funds which would revert to the national budgets â these funds are the sole responsibility of the Member State concerned.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for its support and efforts, which culminated in the conclusion of an anti-fraud agreement with Phillip Morris International on 9Â July 2004.
This includes the payment of USD 1.25 billion to the European Community and participating Member States over 12 years.
The agreement underlines the importance of anti-fraud policies and is regarded as a major success for the Commission and OLAF.
Since the agreement was signed, the Commission has pointed out that all the other Member States should also join it.
Austria, Ireland, Malta and Poland have recently signed and we hope that the other Member States will soon.
We also sincerely hope that the Phillip Morris agreement can serve as a model for a similar agreement with other companies.
The Commission, on behalf of the European Community, and the ten Member States that concluded the Anti-Contraband and Anti-Counterfeit Agreement with Philip Morris International, will decide how the funds are to be shared out.
Discussions are ongoing and the Commission has repeatedly stressed the urgency of reaching agreement on the distribution of the amounts to be allocated.
In this regard, we are grateful for Parliamentâs support in seeking an adequate share for the Commission allocation.
The agreement is intended to contribute to the fight against smuggling and fraud.
It specifies that the monetary payments may serve as a source of additional funding for anti-contraband and anti-counterfeit initiatives.
However, it does not include specific obligations for their use.
In the BÃ¶sch report on the fight against fraud, adopted only yesterday, Parliament asks the Commission and the Member States to use the payments accruing from the agreement to fund measures to prevent and combat cigarette smuggling, including anti-counterfeiting activities.
Funds received by the European Community under the agreement will be entered in the Community budget as non-earmarked funds, in accordance with the rules of the Financial Regulation applicable.
The Community legislator and the budgetary authority can, however, decide to adopt a new programme or to widen the scope of an existing programme.
The Commission considers that the Community is entitled to receive a fair share of the funds, reflecting the principles of the Communityâs own resources system.
The Commission has been discussing the distribution of the funds with the ten Member States and is confident that a consensus will be reached soon.
In December 2004 Commissioner Kallas sent a letter to the ministers of finance and has convened two meetings on the subject.
A final agreement has not yet been reached.
The question of the share that should be allocated to the Community budget is dependent on the solution that is found to the division of funds between the Member States.
The Commission actively continues to seek a final consensus.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, smuggling and evading the payment of duties are problems which affect all the EU Member States.
For understandable reasons, the problem of the illegal circulation of excisable goods is particularly topical.
According to calculations by the Member States, in 2003 the EU budget suffered a loss of approximately 200Â million euro solely as a result of the illegal trade in cigarettes.
Losses to the Member Statesâ budgets are much greater.
Of course, both the Member Statesâ taxation authorities and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have done a lot to combat the illegal trade in cigarettes.
In this connection, the initiative to combine forces in the fight against the illegal trade in cigarettes at European Union level, bringing in the legal cigarette manufacturers, is to be welcomed.
The cooperation agreement concluded by the European Commission and various EU Member States with Philip Morris International is the first example of this cooperation.
The agreement stipulates that Philip Morris International will improve its cigarette distribution system and will provide more detailed information to the Member Statesâ law enforcement and tax authorities, which is necessary for effectively combating the illegal trade in cigarettes.
In addition to this, over a 12-year period Philip Morris International will pay 1.25 billion US dollars into the EU and Member Statesâ budgets.
The European Parliament considers that, ideally, all these resources, or at least the major part of them, should be channelled into combating and preventing the trade in illegal tobacco products.
The European Parliament, as one of the branches of the EU budgetary authority, considers that Parliament should participate in the decision-making on the distribution and use of these resources.
We consider that those Member States which have not yet subscribed to this agreement, especially the new Member States, ought to seriously weigh up the possibility of joining.
More precise information and extra financial resources will make it possible to combat more effectively the illegal trade in cigarettes and to improve collection of excise duties.
Similar agreements could also be concluded with other tobacco companies, and it is to be hoped that this precedent might also encourage the signing of similar agreements with manufacturers of other excisable goods, such as alcohol.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, our man on the Committee on Budgetary Control, for this initiative.
The Commissioner has already made reference to the fact that we have devoted our attention, in a report that this House adopted yesterday, to the subject of cigarette smuggling, which is one of the really big problems that the European Union currently has to contend with.
One reason for this is that, when the finance ministers find that the money has run out, the first brilliant idea they come up with is that of increasing the duty on tobacco.
This means that illegal cigarettes start coming into the country, and so they still end up with less money than they had before.
What is happening is that the Member States â some of them, I have to say, in full knowledge of what they are doing â are rolling out a red carpet to welcome organised crime.
Reference has already been made to the agreement initiated by the Commission and OLAF.
Tremendous though this is, it does â as the rapporteur noted â have an Achilles heel, in that we did not specify in the agreement what is to be done with the money.
In the event of any such agreements being concluded in the future, it is vital â and Parliament demands â that a formula be specified for how the money is to be shared out.
Moreover, Mr President-in-Office, I too would be very much in favour of the Council discussing what is to be done with this money; it cannot simply be left to each Member State.
There is too great a shortage of customs staff.
Too many of our customs offices are not yet computerised.
Your institution, too, is obliged to give serious thought to this.
We expect the money to be allocated to specific purposes when it is paid out.
I wish to thank our rapporteur, Mr Staes, for this initiative.
Â Â  Like my fellow Member, Mr Dombrovskis, I too have asked for an opportunity to speak briefly on behalf of the new Member States affected by this issue.
As everybody knows, Hungary is situated in the centre of Europe or, as we say, at the heart of Europe.
This means that it lies at the crossroads between north and south, east and west, a crossroads used not only for legitimately traded goods, but also for contraband, including cigarettes, drugs and alcohol.
Halting and curbing traffic in smuggled goods was an important task for our country even before accession; since accession, however, we have become rather like a bastion defending Europe.
For this reason, we were very pleased to hear about this exemplary and significant agreement that has been signed with Philip Morris International, thanks to the decisive action on the part of the European Commission and OLAF.
We think it is very important that it can be extended to the new Member States too, although the Commission has signed the agreement on behalf of only ten Member States.
This means that the advantages it brings in the fight against smuggling and fraud â namely professional, technical and financial support from the EU and OLAF â are now also accessible to us.
We were also pleased that, in recognition of our special situation, OLAF has taken up contact with the Hungarian authorities and is developing this mutually beneficial cooperation, that protects both European and Hungarian financial interests simultaneously.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a complex and important question.
We have been engaged in negotiations with the Member States in an attempt to reach an agreement.
Once again I would like to thank the House for its support of our position.
You have specifically requested that the funds allocated under the agreement should be focused on anti-fraud programmes.
You are well aware, as I said in my previous remarks, that these are extra-budgetary funds.
The focus of our efforts at this point remains the conclusion of an agreement on how the funds are allocated, not only between the Commission and the Member States, but also among the Member States themselves.
The negotiations have been and continue to be difficult, but I am confident that we can resolve the issue in the short term.
As to the programmes to which the funds are to be allocated, the Commission has taken note of the relevant proposal, which will doubtless be considered in due course, once we have reached an agreement on the distribution of the funds.
That agreement should then serve to provide the allocation scale for any future similar agreements.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is Question Time (B6-0246/2005).
We shall be taking the following questions to the Council:
Â Â  The Council confirms that the European Council of 22 and 23 March adopted a European Youth Pact.
It is also about to adopt the employment guidelines, which, in their general introduction, contain a reference to the European Youth Pact.
Additionally, guideline 18, which concerns the working life cycle, contains a reference to that Pact, in the context of youth employment and unemployment.
This guideline will therefore be the object of the follow-up prescribed for all guidelines, based on national reports.
It should also be noted that a certain number of quantified goals of significance for the European Youth Pact had already been adopted in 2003 as part of the employment strategy.
These include, between now and 2010, limiting to six months the deadline for offering employment to young unemployed persons, reducing the school dropout rate to 10% and increasing the number of 22-year-olds having completed secondary education to 85%.
Additionally, the Council has noted the Commissionâs intention to submit, in the near future, a communication specifically concerning the pact and entitled: âResponding to the concerns of young Europeans â Implementation of the European Youth Pact and the promotion of active citizenshipâ.
I believe that the European Union should do more for youth, because the results of the referenda show that young people are the first to lose their enthusiasm for Europe with a majority voting against the Constitution.
It is on the basis of that communication that the Councilâs bodies can begin work on actually implementing the Pact.
Therefore, the Council is not yet able to provide the honourable Member with details of the timetable or an assessment of progress with regard to the European Youth Pact.
Â Â  â Madam President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply, which was comprehensive, and for his particular interest in young people, who should be a concern to us all.
Î€he problem is whether the three parts of the Pact will be represented accordingly in the next youth programme, especially the part on reconciling family life and work; in other words, the possibility for young people to start new families.
Â Â  I think that one of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, in the social and employment spheres, is to reconcile the family, on the one hand, with professional life on the other.
We know that, frequently, in many countries â but not in all â this combination of family and professional life is difficult, due in particular to a lack of crÃšches.
This is an aspect which has already been included in the different employment strategies, but which should also re-emerge in the application of the Youth Pact.
Â Â  The honourable Member is aware that the European Council of 16 and 17 December 2004, while accepting that Turkey adequately met the Copenhagen political criteria so that negotiations for its accession could be opened, clearly indicated at the same time that the Commission would have to continue checking to ensure that the political reform process had been fully and effectively implemented.
The Commission is required to reflect on all subjects of concern featuring in its regular report and in its recommendation, including, of course, freedom of expression and respect for minorities, and to report back to the Council regularly.
During the EU-Turkey Association Council of 26 April this year, the Presidency underlined, on behalf of the Union, the absolute necessity for Turkey to complete the suspended reforms without delay, and to ensure full and effective implementation of those reforms, which clearly imply respect for all rights, particularly freedom of expression.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer.
I must, however, ask whether the Turkish Supreme Courtâs judgment of 25Â May is not cause for alarm, since it takes away childrenâs self-evident right to be educated in their own mother tongue and to develop against their own cultural background.
The judgment by the Supreme Court is a crime against human and democratic rights.
As well as infringing these rights, it also breaks up the teachersâ organisation, which thus loses the right to represent its 200Â 000 members.
It is a crime against the ILO Convention.
The Council should inform Turkey that the door that has been opened will be closed again if human rights are not respected.
Â Â  I believe that respect for the rights of minorities, including the right to speak oneâs own language, must be one of the benchmarks used for measuring respect for democratic principles, with which all current Member States â and also, of course, those applying or wishing to become members in the future â must comply.
I am not sure whether your term âcriminalsâ is appropriate, but, in any event, the rights of minorities are an essential part of our approach to Turkey as well.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union's motto is âunity in diversityâ, and you are well aware that, without respect for that linguistic and cultural diversity, this Europe could not be constructed.
You have responded positively by saying that the Council is concerned and that it is monitoring the issue of Turkey and the right of children to be educated in their mother tongue, but I would like to ask you whether you are going to do more than simply monitor this issue.
I believe that the Council of Ministers should do something with regard to Turkey at this point â draw its attention to the issue in some way â so that in relation to this issue we are not simply awaiting the next report from the Commission on compliance or otherwise with the Community acquis.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do you intend to do in this regard?
Â Â  I would just like to say that the Turkish Public Prosecutor has already lost twice in this particular case, and that the judgment expected shortly, which will undoubtedly go the same way, will be final.
It is clear that, in the forums where the European Union holds discussions with Turkey, all these specific cases and other â let us say more general â cases will be discussed, and I believe we must continue to engage Turkey in this dialogue on issues of freedom of expression, the use of language and trades union freedom.
Â Â  Madam President, when this judgment was given, I put a question to the Commission about the matter, for it concerns citizensâ and human rights, and we have all been horrified at what has happened.
My question to the Council is about whether matters are to be coordinated, given that this is an issue concerning both the Council and the Commission, as well as the European Parliament.
What has happened is very serious.
I wish to know whether you are coordinating matters or whether we should resume the discussion once I receive my answer from the Commission.
Â Â  I believe that there is coordination, but it may be useful to ask the Commission as well.
Â Â  As the following questions deal with the same subject matter, they will be taken together:
On 14 April 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called on the Commission to put forward, before the end of May 2005, a proposal on the establishment of an information system linking those responsible for immigration and asylum policy in the Member States so that they would be notified of important decisions to be taken by one or more Member States.
Meanwhile, the Spanish Government has once again changed the criteria governing the extraordinary regularisation programme currently under way in Spain. It is now possible for immigrants to have their residence in the country authorised even if they were not registered with their local municipal authorities.
When and how was the Council informed of the new criteria?
The Spanish Governmentâs regularisation programme for immigrants ended on 7 May. The programme was a great success, with around 700Â 000 applications being made.
The aim of the programme was to end illegal employment by integrating illegal immigrants into Spanish society.
To achieve this, employment contracts were required for regularisation.
The programme was backed across the board by trade unions, management and civil society.
In addition to ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants, the programme has put Spain in the perfect position to participate in and promote the establishment of a common European policy on immigration.
Does the Council support the successful Spanish regularisation programme as a way of ending illegal employment and integrating illegal immigrants into society by granting them full rights?
Is the Council of the opinion that, as a result of this scheme, the Spanish Government is in a better position to contribute to the establishment of a common European immigration policy?
Â Â  The honourable Members are asked to refer to the answer already given by the Council to an oral question on the same subject.
The Council would like to remind the honourable Member that it is the responsibility of each Member State to determine the volumes of migrant workers to be admitted.
With regard to the regularisation programme implemented by the Spanish Government and referred to in the question, this was discussed informally by the Council at its meeting in January 2005.
The Council would like to remind the honourable Member of the conclusions regarding a mutual information system that it adopted at its meeting on 14 April 2005.
These conclusions call on the Commission to put forward an initiative before the end of May of this year â which it did not do â to create a mutual information system between the authorities of the Member States responsible for immigration and asylum policies.
The Council considered that such a system would help to increase mutual trust and lead to a better coordinated approach to immigration and asylum policies in the Member States.
I therefore invite you to put the question to the Commission as to why it has not put forward the proposal that it was asked for in January.
Â Â  . Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your comments.
I am not going to make a statement, but rather I am going to put a clear and direct question: do you believe that the decisions taken in Spain with regard to illegal immigration make a negative or a positive contribution to the future creation of a common European immigration policy?
Â Â  I will first of all point out that Spain took a decision that it had every right to take.
We are all aware, however, that we want to move towards a better coordinated policy, if not a common policy in this area, which is not yet in place.
It is also true that it is better for a Member State to coordinate such decisions with its partners.
At the same time, I understand that this decision was taken in a specific context and that the objective was precisely to integrate people already in Spain as much as possible and in the best way possible.
Moreover, by integrating them into Spanish society, they are probably prevented from going to other Member States.
In this sense, I do not think that this decision was taken at the expense of other Member States.
It is also clear that we all need to realise that better coordination of immigration at European level is the only solution.
Â Â  . Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe we have debated these issues of a Spanish nature fully â as you have said quite rightly â and furthermore they have been very successful.
I would therefore like to thank you for your patience and for the continuity of your policy and I would like to offer you our cooperation as Spaniards.
Â Â  Patience seems to be a virtue.
Parliament has taught me something about this.
Â Â  On 7Â March 2005, the Council reaffirmed the Unionâs commitment to the accession of Croatia and adopted the framework for negotiations with that country.
The Council also highlighted the importance of full and complete cooperation from all the western Balkan countries with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
This is an essential requirement for them to continue to build closer links with the European Union.
For this reason, after discussion in the Council and in the absence of a mutual agreement, the opening of accession negotiations with Croatia had to be deferred.
In the meantime, a working party consisting of the Presidency, the Secretary General/High Representative, the Commission and the next two Presidencies was created.
Its task is to examine, in close contact with the Tribunal and Croatia, the steps that Croatia has taken and still needs to take in order to achieve full and complete cooperation with the Tribunal.
Under these circumstances, the working party met on 26Â AprilÂ 2005 with the Tribunal and the Croatian party in order to examine recent developments in cooperation between Croatia and the Tribunal.
The group decided that the Councilâs conclusions of December and March were still valid and that the Council would review the matter at the appropriate time on the basis of significant future developments in close cooperation with the Tribunal.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to start by asking whether the Luxembourg Presidency is going to put Croatia on the agenda for next weekâs summit.
I would then like to ask what the thinking is behind it being possible â as I have now heard â for the negotiations with Croatia scheduled for 17 March to be put off the day before, while we are told that the principle of applies to the commencement of negotiations with Turkey on 3Â October.
Why is unanimity required in order to begin negotiations with Croatia but in order to refrain from beginning them with Turkey?
There is no logic to this whatsoever!
Â Â  I will start by pointing out that Croatiaâs cooperation with the Council, and in particular with the working party established within it, has been exemplary; it has also been recognised by the Tribunal, and in particular by its prosecutor.
I think that the decision is still on hold, and I hope that it will be taken and that it will be a positive one.
It will be taken unanimously, as all decisions to open negotiations must be taken.
The European Council may also discuss this particular case, but I do not think that there is any point in discussing it unless we can hope to resolve this issue quickly.
Â Â  The Council would like to thank the honourable Member, Mrs Hennicot, for her close monitoring of this matter, which concerns all of us, especially those of us who have children.
The Council attaches great importance to protecting young people from alcohol, as they are so vulnerable.
As the honourable Member pointed out, on 5 June 2001 the Council adopted a recommendation asking the Member States to curb the production of alcoholic drinks aimed at children and adolescents, and advertising targeted at young people for this type of drink.
Also on 5Â June 2001, conclusions on a strategy to reduce the damage associated with alcohol were adopted by the Council.
In the conclusions, it invited the Commission to put forward proposals for a comprehensive Community strategy in this area which would complement national policies and fix a schedule for various measures.
Following this recommendation, the Council did not remain inactive.
However, as it proved difficult to clearly define alcopop-type products and to direct the measures able to be taken at their targets, it preferred to follow a more general policy in accordance with the aforementioned conclusions of 2001.
It was therefore confirmed that alcohol had an important place in the European Communityâs health strategy and in the Community public health programme for 2003-2008, adopted by codecision with Parliament in September 2002.
This programme enabled projects to be put in place that are jointly funded by the Commission and the Member States and are designed to implement the 2001 recommendation and to prepare a Community prevention strategy on alcohol consumption.
A working party made up of experts from the Member States was also created for this purpose.
In June 2004, the Council adopted its conclusions entitled âAlcohol and young peopleâ, in which it repeated the invitation issued to the Commission to report to it in 2005 on the implementation, by the Member States, of the measures proposed.
The conclusions also supported the work done by the Commission to develop a comprehensive strategy on alcohol consumption, stressing that, as part of that strategy, particular attention should be focused on the problem of alcohol consumption among young people.
Finally, at the Council meeting on 6Â December 2004, this invitation to the Commission was repeated once again.
Between now and the end of 2005, the Commission will in principle be in a position to present, along with the evaluation report requested in the 2001 recommendation, a communication on a comprehensive strategy on alcohol consumption.
When this document is received, the Council will start work as quickly as possible.
It is understood that these initiatives in themselves will not be able to deal specifically with the problem of alcopops.
However, in the long term, they will enable us to establish a Community framework to better inform all citizens, especially young people, about the dangers of alcohol abuse.
Â Â  I would like to thank the Council for tackling the issue of alcoholism among young people.
I think that the health problems due to alcohol and to the high sugar content of the drinks concerned are particularly serious: I am thinking of the increase in diabetes among young people and the problem of obesity.
I do not understand why the Council does not do more to tackle the problem of labelling, because many parents do not know that their children are drinking alcohol when they drink what they take to be lemonade.
Â Â  The Commission, which has on several occasions been invited by the Council to make proposals in this respect, should take into account what the honourable Member has just said.
It should also take into account the level.
This is a question of consumer protection, as people do need to know what they are consuming.
Â Â  President-in-Office, I should like to point out, in relation to health, that one of the big issues with alcohol consumption is its link to youth suicide.
That is a particular problem in Ireland.
It should be given much more emphasis in our strategy.
Secondly, in relation to advertising, we are concerned about toys being advertised to children during children's programmes, but we also advertise alcohol to them and are introducing them to alcohol at a very young age and making it acceptable.
We need to look at this.
Perhaps you could give me your view as to whether that should be included in your future strategy on alcohol and the problems related to it.
Â Â  This clearly demonstrates that the Member States need to be able to act quickly and that they have the right to do so.
In this area, subsidiarity can be applied and some of the principles of the free market cannot be invoked.
It is not simply a matter of free movement of goods, but above all of health protection.
I therefore think that it is through examples such as this that Europe should show that it is not rigidly set in a framework that does not recognise real concerns.
Thank you for asking me this question, but it should be put to the Commission instead.
Â Â  Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to put a supplementary question. I have one for the Council, and it is this.
Are there any alcoholic drinks that are â as MrsÂ Hennicot-Schoepges has said â demonstrably targeted at children and young people?
Secondly, is the Council aware that there are mature adults who like the taste of these drinks and who are penalised by the special duty that is already imposed on them in Germany, to give one example?
Thirdly, does the Council agree with me that, rather than seeking centralised solutions through tax systems that treat people as less than adult, it would be better for us to educate children, young people, adults and senior citizens about the dangers of alcohol in general?
Â Â  I do not think that what you said is in contradiction with what I just explained.
It is clear that these drinks are not solely aimed at children or adolescents.
In principle, if we give the producers the benefit of the doubt, I do not think that these products are aimed at adolescents.
However, they do have a particular attraction for this group of the population.
You mentioned taxation.
This is true, but what is needed above all is an information campaign among young people, because taxation alone is not a solution.
It is, first of all, up to the Member States to take all the steps, and the Member States need to be placed in a position, and to be given some degree of freedom, to take these decisions without encountering problems at the end of the line, because, theoretically, they have interfered with the free market and the free movement of goods.
I therefore think that this is the point on which the European Union should also adopt a position regarding these products.
Â Â  So far, 21 Member States have notified the Secretariat General of the Council that they have transposed the framework decision of 13Â June 2002 on joint investigation teams.
These Member States can therefore create joint investigation teams in accordance with the framework decision.
Two Member States have also informed the Secretariat General of the Council that their draft legislation transposing this framework decision has already been submitted to their parliaments, or will be soon.
One Member State has informed the Council that it has partially transposed the framework decision.
Â Â  I am not very good at mathematics, but I make that 24, so one of the Member States you told me nothing about at all.
What are you doing about the one Member State that apparently is doing nothing about it?
Â Â  I need to check whether in fact there are only twenty-four.
I need to check whether there is indeed one Member State that has not responded. I cannot give you the information now, but I promise you that I will check.
I am sure that the information can be supplied in writing.
Â Â  Question No 8 has been withdrawn.
Â Â  Madam President, on a point of order on which I would appreciate your advice, I was told a moment ago by sessional services that this question has been withdrawn, but I understand that normally every MEP has access to the full list of questions.
Every MEP has the right to ask a supplementary question, and yet there seems to be no obligation on the person withdrawing the question to tell all the other Members that he has done so.
So those of us who have come to ask a supplementary question are being denied our democratic right.
If that really is the case, would you not agree that the rules need to be reviewed?
Alternatively, can I ask a supplementary question to Mr Newton Dunnâs question?
Clearly it is a crime that I cannot ask a supplementary question, and it has clearly been organised by the Socialists!
Â Â  There are no crimes organised in this House, Mr Bushill-Matthews; we treat each other democratically, amicably and peacefully.
As regards the question that has been withdrawn, the rules are perfectly clear: if a question is withdrawn by the person who tabled it, it no longer exists, and so you are no longer in a position to put a supplementary question.
Whether Members should inform each other â even Members of other Groups â when this happens is an interesting question.
I would simply advise you to start by discussing this with Mr Martin.
If you have a question you would like to put now supplementary to Mr Newton Dunnâs, then I will allow it on the grounds that two supplementary questions are allowed to each question.
So please go ahead and ask the President-in-Office of the Council something else about organised crime.
Â Â  That is very gracious of you, Madam President, but that would be cheating because my question is about working time and I would not wish to cheat.
Â Â  That is very fair.
We shall continue to discuss what is to be done when Members withdraw questions.
Â Â  The Council is aware of the tragic situation of millions of children living in the majority of developing countries in general, and in Africa in particular, especially due to their vulnerability to famine, violence, infectious diseases and above all, of course, AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
The Council would like to point out that the eight Millennium Development Goals target children either directly or indirectly.
The Council does not believe that it will be possible to achieve these goals by 2015 without a coherent policy for children in the developing countries.
The Council has highlighted the need to focus specifically on children in implementing the European Unionâs development policy, through a series of recent initiatives.
On 16 December 2004, the European Council confirmed the European Unionâs firm commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals.
During this session, the Council indicated its firm support for the European action plan to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, through external action.
The Commission presented them at the end of April 2005.
Joint action between the European Union and the Member States, in cooperation with the main international organisations in the sector, including UNICEF, and with teachers and parents associations in the partner countries is planned.
The review process of the joint declaration of November 2000 on the European Unionâs development policy is underway.
A communication from the Commission on the future development policy is expected at the end of June.
During the extended consultation process, several subjects were identified as possible priority themes, which definitely included child protection.
It should also be pointed out that at Community level, in 2004 Parliament and the Council adopted Decision 803/2004 adopting the DaphneÂ II programme to prevent and eradicate violence, particularly against children.
In conclusion, children are a fundamental dimension of European Union development policy and the Council intends to highlight this priority, both in the context of preparing for the summit on the attainment of the Millennium Goals, which will take place in September 2005 in New York, and in the process of formulating the Unionâs future development policy.
Â Â  Mr President-in-Office, I thank your for that very detailed response.
I should like to ask you to take on board the views of those who know more about children in the developing world than perhaps you or I do, and who are concerned about the fact that we are perceived as a Union that concentrates more on large infrastructural projects than on children, and perhaps to think more deeply about the needs of children in terms of medical care and other assistance.
I accept what you have said, but I would ask you to analyse more deeply the views of those who know.
Â Â  I agree with your analysis: we need to listen to the NGOs.
When formulating development policy for the next few years, which for the Union consists of transposing the Millennium Goals, these aspects must be specifically taken into account.
In any case, I can assure you that the Luxembourg Presidency, which is still in charge of this issue until the end of this month, will take care to ensure that this objective of the protection of children is one of the major objectives of our development strategy.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return in particular to one of the topics mentioned: the issue of AIDS and HIV.
On 2 December 2004, this House voted in favour of a very precise resolution and called for the involvement of the Commission and the Council, with the particular aim of amending the existing TRIPS rules, which are one of the fundamental factors preventing adults and children living in the southern countries of the world from having access to medicines.
As far as I am aware, nothing has been done in this specific area, that is, amending the TRIPS rules, and I should like to ask the reason for this, partly because the situation has lately become even more tragic with the TRIPS rules being adopted by the Indian Government.
Â Â  I think that, as I have already said, the Council has strongly supported the European action programme to combat AIDS and other diseases.
The Council has also expressed a desire to work on the matter of essential medication and has supported changes aimed at making some AIDS drugs accessible.
There is a problem with this at the WTO that has not been resolved.
We are among the largest donors to the fight against AIDS, as, without this money, we would not be in a position to better combat AIDS in the developing countries.
Europe has more or less fulfilled its commitments, unlike others.
Â Â  Question 9 by my colleague, Mrs McGuinness, is very close to my own, question 11, and again, we are not going to get to another question.
I find that very frustrating.
On many occasions we wait here and you do not get to our questions.
We talk about action plans for the Third World, especially with regard to children, but we never hear of any detailed plans or exact initiatives in this area.
I know it is very complicated and difficult, but very rarely do we hear any details of what is happening on the ground in these parts of the world and how we are tackling the serious problem of children with HIV and AIDS.
Â Â  You raise a very relevant and interesting issue.
I think that you need to ask the Commission - as it is the Commission that needs to answer this question - what actual specific measures are in place, through the various European Union aid programmes, to combat the problems of AIDS or similar problems.
I think that you have every right to ask the Commission to provide you with an accurate report on specific measures for this purpose.
Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position to do so, as it is the Commission that implements these programmes and measures.
Â Â  I would like to point out that the plenary decided on Monday that Question Time was to be cut down to half an hour, and we have already spent three-quarters of an hour on it.
I will not now allow the floor to make any more points of order.
As the scheduled Question Time is over, Questions 12 to 30 will be answered in writing(1).
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (COM(2005)0154 C6-0119/2005 2005/0064(SYN)) (A6-0168/2005)
and the report by Othmar Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (COM(2005)0155 C6-0120/2005 2005/0061(CNS)) (A6-0158/2005)
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 26 April I had the pleasure of presenting to you in committee the modifications of the two Regulations providing the basis for the Stability and Growth Pact, which the College of Commissioners had approved on the 20th of that same month.
Five weeks later we debated the reports by MrÂ Karas on the two regulations here in the plenary of the European Parliament, which is another demonstration of the good spirit of cooperation in which this Parliament has dealt with this important issue.
Over these few weeks, Parliament, the Council and we in the Commission have worked to complete the legislative process of reforming the Pact before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Following this first phase of examining the Commissionâs proposals here in Parliament, we will be closer to an agreement, which could be reached ââ and I hope it will be reached, if at all possible ââ before the end of this month.
As I explained when I appeared in committee, our proposal, in accordance with the mandate of the European Council ââ which, in turn, had supported the report of the Ecofin Council in March ââ was restricted to the modifications of the Regulations that were strictly necessary in order to make them compatible with the Councilâs agreement.
Nevertheless, during the Councilâs work, several Member States have argued that certain provisions should be included in the articles of the Regulation, such as, for example, the minimum annual fiscal adjustment of 0.5% of gross domestic product for countries in situations of excessive deficit or which need to move closer to a position of medium-term balance, or the explicit indication of other relevant factors.
These requests have prolonged the discussion on certain points on which there was already agreement in the Council by a few days.
Fortunately, that agreement has been maintained, and according to my information, the Councilâs working group has reached a final agreement on the issue today.
For its part, Parliament, by means of the report by MrÂ Karas, has expressed its concern about certain parameters that effect the credibility of multilateral budgetary surveillance, such as, for example, the quality of national fiscal statistics, the surveillance of debt or the reliability of macroeconomic forecasts.
Parliament also, entirely legitimately, demands that it be regularly informed about excessive deficit procedures.
Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that the Commission has the same concerns as Parliament.
Many of them have been taken up, or can be taken up, in some of the different components of the raft of legal texts regulating the coordination of economic policies in the Economic and Monetary Union.
In the Commissionâs view, certain other concerns expressed in some of the amendments in the reports by Mr Karas ââ I am referring specifically to the surveillance of debt and regular information for Parliament on excessive deficit procedures ââ may perfectly well be included in the Pactâs Regulations.
I said this just this week, on Monday, to the Eurogroup ministers, and I also made certain specific comments about how they could be taken up.
It naturally falls to the Council to take these suggestions into consideration and it will then formally express its opinion next Monday, I believe.
In any event, I hope that our cooperation over recent weeks will be maintained until the end of the legislative procedure, in order to provide us, as soon as possible, with a renewed Stability and Growth Pact that is suited to the true economic dynamic of the Member States, from both political and legal points of view.
The broad consensus relating to this reform is undoubtedly contributing to increasing the credibility of the Pact and demonstrating an unequivocal desire to promote healthier public finances as a condition necessary for sustained economic growth.
Just yesterday, right here in Strasbourg, the College of Commissioners adopted a report which recommends the initiation of an excessive deficit procedure with regard to a Member State, Italy.
This is a further example of the effectiveness of the Stability and Growth Pact and a practical example of the spirit stemming from the reform of the Pact.
It is also an indication that we must hold a discussion on the Pactâs operational rules as soon as possible and focus on the application of those rules and on the practical implementation of the Pactâs principles and guidelines.
Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to stress that if one thing has been made clear by the recent votes against the draft European Constitution in France and the Netherlands, it is, I believe, the need to act and to achieve concrete results that bring tangible benefits in terms of the well-being of the citizens, beginning with employment and the strengthening of our social model.
Hence the need to reach a final agreement over the coming weeks on the reform of the Pact, which will provide the foundations for decisive action by the European Union to make our economies more dynamic, to generate employment and to promote the sustainability of our levels of social cohesion.
The efforts of all the institutions ââ Parliament, the Council and the Commission ââ are moving in this direction and I am convinced that they will allow the modified regulations to be adopted before the end of this month and hence before the end of the Luxembourg Presidency.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking those present for their excellent cooperation over recent years and during the preparation of the reports which we are debating here today.
I intend to divide my comments into two parts.
I have a few words to say on the Stability and Growth Pact, after which I shall turn my attention to the two regulations.
I see the approach taken by many of those in public office to the Stability and Growth Pact, which was included in the Treaty and signed in Amsterdam in 1997, as a clear example of the double standards of numerous politicians and the double game they play between domestic policy and Brussels.
Unfortunately, it sometimes had to be used in the past as an excuse for the purpose of making popular statements at home, rather than being used to safeguard, in a spirit of solidarity, the acceptance of responsibility in the European Union.
I do not see the Stability and Growth Pact as an onerous duty or laborious task imposed by the European Union; on the contrary, it is a necessary coordination framework for national budgetary policy within the framework of monetary union, in which, while monetary policy is centralised, budgetary policy is a national matter.
However, one thing is certain: the incentive structures for budgetary policy have changed with monetary union.
Before, the penalties of the financial markets were clearer and stronger.
If, for example, Italy pursued a shaky budgetary policy, interest on the financial markets rose instantly in anticipation of devaluation.
Now governments do not have such a clear idea of what the financial markets make of poor budgetary policy.
The continually criticised penalties and sanctions at the end of a long process therefore make sense, as the financial markets no longer have their previous powers.
Another point is that, unfortunately, it is not possible in monetary union to avoid oneâs dues and pursue a budgetary policy with no sense of solidarity.
That is why coordination is needed, in order to relieve the burden on monetary policy as a whole and make sure that interest rates stay low.
It is for me beyond question that there should be a framework for budgetary policy in the Member States in monetary union, including for the purpose of preventing excessive debt and guaranteeing monetary stability.
In my view, the Stability Pact has a persistent design fault which, unfortunately, we cannot repair because it is in the Treaty.
Unfortunately, the sinners can stand in judgment and, as they have done in the past, disregard what the Commission proposes in its capacity as guardian of the Treaties.
This has led to a loss of trust and credibility and has, at times, been an expression of action with no sense of solidarity.
Nonetheless, the euro is a success, as is the Stability and Growth Pact, for, without it, we would not have had the debates on the causes of deficit and the objectives of budgetary policy.
It is also the basis of today's debate and the basis for the necessary reforms and adjustments being made.
I think it is a good thing that there is this framework, because it allows us to talk about deficits, the causes of deficits and the effects of deficits more intensively and in all openness.
The public have more confidence in the euro than in many of the European Unionâs other political projects.
However, the subject of today's debate is not the Stability Pact per se; it is the Commission's two proposals for regulations based on the decision taken by the European Council of 22 and 23 March.
Both the majority in committee and I as rapporteur have taken note of the Council conclusions; we do not question these decisions, but we do judge these two proposals for regulations on the basis of principles and statements.
Our aim in our evaluation of the proposals for resolutions, was to bring about greater transparency, define rather than interpret and implement rather than avoid the decisions promised.
We want greater transparency and better definitions.
Different procedures apply to these two regulations.
Regulation No 1466/97 on the preventative aspects is governed by the cooperation procedure, while Regulation No 1467/97 on the excessive deficit procedure is governed by the consultation procedure with the Commission and the Council.
I should like to comment first on the regulation on the preventative aspects, in respect of which our committee made two central demands.
Firstly, we want the quality of statistics to be improved; although Greece is not the only example of this, it is one with which we are all familiar.
We feel that the quality of statistics at national and Community level must be ensured in order to guarantee the independence, integrity and accountability of both national statistical offices and Eurostat.
Secondly, we want the Commission not only to accept statistics, but also to conduct the dialogue in the Member State with the acting persons and institutions for the purpose of analysing the situation.
We want stronger cooperation with the European Central Bank, because we cannot have a situation in which two different statistics are audited even though they are not comparable and possible contradictions result in questions from the Commission to the Member State.
This cooperation, these comparisons, this interpretation and questions of cooperation between the European Central Bank and the Commission during the evaluation and comparison of statistics is important for us.
Secondly, we want medium-term budgetary objectives to be reviewed at least annually rather than regularly and for the general government debt ratio to be taken into account.
For Regulation No 1467/97 on the excessive deficit procedure, we want a clear definition of exceptional factors, because the interpretation is too broad here and there is too little transparency.
We want minimum European standards for budgetary planning to be created.
The Commission should specify the parameters to the Member States, including for more uniform growth forecasting.
We want the maximum deadline for regaining targets to be limited to three years from when the deficit occurred.
We are also of the opinion that we need a specific list of relevant factors to be taken into account in the deficit procedure.
We accept the proposal as it stands.
We want to make it more specific, accountable and credible and to reduce the margin for interpretation, so that it is easier to guarantee compliance, and we want to use these two regulations to give the Pact more credibility, win back confidence in it and hence respond to uncertainty among the people about the degree of seriousness with which European decisions are addressed.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, we have often debated the Stability Pact here in the past.
I thank the rapporteur for his report, which has built on the Council decision and finished the job, although I cannot hide the fact â and I say so directly â that I am not happy with the Council decision.
The precondition to a Stability and Growth Pact in an area with a single currency is that budgetary policies should converge, that they should not diverge too greatly.
What is ultimately at stake is nothing other than the viability of our currency.
We have had enough material for discussion over recent days about the views that many, including many in positions of political responsibility, take of this and, where possible, debates in previous months also made a further contribution.
We expect the Commission â as the rapporteur said â to set out exactly how the Council decision will be interpreted through the regulations in the future.
What is meant by a âslight excessâ or a âtemporaryâ one?
Which ranges will be accepted by the Commission in future?
I hope and wait for the Commission to be strict here and we shall soon see how â with one eye on Italy â it approaches the new Pact and if it is worth the paper it is written on.
I hope for the necessary strictness here. I also hope that the Commission will always put its finger on the actual problems.
Making correlations of this kind between unemployment and the Stability Pact is typical of the cheap policy being pursued in the nation states, and so we should not be surprised if a majority of people believed in the referenda what the nation states convey in Brussels: that the euro is responsible for unemployment and it would be best to get rid of it.
The Commission has a huge responsibility not to give into these cheap arguments by the nation states and, if it comes down to it, to draw the necessary conclusions, take recourse to the Court of Justice where necessary and fight for the euro, a strong currency and the future, as did its predecessors.
This regulation and the Council decision do not make your life any easier.
You will have even more responsibility for it.
I wish you luck with it.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the political situation in the European Union is too serious to get lost in legal wrangling over the Stability and Growth Pact.
Twenty-five Heads of State or Government have recognised the necessity of applying the Stability and Growth Pact flexibly to allow adjustments to be made to economic cycles.
They have adopted the Commissionâs proposals without amendment, allowing the renewed pact to come into force quickly.
This House really should not try to be more Catholic than the Pope.
We must stop elevating stability to dogma.
Stability is necessary.
No one can live on credit for ever, not even the Americans.
All the same, they do take a more pragmatic approach to fiscal policy, they have both deficits and growth.
The euro zone is sinking into stagnation.
Economic policy is not an exact science.
A balanced budget is not enough for growth and job creation.
The nations of Europe are in revolt because the European Union seems to have no other policy to offer than budget austerity.
The EU needs to be jump started, we need to stimulate demand and encourage investment.
So-called structural reforms that cut wage earnersâ purchasing power will not fill manufacturersâ order books.
The Stability and Growth Pact was invented to prevent the states of the euro zone from having too much recourse to the capital market.
Excessive public borrowing would push up interest rates, penalise private investors and be inflationary.
The opposite has happened, however.
Despite some statesâ repeated breaches of the pactâs rules, the euro has become strong, inflation is still low and interest rates are at rock bottom.
Moreover, the right seems to think that the Stability and Growth Pact has proved satisfactory despite the failings of a few major countries.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, for example, adopted an amendment to my report on the broad economic policy guidelines saying: âWhereas the Stability and Growth Pact has contributed to maintaining a low level of inflation and historically low levels of interest rates ...â
This statement of faith, which ignores the role of the European Central Bank, apparently means that the breaches of the Stability and Growth Pact are not having the macroeconomic consequences we are hearing about.
Joking apart, however, the truth is that Europeâs economic situation is much better seen from outside.
The worldâs leading exporter and the biggest market for the rest of the world, the European Union is an economic giant that is still highly competitive.
We cannot compete with the Chinese in tee-shirts and jeans, it is true, but our consumers have the benefit of this free boost to their purchasing power.
At the same time, Europe is moving forward in high value-added products.
Take the motor industry, for example.
While bonds issued by General Motors and Ford have been downgraded to junk bond level, the most recent statistics show that the European industry ranks first in the world for the number of cars produced: 17.2 million in Europe, 14.6 million of them in the Union of the Fifteen.
The United States, the home of mass production, made only 4.5 million cars in 2003, and that includes a large number of Japanese cars manufactured there.
I could quote many more examples.
My conclusion is clear.
We must stop being pessimistic about Europe and bolster European confidence again, especially consumer confidence.
The high savings rates in France, Germany and Italy denote an unjustified fear for the future.
The conduct of economic policy demands stability, yes, but above all growth and also a psychological campaign to restore confidence.
We must therefore send our people a much more optimistic message.
Â Â  . The latest available data prove that public finances in the European Union are a well-kept secret, because we can be aware of some figures only later to find out that the true figures are quite different.
This is a problem we should address irrespective of whether we are speaking of a small or a big country.
Therefore, the proposals drawn up by the Commission are truly well-timed and necessary; however, as a representative of the Lithuanian state, which has always showed due diligence in implementing stringent fiscal policy and cost-saving measures at the expense of public services so as to execute all European Union requirements, I can only regret that we have learnt now that we possibly may not have had to implement those requirements.
I am saying this to make you understand the reaction of new Members.
I would like to emphasise that we should not expect any of our decisions or audit missions to ensure the transparency of public finances, reliability of data and the stability of finances directly.
This should be done by the Member States themselves.
They must achieve the actual implementation of all provisions.
Therefore, I regret that the Code of Ethics has not been presented as yet and that the provisions of this reviewed version of the Stability and Growth Pact, as proposed, may not be observed.
Why was it necessary to carry out the revision in view of the probability that we may not actually follow its new provisions?
In general, the review of the Stability and Growth Pact is not a bad thing, as the experience in my country has shown that excessively stringent regulations curb growth and produce certain deflationary pressures.
Moreover, structural reforms are impossible to implement without additional expenditures; however, we should not forget that all this can only be achieved via the coordination of economic policy, which should be future-oriented and secure.
The European Union countries have no choice but to achieve financial stability and coordinate economic policy and measures, as we have mentioned during our morning discussion of the Constitution.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if there is one point on which I agree with the rapporteur, MrÂ Karas, it is that the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is still a very long way from giving Europe the capacity for economic governance that would allow it to satisfy all its citizens, both of this generation and those to come.
We are still a long way from the situation in the United States, a much more integrated federation than our own, where there is a significant federal budget, where there are rules for coordinating the budgets of the federal states, where budgetary policy and monetary policy are closely coordinated by Congress, where Congress is able to influence the options taken by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and where the Federal Reserveâs objectives are wider than mere price stability.
Having said that, I believe that Commissioner Almuniaâs proposals, from the previous term of office to their adoption by the Council in a more improved version, are an extremely positive step, and our Group will oppose the calls âÂ from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in particular â for backtracking to what the former Commission President called a more stupid pact.
We think we have taken a significant step towards an intelligent pact.
If we may still make a contribution, simply by way of clarification, we suggest, in one of our amendments, both including education expenditure alongside research expenditure among the relevant factors that might justify an increase in the deficit, and making explicit mention of expenditure for the stability of the worldâs ecological balance among the Unionâs objectives.
By this we mean expenditure for the implementation of the Kyoto Agreement.
Â Â  . â Mr President, we have long been warning of the economic and social consequences of implementing the Stability and Growth Pact and of the risks of attaching absolute priority to nominal convergence, without taking account of the reality of each Member State, their differing levels of development and varying budgetary needs.
The irrational nature of the criteria â public deficit below 3% of GDP, public debt below 60%, or indeed the subsequent objectives of achieving zero deficit â did not, and still does not, have any economic justification.
We have always said that following this path would have an adverse effect on economic growth and jobs, and this is being borne out by reality.
Furthermore, the recession in countries with excessive deficit has been exacerbated by the possibility of fines, the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact and constraints on public investment, and, by extension, on the proper implementation of the Structural Funds.
This is one of the main factors behind the so-called âdeteriorationâ in the EU accounts, an issue that has come to the fore in recent years, and to which the over-valuation of the euro has certainly contributed.
Current economic and social reality bears out our stance.
This was also the case when ex-President Prodi and other Members of his Commission controversially labelled the Stability and Growth Pact as âstupidâ and as having âmedievalâ criteria.
This is why we are holding this debate today.
Furthermore, the Stability and Growth Pact would not otherwise have been revised, aside from the many cosmetic changes made at last yearâs Spring European Council.
It is now true that the Council and the Commission have repeatedly said that a degree of sanity needs to be restored to the Stability and Growth Pact, that relevant factors in the analysis of budgetary situations must be taken into account, and that the objective of zero deficit is not the be-all-and-end-all.
They insist, however, on maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact as a key instrument in achieving their neoliberal aims of undermining the public sector and the social responsibilities of the State, whilst promoting price stability, wage moderation and the privatisation, most worryingly, of social security.
The Council therefore reaffirms the aims of the Stability Pact and its benchmarks, and prevents any expenditure from being excluded from the deficit calculation.
What the Council adopted was simply the provision of more time, especially to countries guilty of non-compliance such as Germany and France.
The room for interpretation on the basis of the Lisbon structural reforms â what is known as the âLisbonisationâ of the Pact â is little more than a means of enabling the more powerful countries to make interpretations that suit their interests, and not intrinsically for us to have an Pact.
What we need is to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact and to make a clean break from the current economic guidelines â this was the clear message from the French and Dutch no votes on the so-called âEuropean Constitutionâ â in order to create the macro-economic conditions to revitalise the economy, to stimulate job creation and to work proactively to combat growing unemployment and high poverty and inequality levels in the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, I do not know why we are having this debate.
Mr Karas acknowledges that the Stability Pact relies on Member States disciplining themselves.
He needs to go a step further in deducing that, for that very reason, the pact cannot work; it never could work.
So I regret that his well-intentioned attempts to try and make it work by tightening definitions will be in vain.
Rather than pretending that fiscal discipline can be achieved, we should consider the consequences when it is not achieved.
Let me focus on Italy, where the deficit has now been shown to have been above the 3% margin for several years; debt is 106% of GDP; inflation is making the economy increasingly uncompetitive and economic growth is negative.
The real danger here is that these conditions will culminate in a credible threat from Italy to reissue its own national currency, enabling it to devalue and thereby regain competitiveness without painful and prolonged deflation.
Such an action would have serious Argentina-style results for Italy but could, nevertheless, be seen as the best course of action.
But a decision by Italy to re-issue the lira would undermine confidence in the ability of the euro to survive as a multinational currency.
Other EU countries would then be faced with the prospect of providing the Italian Government with large-scale financial assistance to persuade it to stay with the euro.
Â Â  . Mr President, unfortunately the credibility of the European Union has been increasingly questioned over the past few weeks.
Rather than trying to construct a new consensus, as Mr Barroso suggested last week, we should concentrate on strengthening the current European consensus on competitive markets, fiscal discipline and hard currency.
Sound economics, realism and results are what citizens are demanding and what are needed to continue to build the European project.
Economic reform is needed to create vibrant economies, as has been proven in a number of cases in Europe.
If we want enlightened social policies, in the European tradition, we need to reform our economies.
The examples are there for all to see.
The revised Stability and Growth Pact gives more countries more time to correct excessive deficits and provides more leeway for countries with strong public finances.
Monetary union requires this level of flexibility, so that more internal market competition can be stimulated.
The one-size-fits-all situation was always going to be a problem.
However, some countries need to cut back on their budgets and others â like my own, Ireland â need to spend more on infrastructure, because they have a deficit, but that is not allowed under the rules.
However, giving an inch in terms of flexibility does not mean countries are allowed to take a mile in terms of widening fiscal deficits.
Enforcement of the rules is the key.
There must always be confidence in the fiscal framework that underpins the European Union.
The recent drop in the euro has been used as a convenient whipping boy for all that has happened recently with the European Constitution.
The problem is not with the euro.
The problem in some countries is that they are avoiding the stark reality that the world economy is changing and will continue to change.
Todayâs world economic order demands a lot more, a lot faster and a lot cheaper.
Going back to the basics of economics, countries either meet this demand or it will be met elsewhere.
There is no point in lamenting over the basic economic principle; there is no point in arguing that we do not have a means of competing with the global economy.
We do, and it is the Stability and Growth Pact.
However, the failure to enforce these rules has left too many countries stagnating in an economic period that no longer exists.
We cannot continue like this, because it is undermining the credibility of the overall EMU framework.
Consequently, this has had broader repercussions in sending a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself.
This has never been more obvious than it is at present.
Europe is suffering from a credibility problem and to deal with it we urgently need to evolve from rule makers to economic performers.
Sound economics, realism and results are what the citizens want, and our job is to deliver.
Â Â  Questions relating to increased monitoring of the state of budgets, such as the issue of speeding up and clarifying procedures applicable in the case of excessive deficits, are those where parliamentary institutions, as independent and directly-elected institutions at both EU and Member State level, can and should play the role of guardians of the soundness of economic policies, especially as regards their budgetary and deficit-generating consequences.
In this respect, I consider the European Parliamentâs proposed amendments to be positive, and greatly appreciate them.
The package of Council directives will, however, remain an open document that will, for a long time to come, enable the national governments to use various means to escape this prudent budgetary and deficit framework, to employ more or less obvious forms of putting their countries into debt and to skilfully disguise the expenditure of one-off, unique resources, such as those from privatisation, for governmentsâ current economic management.
Naturally, this meets the purposes of short-term government policies.
The path ahead of us is therefore still a long one, but it is one that we must travel.
Â Â  Mr President, the Stability and Growth Pact crops up regularly in debates on the economy in this Chamber.
This is an illustration of the central position this agreement has in EU economic policy-making.
In this respect, I wish to congratulate my colleague, Mr Karas, on his two reports on this subject.
The reportâs emphasis on a stronger role for the Commission in enforcing budgetary discipline is an absolutely necessary development.
Especially now, in their watered-down format, the Commission will have to enforce a clear and strict line with regard to the rules of the pact.
Furthermore, the absence of the European Parliament in the decision governing the Stability and Growth Pact is rightly highlighted as a serious structural flaw in European economic governance.
As the only directly democratically elected EU institution, this Parliament could play a vital role in putting an end to the political horseplay that goes on in the Council and provide the pact with the much needed credibility that many colleagues want.
However, let us not fool ourselves: even with the improved institutional feedback mechanisms that this report suggests, it is not the Stability Pact alone that will lift Europe out of its economic slumber.
Helpful as they are, it is not a set of rules that will help us to put public finances in Europe on a strong footing.
What we need is economic growth and advances in competitivity, and these derive not from the rules of the pact but from meaningful economic reform, something which many European Member States have avoided for far too long.
So we have a new pact and I hope, with Mr Karasâ reports, a better way of making the rules work in a sensible and equal fashion.
But until countries achieve meaningful economic reform, we will soon find ourselves in yet another debate on the inflated importance of the pact.
I hope the Commissioner will do his utmost to prevent any further dilution of the commonly agreed commitments of the Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, basically, if I look at what happened in France on 29 May objectively, a lot of reasons are mentioned, including enlargement.
Personally, the difficulty we are having in taking advantage of all the space and all the added value that economic and monetary union should have brought us is a real source of concern to me, and I believe it is the real explanation for what happened in my country.
Today we are debating reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, and I would like to express my agreement with my fellow Member MrsÂ Kauppi on one point.
This reform will not bring us all the answers we need if, finally, we are to find the right solution in the euro zone, which ought to be the engine for growth in the Europe of the Twenty-Five as a whole.
Let us, however, accept that what you have done, Commissioner, in agreement with the President of the Euro Group, is a step in the right direction.
I hope, moreover, that you will be wise enough to accept some of the European Parliamentâs amendments so that we can bring these negotiations to a conclusion under the Luxembourg Presidency.
So far as statistical reform, predictability and agreement on the macroeconomic data that should underlie the preparation of the Member Statesâ budgets are concerned, it seems to me that there are things that should allow us to move in the right direction.
This stage is, of course, only one among others, however.
On one point I must disagree with Mrs Kauppi, however.
It came up repeatedly in our debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs: on its own, structural reform will not be enough to restore domestic confidence, stimulate internal demand and achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.
What we need is more coordination and, on this subject, I absolutely deplore the lack of thinking since economic and monetary union.
We need to develop more means, to find other ways besides the Stability Pact, which is still not adequately geared to growth.
I wish you good luck for this first stage, Commissioner.
Â Â  â Mr President, the workers in the countries of the European Union oppose the capitalist restructurings which result in a reduced standard of living and increased unemployment.
They denounce the commercialisation of health and education and the cutbacks in the remaining public utilities and their privatisation.
They oppose and are fighting the new, worse, insurance systems.
They are calling â and rightly so â for the Stability Pact, the tool and alibi for anti-grass roots objectives, to be abolished.
The reform of the Stability Pact by the European Council on 22 and 23 March was put forward as a relaxing of criteria.
Under no circumstances, however, is it a relaxing of anti-grass roots policy; it is another burden on grass-roots incomes for the benefit of big business.
That is why the workers should have no delusions or room for expectations.
Unfortunately, today's report does not move in the right direction either.
Not only is it indifferent to the trials of the workers, but it also calls for even more unfavourable terms for the application of multilateral supervision and even for a Community fraud squad to undertake financial auditing missions.
It calls on the central banks to act as guardian of statistics and sets deadlines for adjusting to the Pact, in which recommendations are made about excessive deficits and debt, as in the case of Greece.
In Greece, the government has used deficits and financial prudence in order to unleash a series of anti-grass roots austerity measures and programmes, thereby guaranteeing even more poverty for the people.
It would appear that the referenda in France and the Netherlands have been ignored. It is as if they never took place and they can carry on as before.
However, the referenda returned a resounding ânoâand were a real expression of insubordination and disobedience to the commands and policy of the European Union and the political forces which support it, and that is promising.
Â Â  Mr President, at the European Summit of 22 March, it was decided to review the Stability Pact, and the Council agreed on a new kind of Stability Pact, one to which we hope the Member States will adhere this time around.
I have always said that stretching the Stability Pact is harmful to economic growth and monetary stability, while at the same time denting public confidence in the euro and therefore in Europe itself.
The fact that the change to the Stability Pact concerning the 3% limit is not being made public does nothing to improve confidence in the euro.
Although Member States will be permitted to exceed the 3% limit, the Council and the Commission have not, to date, explained how this new arrangement will be translated into practice.
If the 3% limit can be exceeded, does that mean that a new limit will be introduced?
This is a pressing question, and I would like Commissioner Almunia to answer it.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, we have often discussed the Stability Pact and I am going to try to summarise some of the things that have been said.
My spokesman, Mr Radwan, has said something that I agree with: we are beating the retreat.
The Pact I liked was the Pact of 1996, which was signed by the CDU Minister Theo Waigel and defended by your predecessor, Commissioner Solbes.
We have not been able to maintain it.
The Council noted that there was generalised non-compliance in Europe, and it could have done two things: it could have demanded compliance or, euphemistically, it could have made the Pact more flexible, and that is exactly what it has done.
You are appearing here to explain to us the modifications that need to be made to the Regulations in order to make this Pact effective.
What could Parliament do?
What could my group do?
We could have produced amendments aimed at reviving the previous Pact, in the form it then took.
We have not done that because, following Ortegaâs advice, we do not like pointless efforts, which only lead to melancholy.
We have presented some amendments, which Mr Karas has explained very well. The intention is to ensure that the disaster does not get any worse.
Our intention is to ensure that it is applied properly, in technical terms, with reliable statistics, we want to reduce the margin for arbitrariness, filling in the legal gaps, in short, we want to ensure that the retreat is not a complete disaster.
It has been said here that Europe is not going well and that is the case.
But if it is not going well, it is not a result of the Stability Pact, but rather of our not having complied with that Pact.
The Stability Pact, budgetary authority, to put it in quasi-theological terms, is a virtue, a necessary condition, though insufficient, for growth.
Furthermore, as Mrs Kauppi has pointed out, we need those reforms that we have been unable to carry out.
Parliament is helping you; it is helping you to reduce the Governmentsâ margin for discretion.
It is up to you to ensure that this does not get any worse.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Karas and the Houseâs shadow rapporteurs for the report we are debating.
You have cooperated well and succeeded in pulling this important discussion out of a superficial, ideological debate and ensuring that this House is able to help reform the Stability and Growth Pact, something that is urgently needed.
Why do I say that the reform is urgently needed?
Let us simply review the economic facts.
We have designed a pact which has lived solely by the idea that it has to combat inflation.
This is an important objective and many Member States have managed to achieve it to a large degree.
However, at no time was it designed for an Economic and Monetary Union in which we also urgently need to achieve macro-economic coordination, because we need to have the flexibility required in order to be able to react appropriately in an economic cycle, in both large and small national economies.
Compare the data situation in the USA with the data situation in the European Union.
Since 2002, the USA has been in a much better position to react to external shocks: to rising oil prices, toÂ September 11, to the crisis on the stock markets.
Why?
Because its central bank was able to be much more flexible than the European Central Bank and, more importantly, because financial policy did what was needed in the short-term economic situation at the time.
We need flexible and better coordination of our financial policies, so that we can restore trust in the European economy, but, first and foremost, for the sake of our jobs.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should first like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks.
He has managed to formulate a contentious issue in a relatively short space of time in such a way that Parliament can support it with a large majority.
This was not an ideological debate, Mr Bullmann; it was an acknowledgment that the political will to keep to the 1996 Stability and Growth Pact was missing.
At the first serious general test, the two large states, France and Germany, failed totally, assisted at the time by Luxembourg and Greece.
This start prevented the Stability and Growth Pact from playing its proper part as originally planned.
In this respect, the current reform is, in all events, a second best solution, which uses the argument of flexibility in order to exclude future infringements of the rules.
In saying this, I am also voicing criticism of my own government in Germany.
Introducing the costs of European unification as a new criterion has thrown the door wide open to arbitrariness and means, in principle, that sanctions will no longer be possible in future, even with a 4% or 5% excess.
I consider this to be a definite mistake.
Given the powerful role of the Council and the inadequate role of Parliament in this matter, the Commission could only react defensively.
We have debated this often here in this Chamber.
That is why I think it is a good thing that Mr Karas addresses precisely this point in his reports.
More competence for the Commission, a stop to the sinners standing in judgment and greater participation by the European Parliament â these are things we can agree on.
However, nobody will be able to say that this version of the Stability and Growth Pact is forward looking and will contribute towards the future stability of the euro.
Â Â  Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to say that I think matters have gone extremely well for Commissioner Almunia when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact.
The result is sensible modernisation, which we can fully support.
What we now have is the golden European triangle with three types of instrument we shall have operating together.
The first is the Stability and Growth Pact, the second the Lisbon process and the third the broad economic guidelines.
Having said that, MrÂ President, I cannot hide the fact that our debate today is taking place in the light of referenda in France and the Netherlands which, among many other things, reflect a grass-roots demand for a real agenda for Europe.
Such an agenda also means our having to say that we have understood Europeâs need for the Stability and Growth Pact but that the pact does not, of course, in itself create new jobs.
It is the basis for getting structural reforms and, at the same time, macroeconomic investment under way.
Moreover, it is because of these efforts that the national governments need to concur with our line of thinking.
With the modernisation of the Stability and Growth Pact, we have obtained a useful tool, but that tool must now be accompanied by a number of other tools at national level that can create the new jobs we so badly need.
That, Commissioner Almunia, is why I hope that this pact, which is now almost in place â and which I am certain will be implemented â is the first step on the way to a new and genuine agenda which, in reality, is the prior condition for creating popular understanding in connection with that modernisation of the treaties that we have been debating so vigorously over the last few days.
Â Â  If I may, I should like to make a few remarks, even though I represent the Czech Republic, which is not a member of the eurozone.
The first thing I would like to say is that the main reason for the victory of the ânoâ camp in the recent French referendum was French peopleâs fears regarding the future of their expensive social system.
France is, of course, a member of the eurozone, and cannot therefore allow itself to violate the rules of the Growth and Stability Pact in the long term: in my opinion, this will lead to rising tension between the existing rules and the willingness of French politicians to please large parts of their domestic electorate.
Secondly, it is not at all clear in the short term how vigorously and, above all, with what political courage public finance reform will be carried out.
I am thinking in particular of France, which will only be able to keep its finances under control by restructuring government revenue and expenditure, or in other words by carrying out unpopular reforms.
The situation in the Netherlands is somewhat different, and this is the third point I should like to make.
After entering the eurozone, the Dutch had to give up their strong currency, and under the hugely unfavourable conditions of an undervalued exchange rate.
They doubtless reminisce about the strong guilder, which would now help them solve the problem of negligible economic growth.
Fourthly, other key members of the eurozone, namely Italy and Germany, are experiencing problems with over-expensive social systems and sclerotic economies, and they can expect structural reforms that will doubtless be tough.
It is of key importance for the stability of the euro, and I think MrÂ Karasâ analysis of this point was relatively accurate, that the basic rules of the Stability and Growth Pact remain unchanged, or that they apply to all countries always and at every moment.
That is why the eurozone countries should first comply with the current rules that apply to everyone, and only then debate any possible relaxing of these rules.
Â Â  Mr President, since we are speaking of steering the European economy, I cannot resist making the following observation: by bringing the euro closer to the dollar, the combined efforts of the citizens of France and the Netherlands will have done more, in the space of a few days, to make European exports more competitive than anything the European Central Bank has done.
I would therefore like to pay tribute to the effectiveness of Europeâs citizens rather than the certainties of the central bankers.
The March Councilâs decision to reform the Stability and Growth Pact âÂ a decision largely inspired by yourself, Mr AlmuniaÂ â is a step in the right direction.
It is not enough, however, to reassure people that the European Union is capable of adopting a strategy that will bring lasting revival to the economy.
We cannot separate the debate on the future of the Stability and Growth Pact and hence on the coordination of economic and budgetary policies from the debate on the financial perspectives.
How can you cut the Member Statesâ deficits unless, in return, the European Union gives itself the budgetary resources to guarantee social cohesion and revive the European economy?
Personally, I do not believe that budget austerity in the Member States combined with budget inertia in the Union is the answer to the twin challenges of growth and employment.
I would therefore like to say that it is now time, at the stage we have now reached, to speak about increasing and diversifying the Unionâs resources, even if that means amending the Treaties to allow the Union to take out the loans and raise the European tax that our current economic and political crisis demands.
Â Â  Mr President, allow me to put the following question to the House: would we be experiencing the current crisis in the European Union if economic growth and job creation were strong here, if the large European countries were offering us a different profile, if they were promoting the whole of the European Union and contributing to balancing the world economy?
Surely the answer would be ânoâ.
There would be resources, there would be money to fund enlargement, for the challenges of the European Union.
But there is no economic growth because there is no confidence.
And there is no confidence because we lack determination when it comes to applying and implementing confidence and stability policies.
That is the contribution of the Stability Pact.
Its reform, Mr Almunia, comes at a complicated time.
The next thing now under threat in this crisis in the European Union is the euro.
The reform of the Stability Pact must therefore be the right reform.
Mr Karas has done an excellent job trying to remedy a mistaken proposal on the basic content of the Stability Pact.
Mr Almunia has told us tonight that the Commission is satisfied with Parliament's position on improving the quality of statistics and the surveillance of debt.
I would also like to hear from Mr Almunia that he is in agreement with the listing of relevant factors, which are extremely important if the Stability Pact is not to be a box in which we can fit everything, and in which, at the end of the day, the rules can be ignored.
We have reached a situation in which each country does what it sees fit in order to promote the policy of budgetary stability and, if relevant factors are undefined, this would be practically impossible.
We have an example within the European Union of Fifteen: the countries which have done their duty in budgetary terms are the ones which today are enjoying economic growth and employment.
We do not have to look for models elsewhere.
We should identify those countries within the European Union and all apply those policies.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Europeâs citizens continue to point the finger at the Stability and Growth Pact and the single currency as the real culprits of the ongoing economic and social crisis in Europe.
At the same time, European politicians of almost all ideological hues trot out the same politically-correct rhetoric, extolling the virtues of restrictive fiscal policies and of the overriding obsession with price moderation.
This contradiction must stop and this is now the real challenge that the European institutions must meet head on.
The Council and the Commission recently took steps to tackle this dilemma, including the relaunch of the Pact and the regulations that we are discussing in this House.
Parliament, in turn, does what it can with the powers that it has.
The rapporteur should be warmly commended for raising a number of concerns such as construction fault, the reliability of statistics, relevant factors, the deadlines for correcting deficits and the stepping up of budgetary surveillance.
In spite of these steps and the undoubted quality of your work, Commissioner, it remains to be seen whether these remedies have come in time and whether they will be sufficient.
Pangloss said that we live in the best of all possible worlds, but in 1755 there was a terrible earthquake in Lisbon, which had a profound effect on political and economic relations in Europe in the 18th century.
We have a duty at least to reflect on this.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, basically everything has been said, but not by everyone and, more to the point, not by me.
Firstly, I should like to offer the rapporteur, Othmar Karas, my warmest thanks.
He has made the best of a bad job, and on that, I might perhaps be permitted to comment.
Today is the third time I have stood on this podium in order to speak on the Stability Pact.
In 1997, Parliament had to give its opinion on the introduction of the euro and the Stability Pact associated with it at the time.
We did so gladly, because we were convinced that the Stability Pact offered a basis of trust for the citizens.
This time, as the rapporteur rightly said, the European Parliament has only a minor role in the whole procedure.
Consultation means something different in my view.
Monetary questions are questions of trust and this trust is shaken by the watering down of the Pact.
The two so-called big countries â in what the rapporteur calls 'peer complicity' â set the entire watering down process in motion, as we have already heard here today.
Big gestures, big overtures obviously no longer convince the citizens of Europe.
The shattered remains of the SchrÃ¶der and Eichel policy in Germany and the Chirac policy in France have drawn the euro into this completely negative discussion.
The report formulated by the rapporteur is a desperate attempt to rescue some of the philosophy behind stability.
We must stop exacerbating the crisis of confidence still further.
The best solution would be if Mr Barroso, and Mr Juncker on behalf of ECOFIN, were to withdraw all changes to the Stability Pact in the light of recent developments.
Â Â  For Hungary, like all the new Member States, meeting the convergence criteria is a key requirement, as well as being in the countryâs own interests.
In its efforts to do so, it must take into account the fact that alongside the overall positive economic impact of EU accession, it also puts considerable transitional pressure on the government budget.
There are costs involved in meeting its contribution obligations and getting the new institutional network up and running, while outstanding customs and other revenues and implementation of new, more flexible VAT regulations have caused a serious deficit.
At the same time, it is not the budget itself that is the beneficiary of the projects funded by the EU that are so important for the national economy, but the local authorities, institutions, or companies concerned; the burden of cofinancing, meanwhile, must be met out of the government budget.
We want to be successful members of a successful European Union and so we accept these transitional pressures and ask that they be taken into consideration when it comes to assessing our performance.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like once again to thank Mr Karas for his reports and all the Members who have spoken in the debate for their contributions.
Of all the contributions, I would like to refer to two of them, in particular those that have demonstrated the success of the euro, of the single currency, and I feel I should point out, at a time when certain statements appear to have called into question something that is obvious; that the euro has brought stability, solvency, historically low prices, that the euro has brought us historically low interest rates, that the euro is making us stronger.
This should be pointed out because, immediately afterwards, I must say that in order to maintain that strong single currency which strengthens us as Europeans in economic terms and in other terms requires a fiscal framework and a Stability and Growth Pact such as the one defined in the Treaty and provided for by the regulations that this Parliament is discussing today through its partial amendments.
I would also like to express my agreement with those of you who have reacted to certain pessimistic analyses.
It is true that there are economic difficulties, that there are growth and employment problems, that the citizens often feel that their needs are not sufficiently met.
But it is also the case that when we are looked at from the outside, or when the situation of the European economies is looked at objectively, there is also cause for optimism.
At the meeting of the Eurogroup the day before yesterday, the Director of the International Monetary Fundâs European Department explained to us the general lines of the reports that it has just published and that can be consulted on the International Monetary Fund's website on the economy of the euro zone.
He began by telling us that he is surprised about the excessive pessimism, since, on analysing the European economy, he has noted that the conditions are in place to allow it to recover fully.
There is a problem with confidence in some of the main European economies and one of the objectives of the reform of the Stability Pact is undoubtedly to increase the confidence in, and credibility of, a necessary framework of fiscal and budgetary discipline.
To this end, this reform is balanced; it introduces certain elements of flexibility, but it also introduces greater demands -- particularly in the preventive part, regulated by Regulation (EC) No 1466/97.
It is a reform that requires more transparency and it has therefore contributed to the adoption of important decisions aimed at improving the quality of our statistics.
Furthermore, on the proposal of the Commission, Ecofin yesterday approved certain very important conclusions which indicate the improvements that are being made to the European statistical system and, in particular, to fiscal statistics.
Restoring confidence also requires a clear explanation.
In many of your comments, ladies and gentlemen, I have noted an understanding of the Pact and of what the reform of the Pact means.
In others, I have recognised ignorance or lack of knowledge or, in some cases, simply an interpretation that is not in line with reality: the reform of the Pact cannot be accused of repeating literally what the Treaty says, because what would jeopardise confidence would be to go against the Treaty.
To act in accordance with the Treaty, to repeat what the Treaty says with regard to the reference value for public deficit, to the reference value for public debt and to all the factors that must be taken into account Article 143 of the Treaty lays down the relevant factors to be taken into account when analysing a country's excessive deficit situation to comply fully with the Treaty in every respect, to re-read carefully the Treaty approved in order to implement the Economic and Monetary Union, is one of the elements that will do most to restore confidence in the euro zone and throughout the whole of the Economic and Monetary Union.
In any event, I am convinced that this reform we are discussing today - and that I hope will enter into force at the end of this month - respects the rules, introduces clarity, economic rationality, demands equal treatment and will be applied rigorously, as was demonstrated yesterday.
And what it requires from all of us is an accurate and full explanation of what it means, and in that way we will help the European citizens and the European project.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the report by Dominique Vlasto, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on strengthening European competitiveness: the effects of industrial change on policy and the role of SMEs [2004/2154(INI)] (A6-0148/2005)
Â Â  Mr President, the report I am presenting to you this evening confirms the return of an ambition, the ambition of an industrial policy for an enlarged Europe.
It was both necessary and essential.
We need to go further, however.
The time is short so far as industrial policy is concerned and we need to go faster and move from ambition to action.
Last week I was in Shanghai with the delegation from the city of Marseille. Industry is the backbone of Chinaâs development.
Innovation and new technologies are the vehicles of that industryâs development, and economic growth there is ongoing.
In a word, the dynamism of that society is enough to make you dizzy.
Of course, I do not want a Chinese-style development model for the European Union; but I would like our Europe to have the means to hold its own against the economic giants of the United States, China, India and others.
Above all, our challenge must therefore be to be competitive through innovation and by investing in research, know-how and knowledge.
The Commission and Vice-President Verheugen are making a lot of proposals along these lines.
What we are looking for now is for these proposals to be made political reality, and it is in this light that this report and its contents should be considered.
First of all, we think a policy should set itself objectives that lend it significance, like the development of a sound European industrial base, increasing employment, especially for young people, and the emergence of European industrial champions able to act as standard bearers for the âMade in Europeâ brand.
European industrial policy must also, however, be aimed at all enterprises and become a full part of the Lisbon strategy.
The Commission is focusing on a sectoral approach: we are pleased about that because it is essential that part of industrial policy should take account of the distinctive nature of each sector in the way it is implemented.
An effective policy must also take account of the nature of enterprises, however, because only 1% of European enterprises are large groups, while there are millions of other small and medium-sized enterprises that make up Europeâs industrial fabric.
The Commission must make a real effort to take small enterprises into account.
The second dimension that must not be overlooked is the territorial dimension.
Industry acts as a magnet for other economic activities, making its location a key factor in the development of many regions.
The Structural Funds must therefore support industrial development while at the same time acting as instruments to assist the reconversion of areas suffering from industrial relocation.
We must bring a specific response to this problem of relocations, assess the sectors at risk, anticipate relocations and help to regenerate the regions affected.
We must also take account of the existing differences between the 25 countries of the European Union.
Finally, we believe that every policy must be based on a clear and effective method, and that is particularly true, Mr Verheugen, of your commitment to better lawmaking.
We are looking for a way of simplifying legislation that takes account of the cumulative effects of legislation on individual sectors.
We are hoping for a method of studying the impact of proposed legislation that will take account of SMEs and, in particular, use precise criteria to evaluate the responses made to Commission consultations.
I would add that Parliament and the Council also have their parts to play and that they should be actively involved in the better lawmaking objective.
As you can no doubt see, Mr Verheugen, our expectations are high.
For many instruments of industrial policy, they depend in part on the outcome of the negotiations on the financial perspectives; they also depend on our ability to make use of the instruments we already have, such as competition policy, education, the allocation of State aids or commercial policy.
I hope our Parliamentâs contribution will help this challenge to be taken up.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report that we are debating this evening is completely in line with the Commission's beliefs and with the policy that we are pursuing and I am therefore exceptionally grateful for the support of the European Parliament.
First of all, we needed to make sure in Europe that industrial policy in general is seen once more as a political task.
We had to clarify that we in Europe cannot manage without a strong, efficient industrial base and that it is a mistake to believe that we can live from services alone. This has already been achieved.
Secondly, we need to ensure that European industry retains its long-term edge in increasingly fierce, and increasingly global, competition.
That is the main thrust of the new growth and employment strategy which the Commission has tabled and which Parliament adopted by a large majority.
What we are trying to do here, above all, is to improve our innovative skills.
European industry can survive worldwide and generate growth and jobs only if 'made in Europe' indicates a top-of-the-range product.
We cannot compete through lower social standards, lower environmental standards or lower wages; we need to compete through efficiency, quality and technological progress.
Thirdly, we must analyse very carefully where our industry has structural problems.
I shall shortly be submitting a communication containing a precise analysis of the industrial sectors in Europe and explaining what individual steps are needed in order to improve the competitive chances of European industry.
Everyone can see that the automobile industry and the chemical industry do not have the same problems, any more than do the textile industry and the tooling industry.
I am very grateful to the rapporteur for emphasising the problem of small and medium-sized enterprises, which I regard as the focal point of our efforts; there are 25Â million of them, and the European economy thrives on their flexibility and capacity for innovation.
We should always bear in mind that new jobs in Europe are created in this sector and in this sector alone.
The advances in productivity made by European industry mean that, in years to come, no new jobs will be created in industry.
Jobs are only being created by small and medium-sized enterprises, which is why we must help them to overcome their structural problems.
That means access to risk capital, access to knowledge and skills and innovation and an improved business environment, basically in the form of red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The density of regulations that we have achieved in numerous sectors in Europe is quite simply too much for small and medium-sized enterprises.
That is why I am making an announcement today that is also directed at the European Parliament.
This Commission takes the 'better lawmaking' project very seriously.
This does not only mean that we shall improve the quality of lawmaking, it also means that we shall say no much more often in future.
We shall say no to demands from the ranks of the Member States for regulations which are not necessary and I shall also say no if demands come from the European Parliament â and this is, unfortunately, often the case â for regulation which we do not need and the same Parliament then criticises the Commission because it over-regulates.
You are going to see a new Commission here.
We shall say ânoâ where over-regulation is being set in motion and we shall see how the European public reacts.
I wait with anticipation and I am counting on your assistance.
Healthy self-regulation in the field of lawmaking is what the citizens of Europe expect of us at the moment.
It is also what our economy needs in order to improve its chances of growth and its investment potential.

Â Â  Compared to large enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) have special requirements for competitive development, so they need to be given special attention when policies are being formulated.
Industrial policy should be no exception, since industrial development based on knowledge is not limited to large enterprises.
Greater financial resources for research, for instance, still do not guarantee a greater number of innovations, and this is why we need the enterprising spirit embodied in SMEâs.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are not merely the driving force of economic growth.
We must be aware that they also represent an opportunity for the European Union in the political sense.
They also carry a political charge, since the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands is, amongst other things, a consequence of the fact that the people of Europe do not feel the direct effects of the workings and decisions of European institutions.
Something similar is also true of SMEâs, which lack their own resources to exploit the advantages offered by the European Union.
In the report, therefore, as the European Parliament we are giving particular support to institutional measures that will strengthen the innovative capacity of SMEâs.
We are in favour of the European Union giving priority to mutually linked processes such as research, education and the elimination of administrative barriers, which present particular obstacles to small and medium-sized enterprises in exploiting the opportunities offered by the EU.
Commissioner, in formulating the report we collaborated very enthusiastically with Members from the new Member States.
Indeed we are aware that industrial policy may serve as an opportunity both for the geographically larger old Member States, which have the conditions for the development of industrial heavyweights, and for the new Member States, which can with their dynamic sectors of innovative SMEâs represent the basis for high economic growth and for raising European competitiveness in the long term.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner, several assessments suggest that uncertainty, particularly with regard to employment and social protection, has been a significant reason why many citizens have rejected the Constitutional Treaty in France and in the Netherlands.
After many years during which the words âindustrial policyâ had disappeared, today they are making a reappearance, and we should all be pleased about this because it is by promoting a solid industrial sector that the citizens will be able to find better paid and more stable jobs.
That is the way to contribute to increasing confidence in the European project.
The Commissionâs Communication proposes an integrated approach, which includes the simplification and harmonisation of legislation in order to consolidate the internal market, and supports R+D and the need to promote its transfer to companies.
But that harmonisation should also include a fiscal dimension.
The European industrial fabric is made up of diverse sectors, ranging from the aerospace industry to the textile industry, and they require specific responses.
Sectoral analyses will help to facilitate greater cooperation between industry, the Commission and the Member States, which could create new opportunities.
Small and medium-sized businesses make up 90% of European industry and they require special attention in terms of their access to funding and transfer of research.
Relocation is, on occasions, an inevitable reality and we must anticipate those changes.
To that end, we must create a dialogue that includes the administration and the social and economic actors and that takes account of the available research and innovation instruments.
And, of course, an adjustment fund will be essential in order to accompany restructurings.
I would like to end by congratulating the Commission, because it has proposed the appropriate instruments for increasing European competitiveness and has done so within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy.
But if we want the citizens to see the Unionâs policies as an instrument for making progress and not as a threat, we must maintain the balance between the three pillars of that strategy, that is to say, the economic, the social and the environmental pillars.
Â Â  .Â Â MrÂ President, I very much enjoyed listening to all that MrsÂ Vlasto and CommissionerÂ Verheugen had to say.
I cannot comment on what has been said in this Chamber today, however, as I feel obliged to comment on what is written in the report.
Unfortunately, I have to say that it does nothing whatsoever to advocate healthy competition, which is the cornerstone of a free economy.
Instead, it is riddled through and through with interventionist ideology.
ParagraphÂ 1 reads as follows, â[The European Parliament] welcomes the Commissionâs decision to make industrial policy a priority of the EU agendaâ.
I would ask the House to remember that there is no such thing as priorities in a free economy.
Societyâs needs dictate everything that is necessary in such an economy, and the free market tells us what those needs are.
To discuss priorities for the economy would be to neglect the economy as a whole.
To quote paragraphÂ 2, â[The European Parliament supports] the promotion of a proactive industrial policyâ.
With all due respect, if it needs to be said that any aspect of the economy should be proactive, then I have to say that we have taken a very wrong turning indeed.
After all, this would imply that we already regard freedom as a non-essential feature of the economy, and yet a free economy is the foundation for success.
ParagraphÂ 5 says, and I quote, âsocial dialogue should help to identify the best-performing sectorsâ.
I would remind the House that deciding whether something is performing well, or whether those running businesses are adhering rather too diligently to healthy free-market principles, is no job for social dialogue.
Moving on to paragraphÂ 6, â[The European Parliament] would like to see women encouraged to train for industrial careersâ.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a gross corruption of feminist ideals.
There is no point in encouraging women to train for industrial careers, since they will find jobs in whichever sector they wish.
I see no reason why women should have to work with pneumatic drills.
ParagraphÂ 12 reads as follows, âindustrial policy should lead to balanced development, by maintaining social cohesionâ.
I would remind the House that this is the wrong path to take if we wish to achieve competitiveness and success.
One hundred and thirty years ago, the then British Prime Minister said that the job of economists was to prevent the government from harming the economy.
At the time Britain was the fastest developing country in the world.
I am far from hopeful that the European Commission will follow my advice, but I would call on it to take my comments into consideration, if nothing else.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to emphasise that the refrain of âenhancing European competitivenessâ has been repeated for many years.
It is time to make it clear that achieving a global economy is an extremely challenging goal, but an absolutely essential one.
This leads us to a number of conclusions, the most important of which is that precise and detailed implementation plans and timetables must be drawn up for all issues raised and measures taken.
In view of the limited funding available, it is important to establish which goals and priorities should be focused on, for example the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the global economy, whilst at the same time safeguarding environmental protection and job security.
Particular priority should be given to science and research programmes and training measures in the field of new technologies and new generations of products and services, as well as to productivity, potential savings and access to research for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Â Â  I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work on this well-balanced report.
