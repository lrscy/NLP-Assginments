It is important that the presidency should also say this on behalf of the EU, and so I ask you to take the initiative by stating this here and now.
That you should do so is made all the more important by the powerful impression that the United States of America takes a different view, and we do indeed need to state what our differences with them are.
They do indeed believe - and how else is the deployment of 100 000 troops in the region to be explained? - that Resolution 1441 does not exclude the possibility of immediate military strike action, but there is also the implicit danger that international law, to which nations are subject, and by which alone world peace can be guaranteed on a long-term basis, will be jeopardised by unilateral power-seeking on the part of one UN member state.
This is where the European Union has to state its position in clear terms, the primary reason for this being that international law cannot be enforced in an arbitrary and opportunistic way.
In the case of North Korea, against which there is a mass of evidence that it is desirous or capable of producing weapons of mass destruction - and its actions suggest that this is the case - negotiations are in progress, and yet it is Saddam Hussein who is threatened, despite the presence of a host of inspectors in his country, who have found nothing.
I might add that this threat is not justified under the UN Charter.
Bringing this difference between us into the open is one of the primary tasks of the European Union and of its Greek Presidency, and I know that you are determined to do this.
You can count on the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House!
Mr President, in wishing the Greek Presidency well, I appeal to it to make every effort to address the grave problem of falling farm incomes.
I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another.
We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which, with falling incomes, is now under serious threat.
In the context of the mid-term review proposals due to be adopted this week and the forthcoming world trade talks, I appeal to the Greek Presidency to work towards continued commitment at EU level for the European agricultural model and to guarantee a decent livelihood for our farmers.
The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture.
Unless we address the very serious problem of the declining age profile in European agriculture, in the not too distant future Parliament will be sitting in an emergency session to address what has turned out to be a very serious problem.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, taking the helm of the European Union for six months is a major challenge for any country, and that is true, Mr Simitis, of your Greek Presidency as well.
The five priorities that you have enumerated and set yourself are, politically speaking, not merely a matter of logic but also of necessity.
The list does not sound particularly sensational, but, as you will already have gathered from the speeches here in the European Parliament, a number of these topics carry within themselves the seeds of potential tensions, both within the European Union and beyond its borders.
The smouldering Iraq crisis, along with America's continuing deployment of troops in this region and the divergent views on this emanating from London, Berlin and Paris, demand sensitive handling.
What I would ask the Greek Presidency in this regard is what measures they contemplate taking in order to perhaps get the EU to have a single line on this issue.
My second question has to do with enlargement, and, in particular, with your strategy in relation to Turkey.
In Copenhagen, Turkey was given a specific date, and the prospect of the commencement of accession negotiations, subject to its fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria by that deadline.
This is a considerable obstacle to surmount, and it is at present far from clear that Turkey will be able to meet these conditions.
Quite apart from that, I believe that it is wrong to be always offering Turkey only an either/or choice and not the option of a privileged special relationship, a perhaps far more rewarding prospect, and one that has already been addressed in a report by Mr Brok.
The question I have in this context relates to Greek strategy towards Turkey.
There is a third point, and this is something to which I would like to give favourable mention.
Your declaration of belief, in the chapter on energy policy, in the establishment of common rules on nuclear safety is something that I very much welcome.
Do you think this has a real chance of being more widely accepted in the Council?
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is only right that much should have been said about Iraq, which is very much a live issue.
I would nonetheless like to touch upon a topic that is not a live issue - at any rate, not at the moment - by which I mean the situation in the Balkans.
You have announced a sort of Integration Summit in Saloniki, with the intention of opening up for the Balkan countries the road that leads to the European Union, and I regard that as highly meritorious, although we must not be deluded.
Even today, there are manifestations of crisis, and there has been a recent recurrence of gunfights in Sandzak.
We know that neither the situation in Yugoslavia - now Serbia and Montenegro - nor that in Kosovo have really been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties.
This leads me to see it as important that the Greek Presidency, and of course the EU as a whole, should send out signals to the Balkan countries to the effect that a way is open for them to join the European Union, a difficult and lengthy way though it may be.
We must be guided by the need for adaptation of the mechanisms for encouragement and support.
There is a great difference between what we are currently giving to these poorest of poor countries and what we gave to the countries that are about to join us, so these instruments need to be adapted.
The next, post-2004, Commission will have to give consideration to how to allocate responsibilities for the Balkans within itself.
If, though, unmistakeable signals go out from Saloniki, even the Commission will be able to adapt itself as necessary.
There is also a need for annual progress reports.
These countries need to know when they are moving closer to the European Union, when stagnation is setting in, and when, indeed, their progress is being set back.
All the forces in these regions need to know that the chance of moving closer to the European Union is there, but that we will monitor, very closely and country by country, whether real use has been made of these opportunities.
Mr President of the Council, I believe that, one day in the distant future, Saloniki may well mean for this region what Copenhagen - by which I mean the 1993 Copenhagen Council - meant for the present candidate countries.
Let the signal you send out be a bold one, one that is readily understood, and one that also awakens a sense of responsibility in these countries.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, I too would like to speak today about enlargement, about the Convention, about Iraq and about the economic situation, but I do not have time.
I certainly support what the chairman of my group has said.
Before coming here, I asked the Greek Presidency if it would give priority to the issue of international maritime traffic in dangerous goods.
I subsequently noted that the President-in-Office of the Council did in fact refer to this question.
Maritime traffic is an important issue for Greece and it is to be expected that the Greek Prime Minister should give it priority.
However, Mr President-in-Office, international maritime traffic has at present unfortunately fallen from grace and is associated with the situation in Galicia, the location of one of Europe's and the world's biggest disasters over the last 30 years.
These names are all too familiar: 'Andos Patria', 'Telepolicomander', 'Orquiola', 'Cason' and 'Prestige'.
Mr President-in-Office, like those I have quoted many of the names are Greek and most of the shipowners were or are Greek.
There seems to be no solution and no end to the 'Prestige' disaster: our coastline and sea have been contaminated and the wreck of the 'Prestige' on the seabed still represents a continuing threat.
The actions of the Spanish Government, of Mr Aznar's Partido Popular, have been disastrous, and the same applies to the Galician Government, while the European Union has stood on the sidelines, judging at the Copenhagen Council that five million euros would be enough to solve this problem - which is a problem for Europe as well as for Galicia and for other countries.
The sea is now ruled by illegal and lawless mafias. Yet faced with this problem, the public, volunteers, seamen and fishermen have had to do the job of the government and of the European Union and solve this problem with their own hands, because the 'black tide' is still landing on the shores of Galicia, of the Iberian Peninsula and even of France.
The Copenhagen European Council laid bare a serious political conflict: the Member States turned their back on the public, on the fishermen and on the volunteers who had acted so admirably.
The Member States have neither implemented the 'Erika' legislation nor set up the compensation fund.
This is very far removed from the attitude of the United States, where with the Oil Pollution Act they are preventing accidents and even setting up a responsibility fund of four billion euros.
What does the Greek Presidency intend to do along these lines?
I believe it should distinguish itself by taking action in this area.
Mr President, may I welcome the prime minister of Greece as President-in-Office of the European Council and sincerely wish him every success, because his success will be beneficial both to Europe and to Greece.
He rightly stated that one of the basic objectives of the presidency is to promote the Lisbon strategy; Mr Prodi also had a great deal to say about this and very important it was too.
However, I read in the international press today that the Commission is about to submit a report which concludes that Europe is losing its battle to acquire a more competitive economy in the world by 2010.
On the contrary, growth is very weak and the political will is lacking.
This Commission report also states, if the Figaro is to be believed, that it expects a twin-track Europe to emerge, with Sweden and Denmark fast-forwarding on one track and Greece, Italy and France in slow motion on the other.
What I want to ask is: first, is there a common policy for promoting the Lisbon strategy or is it a question of each country either doing what it likes or, at the very least, failing to apply any such common policy?
And secondly: do you intend to apply policies that will help achieve the Lisbon objectives in all the Member States of the European Union, especially Greece?
Mr President, the Greek Presidency has come along at a crucial time for our planet, and not just because we are on the brink of at least one armed conflict.
It is a crucial time because the only superpower, the United States, is doing all it can to turn its tremendous power into a global hegemony and, naturally, this is provoking a reaction.
When we emerge from these vicissitudes, the entire world - and the European Union in particular - will be a different place, regardless of the outcome of the crisis.
What is certain is that the post-war world order and its institutions will be the victims of the conflict and a different world will emerge from it.
The European Union needs to have a view and an opinion about this new world.
However, I get the impression that the prevailing mood in the institutions of the European Union is one of complacency, as if what is happening has nothing to do with us.
I get the impression that many of us believe that we are living in a vacuum, in another world, immune from what is already happening and what is yet to come.
In times such as these, a European Union presidency has to be able to rework the values which we say we stand for into a vision of the world to come, and to persuade the people of Europe that these values are worth fighting for.
Only with this priority will a presidency be successful and worthy of the times we live in.
Sittings come and go.
So do programmes.
However, the times we live in call for a return to the values of the people of Europe, as is only proper when we are fighting for peace.
Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr President of the Commission, I have listened very carefully to the priorities you set out.
I wish there were six instead of five, but I think that the sixth will be added in due course.
I refer to the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
The final proposals are due before the end of January.
The European Union is already taking on ten new members.
The rural population of the European Union will rise by 165% and rural land by 43%.
Cultivable land will increase by 55%.
And yet the budget up to 2013, in the best case scenario - with minimum inflation - will remain the same.
I should like to ask you what your presidency's objectives are, Mr Prime Minister, and what you intend to do for the millions of European farmers, in both the current European Union and the enlarged European Union.
As far as Lisbon is concerned, two of the ten years have passed and little has been achieved, far less than the 20% which should have been achieved by now.
What is certain is that, instead of closing, the competitiveness differential between our economy and the American economy, which is our main competitor, is now even wider.
I was both interested and delighted to see that entrepreneurship and small enterprises are one of your priorities.
An excellent move.
Today you announced this in an ambitious voice.
We shall be here in about five months' time, totting up the accounts to see what has been done.
I should like to know, Mr Prime Minister and President-in-Office, what you intend to do to achieve these ambitious objectives, which you have failed to achieve at home.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, while welcoming the fact that Greece has taken over the presidency, I should like to point out that it has done so at an historic moment in the development of the unique phenomenon which we refer to as European integration and which, among other things, has replaced the post-war division of our continent.
As regards the priorities of the Greek Presidency, as time is so short, I shall confine myself to the following brief points and comments:
On enlargement: the main decisions may have been taken during the previous presidency, but the final stages have yet to be completed, culminating in the signature of the accession treaties in Athens.
Preparations still have to be made so that the new Member States can adjust smoothly to European developments, which is why enlargement has rightly been given priority and will require close attention if we are to avoid irregularities and delays in the accession process.
I noted that you intend to continue the enhanced pre-accession strategy with Bulgaria and Romania, Mr President-in-Office, and rightly so.
But we must not forget the southern Balkans, where rapprochement with the European Union started up some time ago under the stability and association process.
This rapprochement needs to be encouraged here too, so that we can consolidate our relations, which we are not doing when it comes to the security and stability of the new, enlarged Europe.
On the Lisbon strategy, I should like to focus on sustainable development.
The need to promote a sustainable development strategy within the framework of European integration is even more urgent today, what with the pressure of enlargement and increasing globalisation.
The plan for implementing the sustainable development strategy drawn up by the European Commission is already filling the vacuum between what we say and what we do, by way of legislation, to protect the environment and public health and encourage the application and mainstreaming of the environmental dimension in all our policies.
That is why I think it is so important for us to adopt a step-by-step procedure for monitoring policy in practice at the spring European Council.
The difficulties in getting the Kyoto protocol signed make it even more imperative that we step up dialogue and collaboration with the USA, Japan and developing countries.
Obviously, the European Union cannot deal with this as an internal problem.
So it needs to shoulder its responsibilities at international level, which means pioneering efforts to achieve sustainable development through technology and science.
This is where I should like to focus your attention, Mr President-in-Office, because Europe has clearly started slipping behind recently, especially in biotechnology, in comparison with the United States and Japan.
As far as defence and immigration policy are concerned, I agree.
As you know, we have been calling for an immigration policy in the European Union for years, without any concrete results.
We expect an integrated policy to be developed and an integrated policy on illegal immigration to be developed.
Although illegal immigrants themselves are often living in abject circumstances, they also cause huge problems in the societies and to the people living in the Member States of the European Union.
Measures therefore need to be taken to improve the management of our external borders and to combat illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings by promoting measures under the third pillar.
I was most interested to hear you talk of readmission agreements with all our partners, especially those under serious pressure, and would ask you, please, to push ahead on this issue.
I think the Thessaloniki Council needs to push on with the reform of the Treaties of the European Union.
Finally, in foreign relations, I think that you need to encourage Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, basically under a long-term Euro-Mediterranean policy.
Italy is to follow Greece, giving two countries with excellent knowledge of these problems the chance to draw up an efficient Euro-Mediterranean policy.
Cooperation is not enough.
We need a long-term policy.
I wish you every success.
I trust that in six months' time we shall meet here, with you reporting that you have done what you said here today, and with us ready to exercise constructive, honest criticism in good faith.
May I wish you every success.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members, it is a fact that Greece is taking over the helm of the European Union at a crucial turning point for the European Union, both at home and abroad.
We are on the brink of the biggest enlargement in the history of the Union, an enlargement which puts an end to a division which has lasted fifty years.
We are about to draft a European constitution and strengthen our institutions, in order to guarantee the continuing cohesion of Europe, even after the ten new countries have joined, and ensure that it continues to operate as a political union so that it can achieve its objective, which is greater and greater unification of the nations of Europe.
The Convention has called for more Europe on numerous occasions and the Greek Presidency will put the finishing touches to this structure in Thessaloniki in June.
Europe is also in the middle of a very serious downturn in the economy.
The global economy is in recession, but that is nothing new.
The economic depression in Europe has lasted at least ten years.
Europe has resisted an inspired strategy, the Lisbon strategy.
And now this strategy is also in danger of being washed away by the recession.
I think that Greece, a country whose economy has recovered thanks to a programme of reform carried out on its own initiative, and a country which has achieved rates of growth putting it at the forefront of the European Union and has used this process to bring about a positive revolution in the agricultural sector, and a country which now has a first-world rather than a third-world economy, thanks also, of course, to the common agricultural policy, is now well prepared to breathe new life into the Lisbon process, which it badly needs if it is to survive.
In addition, Greece, as a country on the borders of Europe, has always linked trade between east and west and it can do the same now; it understands better than anyone else that the economies of eastern Europe have the potential to become a driving force behind the economy of the Fifteen.
These creative prospects cannot be reversed.
We are not going to cancel enlargement and we are not going to stop drafting a European constitution.
Their beneficial results, however, may be delayed if we have to deal with war with Iraq.
I agree with my honourable friend Mr Poettering that nuclear weapons cannot be left in irresponsible hands.
But nor can they be left in responsible hands, Mr Poettering.
There are no hands responsible enough for these terrifying, apocalyptic weapons we have armed ourselves with.
We do not know what is going to happen in Iraq.
But we do know that the President-in-Office of the Council is the only European leader who has had the unfortunate privilege of dealing with the danger of his country's becoming involved in a catastrophic war.
He managed to avert that war.
I trust the experience he gained will help him do as much for the war which is threatening the entire planet as we speak.
Mr President, I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond at the end of the debate.
Members have raised very interesting points.
I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will have taken careful note and will be keen to take on board as many of them as he can.
Until recently relations between Parliament and the Council were not extensive, but a combination of an increase in the powers of this House and the prospect of an increase in the number of Member States has had the effect of bringing our two institutions much closer together.
On behalf of the Liberal Group I welcome this closer working relationship between Parliament and the Council.
We see it very publicly, particularly in the Convention, and also in the number of very successful negotiations through the codecision process.
I welcome the approach taken, first by the Danish Presidency and now continued by the Greek Presidency, to much closer working relations with this House, shown in the President-in-Office's concern that a statute for Members should form part of the successful reform of the European Union institutions.
We look forward to working closely with you.
Mr President, unfortunately, circumstances prevent me from being in celebratory mood.
The Greek Government has indeed taken over the presidency at a time of acute economic crisis, with growing prospects of a new, even more murderous attack by the imperialist powers on the Iraqi people.
Their pretext is that Iraq has a smoking gun, although they have yet to find it; and yet these self-same hypocrites make, use and sell every type of weapon of mass destruction there is.
The Greek Government was party to the wars against Yugoslavia and Afghanistan and has said that it will join the impending war against Iraq, even if it is hiding behind its fig leaf by saying that war needs to be preceded by a UN Security Council resolution.
The Greek Presidency will promote the interventionist European defence and security policy by immediately deploying the European army, first in Bosnia and the FYROM and then anywhere else it is needed.
It will step up the attack on employment, insurance and pension rights.
It will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms during the mid-term review of the CAP.
It will promote mechanisms for deporting immigrants and strict asylum laws.
Using terrorism as a pretext, it will promote the transposition of anti-grass roots European legislation into national law and the abolition of democratic rights and freedoms.
The signature of the Treaty enlarging the European Union under the Greek Presidency will mark the start of even more hardships for its people and will, we fear, result in the Euro-partition of Cyprus.
May I reassure anyone who may be worried by the socialist label sported by the Greek Government that, as we have heard today, the Greek Presidency intends to keep big business happy.
That is why the people of Europe who, unlike big business, have nothing good to expect from the Greek Presidency, should not be complacent.
The only way out is for them to join forces and step up their fight against this policy.
In Greece, demonstrations are almost a daily occurrence.
They will culminate with demonstrations in June, which we invite the workers of Europe to attend.
As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned, it will be right on the front line of this fight.
Mr President, I wanted to pick up on a couple of the points raised by Mr Prodi and by the Greek Presidency.
Firstly, on the research and development policy of the European Union, Mr Prodi talked about the need to develop and invest in clean technologies.
Obviously our group agrees with this.
We need to develop environmentally friendly technologies, partly because of the employment opportunities they create and the training needs that exist, but also because of their positive social repercussions.
I note that the Greek Presidency has identified cutting-edge technologies, in biotechnology and defence, as research priorities.
That begs a few questions about how we are deciding what we wish to invest in, with whom we are wishing to compete, and for what purpose.
I am interested in understanding how this links to the current treaty requirement in Article 6 to integrate the environment into policies and practices of the European Union.
Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this.
We are pleased that in future we are going to be monitoring policies in terms of a social sustainable development emphasis.
Given that the Spring summit is supposed to be about sustainability, I am also interested to know what proposals there will be from Council about how it is going to change its own structures to deal with this much more integrated approach.
Our group is also interested to note that the Greek Presidency's priorities include the tasks relating to services of general interest, because we are going to be looking at the preparations for Cancun and the offers from the EU in that connection.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Greece has changed a great deal since its last presidency, as it has become a staunch supporter of Turkey's candidacy.
To a certain extent we can understand the position of the Greek Government, since it aims to solve its problem from the top, by transferring it to the European Union.
At Union level, however, as I have already said several times to my fellow Members here in Parliament, we should not accept what strongly resembles a decision to forge ahead without having considered it further.
Greece's position with regard to the institutions surprised us a little.
The Prime Minister, Costas Simitis, who is here today, said recently, speaking in a French daily newspaper, that 'Greece believes we need a strong Commission rather than two decision-making bodies, the Commission and the Council, otherwise the European Union could risk turning into an intergovernmental Union and not the federal model we are hoping for'.
On studying this statement carefully, we learn that, according to the Greek Government, the Commission should possess greater decision-making power than even the Council.
That is indeed far removed from an intergovernmental Union, but it is also far removed from the traditional Community model.
I hope that the Prime Minister will contradict me later on.
With regard to the priorities of the Greek Presidency, we welcome the emphasis placed on the issues of immigration, asylum and external border management, which today have in fact become extremely serious.
We would therefore ask the Presidency to show greater firmness in these matters, and in particular in the fight against illegal immigration.
Lastly, we are surprised at the absence, in these priorities, of a specific chapter on economic and monetary union, because, on this point, Greece could have presented not only priorities for the future, but also a summary of the past.
This summary would have been fully justified, since Greece has presided over the Eurogroup for the past six months.
We cannot, however, see anything: there is no such summary!
With regard to the past, how has the euro favoured growth, or, on the contrary, has it had an adverse effect?
With regard to the future, how, for example, does the Greek Presidency intend to contribute to making the Stability Pact more intelligent?
We would have benefited from some clarification on all of these points.
Mr President, allow me to start by thanking all the members of the European Parliament.
Their interventions will help the presidency enormously in outlining its policy and taking decisive action.
This has been a most useful debate.
Mr President, after Prime Minister Simitis' exhaustive reply, I wish only to add a brief comment and response in order not to prolong your suffering.
The first question concerns the proposal to create a worldwide Socrates programme.
I believe that this is the way to go.
We have already created an Erasmus World based on the same criteria, save that the financing is such as to restrict us to minor projects.
Let this be clear: if Europe does not undertake a major common research programme to bring back the drained brains from abroad, to make the most of our young people, to create a breeding ground for scientific and cultural knowledge, then we are lost.
You all know that I never exaggerate.
I can assure you: we are lost.
We, with our costs, with our social structure, with our diversities - if we do not take a great leap forward we will be lost.
I will give you just one example, by way of a practical illustration. At present, it costs three times as much to transport a container from China to Amsterdam as it does to transport a container from Amsterdam to China.
Such are the market forces on both sides. I can give you another figure.
In the past month, there have been 8 million new subscribers to mobile telephone networks in China - in one month.
Do we really think we can tackle this world with our research sector in such a fragmented state, without entering the technology race, without being at the forefront of innovation?
We are deluding ourselves.
My response to the second question is this. We have been accused of not mentioning the benefits of the internal markets.
No: these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year.
I would merely point out that so great is the importance of the internal market that, if we were to analyse the sectors which have been affected by inflation in recent months, entering the great, heated debate on the euro, we would find that, where the internal market has been implemented, there has not been any inflation and where there have been delays in implementing the internal market there has been inflation.
Suffice it to say that our future depends on the competition the internal market can bring.
That concludes the item.
The next item is Questions to the Commission (B5-0001/2003).
The Commission has just informed us that, due to unforeseen circumstances, Mr Vitorino cannot attend Question Time.
He will be replaced by Mrs de Palacio, who will reply to Question No 18 by Mr Papayannakis.
Part I
President.
Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I realise that this is rather out of the ordinary, but might I not be permitted to take over Mr Lage's question?
I would be happy to do so.
I wanted to put a supplementary question in any case.
That is not possible.
Supplementary questions must be just that; supplementary questions.
Question No 15 by Carlos Lage (H-0851/02):
Subject: Humanitarian crisis in Angola
The protracted war in Angola has brought about a severe crisis and a calamitous economic and social situation.
Thousands of people, children included, are dying of hunger.
The Luanda Government has been appealing again and again for emergency aid.
Given the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Angola, international aid, not least from the European Union, has to be stepped up immediately.
Is the Commission monitoring developments as regards hunger in Angola, which, according to the most recent figures, is now besetting four million people?
What steps is it taking to minimise the immense human suffering?
Mr President, the Commission is committed to addressing the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola effectively and without delay and to supporting the peace process.
The Commission is constantly monitoring the situation in Angola, as we have done for many years, in order to get a clear picture of humanitarian needs.
I will be going to Angola - and also to Zambia - to assess the situation myself later this month, so I shall gain an overview of the humanitarian situation and the development of the peace process in Angola.
On that occasion I will be signing the EC-Angola cooperation strategy for 2002-2007, including the plan of action.
The Commission's action in Angola is twofold: emergency humanitarian aid and a longer-term strategy based on cooperation.
This is funded by ECHO and by EDF funds.
As far as the humanitarian aid is concerned, the Commission, through ECHO, has already generated a considerable amount of funding to address the needs and will maintain its presence and commitment in the country throughout this year.
Last year Angola was among the top ten recipients of ECHO funding, receiving a total of EUR 14 million.
This year, an initial decision has been taken to provide EUR 8 million funding, due to be adopted soon.
Malnutrition is one of the main targets for our support in the humanitarian area, particularly in forgotten regions where no other donors are present in the country.
As far as the longer-term strategy is concerned, in May 2002, a month after the signature of the peace agreement, a plan of action to support the peace process was presented by the Commission and approved by the General Affairs Council on 13 May.
The plan of action identified a financial package, originally EUR 124 million, from unspent EDF funds and budget lines aimed at addressing the most pressing concerns at this stage, including emergency relief, food aid and food security, reintegration and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons and de-mining operations.
The implementation of this is now under way and to our great satisfaction we can start doing things in a country where for many years we have, owing to the circumstances, only been able to do humanitarian work.
On that basis, and as part of this plan of action, the Commission has made EUR 30 million available for emergency support for the peace process by reallocating funds from earlier European Development Funds to support short-term work on the peace process.
These funds are targeted at medical assistance, the distribution of seeds and tools, food aid and the resettlement of former UNITA soldiers and their families.
De-mining is also important.
We tried to do all this as quickly as possible last year.
The decision on all this will be implemented through different UN agencies, EuronAid and FAO for the food security component and different NGOs for the de-mining operations.
Proposals for EUR 16 million have been signed and the remaining proposals are awaiting approval by the Angolan national authorities.
They are expected to be finalised within the next few weeks.
Although humanitarian support will continue to be provided, the Commission considers that pressure must be kept up on the Angolan Government to urge it to assume more direct responsibility for its own vulnerable populations.
We are therefore calling upon the government of Angola to make more efforts in addressing the critical humanitarian needs of the population.
We welcome the Angolan Government's intention to organise an international conference for the reconstruction of the country, and trust that the views of all groups in society will be reflected in the reconstruction plan to be presented.
The Commission has offered to assist in the organisation of the conference, which is tentatively scheduled to take place in March or April 2003 in Brussels, kindly hosted by the Belgian Government.
These are times of great change and challenge for Angola after many years of conflict.
The emphasis now will be on progress, economic growth, stability and governance.
That will change the whole mood of politics in the country and I am looking forward to the dialogue we shall be participating in next week.
Commissioner, thank you for your very balanced reply to my question. I am pleased with the action taken by the Commission and by the European Union in Angola, and I note that the Commission is stepping up the action it is taking to assist development in and provide humanitarian aid to Angola.
I totally agree that the best solution for Angola is to take advantage of this country's enormous potential.
Angola has been generously endowed with resources by nature, but unfortunately it has also been the victim of acts of madness by mankind for decade upon decade.
It is now possible to use these rich and immense natural resources to benefit the people of this country, which, although it covers an enormous geographical area, has a population of just 13 or 14 million people.
So we are faced with a difficult paradox: a land rich in resources with a population living on the verge of misery, hunger and death.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, I think that the Commission should continue along the lines you have just informed us about.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to add something to what has just been said.
Only a matter of a few decades ago, Angola was one of Africa's principal agricultural exporters, and this of course means that it is appalling that we now have to supply it with food aid - a situation brought about by both war and socialist mismanagement of the economy.
There are three questions I would like to put to you.
Firstly, what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing?
That, in my view, is the most important thing, that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce.
Secondly, what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food?
And thirdly, what is happening about educational and training programmes?
These are, I believe, the three most important issues that are at stake here.
It is difficult to say what is most important.
In cases like this almost everything is important.
I would say to Mr Posselt that consolidating peace, to give people the confidence that it is irreversible, is most important right now.
But certainly it is essential to open up the interior of the country and make roads safe from landmines so that economic life and the resettlement of people can take place.
This is extremely high on the agenda.
For many years any support, even food supplies and basic commodities, has had to be flown in to the small towns in most of the country: these towns were more or less isolated because of UNITA which surrounded them.
For humanitarian reasons, for political reasons and for economic reasons, opening up and creating a normal flow is absolutely essential.
There is an increasing number of accidents due to landmines because things are starting to move now.
It is therefore enormously urgent to accelerate that effort.
As regards agriculture, as defined in the country strategy paper, we will be focusing on agricultural development.
This is essential both for the survival of the people and because of the enormous potential that Mr Posselt rightly pointed to.
Angola is more than diamonds and oil. It is also a country that has great potential for a much more diversified economy.
As the author is not present, Question No 16 lapses.
I would apologise to the Commissioner on behalf of this Parliament.
Question No 17 by John Walls Cushnahan (H-0872/02):
Subject: Recent maritime disasters
In light of the series of maritime disasters that have occurred in European waters in November and December 2002, namely the Prestige disaster which continues to produce yet more oil slicks which are devastating the coastline and marine life of Galicia, compounded with the recent collision between the freighter the Tricolor and the Kariba, and the second collision between the wreck of the Tricolor and the freighter the Nicola, will the Commission recognise that there is a clear need for a coordinated EU response?
Furthermore, given the severe consequences of such maritime accidents, what is the Commission's view of the submission that I made to the Convention on the Future of Europe in June 2002 (reference Conv 150/02), calling for the creation of an EU Coastguard?
Mr President, on 3 December, the Commission approved a communication on the measures to be taken as a result of the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige.
This document contains detailed proposals for a series of measures and, in particular, speeds up the application of the legislation approved by Parliament and the Council following the Erika disaster, the so-called Erika I and II packages.
The Transport Council of 6 December supported the majority of the initiatives proposed by the Commission.
Therefore, on 20 December, the College approved a proposal for a regulation, which has just been sent to the Council and to Parliament, prohibiting the transport of heavy oils by single-hull oil tankers destined for or originating from European Union ports and speeding up the replacement of this type of oil tanker by double-hull oil tankers.
The European Union has not waited for the recent events to happen to implement an agreed maritime safety policy.
There was already a wide range of measures for guaranteeing better protection in this field.
The Commission takes good note of Parliament's contribution to the work of the Convention with regard to the creation of a European coastguard body as an effective means of fighting the danger of pollution and maintaining maritime safety.
The recurrence of accidents such as the Erika or the Prestige, not to mention other lesser ones such as the Vicky just a few days ago, demonstrates that the whole of Europe would gain from a European coastguard body, particularly in view of the fact that some of the 25 future States of the Union have absolutely no type of protection or body of this nature.
In any event, the main task of the European Maritime Safety Agency, which is soon to be created, is to technically coordinate the application of Community rules, and the Commission will study which measures must be adopted in the future, in view of the experiences of the Agency.
Commissioner, thank you for your response.
The Prestige disaster highlights not only the gaps in the implementation of EU legislation which you referred to in your answer, designed to prevent the recurrence of such incidents, but also the lack of an adequate EU response mechanism.
In relation to the Prestige, responsibility and liability were disputed.
This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact.
If this incident, with the consequences it had for the shared environment and European fishing industries, had occurred in EU waters, and if an EU coastguard had existed, the response time would have been reduced, a refuge port would have been designated and the damage could have been minimised.
On top of this, we have had the subsequent incidents involving the Tricolor, the Kariba and the Nicola.
All these indicate the need not just for legislation but for the resources to do the job.
Would the Commission consider setting up a study?
We can learn how the United States tackles this problem, in relation not only to prevention - it saves some USD 6 billion per year by preventing incidents like this - but to its response when incidents do happen.
They have successful experience in this field, and we have a lot to learn from them.
Since the Commission is the body which initiates legislation, I urge you, Commissioner, to consider acting on the findings of any such inquiry you may care to set up.
Mr Cushnahan, I can only agree with you in that, amongst other things, I cannot accept that citizens have fewer rights in Europe than in the United States.
This is what I said very clearly when I made the proposals in the Erika I and Erika II packages.
If the Council had agreed to the proposal for single-hull vessels transporting oil to leave Community waters, the Prestige disaster would not have taken place, because it would have had to leave Community waters several months beforehand.
I do fully agree that there are things we can learn from the United States.
I do not understand why the United States can have a timetable according to which there will be no single-hull vessels transporting oil in its ports by 2010 and we cannot adopt a similar measure.
In the end, as the honourable Members know, a less ambitious timetable was approved.
What I have proposed to this Parliament and to the Council of Ministers is that we return to the Commission's initial proposal and speed up the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil.
And furthermore, to take the maximum security measures, specifically, that the transport of heavy oil, of heavy fuel oil, of bituminous products and of tars, in other words, of the most polluting products, should be carried out by safer ships, meaning those with double hulls.
Copenhagen speaks of specific measures.
The Commission is studying how to apply those specific measures following the Prestige; they include the possibility of promoting the construction and maintenance of two or three large skimmers, large suction machines, so that, if an oil slick happens - unfortunately there is no such thing as zero risk, although it should be reduced to the minimum - there may be vessels of the greatest possible power, superior to the vessels currently in existence on European coasts, which furthermore can operate and act at sea at times of storms and difficulties.
We must coordinate the European response.
The Agency, which would be responsible for these vessels and for the deployment at different strategic points on European coasts, must also implement a series of plans for responding to maritime accidents of this type.
This will be one of your tasks: to create a pre-established method for cooperation between different Member States of the Union, which could work better, since it largely depends on bilateral agreements rather than on a perfectly coordinated European-type action.
With regard to responsibility, as the honourable Member knows, we are working on it and I hope that over the next few weeks we can present, within the Commission and rapidly approved, a proposal to provide a criminal definition of serious negligence in all the Member States of the Union in the event of this type of accident.
Commissioner, it seems to me from reading the documents drafted by the Commission, which have your imprimatur on them, and from listening to what you have said, or at least what you have said from time to time in the past, that there is a real political conflict between your position, that is the Commission's position, and the Council's position as presented at Copenhagen.
I do indeed have the document of 3 December, which I read with great interest. However, as I see it, the Transport and Environment Councils held in the same month and the Copenhagen European Council did not respond in any practical way to the Commission's request for urgent action.
You called for the commitments given in the 'Erika' legislation to be implemented, Mrs de Palacio, and you called for an approach that went beyond those commitments, but the European Council turned its back on the victims of the disaster who at that very moment were scooping up oil with their own hands.
The Council seemed to hold the Commission's views in contempt, and it is enough to say that it proposed only five million euros for Galicia and all the countries affected, whereas the United States is currently calling for four billion euros for the 'Exxon Valdez' accident.
With this in mind, Commissioner, I would like to ask you why the Commission has not brought forward a legislative act like the United States' Oil Pollution Act, which provides a real basis for combating this problem.
Furthermore, will Galicia be considered as a location for a European Maritime Safety Agency?
Mr Nogueira, firstly, in relation to your last comments, I do not see that conflict between the positions of the Commission and of the Council.
At the Transport Council on 6 December, conclusions were unanimously approved which stated that the States are committed at national level, until we have a Community proposal, to adopting measures aimed at excluding from their ports any ships transporting bituminous products (heavy fuel oil, heavy oil, tars) which do not have a double hull.
And the country which I know best, just like the honourable Member, has already taken a measure which entered into force on 1 January this year, and certain other countries have adopted it as well.
Secondly, as well as this proposal, they have committed themselves to adopting, before June, an accelerated timetable for the departure of single-hull ships transporting oil from European ports.
Thirdly, they have committed themselves to speeding up the implementation of all the measures adopted in the Erika I and Erika II packages and therefore not to wait until July of this year or February 2004 to do so.
In particular, I am awaiting a response to the delicate issue of the famous ports of refuge; in principle, the Member States of the Union have the time limit of February 2004, but I hope they will communicate it to us before that - some countries are beginning to work on this - and I hope that they will do so before the summer.
I would therefore insist that I believe there is considerable agreement.
The Prestige tragedy has been a real wake-up call for all the Member States of the Union.
I would like to have the powers of the federal government of the United States, but the European Union is not a federation and the Commission is not therefore the federal government of a United States of Europe; I would not mind if it were, and if I were a Minister in that federal government, but that is not the case.
Despite this, we have proposed a series of measures which are very similar to the American proposal, except on the timetable - which, I insist, we are going to raise again so that it may be speeded up - and on the amount of compensation, which is on the table with the Ministers and must be discussed, and if it is not adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the Ministers have committed themselves to proposing it at European level.
Finally, I would like to say to the honourable Member that I have nothing against the Maritime Safety Agency, but rather I am entirely in favour of it, but it is not I who decides.
This will be decided by the European Council at the appropriate time.
I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue in the House today.
My supplementary question to the Commissioner is: given recent maritime disasters off the Spanish coast, and indeed in the English Channel, does she agree with me that it is only a matter of time before a passenger ferry and a rogue oil tanker collide, with devastating environmental and indeed human consequences?
Is it not time to ban all flag-of-convenience ships once and for all, not just from EU ports but from EU waters as well?
Mr President, the honourable Member has a very good knowledge of maritime safety issues; you have been a rapporteur and furthermore you have had considerable successes, such as the inclusion of black boxes, which was largely achieved thanks to your work, effort and persistence.
You are also well aware of the problem associated with maritime traffic.
I believe we must do work on this; in relation to the problem of the Channel, we have seen that there are aspects on which progress can be made.
With regard to flags of convenience, the honourable Members are aware that, within the International Maritime Organisation, work is being done to improve this situation.
In any event, there are two types of flag of convenience: those which exist for purely economic or tax reasons and those which, furthermore, demonstrate very little responsibility when it comes to control and the quality of the ships which fly them.
We must distinguish between these two situations.
The way to act is not to make a generic declaration; which would be the easiest thing to do, but, when it comes down to it, would be difficult to put into practice.
We have to make their lives difficult in our ports so that they stop coming.
In this regard, port inspections, with the selective criteria we have proposed and which have been approved thanks to the support of this Parliament, and which the Council also approved, clearly mean that, as soon as a ship flying that flag reaches a European Union port, it will be thoroughly inspected.
It will therefore have to be up to scratch.
This type of action and control, particularly in relation to those countries and flags which present most risk, is the way to act in the immediate term.
However, the honourable Member is right, because it is not just a question of flags of convenience, but also the problem of the responsibility of classification societies, who have a conflict of interests, because they justify and certify the quality of a ship on behalf of the State issuing the flag but at the same time work for the owner of the ship in order to issue certain types of certificates.
We must analyse these chains and deal with the issues in depth, and we must also deal with responsibility in the event of serious negligence.
We will begin the second part of this Question Time with a question which should be replied to by Mr Vitorino but which, as we have already said, will be replied to by Mrs de Palacio.
Part II
Questions to Commissioner de Palacio
Question No 18 by Mihail Papayannakis (H-0874/02):
Subject: Accusations of torture in Greece
A recent Council of Europe report (Committee for the Prevention of Torture) points out that during investigations ELAS, the Port Police and the Customs Authorities concealed the existence of temporary detention areas for foreigners, while completely unacceptable conditions were found to exist at jails in Kozani and Heraklion.
Given that the above Committee has received 'a significant number' of accusations from detainees about ill-treatment by police and port authorities, usually during interrogation, that it states in its conclusions that Greece significantly downplays the extent of the problem of the ill-treatment of prisoners by the police authorities and that the EU is based, inter alia, on the principle of respect for human rights, what measures does the Commission intend to take to put an end to the flagrant violation of human rights?
Questions to Commissioner Liikanen
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would point out that the issues raised by the honourable Member are linked, in particular, to respect for human dignity and the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading punishments or treatment, principles which are common to all the Member States of the Union.
These principles are laid down in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and are confirmed in Articles 1 and 4 of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Respect for these principles by the States is guaranteed by the infringement procedure laid down in Article 226 of the European Community Treaty and by the political procedures laid down in Article 7 of the Union Treaty.
In accordance with the former, the Commission can bring a case before the Court of Justice if the alleged act falls within the scope of Community law.
In the case of the latter, the Commission or a third of the Member States of the Union can raise the issue before the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government, in the event of a serious or persistent violation of the principles laid down in Article 6.
The majority of cases relating to the issues raised by the honourable Member relate to asylum, immigration and the protection of the rights of third-country nationals.
These issues are included in the scope of the Community's competences.
Furthermore, the Community began to legislate on this issue in accordance with Articles 61 and 63 of the European Community Treaty.
The Commission would point out however that the report by the Council of Europe which the honourable Member refers to was followed by a detailed response by the Greek authorities, which in the current situation is providing a series of responses to the concerns expressed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
In any event, the Commission will closely monitor the development of the dialogue between the Council of Europe and the Greek authorities.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply.
I really do hope that you will keep an eye on this.
It is a very, very serious matter.
It raises questions of transparency and questions of control because, as you can see, the committee of the Council of Europe has been given false information.
I hope that neither you nor the European Commission will be given false information.
I should like to put the following supplementary question to you: quite apart from anything else, when it comes in these cases to the right to visit foreign nationals, especially immigrants, wherever they are being held, and it is often in unofficial detention centres, can we guarantee or can we call on or persuade the Greek authorities to make visiting rights normal practice, at least for non-governmental organisations?
Then at least we could resolve the problems which have already been raised as a result of these accusations, accusations which make me personally cringe with shame, both on my own account and as a Greek citizen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the fact that - as I have said - it seems that there is a clear dialogue between the Greek authorities and the European Council, I would like to say that the Council of Ministers of the European Union reached a political agreement in December 2002 to bring forward a directive on the minimum rules for the reception of asylum seekers in the Member States of the European Union, on the basis of a Commission proposal of May 2001.
Formal adoption is yet to take place because of the parliamentary reservations of one State of the Union.
However, this directive - which was also supported by the Greek Government - intends to grant asylum seekers material facilities, which include accommodation, food and clothing, as well as a daily allowance which guarantees an adequate standard of living and subsistence for the asylum seekers.
The States will also have to inform asylum seekers of the advantages they may benefit from, give them access to the labour market in certain circumstances, and ensure that they receive the necessary medical care.
Furthermore, they will ensure that the conditions for reception are subject to appropriate monitoring and control.
Finally, they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers, at borders and in residential centres.
All these measures will be applied in favour of asylum seekers authorised to remain in the territory in that capacity, even if they are obliged to remain in a particular place.
Ladies and gentlemen, Greece has accepted this agreement and - although the Commission will monitor this issue - we know that the dialogue between the Greek authorities and the European Council about these complaints that the honourable Member has mentioned is continuing.
Mr President, I think Mr Papayannakis was also raising the issue of control.
In one Member State, Italy, Members of Parliament are able to visit prisons and similar institutions day and night, without advance warning.
Is the Commission prepared to table a proposal for European parliamentarians to be able to visit prisons and this type of institution throughout the Union's territory?
Mr President, all I can say to the honourable Member is that I have taken good note and that I will communicate the suggestion you have just made to my colleague, Mr Vitorino.
Mr President, I would like to refer to my question which is now number 52 on the question paper, which I tabled within due time specifically addressed to Mr. Liikanen, on the subject of regulatory impact assessment.
This is a subject which I know he is very capable to deal with, since I have participated in a number of seminars organised by his services.
When I arrived in Strasbourg this week, I discovered that this question was not down for a reply by Mr Liikanen, and Parliament's services told me that it had been reclassified by the Commission - I understand, by President Prodi's services - as a general question, and that therefore it would not be covered.
I have two points to make to the President.
Firstly, I have discussed this with Mr. Liikanen and, if we have time to reach it this afternoon, he is certainly prepared to address the subject, if not necessarily the full scope of the question.
The broader issue is, could we ask the Parliament's services - and I am not blaming them in any way because this is a Commission issue - to ensure that if a Member's question is reclassified in this way, and is not down for an answer by the Commissioner to whom it is redirected, we are told about that, so that it can be reformulated if necessary and the Commissioner to whom it is addressed can answer it.
It does seem to me, Mr President, from the point of view of this Parliament, that it is perfectly possible for the Commission services in effect to deflect a question away from a Commissioner unilaterally, without the Member concerned having any knowledge of it.
Perhaps you could address that, and take it up with the services, so that in future we may be given more knowledge about these instances.
Can I ask you, if we have time, to allow Mr Liikanen to answer my question?
In general terms, I must say to Mr Harbour that we have provided ourselves with Rules of Procedure - approved a few weeks ago - and that these Rules regulate practically everything.
Competence for and allocation of the order or classification of these questions falls to the Commission, which naturally can make mistakes, just as Parliament can.
In the classification today, as you have explained quite rightly, this question is not allocated to Mr Liikanen.
I have no opposition to Mr Liikanen replying, but I must say one thing: that this is not just an issue between Mr Liikanen, you and myself, but that there are other Members whose questions are in the order, who wish to ask their questions and we have very little time.
In other words, introducing one question means giving up another, and this sets a very difficult precedent.
You, as a Briton, know better than anybody else how important precedents are.
In principle, your question will be replied to in writing.
It will only be possible if some of the twenty minutes remains and Mr Liikanen is prepared to answer it.
Only in this case.
In any event, Mr Liikanen can give his opinion.
Since you have referred to the opinion of Mr Liikanen, I will give him the floor so that he can give his opinion on this point or order.
Mr President, in the Commission of course the impact assessment has a global approach at the moment, because we try to assess business, environmental and social aspects at the same time.
I am very honoured that the President of the Commission has taken full responsibility for that, but I might have some questions which are closely related to Mr Harbour's question.
I can then reply in that context.
If it comes within the twenty minutes, without setting a precedent - and I have heard Mr Liikanen - I will allow a brief reply.
Otherwise, it will not be possible and you will receive a reply in writing.
As the author is not present, Question No 19 lapses.
Question No 20 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0876/02):
Subject: Greece and SMEs
At the Barcelona European Council Member States were asked to speed up the implementation of the European Charter for SMEs and the Commission was asked to draw up a Green Paper on the entrepreneurial spirit and SMEs.
Has the Commission drawn up such a document and, if so, what are the main new strategies for promoting the entrepreneurial activities of SMEs?
Has it already evaluated the participation of SMEs in existing Community support programmes for SMEs?
In particular in respect of Greece, is any information available on the number of SMEs, by category of activity and size of undertaking, which have so far benefited from Community funding (beyond the EUR 1000 subsidy from the Greek Ministry of Development's 'Diktiotheite' (Link Up) Programme and on the results of this funding?
The Commission is committed to improving the environment for small businesses.
This is a policy line that we have followed for many years.
The European Charter for Small Enterprises has been a valuable instrument focusing and reinforcing this work.
Many of the Charter recommendations address issues that fall under national responsibility.
Much of the Commission's work aims to help Member States to improve the business environment for their small businesses.
The Commission welcomes the request of the Barcelona European Council that Member States speed up the Charter implementation.
This has contributed to keeping small businesses' concerns high on the political agenda.
I had a chance to speak with the Greek Presidency last week and my services have separately met the national authorities of all Member States including the Greek Ministry of Development to review progress under the Charter.
The Commission will report next week on the implementation of the Charter but I can already now say that Member States' progress in 2002 is encouraging, in particular in the areas of education for entrepreneurship and better regulation.
Better regulation is at the heart of the Commission's concerns at the moment.
If I may just refer to the question by Mr Harbour, better regulation involves, at the Commission level, firstly open consultation so that SMEs are not taken by surprise when new legislation is being proposed, and secondly impact assessment where we try in a consolidated manner to assess the impact on businesses, especially of course small- and medium-sized businesses, of any important new regulatory initiative that the Commission takes.
This year we have agreed orally on the number of the issues which will go to this kind of broad impact assessment when we assess the economic, social and environmental impact.
A detailed review of all Community measures benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises will also be published next week when the Commission reports comprehensively on entrepreneurial and SME activities.
At the same time I hope we will be also able to adopt in the Commission the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship.
This Green Paper intends to launch a debate among the widest possible audience of stakeholders on two crucial issues:
how to produce more entrepreneurs,
and
how to get more firms to grow.
The Green Paper defines entrepreneurship as a 'mindset' and focuses on the role of policy on entrepreneurial behaviour among both new and existing entrepreneurs.
It also considers the influence of society at large on entrepreneurial initiative and risk-taking.
The Paper suggests a coordinated approach, involving policy-makers in different services at European, national and regional level, to provide a coherent response to the needs of entrepreneurs.
The Commission can help the Member States to share experience and compare performance.
The Paper identifies three pillars for action:
firstly, bringing down barriers to business development and growth;
secondly, balancing the risks and reward of entrepreneurship;
and thirdly, a society that values entrepreneurship.
For each of these, the Green Paper raises a number of questions for debate.
As far as the SMEs which have benefited from Community funding are concerned, some basic data have been collected but a completed picture would require more time for an in-depth analysis.
Thank you for your reply, Commissioner.
The only specific information you have given me is that the Green Paper is being prepared and will contribute to the joint effort being made by the European institutions and the Member States to increase entrepreneurship, kick-start the European economy and, as a result, create new jobs.
I, for my part, need more specific details and I think it would be worth your spending some time on them because, as we have seen from our lengthy discussion of the Lisbon strategy earlier today, following the presentation of the Greek Presidency's priorities, it will not be easy to achieve the targets we have set and the best way of giving the European economy the competitiveness it needs and creating jobs is to develop small and medium-sized enterprises.
I shall wait and see what information I obtain in response to my questions from the report you will be publishing next week, and I reserve the right to re-table my question and ask for specific answers to specific questions.
Question No 21 by Paul RÃŒbig (H-0879/02):
Subject: Status of third-party certifiers in the EU
The European Commission is currently working on a new approach to the CE marking system and the future strategy for that system.
From the point of view of European SMUs, it is particularly important that European third-party certifiers should continue to be able to place their own marks on all products.
Particularly in the light of global competition, and in the interests of consumer protection, those marks should be easily recognisable by every member of the public, given that non-European certifiers can at any time check a product and, as third-party certifiers, have their own names and logos placed on that product.
How does the European Commission intend to incorporate these considerations regarding the strengthening of the position of European certification undertakings into its new approach to the CE marking system?
The objectives of the forthcoming communication on the new approach, enhancing the implementation and new approach are: firstly, to analyse the overall situation in the field of new approach directives which cover a wide range of products; secondly, to detect possible weaknesses; and thirdly, to outline remedial measures to improve the application of the new approach directives.
CE conformity is one of the main points that have been identified as requiring strengthening.
This marking, required by most new approach directives, is addressed to market surveillance authorities of the Member States and symbolises the conformity of the product with the applicable Community requirements imposed on the manufacturer.
The communication will also address the issue of the relationship between the CE marking and voluntary markings.
The Commission has conducted an on-line survey of new approach stakeholders.
As far as the CE marking was concerned, the Commission has taken on board the opinions of the majority of those who replied, the main thinking being that the additional voluntary markings are not in contradiction with the CE marking, as long as they do not cause confusion or overlap in meaning or purpose with it.
They also often provide added value for consumers, users, public authorities and all those being addressed.
Third party certifiers are in some sectors already involved in the conformity assessment procedures leading to the CE marking.
It is also quite often stipulated that the identification number of the item should appear next to the CE marking.
Third party certification, in areas of conformity assessment where no harmonised directives apply, is permitted and even welcomed, since it indicates to the people to whom it is addressed that certain qualities of the product have been tested and certified by the body in question.
Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, believing as I do that third-party certification will be a particularly important consideration for us in the future.
The CE conformity marking does indeed confirm that the product complies with all rules within the European Union and is legal here.
The only thing is that the public do not, in fact, want just this legal status quo; they want certification by a third - and of course neutral - party to give better products a higher market profile, so that what we end up with, for all practical purposes, is a quality pyramid.
The CE marking would be its lowest level, with a standard mark being required to indicate significant improvements in quality, practical usefulness, or safety features in comparison with the normal CE marking.
I believe that such upward gradation of quality would be of great importance to consumers and the public.
I thank Mr RÃŒbig for his interest on this issue of conformity assessment.
Conformity assessment new approach directives are not usually included among the major policy issues which reach the front page.
When we talk about SMEs or any entrepreneurs, whether small or large enterprises, these are key issues to enable a company to act in the internal market and globally.
On the other hand, they also enable the proper weight to be given to the interests of the consumer.
I hope Parliament will create a system to deal properly with the communication which is coming in fairly soon.
Of course, I am not going to set any bad precedents, and therefore, within the Questions to Mr Liikanen, if it is considered that the question can be partially replied to - not Question No 53, but Question No 20b - I do not have any opposition, but if Mr Liikanen believes that the question is much more general and the Commission's allocation of the question to Mr Prodi is correct, this question will be replied to in writing.
First of all, I should like to refer to the reply that the President will give today.
For the first time the Commission has made a proposal that has undergone this broadened impact assessment, concerning employment policy guidelines.
It is very important for our internal work that we stick to this impact assessment system.
I hope that Parliament will take advantage of this too.
When dealing with legislation Parliament will be able properly to assess the Commission proposal.
The next challenge is how Parliament and the Council will assess the changes they might make to the Commission proposal.
That is the issue for Parliament, the Council and the Commission in forthcoming discussions.
Referring to the President's reply, we will have opportunities to discuss the matter further.
Mr RÃŒbig, in any event you will receive a reply in writing as Question No 52.
Questions to Commissioner Patten
Question No 22 by Bart Staes (H-0832/02):
Subject: CFSP: Future prospects for Kosova
Recent contacts with political leaders in Kosova have made it clear to me that the young Kosovan institutions face enormous handicaps in seeking to pursue a real and effective policy, not least on the socio-economic front.
I can dispense with a description of the dire economic situation in Kosova, well known as it is.
Kosova needs urgently to be enabled to pursue an imaginative policy in order to attract investment.
The big problem is that the Kosovan authorities are prevented by the statute in force from pursuing any such policy.
Kosova is, in particular, not at present in a position to conclude any international trade agreements or to contract loans with international financial institutions.
Kosova needs a clearly autonomous statute.
I therefore ask the Commission what future prospects it can hold out to the Kosovars of that happening.
Specifically, can Kosovan institutions count on very wide-ranging autonomy in the future?
Let me emphasise that Kosovo's institutional set-up, including the distribution of responsibilities, has been defined by the United Nations Security Council and must be respected by all sides, including the provisional institutions of self-government in Kosovo.
Kosovo's current economic situation is clearly a product of past political and economic neglect and oppression before 1999.
This demanded major economic efforts from the United Nations interim administration, and especially its European Union pillar, in the last three years.
A war-torn region has been economically stabilised, basic infrastructure has been repaired, the euro has been introduced and the legal framework for a market economy is being laid.
A new customs service is collecting much-needed revenues for the Kosovo budget.
We are still heavily engaged on the ground to further support Kosovo's recovery, for instance, the consolidation of the rule of law, which is vital to attract foreign direct investment.
There is still a long way to go but we should not forget from which level we started.
Furthermore, the Commission has succeeded in letting Kosovo benefit from the various instruments of the European Union's stabilisation and association process, even without a decision on its future status, to ensure that it does not fall behind in the region.
UNMIK is also currently consulting with various international financial organisations on how to give Kosovo access to their funds in the absence of a decision on its final status.
In the framework of the stability pact, UNMIK is exploring ways of embedding Kosovo in the process of regional trade liberalisation and has already signed the Memorandum of Understanding on the regional electricity market in south-east Europe.
In short, we have gone a very long way to find creative ways to improve Kosovo's economic situation and we will continue to do so.
Our efforts and those of the United Nations qualify the imaginative policy that the honourable Member mentioned in his question, even though Kosovo's unresolved status poses additional challenges to both the international and local authorities.
This should not prevent us from pursuing a sound economic policy and structural reforms, which are feasible and necessary to ensure economic growth and welfare for the people of Kosovo.
I hope that the technical breakdown is not a reflection of the situation in Kosovo, for we all know that there are power cuts there sometimes as the electricity supply is not yet fully operational.
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten wholeheartedly for his answer.
It was a very elaborate answer which took account of reality.
My question was actually prompted by talks with representatives of the Kosovar community, representatives of both Mr Haradinaj's party and the LDK of Ibrahim Rugova, both of whom point out whenever we meet them that Kosovo has no status as yet, which makes their work much more difficult.
They are asking us to make serious efforts to enable them to contact international financial institutions despite their current status.
We know that much has happened.
The war took place almost three and a half years ago.
Is it not possible for us, the European Union, which has the necessary leverage in the international institutions, to make efforts to help Kosovo gain access to institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the context of the United Nations?
This is a question from the people on the spot.
First of all I am glad that technology eventually brought us the honourable Member's supplementary question.
I have two points.
First of all I very much agree with the argument of the head of the UN mission in Kosovo, Mr Steiner, that the real task for Kosovo over the coming year is to put standards before status.
What we want to see is Kosovo putting in place the sort of policies and the sort of implementing agencies which will allow it, with the other countries in the region, to move ever closer to the European Union.
Secondly, the honourable Member is correct in saying that a problem that we face in Kosovo is that as it becomes more economically self-sustaining, as it moves away from heavy dependency on grants, it will naturally be looking to international financial institutions and others for loans.
The status issue has raised some problems in that respect.
We are discussing that issue with the IFIs, in particular with the European Investment Bank, and I very much hope that we will be able to resolve it in a way which enables Kosovo, as one would expect of any economy in those circumstances, to move from grant-dependency to the ability to borrow money and to service those loans.
Question No 23 by Bernd Posselt (H-0866/02):
Subject: Status of Kosovo
Would the Commission be prepared to have various options drawn up for the future status of Kosovo and to submit them to the Council and Parliament for further discussion, or does it see any other practicable ways of finally tackling this problem?
Kosovo's status is currently defined under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999.
Any decision on its final status will therefore have to be taken by the Security Council.
The international community has not set a clear point in time at which this issue will be debated.
Consequently it is not up to the Commission to draw up scenarios for Kosovo's future status.
The European Union fully supports the policy of standards before status pursued by the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to which I have just referred, endorsed by the UN Security Council at its meeting of 24 April last year.
UNMIC has set clear benchmarks concerning democratic and market economic reforms, human and minority rights, which are all necessary to prepare Kosovo for future challenges.
These basic standards must be met before a discussion on status can begin.
Kosovo is an integral part of the region for which we have devised the stabilisation and association process to bring it closer to European Union structures.
We have made sure that Kosovo's unresolved status does not prevent it from benefiting from the stabilisation and association process.
Commissioner, I too am aware that Kosovo's present status is laid down in the UN Resolution, but the simple fact is that we also have to consider the future, and that is where I can envisage a problem, in that no major investor will put money into Kosovo if he does not know what sort of long-term future the place has to look forward to.
If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country, they will carry on trying to emigrate, rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself.
Hence this question: is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo, in which these issues are at least considered?
After all, the present position cannot remain as it is for decades at a stretch, and we cannot go sliding, without any sort of forward planning, into a future that will be with us very soon.
The Member is right to show the importance of attracting inward investment to Kosovo, but I think that any would-be investor would have a lot of other concerns higher on their agenda than the constitutional status of Kosovo - concerns about the rule of law, about the law and order situation, about organised crime and about the policy infrastructure within which he or she was being encouraged to invest.
That is why, as I said earlier, I support the arguments which have been put forward by the special representative of the Secretary-General, Mr Steiner, that the task at this stage for Kosovo is to focus on standards rather than to consume the political process with debates about status.
Clearly we have discussed those political issues with Kosovar representatives.
I am very pleased that in the three years and more that I have been visiting Kosovo we have seen not only a transformation of the economic and social situation on the ground but the establishment of the provisional administration: the political structure to reflect the wishes of the people of Kosovo themselves.
I think that is a step forward, but I very much hope, in the debate which local politicians have, that they will recognise that whatever the nature of their aspirations on the status issue, the first thing they have to get right is the basics of economic and social life in Kosovo.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think that you are right to refer to the arguments of the honourable Member who is talking about standards before status.
That is an 'either/or' approach.
Should we not, however, be aiming for a 'both/and' approach?
Should we not be working on standards - and I share your opinion entirely - and the status of Kosovo at the same time?
I think that a 'both/and' approach is a better one, one which offers the Kosovar people more hope and more opportunities.
I just wanted to point that out.
Question No 24 by Torben Lund (H-0836/02):
Subject: Israeli military operations and lost EU funding
The EU has financed many projects in the state of Palestine, in particular to help develop democracy and secure human rights.
Will the Commission say which projects the EU is financing in the state of Palestine and indicate the extent of the damage caused by Israeli military operations to EU-funded projects?
Will the Commission also say what the consequences of Israeli military operations in the state of Palestine are in terms of Israel's chances of obtaining support from the EU and in regard to relations between the EU and Israel in general?
Following a request from the Council, the Commission compiled in January last year a list of projects funded by the European Union and Member States which had either been destroyed or damaged by Israeli military forces.
The list of destroyed projects has recently been updated by the Commission office in Jerusalem, in coordination with the EU Member State representative offices in Jerusalem and Ramallah.
The estimated total, as of 14 December last year, stands at approximately EUR 24 million.
This assessment is limited to the costs of physical infrastructure, excluding indirect losses such as project delays or suspensions.
These estimated damages were presented to the General Affairs Council of 28 January last year; the GAC in turn asked the Government of Israel to put an end to this practice and reserved the right to claim reparation in the appropriate fora.
The issue was also more recently discussed at the EU-Israel Association Council meeting of 21 October 2002.
The position of the European Union in the international community is that the wanton destruction of basic infrastructure and facilities is counter-productive. It sets back efforts to improve the economic, social and humanitarian development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Poverty levels are now at over 60% and unemployment is at around 50%.
This situation of economic collapse, and a deepening humanitarian crisis, destroys hope and destroys any prospect of stability and security for both Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel, due to its relatively high average income per inhabitant, is not eligible to benefit from bilateral European Union funding under MEDA programmes.
So the Israeli Government or Israeli public entities do not receive funding from the European Union aid budget.
Some organisations from civil society in Israel and the Palestinian territories may apply for projects designed to support the peace process.
These projects should, in our view, be pursued in any circumstances.
Some organisations have advocated - and this has been debated in Parliament - commercial sanctions against Israel.
I am bound to say that in my strong judgment the suspension of the association agreement, which provides the basis not only for the European Union's trade relations with Israel but also for its political dialogue, would do nothing at all to increase the understanding of the Israeli authorities in relation to the current widely held concerns of the European Union and of many European Union citizens.
A summary table of financial aid given by the European Union to the Palestinian Authority from 1994 to 2002, as well as the updated table with the estimate of losses, are being sent directly to the honourable Member.
Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for a very precise and very satisfactory answer.
We no doubt all view the present situation in the Middle East as one of unimaginative tit-for-tat exchanges, and I personally think that the military action on the part of Israel is such as to make it almost impossible to imagine the Palestinian people's being able to unite around a well-functioning society.
In answer to the only supplementary question, I should like to be told whether the military action currently being taken by Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank affects the EU's policy of aid to the Palestinian people.
Has it any influence, or is the EU trying to maintain the aid it is at present able to give to the development of Palestinian society?
I also think that this is all illustrated very graphically by the fact that it has not even been possible to hold democratic elections in the Palestinian area because of the situation inflicted by Israel upon the Palestinian people.
I should like to make two points.
Firstly, all of us condemn terrorist acts.
All of us condemn suicide bombing.
Many of us doubt whether the right way of rooting out the infrastructure of terrorism in the Palestinian territories is by destroying the infrastructure of public facilities and the Palestinian authority.
I am not sure what damaging and almost destroying the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territories has to do with rooting out terrorism.
I am not sure what destroying the Land Registry has to do with rooting out terrorism.
Very often it looks to bystanders as though every manifestation of institutional life in the Palestinian territories has been targeted, whether public or private, whether the authorities' administrative structure or civil society.
I happen to believe that is a profoundly mistaken policy, particularly if one is trying to hold out to Palestinians a political prospect and a path to peace and future security.
As to the question of our assistance in Palestine, we continue to provide to the Palestinian authority - and this is a policy that began because of the block put on the payment of tax revenues by Israel to the Palestinian authority - very carefully controlled and monitored assistance, for instance to pay for doctors and nurses and for the ordinary infrastructure.
We have been one of the main supporters of the Palestinian authority and have been the subject of some very unfair criticism for that.
However, keeping a Palestinian authority in being is an important part of holding out the prospect of a peace process.
We continue to provide substantial quantities of other sorts of assistance, such as humanitarian assistance.
Before Christmas we announced that we would provide EUR 30 million for those municipalities in Palestine that had been hardest hit by hostilities.
We are providing a loan fund of EUR 10 million for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
I can send details of all the assistance that we have given in the Palestinian authorities.
I am only sorry that it has not been more successful in creating the economic and social foundations that are so relevant to a peaceful political future.
Mr President, I would be interested to know if the Commission has considered the accusations from the Israeli point of view.
Following the destruction of Palestinian infrastructure, these accusations were made precisely when that same infrastructure had some connection with terrorist activities directed against Israel and against Israeli civilians, without regard to whether they were Jewish or of Arab descent.
I would be interested to know what conclusions this has led the Commission to draw.
As I suggested in response to the previous supplementary question, it may be that the destruction of some projects and some infrastructure has been an unfortunate by-product of legitimate, counter-terrorism activities, which are proportionate to the violence that they are seeking to contain.
This may be true in some circumstances, but what has seemed surprising to us is the way in which one Palestinian institution after another has been destroyed or badly damaged as though some people believe that the aim of the exercise should be to undermine the ability of Palestinians to actually create an administrative structure for a future Palestinian state.
I will take two examples that I referred to earlier.
How can destruction of the Land Registry contribute to the defeat of terrorism?
How can doing a huge amount of damage to the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territory be other than an example of needless destruction?
It is not very sensible when most of the material contained in the Central Bureau of Statistics can be found freely on the internet.
It is difficult to see how those activities can be justified.
This is a point I have made before; it is a point that the Council of Ministers has also made, and it is a point which the Israeli authorities should address rather more intelligently and sympathetically than they have so far.
Question No 25 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0843/02):
Subject: Voice of Europe
In its answer to Question H-0234/02
The Commission fully shares the motives and objectives of the honourable Member, in particular in strengthening the pressure for a better respect for human rights by improving the availability of information.
Our differences are on two points: firstly the eligibility of this specific proposal in terms of the current funding policies and criteria, and secondly the cost of the proposal both in investment and running costs.
Projects of this nature are foreseen neither in the communication of May 2001 on the European Union's role in promoting human rights and democratisation in third countries, nor in the 2002-2004 programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
The programming document which governs the selection of projects sets out eligible themes for support, including freedom of expression for the independent media, which were then refined in the context of programming identification missions to 29 focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.
These refined themes, which effectively excluded the possibility of a project with a regional character, formed the basis of an international call for proposals launched in July 2002 with a deadline of 5 November.
It is nevertheless likely that, with future calls proposals, the criteria concerning the selection of projects under the general theme of strengthening democratisation, good governance and the rule of law will be modified to allow projects of a regional nature.
In this context it would be possible for an applicant to present a project concerning a 'Voice of Europe'.
However, this brings me to the problem of cost.
Any application would be admitted only provided it satisfied the general conditions of eligibility applicable under the published guidelines, including the condition that the grant is to fund specific project activities rather than general operating costs.
Whichever comparison is drawn, the cost of establishing a radio station would be high and it would probably require permanent annual core funding for which this budget line is an inappropriate instrument.
Achieving the same objectives by the use of the Internet might be a more appropriate way forward.
I should like first of all to emphasise my personal interest in this subject.
I am absolutely convinced that providing reliable information about world affairs in countries that are suffering from tyrannies, or where freedom of speech and freedom of the media is attenuated, is exceptionally important.
Referring to the country I know best, the work done by the BBC World Service has, over the years, been of enormous significance in the promotion of pluralism around the world.
I understand, however, the point made by the Member.
Radio Free Asia has a budget of about EUR 30 million per year.
If we were to take that as the model, we would be talking about committing 30 per cent of the budget for Chapter B7-7.
I suspect that the House would regard that as rather a large chunk of the available funds.
The Member asked whether establishing a broadcasting medium would be a good use of the funds if we were to have a larger budget and more money to spend on human rights.
I suspect that, if this were so, I would have to argue with the Court of Auditors and with Parliament.
The policy on democracy and human rights that we now faithfully follow precisely reflects reports by Parliament and the Court of Auditors.
It was warmly endorsed for its strategic thrust by both the Council and by the Parliament.
The Member concerned has powerful powers of persuasion.
His silver tongue might be able to convince Parliament to support this proposition and to change its view on strategic thrust.
He may, however, have more difficulty in persuading the Court of Auditors that we should support the core funding that would undoubtedly be necessary in order to establish such a broadcasting medium.
I believe it is more sensible to look at other options, including use of the Internet, while wholly concurring with what the Member said about the importance of trying to broadcast the truth to countries where, alas, the truth is obfuscated by darkness and tyranny.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while dealing with the 2003 Budget, the Committee on Budgets discussed Euro-News - the television channel that concentrates its coverage on European affairs - and did so in very great depth.
Do you believe that Euro-News might be a means of disseminating European values and discussions throughout the world?
EuroNews has promoted European values and ensured that more people around the world are able to follow what is happening in Europe, but whether the organisation is EuroNews or any other, when you start discussing a public subsidy, in my experience legislators and others ask searching questions about value for money and about alternatives for achieving the same objective.
Nobody should be immune from that sort of scrutiny where taxpayers' money is involved.
When I look back, I might well wish that European broadcasters had done more at an earlier stage to provide greater competition with CNN.
In the field of television news that would have been sensible, but nobody should underestimate the costs and nobody should argue today that it would be easy for Europe to rival the main American international broadcaster.
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 26 to 58 will be replied to in writing
The next item is the report (A5-0431/2002) by Mr Andria, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled 'Clearing and settlement in the European Union. Main policy issues and future challenges' [COM(2002) 257 - C5-0325/2002 - 2002/2169(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in financial markets, where the liquidity of the market is closely related to the confidence operators have in the reliability of securities payment and settlement systems, the inefficient operation of the latter can represent a source of risk for the markets themselves.
Reliable payment and settlement systems require a clear legal framework, rules and procedures to govern securities holding, transfers, lending and related payments, as well as the imposition of constraints on these securities.
Clearing and settlement, essential components of all securities transactions, are therefore fundamental to the smooth functioning of integrated financial markets.
In any case we should note that, despite the increased demand for foreign securities, not only does the EU's infrastructure for clearing and settlement for cross-border transactions remain fragmented to a high degree, but there is also an excessive and certainly not controlled incidence of costs at cross-border level.
In any case, in order to attain specific objectives, it is necessary to know what the operational situation in the sector is, in order to make the appropriate adjustments.
There are two main reference markets: the United States and Europe.
The USA has opted for the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which incorporates both clearing and settlement systems and is overseen by a single managerial body, whose proven efficiency has led to substantial cost reductions.
The European model with as many as 20 CSDs is fragmentary, benefiting from the fact that competition is only limited to securing new areas of influence.
There has never been a price war, as market liquidity is controlled by a single active player.
From an analysis of the existing framework and from the thorough research undertaken by the Giovannini Group, it is clear that there are a range of technical, legal and taxation barriers at the root of the high costs and inefficiency.
Removal of the technical barriers has to be our prime objective and can be considered easily attainable.
Standardising information technology languages and paper-based documentation does not, in fact, require a particular operational effort.
There would certainly be greater difficulties in harmonising legal and taxation rules.
We should aim to achieve the ambitious objective of creating a single securities code, which would constitute a real guarantee for operators; but it would certainly be difficult for Member States to reach agreement on this issue, for delicate and sensitive reasons linked to the differences between legislation governing property rights, company law and insolvency law.
Therefore, the creation of this code must be considered a long-term objective.
In the short term, an information statement should be drawn up which would provide market participants with a guide to the differences between the laws in the Member States.
With regard to taxation barriers, the difficulties do not stem only from the differences between systems but also from strong resistance to change and harmonisation by some Member States.
Starting with the need to reform the post-trading environment, with the aim of eliminating confusion between infrastructures and functions and destroying existing natural monopolistic positions, there must be an arrangement for core settlement services managed for legal purposes as a user-owned service governed by the rules of non-profit status.
This option would guarantee market integrity, ease of access to the service by users and effective supervision with regard to operational risks.
There could not be any distortions of competition, because this guarantee stems from the fact that the services user participates in managing the body.
Innovation and technical progress could also be attained since the arrangement in paragraph 11 of the report specifies that non-profit status comes after allowing for necessary investment needs.
Separation of core services and value-added services is considered vital.
The latter could, in any case, be performed by central depositaries but with separate structures, including from a logistical point of view, by means of shared or supervised companies.
The clearing and settlement service encompasses guarantee, margining, clearing, settlement and regulation activities.
A quick read through reveals that these are all public utility services.
The added-value services offered by banks or structures separate from depositaries are securities lending, collateral management, cash management, corporate actions, income management and taxation services: all purely commercial activities.
In conclusion, it is also vital to have strong cooperation between the States in order to ensure adequate supervision.
The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's timely and constructive response to its communication on clearing and settlement.
In particular I should like to thank the rapporteur for his important report.
The Commission will assess Parliament's response to its communication very carefully and will take into account the views expressed in that report.
The Commission shares the view expressed in the resolution that efficient clearing and settlement is vital for the proper and safe functioning of the European financial markets.
In fact, as is often said with reason, clearing and settlement is the plumbing system of the securities markets, without which nothing works.
The challenge that lies ahead for the Community institutions is to ensure - in cooperation with market participants, national regulatory authorities and national legislators - the elimination of all existing barriers to integration and lack of competition, which would make cross-border post-trade arrangements in the European Union inefficient.
That is essential for our common goal to build an integrated EU capital market by 2005.
The Commission feels that we should encourage market-led approaches and solutions wherever possible.
However, it is also true that major public policy concerns are at stake, such as the efficiency of the systems, costs, petition issues - namely open and non-discriminatory access and exclusivity agreements - interoperability of systems, and prudential and systemic safety.
All these concerns need to be taken into account, and the rapporteur referred to a number of them.
Now that the initial consultation period has been completed, we at the Commission are in the process of digesting the responses to that consultation document and of defining our approach to clearing and settlement arrangements.
The Commission now intends to issue a new communication which will set out clear policy orientations, something which, until now, we have not been able to do.
That document will serve as a basis for a second round of consultation, possibly in the first half of this year.
I look forward to having a further discussion with Parliament, hopefully with the same rapporteur, on that subject.
As in all future steps that we might want to take, we intend to proceed in close cooperation with the rapporteur, with Parliament and, in particular, with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Mr President, like Mr Bolkestein I would like to thank Mr Andria for his hard work on this most important of subjects.
I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur that it is very important to remove technical and other barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement in Europe.
The Commission and the European Union can play a constructive role in facilitating cross-border clearing and settlement as a vital part of creating a single market in financial services.
There are certain points upon which PPE-DE Group opinion is divided, in particular point 11.
It is not necessary to separate so-called core and value-added services, contrary to the view of the rapporteur.
It is vital to price these different services transparently, so that when people are purchasing they know exactly which service they are buying and which they are not.
It is also necessary to ensure that suitable risk management schemes are in place so that if there is a problem with one service there is no contagion between the so-called core services and value-added services.
A law which said that a financial institution could only create or provide a certain core service and was not allowed to diversify into others would be too big an intervention in the market.
I myself and many in the group therefore support a small amendment to Mr Andria's report on that point.
I have reservations about the proposal that we should move to a directive at this point.
We might well need to look at a directive in the future but it may be premature to decide now whether a directive is necessary.
There may be many other ways in which the European Union and the European Commission can facilitate cross-border clearing and settlement, without necessarily having to resort to a hard law solution.
Finally, the only other point of substance where I have a slightly different view from Mr Andria is the suggestion that we should prescribe that clearing and settlement systems are based on a 'not for profit' principle.
I appreciate that Mr Andria has moved on this and has compromised and added the facility for allowing the services to make proper investments, but we should not prescribe a non-profit status and compel the markets to adopt this model.
There are great merits in opting for user-owned systems.
These are very good ways to ensure that the clearing and settlement service provides an excellent service to its users, but I am not really sure that we should prescribe on that issue.
We certainly should not write in at this stage the requirement that these services must be managed on a 'not for profit' basis.
It is important to allow firms to innovate and to invest, and a certain amount of profit generation is necessary to allow that investment.
I welcome much of Mr Andria's report, with those three minor reservations.
In particular we should not prejudge the market at this stage.
We should allow and encourage the market to produce its own solutions, to produce market-led solutions, although I can see that there are merits in encouraging user-owned systems, because looking around the European Union we can see a number of systems which are working well on a user-owned basis.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Andria for his work, on behalf of my group.
This is a complex subject and Mr Andria used all the means available to him to reach a compromise.
Our group is highly satisfied with his working methods and the results he has achieved.
The report, as voted on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is very well-balanced.
We would like to add two minor amendments designed to clarify the text rather than change the content.
I shall not repeat the importance of our work in establishing an integrated financial market at European level.
Parliament has already examined some aspects of this market and imposed some of the extremely numerous common rules which will be necessary for it to function properly.
A single, transparent framework for clearing and settlement is part of these essential rules.
That is why, in parallel with our work on the directive on investment services, Parliament is asking the Commission for a draft directive on clearing and settlement.
In the absence of any form of regulation, the market players have organised themselves to create a system which, although it does function, is far from ideal.
Furthermore, this system naturally tends towards the establishment of a private monopoly and distortions of competition due to confusion between the differing functions of infrastructures and banks.
We cannot seriously accept this.
We could, of course, as some Members are proposing, allow the market to organise itself.
We could also shoulder our responsibilities as co-legislators and ask the Commission to lay down rules ensuring transparency and free competition.
Everyone here knows that the markets cannot achieve a healthy balance unless they are organised transparently and safely.
That is not currently the case, and that is what my group is asking for.
We support the rapporteur on three essential points.
First, the removal of all barriers to the creation of a single market for clearing and settlement.
These barriers, whether technical, fiscal or legal, obstruct the finalisation of individual cross-border transactions and must be removed.
Secondly, free, transparent competition.
We call for open, fair access to settlement infrastructures.
We believe these settlement infrastructures should be considered as a service of general interest.
That should not prejudice their private or public status, but allow them to be run as non-profit-making bodies and be accessible without discrimination to all users.
Lastly, we must put an end to the current state of confusion between commercial and non-commercial functions.
We cannot accept that some players, driven solely by the prospect of profit, expose the non-commercial functions to the risks inherent in banking.
This seems particularly relevant at a time when the United States are stepping up measures to protect their market.
That is why our group will support Mr Andria's request for clear separation of roles.
That way we will protect our markets and put an end to the dumping that is often concealed in the confusion.
The European Commission has asked us to speak on this matter.
If we are to fulfil our role as colegislator, it is not enough to present the Commission with a recommendation that is devoid of any content.
For this reason, our group will reject all the amendments that are nothing more than delaying tactics and will support the rapporteur in his clear, constructive positions.
We have tabled two amendments, whose principal aim is to clarify the text voted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which do not take anything away from the text.
We simply believe that the wording of the current paragraph 11 no longer corresponds to the state of market forces and would lead to excessive disruption if settlement services had to be the property of their users.
We have also taken the liberty of adding to the compromise adopted by all the groups on paragraph 12 our concern for transparency and the exercise of free competition.
I do not think that should pose a problem to my fellow Members.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Andria on his excellent work, first of all, and secondly on his political courage in this difficult matter.
From the start, in the action plan for the financial market, this matter of clearing and settlement did not receive the attention it deserved and we therefore now need to remedy this omission.
Post-market infrastructures do indeed play a fundamental part in the proper conclusion of transactions.
You spoke of trust and security.
Systemic risks are also inherent in this type of activity which therefore clearly fall within the scope of general interest.
On the other hand, these activities have an increasing return.
It is for these two reasons that, based on experience, a public interest regulation is vital.
We know, however, that these regulations exist at national level, as well as at European level, and fragmented infrastructures and rules predominated until recently.
That is why it is time to establish a legislative act in accordance with our objective of building the internal market.
We can see, however, that in the absence of appropriate legislation, the current development is biased and dangerous, as bodies are being formed which carry out both clearing and settlement activities and competing banking activities, with no general interest framework and apparently at risk of distorting competition.
The rapporteur is therefore quite right, for reasons of both content and experience, to choose a public service line, or, I should say, public utility line, the terms are not important - in the United States they talk about public utility, it amounts to the same thing.
Hence the proposals to separate non-profit-making activities from fee systems based on costs.
In conclusion, I shall say that now is the time to legislate.
I do not understand why we should consult again.
We have clear positions from the rapporteur which Parliament should adopt without sugaring the pill in order to achieve a positive line.
We believe that the Commission should now, for the sake of the credibility of all our work, prepare the draft directive.
It has recently become clear in Europe and in the USA how sensitively financial markets react to various developments.
Stability in the financial markets is continuously under fire, with all the repercussions that this has on consumer confidence in the economy.
Stability in the financial markets can be aided by effective management based on clear regulation.
Mr Andria's report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities therefore requires our full attention.
Given the complexity of the way securities are organised, there is no simple solution.
I would, however, like to emphasise that a solution must be transparent and controllable. That is in the interests of confidence in the financial markets.
An inquiry into competition aspects as described in paragraph 15 can contribute to creating a transparent securities market.
I believe that we can look back on the way in which this Parliament worked to eliminate obstacles to cross-border payments last year.
At that time too, all the organisations, rules and interests formed a complex whole.
Yet it turned out to be possible to eliminate virtually insurmountable obstacles.
It is therefore high time we made sure that where there is an internal securities market, the numerous settlement costs do not obstruct cross-border transactions in this market.
Mr President, Commissioner, clearing and settlement are an essential element in all securities market transactions.
The Commission communication on clearing and settlement in the European Union analyses the sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements.
This inefficiency is largely due to technical requirements, market practice and the fragmentation resulting from national differences and legal barriers.
It is also very important that the supervisory authorities adhere to a common approach and harmonised rules.
Firstly, the technical barriers should be broken down and there should be a move towards interoperability of systems.
Understandably, it is often the situation obtaining in the big Member States that serves as a basis for drafting single market directives and this sometimes seems to lead to the 'one size fits all' principle being applied.
The solution chosen in drafting an EU securities code would not necessarily represent Europe's single financial markets but the application of a national solution on a European scale.
This principle is very poorly suited to the stock markets, which will still be characterised by their own national features well into the future.
As I see it this is partly the situation dealt with by Generoso Andria in the report we are discussing today.
Items 11 and 12 explore the most desirable way of organising securities trading settlement services and the relationship between the central securities depositories and the custodian banks.
The message in these points, put in just a few words, is that core functions in settlement should be properly determined, and the central securities depositories and the settlement institutions should practise these with a view to making a profit and under the supervision of users, whereas those offering services must be kept separate from the others.
Unfortunately I cannot agree with Mr Andria's proposed solution on these two points.
There are considerably more differences between Member States in arrangements for securities trading clearing and settlement and custodian services than in securities trading on the stock exchange.
For example, in Germany securities are still kept in a physical form in vaults, whereas in Finland all securities have been converted into electronic recorded items, or book-entry securities.
Owing to national laws relating to limited companies, the status of the German shareholder differs essentially from that of the Finnish shareholder in company transactions, for example.
There is also a fundamental difference in the structure of central securities depositories in continental Europe on the one hand and the Nordic countries on the other, in that information on the investor in the Nordic central securities depositories is entered directly into the system and also, except in Denmark, directly into the issuer's register of shareholders.
In the systems in continental Europe custody is nominee registered, and the investor has no direct contact with the issuer.
The Commission has furthermore become conscious of these differences and is approaching the matter of clearing and settlement cautiously and from a functional point of view, which is a very good thing.
If a directive should be issued on this matter, the Commission's approach, which takes account of these differences in the markets, should be adhered to.
In my country, Finland, for example, Finnish issuers have, in their everyday activities, had a high opinion of value-added services based on registers of shareholders.
The giant Nokia, for example, considers them to be very important.
Items 11 and 12 in Mr Andria's report correspond very much with the views of banks in certain countries in relation to clearing and settlement structures, and in that respect they reflect partially outdated thinking.
Together with my colleague, Astrid Lulling, I have drafted two amendments, which are aimed at preserving the efficacy of the national markets and would make possible the existence of all structural systems and alternatives.
There is a saying in English: 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'
The rapporteur, Mr Andria, is trying to repair a situation here that works fine.
This being the case I would like to stress the importance of accepting these two amendments, and I also hope that my group will support them.
Mr President, my compliments to Mr Andria for this report on the Commission communication to Parliament and the Council dealing with policy issues and the future challenges of clearing and settlement in the European Union, the process through which transfer of ownership takes place in a securities market.
This communication builds on the Giovannini report of November 2001, which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union.
It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively, to ensure the stability of the financial system.
With the increased demand for foreign securities since the introduction of the euro, our infrastructure for clearing and settlement of cross-border transactions remains fragmented, resulting in much higher costs than with national transactions.
In this report we are presented with proposals to remove the barriers and distortions in the European Union post-trading environment, to create a level playing field between institutions, a common regulatory view and the development of rights of access and choice.
Pan-European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market, with market participants, regulators and competition authorities all playing a role.
We know the European Union has already accepted natural monopolies in certain service areas such as gas, electricity and air traffic control to ensure fair access to all users in the single market.
Now the same principle must be applied to post-trading infrastructure.
But - and I enter a very strong caveat here - it is very important for the effect of consolidation on competition and financial stability to safeguard prices in what will, de facto, be a less competitive arena.
In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse.
Proper safeguards will be needed.
The American model is obviously an attractive template.
It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement.
But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depositories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve.
While a lot more work is needed prior to any legislative initiative from the Commission - and I welcome Commissioner Bolkestein's offer of a second round of consultation - the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has laid out its stall, proposing separate core settlement services as a user-owned or public service, governed by the rules of non-profit status.
It wants a specific directive on clearing, on the one hand, and settlement on the other, laying down common rules on authorisations, supervision and a common framework amongst others.
An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-trading activity.
There is certainly a long and fraught road ahead, with different banking cultures and legal systems, but there can be no doubt about the bottom line: without provision for efficient cross-border clearing and settlement, the full benefit of an internal market for financial services cannot be realised.
Mr President, I cannot but wonder at the way in which several Members here present have been giving us the benefit of their views on this highly complex subject-matter without ever having taken part in the discussions on it, but I do want to say that, whether in agriculture or in politics, you must know that there is no point in putting the cart before the horse.
I find it regrettable that our rapporteur has largely disregarded this self-evident truth.
As regards clearing and settlement, we have reached the stage of consultation on the basis of a Commission communication, a stage at which it is premature to say the least to instruct the Commission, in precise terms, to submit a proposal for a directive, and to tell them what should be in it.
We are all in agreement with the Commission that it is right to make the cross-border clearing and settlement systems more efficient and to cut their costs.
It does not inevitably follow, though, that we need a European legislative instrument in order to do this.
What is first required is that the technical barriers within the EU be dismantled.
It is at least premature to predict today what form this might take, having had a not very satisfactory discussion in committee, when we could have done with more time in order to dispel various evident misconceptions.
We would, in my view, have done better to wait for the second Giovanni report, which is due to be with us in mid-February, rather than now attempting to commit this Parliament to a line that I regard - putting it bluntly - as nonsensical.
In this area, though, nonsense is a public menace.
My hair stands on end at the sight of the proposal that core settlement services should be handled by a service subject to the rules applicable to non-profit organisations.
Such a proposal simply ignores the fact that a single legal system is capable of being applied only if laws on securities and taxation have already been standardised.
I have been told by practitioners and specialists in these fields that there is at present no system capable of bringing together even only two jurisdictions, which means that such a system could not be made to work throughout the EU.
I am also astonished at the sweeping proposal for a non-profit system of this sort, even though it is far from being proven that such a model would be preferable to a system run on a profit-making basis.
There are enough examples to demonstrate the fact that the achievement of profit and reductions in cost are not mutually exclusive.
Indeed, if I understand him right, the Commissioner has, in this House, declared himself to be in favour of a market-based approach.
There are today many sectors in which a policy of moderate deregulation is being pursued and in which the market is being opened up.
To do the very opposite in a sector like clearing and settlement, which is so important to the nascent internal market in financial services, and to attempt to establish a public monopoly, is quite simply absurd and demonstrates a lack of awareness of the world's realities.
Healthy competition - which already exists - has always benefited the consumer.
Contrary to what the rapporteur would have us believe, that is not fragmentation; that is competition.
As adopted in committee, the report also envisages the provision of core settlement services by one structure, and of 'value added services' by another, separate structure.
This would result in the enforced breaking-up of a variety of enterprises and is contrary to the approach favoured not only by most market operators, but also by the European Central Bank.
Any operator in the market should be able to provide all these services, and any future European legislation should focus on the service itself and not on the body providing it.
In view of these considerations, Mrs Kauppi and I have tabled amendments, and I hope that Members will support them.
It is my especial hope - having heard the rapporteur's praises sung by the Socialist/Communist element in this House - that Mr Andria will take time to think things through again.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Andria, ladies and gentlemen, I knew why I had been moved down the list of speakers when I realised that I would have something to say in response to Mrs Lulling. Both in my personal capacity and as our group's co-ordinator, I repudiate any and every personal attack upon the rapporteur.
It is a matter of political good form that opposing views are to be accepted as such and that one engages with them without simply dismissing them as nonsense.
The report presented by Mr Andria has been passed, by a clear majority, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
It is not his report alone, but a report to plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and Members who have failed to win their case in committee are entitled to use the tabling of amendments as a means of keeping discussion going and making differences of opinion clear. This is all the more the case - and, in my view, right and proper - when we are engaged in an intermediate consultation, that is to say in the midst of the opinion-forming process.
Many interventions, as well as what has been said here today, show us that opinions have not yet taken their final form - it is not that the report is not good enough, but that the subject-matter is too important.
The creation of an integrated financial market is not alone in still facing too many obstacles, hindrances and barriers, and the costs involved are still excessive.
Historically speaking, we know that the settlement systems within the European Union have developed along different lines.
This means that integration is something to be advocated if we really want an integrated financial market, but I would not venture to say today whether vertical or horizontal integration is to be preferred, in other words, whether the amalgamation of different settlement systems is in itself something to be favoured or repudiated, or, indeed, whether it is inimical to competition.
Yes, we have excessive costs.
Reference has been made to reports that make it clear that barriers are among the causes of this.
A study carried out jointly by the German stock exchange and Clearstream has clearly shown that overall transaction costs resulting from barriers amount to some EUR 4.3 billion.
We all want a level playing field.
We all want improved access, and many of us believe that the structures of power mean that regulatory intervention is contrary to functional approaches to regulation.
Criticism of the report has focussed on two aspects; one being the idea of a government body for 'core' settlement services, and hence of restricting the services of international central securities depositories to 'core' settlement services, and the other the idea of non-profit status, many being of the opinion that this would preclude competition.
There is, moreover, the desire that all these services should be able to be performed by both banks and central securities depositories.
Hence the amendments, and we hope that the debate has also demonstrated to the Commission the need for the various standpoints to be reconsidered.
We await a proposal for a directive, which will make it possible to move this debate on to a more concrete phase.
Thank you very much, Mr Karas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0452/2002) by Mr Mantovani, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions on the future of health care and care for the elderly: guaranteeing accessibility, quality and financial viability [COM(2001) 723 - C5-0163/2002 - 2002/2071(COS)].
- (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are addressing a subject of considerable importance for all European citizens.
We are discussing health and the elderly, and I would say that the health systems of all the European Union Member States are experiencing, albeit to varying degrees, similar situations.
In fact, they are already, at this juncture, faced with the fundamental challenge of how, in particular, to control and cover the costs of health care.
The ageing of the population, developments in medical technology and rising demand for health care services have led to a significant increase in the costs of health care across the board, which, at times, cannot be sustained by current economies, and in the costs of care for the elderly throughout Europe.
Here are some examples: in the European Union, the proportion of the population over the age of 65 will rise from 16.1% in 2000 to 22% in 2025 and 27% in 2050, that is a third of the population.
At the same time people over the age of 80, who made up 3.6% of the population in 2000 are likely to make up 6% in 2025 and 10% in 2050.
Although the provision of health care and care for the elderly remains essentially the responsibility of the Member States, we realise that this trend, owing to the significant and complex implications, cannot find an effective response at exclusively national level.
These problems must be included in the context of broader European cooperation so that we can achieve successful results, as set out by the principles and goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health and the specific objectives established by the United Nations Plan of Action.
In order to meet these objectives, the cooperation of all health care professionals is required. There needs to be greater cooperation in the exchange of information and best practice, research, the establishment of a data bank covering the social and health care sector containing statistical analyses and projections, and the definition of common qualitative and quantitative standards, which will establish health indicators and formulate common standards to monitor the health services.
In March 2002, the Barcelona European Council also stressed the need to launch and develop cooperation between Member States in this sector, through exchanges of best practice and information and discussion of the common challenges facing them at European level.
The European Union has already affirmed on various occasions the need to draw up a global strategy covering the economic, employment and social implications of an ageing population, by harnessing the full potential of people of all ages and strengthening solidarity between generations.
The safeguarding and further improvement of high quality social protection and health care provision in the Member States, based on the principle of solidarity and accessibility to healthcare for all concerned, will be necessary in order to fully attain the goals of financial viability, accessibility and quality.
All this should, in the future, also lead to the creation of an internal market in health services and products: an internal market not treated in the same way as a commercial product and subject to its rules, but a product subject to the rules on quality and accessibility for all, and I am saying this in particular for Mrs JÃ¶ns, who has contributed a great deal and whom I would like to thank for her work on this report.
Another key aspect to take into account is the risk of overemphasising the importance of the goal of financial viability at the expense of accessibility and quality.
Solutions should be defined at the earliest opportunity: there need to be awareness-raising and information campaigns, specific analyses and research, programmes to fund training projects and refresher courses for medical, nursing and care staff, as Mr Mussa also suggested.
Lastly, more attention needs to be paid to certain aspects of developing health care and social services for the elderly, especially for those who are not self-sufficient, who constitute the main, most important problem, such as the treatment of mental illnesses affecting the elderly, preserving peoples' autonomy, integration, access to rehabilitation and readjustment services, prevention, assistance and support for families caring for elderly people and combating maltreatment and neglect.
Yesterday, the Commission sounded the umpteenth alarm, seeking to make us the most competitive economy in the world by 2010: precisely what was determined in Lisbon three years ago, owing to slow growth.
Well, the thorny question of ageing of the population is important in this context.
Therefore, in the hope that we shall soon see the European Parliament participating more actively in drawing up the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and health policy guidelines, I would call on the Commission and the Council to take into consideration the decisions contained in this report when preparing the joint synthesis report for the Spring 2003 European Council, and also the European Convention, which should include a high level of health protection as a general goal.
I believe that having a 'Social Europe' is the only way that we will move from being a Europe of banks and money to a Europe of people and peoples.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mr Mantovani and the honourable Members for their report.
The Commission will be taking account of the proposals and recommendations made in it.
The fact that the report is in favour of Community cooperation to improve health care in the European Union is very important.
The information provided by Mr Mantovani, which illustrates that the viability of social systems, especially care services for the elderly, has deteriorated dramatically and that we really do need cooperation at Community level, is equally important.
The ageing population, the increasingly technological nature of services for the elderly, the special programme needed and the increase in the prosperity index are creating huge problems which need to be addressed.
As you know, the Barcelona European Council called on the Commission and the Member States to work together in this sector.
The Commission presented its first communication in December 2001 and this parliamentary report is in response to it.
A series of questionnaires was sent to the Member States in the autumn.
They have now been returned and the Commission is working on a new report which will be presented to the Employment Council and then to the European Council in 2003.
I should like to point out that this whole procedure centres around social protection rather than care issues.
Our aim is to make sure that citizens, especially elderly citizens, have access to a high standard of affordable care and long-term care services, which is what the elderly generally require, and to address the question of cost, which often exceeds the financial resources of both the patients and their families.
Another important objective is the economic viability of care services faced with an ageing population which, as I said earlier, is one of the main causes of the crises in a number of Member States and will be one of the main causes of future crises in others.
This entire process forms part of a coordinated strategy to modernise social protection systems.
The Commission proposed this strategy in 1999 as part of the social agenda under the Lisbon strategy.
Of course, this report will influence our work throughout 2003 and I think that both Parliament and the Commission will be formulating the same urgent request to the Member States to cooperate and teach each other so that three basic objectives can be achieved: access to these systems for the elderly, the provision of quality services and economic viability.
We are working constantly on the comparability of the data and indices needed to facilitate cooperation between the Member States.
The Commission will issue a new communication on measures which need to be taken during the current year on the basis of this experience and the work I referred to earlier.
Obviously, the entire procedure comes under the Community strategy on public health and the Community action programme which has finally been approved and to which Mr Berend referred.
Mr Mantovani's report also examines a whole series of other issues relating to public health and the free movement of people and services on the internal market.
These are important issues which we shall continue to work on, using appropriate political tools and bearing in mind that they need to be complementary and cohesive.
I should like to finish with the candidate countries.
Last year, my services started a series of studies into the social protection systems in the 13 candidate countries and they are currently examining health care systems.
The conclusions of these studies, which were discussed in Brussels on 5 and 6 December, will be available to you shortly.
Mr President, as has already been said, this is one of the major issues facing the European Union.
As the elderly population increases, we need to work out ways of coping with it and to find a strategy across the European Union which really works.
But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States.
Our challenge is to ensure that Member States carry on with their own provision, but with coordination and cooperation and the sharing of best practice throughout the European Union.
We must also be aware that not all elderly people fall into the same category.
Elderly people should be encouraged to remain active because otherwise, as previous speakers have said, this will ultimately cost more money than we are able to afford at the moment.
So we need to find a sustainable way of keeping people active and healthy for as long as possible.
I welcome Mr Mantovani's report and the Commission communication.
We must ensure that, sooner rather than later, there is real dialogue between Member States and an exchange of best practice, so that we can put the strategies into effect and make this a reality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my compliments to Mr Mario Mantovani, who has carried out the onerous task of determining the difficult challenges which health care systems and public health polices in European Union countries will have to face, in view of the ageing of the population, and, not least, in view of enlargement.
Although the provision of health care in general and care for the elderly in particular is essentially the responsibility of the Member States, it is right that we look to broader European cooperation in order to face these problems, given the extremely difficult situation which countries continue to experience.
One of the difficulties is the nursing shortage: in fact, an ever-increasing number of nurses will be needed.
The increased life expectancy of the European population, with a growing adult proportion, will create the difficult question of the staff who must care for them, staff who must, moreover, be increasingly qualified owing to the specific nature of the diseases which affect the elderly.
Employment of nursing staff has already increased by more than twice the average in the last five years: a level of employment which, however, is still not enough to meet the demand.
Secondly, it is easy to foresee that this shortage will be felt particularly keenly when, thanks to enlargement, there will be increased mobility of patients from the CEEC, whose health systems provide less than those in the Community, because they will automatically turn to cross-border health services.
From this point of view, an issue comes to the fore: ensuring a high level of human health protection, as set out in Article 152 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and as specified by the goals of the Community action programme in the field of public health, which, moreover, calls for universal and equal access to health services, the constant improvement of these services and promotion of the social inclusion of people with disabilities and people in the most vulnerable categories.
Qualitative principles in the field of health care can be put into effect through the creation of specialised higher training for nurses, financed by European training funds, which encourage people to obtain further professional qualifications in important areas such as oncology, transplants, heart surgery and all the age-related diseases.
With the launch of this higher training, we will ensure access to health services for European citizens, the provision of high-quality care and financially sustainable care systems, which is included in the three objectives proposed by the Barcelona European Council.
In order to ensure care for all, however, the European Union Member States need to take steps to raise young people's awareness of paramedical professions.
The solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the Member States.
It is all well and good to raise awareness of the profession among young people of the Member States but, up to now, this has been on too small a scale, so much so that there are far fewer qualified nurses than the countries need.
This opportunity should therefore also be extended to CEEC qualifications, in order to resolve a twofold problem quickly: to respond to the nursing crisis in the Member States and to respond to the situation of countless immigrants seeking work in Europe.
What I am about to say may sound like a provocation, but I cannot avoid talking to you about another serious problem which concerns citizens from every European country, that is the 500 000 job cuts in the engineering industry over the next four or five years, a figure I have been given by an international trade union source.
This employment problem could be resolved in part though the transfer of qualified resources from one sector to another.
The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing.
I would close by calling on everyone to reflect on what has been said regarding the need to remedy as soon as possible the nursing shortage in the European Union, the need to meet the quality criteria for care specified in the Community action programme by providing higher training, and the need to respond to the specific employment needs of the citizens of the Member States with solutions such as mobility and retraining, looking, where these prove inadequate, to human resources from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Mantovani on the quality of his report, which I believe is serious and well-balanced.
I have heard it said on occasions that we cannot give our opinion on numbers and therefore we are saying nothing new when we say that world demographic tendencies reveal a gradual ageing of the population.
The rapporteur has already mentioned the percentage of the European population over the age of 65, 16 %, an estimated 22 % and 27.5 % for 2025 and 2050, and that the number of people over 80 is going to increase as well, from 3.6% in 2000 to 6% in 2025 and to 10% in 2050.
In view of these statistics it is no good to bury our heads in the sand like an ostrich and wait to see what happens and nor must we be alarmist.
The demographic situation is obviously a success for society, which can be attributed to medical care and an improvement in living conditions in general.
Elderly people do not make up an homogenous group and their needs therefore also vary.
Policies relating to the elderly must focus on the double perspective of their needs and the care they require - and which they have a right to - in order to meet those needs, and of their potential and the services they lend to society.
No society - including European society - can afford not to take advantage of the contributions elderly people can make in terms of their experience, training and knowledge.
As well as Article 152 of the Treaty, these policies comply with Article 21 of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, by prohibiting all discrimination - in this case on grounds of age - and Article 25, stating that the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life.
These principles would be deprived of content if they were not accompanied by policies to turn them into realities.
In this regard, the Barcelona Council of March 2002 pointed out the need to initiate and develop cooperation between the Member States on these issues during 2002 and 2003, the need for an exchange of good practices and information and the need to hold a debate on the common challenges at European level.
Healthcare systems must face a triple challenge.
Firstly, access to care for all, with the special characteristics of care for the elderly; secondly, a high degree of quality and, thirdly, the financial sustainability of the systems.
I believe these are three necessary, minimal and laudable objectives, and I would like to draw attention to the close link between them.
Whatever the system of funding, taxation or contributions, their achievement can and must be promoted also through the promotion of healthier lifestyles, prevention measures and increasing awareness on the part of service providers and users on the correct application of therapies and medications.
This will allow a balance between the three objectives.
The risk of prioritising the objective of financial sustainability could undermine those of quality and accessibility, but also, without sustainability, quality and accessibility would only be possible in the short term.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending my very warm thanks to Mr Mantovani for his excellent cooperation.
I think we have succeeded in securing a broad majority in tomorrow's plenary for this most important report.
It is also timely that we should at last achieve closer cooperation in health policy and, of course, also in care for the elderly, something to which the Gothenburg Summit, albeit very late in the day, pointed the way.
Let us just be honest.
In matters of health policy, the EU is still catching up with reality.
In many fields, after all, a European health policy already exists - the Euregios spring to mind.
Even now, to take an example, patients in the German Rhineland have the right to use their German health insurance cards to obtain treatment in health centres in the Netherlands.
Apart from that, Europe has hospitals generally recognised as specialising in specific diseases, and there are also European networks that draw up guidelines for the treatment of those diseases.
All the Member States are looking for strategies to guarantee that their health care systems will, in future, remain accessible to all and to secure their standards of quality and performance, as well as ensuring that it is possible to finance them.
New mechanisms are constantly being tried out, but, as yet, nobody has made the great breakthrough.
So, when governments realise the importance of organising an EU-wide exchange of experience on matters concerning health care and the care of the elderly, they are simply being logically consistent.
Just to take the wind out of the sceptics' sails, let me say that I am convinced that nobody in this House actively wants a single European system of health care.
The Commission does not, and the Council very definitely does not.
The organisation and funding of health care systems is a matter decided at the national level and should remain so in future.
It is far more a case of how we are to retain, in the long term, our European model of a health care policy based on solidarity.
I am speaking quite deliberately in terms of a European model, as the following four principles underlie all health care systems.
The first is that health is not, and must not be allowed to become, a purely economic commodity.
The second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one.
The third is that, as has already been said, all systems of health care are based upon the principle of solidarity.
And the fourth is that the State has a crucial role to play in regulating, funding and providing services.
Now, the Mantovani report makes quite practical proposals as to what enhanced European cooperation in health care policy might be like.
These proposals have to do with methodology, objectives and specific content.
As regards the working method, the report proposes that the open method of coordination should now be brought into play in this area as it has been elsewhere, which is consonant - I am very glad to say - with what the Greek Presidency has said.
Now, though, we must not lose any more time, and it is for that reason that the report urges the forthcoming European spring summit to resolve upon a precise timetable for further action and to agree on common targets and indicators within one year.
If, though, we are to be able to carry out any kind of exchange of experience, we have to start by improving the national and European systems of health monitoring.
Comparable data are absolutely indispensable here, but to date the EU has not even had a standard measurement of mortality rates.
This is where we can even now make progress by using the new action programme on health care policy.
The same is true of the establishment of common criteria for patients' rights, and, in view of eastward enlargement in particular, there is a need for a survey of patient mobility in the Euregios, for we know all too well that the shortfall in health care provision is especially pronounced in the regions bordering on the new Member States, and any European constitution must not only stipulate a high standard of health care as an objective, but also health policy's continuing status as a responsibility shared between the EU and the Member States.
We do all, after all, want the EU to be able to keep on, in future, using legislation to supplement the Member States' policies.
Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mantovani for the work he has done on this report.
I say that, even though there are features of the report in its final form with which my group disagrees.
I should like to thank the Commission for the survey it has given us of future care for the elderly, for I do believe that the Commission communication is genuinely constructive.
It indicates a number of overriding goals in terms of access, quality and financial sustainability.
It also points out that, even though we know that there will be many more elderly people in the future, it is quite uncertain what that will actually mean in the form of future financial burdens.
Over and above this, it points out that, in many areas, the EU has opportunities to make joint contributions under the current rules.
That is true in relation to public health policy, on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty, to economic policy and to the development of the internal market.
We therefore have a host of opportunities for cooperating under the existing rules.
My group must therefore also reject Parliament's present proposal, as put forward in the report, that we should introduce outright open coordination when it comes to health policy and policy in relation to the elderly.
We have tabled a number of amendments, and if, as I really believe will be the case, it is not possible for these to be supported by Parliament, we shall find it difficult to support the report as a whole.
The open coordination method has, of course, become very popular in recent years and is used in a great many areas of economic policy, such as pensions, social exclusion within education and the convergence criteria in employment policy. It is a good form of cooperation in which a number of common objectives are set that can be achieved in different ways.
I am a great believer in using open coordination because it is a way of achieving common objectives without needing to legislate in a lot of new areas, but I think it important that open coordination be binding.
In some areas, open coordination is directly authorised by the treaties.
That applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy.
In other areas, there is a less obvious basis in the treaties, or else there is really no basis.
