As to the draft mandate for the IGC, it may be very precise but it is not necessarily right.
We believe very strongly that, whatever form this constitution is shown to be in, there ought to be a referendum, certainly in the United Kingdom.
And indeed we believe that the promise made by our outgoing - now former - Prime Minister, Mr Blair, to give the British people a referendum on this issue should be followed and taken on board by his successor, Gordon Brown.
We have other serious concerns.
There are serious concerns about our continuing commitment to free competition, about the legal position of the so-called British opt-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and about the collapse of the third pillar, but I look forward to a positive debate during the IGC on these matters.
Finally, I want to refer to the resolution on the IGC today, which calls for the issue of Parliament's two seats to be included in the mandate.
I believe this is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that Europe is listening to the people.
The continuing vast expense of shuffling between Brussels and Strasbourg undermines the standing of our Parliament and the matter must be resolved soon.
(PT) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I support the programme of the Portuguese Presidency because, Mr President, if there is one thing worse than standing still, it is to go backwards.
(ES) We are currently undergoing a process of political realism.
We are not entirely pleased with the mandate, but we feel that it shows political realism.
We in the European Parliament, and many citizens - the majority of them - wanted the Constitutional Treaty, but we accepted the idea of seeking a solution through a mandate that is very clear, but I do not believe there has ever been a mandate with so many footnotes.
We must not forget that.
We are all aware of the skill that legal experts have when it comes to resolving problems.
Certain issues are striking.
For example, we are meeting here under the European flag.
What are we going to do, Mr President.
Are we going to take the flag down or is this meeting going to be considered illegal?
This is an important point and there is something rather humiliating about it.
There is another significant problem, and that is how we are going to explain this to the citizens.
We are going to have Treaties 1 500 pages long, like telephone directories.
In other words, we must find a way to explain the things we are doing and in doing so we must defend the progress, the legal personality, the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision, the advances in foreign policy ...
We must explain all of this, but it is not going to be at all easy and - since the devil is in the detail - we must study the way the mandate is drawn up very carefully.
I believe that the European Parliament and the national Parliaments and civil society are going to be watching closely.
Having said that, Mr President, I want to see a Lisbon Treaty emerge from the Portuguese Presidency.
I want it to be a Treaty of reform and not of counter-reform.
(PL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have carefully listened to your speech today and carefully read the speech you made at the Assembly of the Republic in Lisbon.
I see that you have set out a wide-ranging programme for the Portuguese presidency and I wish you every success.
I would, however, like to give my personal interpretation of your programme, and ask three fundamental questions.
The first and most obvious one is the new constitutional treaty.
The German presidency made some progress and managed to put together a difficult compromise.
Each Member State may now feel that it has lost something in the negotiating process - that is the nature of compromise.
But Europe has gained the chance to strengthen its unity.
The mandate, which was unanimously approved, must be implemented, and no country, including my own, should be allowed to back away from its undertakings.
The Portuguese presidency now has the difficult task of creating the consensus required to get the treaty approved.
I would also appeal, as BarÃ³n Crespo has done, to try and put it in a form that would make it as clear as possible to the ordinary European citizen.
The second point is establishing a policy of European solidarity, such as the common European energy policy, which will prove that Europe has profoundly and irreversibly united since the historic year of 1989.
Another example of solidarity policy is the historic idea of free movement of people within the European Union, meaning the full opening of the Schengen area to new Member States.
Only a Europe without internal borders can be a truly united community.
And the third task is fulfilling Europe's undertakings towards the rest of the world.
Portugal has pointed out the significance of Brazil, which has traditional ties with Europe as well as a vast development potential.
However, the presidency's programme has also ensured renewed dialogue with Africa.
This is an extremely important task, arising as it does from Europe's historical responsibility towards the continent with its unexploited natural resources, but which is currently racked by poverty, disease and ethnic violence.
These are the challenges of our times, which can and must galvanise the process of European integration.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency does well to devote itself to the dialogue with Africa, in which what is perhaps needed more is the presence, for instance, of an army of small and medium-sized European businesses, to give birth to and shape a healthy economy in those regions, rather than an invasion of Chinese or multinationals that are not always inspired by humanitarian aims.
It is equally crucial, however, to exclude from that Summit a leader such as Mr Mugabe, whom Europe should condemn not only for his initiatives and anti-humanitarian acts but also for his anti-white and anti-European racism, since racism should be condemned everywhere, not just in some places.
We are worried, though, by the attitude of Mr Manuel Lobo Antunes towards an extremely swift opening up with regard to the Turkey issue: it is not absolutely necessary to step up the pace, for many reasons, the main one being that there is still a risk of admitting to Europe a country in which sharia law is in force.
These are very worrying questions, and include geopolitical issues: for example, Mr President, we do not want Europe to end up bordering Iraq, Iran and other countries of that type.
(CS) Mr President, the Portuguese presidency wishes to bring the European Treaty to completion and at the same time to address the challenges of global competition.
I must point out that these are entirely incompatible and contradictory processes.
It is clear from the new text that the Treaty seeks to preserve excessively costly and inefficient social systems.
It is also clear from the text that the leaders of the EU Member States believe in a Bolshevist fantasy of stable prices and full employment.
More to the point, the Union has again distanced itself somewhat from its founding principle of free economic competition without barriers, which has simply been expunged from the new Treaty.
Mr President, I must again point out that the rejection of free economic competition as the driving force of the European economy constitutes a serious warning for all democratically aware citizens.
It is only a small step from trampling down freedoms in the area of business to trampling down fundamental human rights and freedoms.
The main thrust of democratic politicians should now be to incorporate free economic competition back into the Treaty with immediate effect.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me make a few comments.
Only a few, because I agree with what both the Commission President and the President-in-Office of the Council have said regarding the Intergovernmental Conference.
The Intergovernmental Conference is tasked with doing as little as possible.
Its role is to keep to the IGC mandate, not to develop new ideas.
I can think of many things that should also be included in a Treaty of this type.
I know that some elements that were in the Constitution are missing, but this is a historical moment in which what has been agreed has to be transformed into a legally-binding document.
For this reason, we feel that we should support the Presidency in their clear commitment to the mandate in order to get the job done as soon as possible.
Whilst I think that symbols and many other elements - particularly transparency - have been lost, since the Convention, which also had input from national parliamentary representatives, we have had more democracy and greater efficiency.
Efficiency has been improved through more majority voting, through the rules on foreign and security policy and a few other areas.
There is still room for improvement, but this is better than the current situation.
Wherever majority voting applies, the European Parliament has the power of codecision.
If this Treaty becomes reality, the European Parliament will have equal powers of codecision in 90-95% of cases.
Some things have been forgotten: in future, the European Council, on the basis of a qualified majority, will propose a candidate for election as Commission President to the European Parliament in the light of the results of the European election and after consultations with the European Parliament.
This will increase citizens' rights, because, through the Parliament, citizens will have a direct line to the Commission thereby generating considerable legitimacy.
This marks a significant step forward, and ties in with the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
If we speak out for certain values worldwide, we also have to apply those values ourselves and make them legally binding.
This is why a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights is so vital for citizens' rights.
The only ones who have been cheated are the British citizens.
(DE) Mr President, occasionally one hears that this Intergovernmental Conference will just be dealing with the technicalities of the Treaty.
That is not true!
You, President-in-Office, have shown that the political significance of the Intergovernmental Conference is that it will keep to the whole mandate and nothing but the mandate.
The political significance lies in the clear determination to conclude the negotiations in October, and in seeking to convince all 27 Member States that this is the right way forward for Europe at this historic moment.
I have no doubt that you will succeed, given the clarity of your programme and your firm political will.
The chairman of my group has said that you just need to get the ball in the net from the penalty spot.
Martin, let us not forget, this is not a penalty shootout, but a penalty awarded mid-game!
The game will continue.
There is still the whole second half, or the ratification process.
Past experience has shown that a few problems may yet emerge.
So I feel it would be good, President-in-Office, if you were to seek to convince your colleagues in the Council informally of the need for speedy ratification within the next twelve months.
It would be good if the Netherlands and France, who voted 'no', could be the first to ratify.
It would also be good, President-in-Office, if you could persuade the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, not to bring up the rear in the ratification process, but rather to lead the way.
That would send a clear message to the whole of Europe.
(MT) Thank you, Mr President.
Last week I had the opportunity to visit one of the four detention centres in Malta in the company of the Chairman of our group, Mr Daul.
Currently, these detention centres are together providing shelter to more than 1 400 people, all of whom are immigrants who took great risks to cross the Mediterranean.
In fact these people were saved from drowning by our Maltese maritime patrol team.
I talked with one of the immigrants from Nigeria, supposedly a country with abundant natural resources.
With tears in his eyes, this young 17 year-old kept insisting that he wanted to go to Europe.
However, he claimed that even being held in detention was better than having to return to Nigeria.
This illustrates the fact that our policy designed to promote development in the African continent has so far failed.
It is this policy that can, in the long term, lead to a reduction in the influx of immigrants to Europe.
However, this policy must also go hand in hand with other policies that require urgent and immediate attention if we are to step up the fight against illegal immigration, and, in particular, against the network of organised crime that is behind it and that is exploiting the misfortune of these people.
We saw some of the boats used by immigrants to cross the Mediterranean.
They are all the same size, have the same type of engine and are in a shocking and disgraceful state.
They generally accommodate around 30 people, which is enough for these vessels to start taking in amounts of water large enough to sink them at the first sign of wind or sea swell.
It is little wonder that, before departing from Libya, the immigrants are informed that their journey will take them to either Italy or Malta or lead to death by drowning.
Each person pays $1 000 for the crossing - a total of $30 000, almost all of which is profit.
Who knows, maybe this money is going towards the financing of terrorism.
Thank you.
(FR) Mr President, Mr SÃ³crates, I welcome the fact that justice and internal affairs constitute one of the priorities of your Presidency.
We do in fact share an overall and common view of immigration.
True, we need to implement a genuine policy of cooperation with the countries of origin, which must be based on respect for fundamental rights, but it is also crucial that we open up legal immigration channels at European level, and we await a constructive debate with the Presidency on the definition of the common rights of non-EU nationals working legally in Europe.
It goes without saying that the statements of good intentions made by the European Councils on the subject of European solidarity in terms of border management and migratory flows must be followed up with concrete measures.
That is why the Council must, as a matter of urgency, look into the necessary revision - and I would emphasise this point - of the Dublin II regulation.
Furthermore, we are relying on the Portuguese Presidency to encourage the Council to reach an agreement on the 'return' Directive that respects the right of asylum and the principle of non-refoulement.
(Applause)
(PT) Mr President, the European Presidency that began a few days ago is facing challenges that call for negotiating ability, political will and strategic vision.
Firstly, there is the institutional issue.
Now that the Intergovernmental Conference mandate - a precise one, as requested - has been adopted, we hope it will be possible for the Portuguese Government to negotiate a reform of the Treaties with the scope required to overcome the institutional deadlock.
Among other amendments that stand out, the European Union is no longer rotating presidencies, such as yours, and one Commissioner per Member State.
Once these national elements have been eliminated, in the name of efficiency, the greatest responsibility is to reduce the distance that has been created between citizens and the EU, and the best way of doing that is to build a Europe that produces results when it comes to its citizens' concerns, such as the economy and employment.
In this regard, we have recently been talking about 'flexicurity'.
We believe that, without employment, there is no social model to support and that employment is protected by means of nimble, competitive firms that are constantly adjusting to the market.
Making the employment system more flexible is not the only answer, nor is it the only way to achieve the economic sustainability that we advocate.
Europe will be successful if we have the political will to invest in the areas in which it has particular potential and, at the same time, in research, innovation and long-term vision.
One such area is the new European Maritime Strategy to which the European Parliament will make a major contribution in today's vote.
When it comes to the exploitation of resources, transport, trade, the environment, scientific research, in the section on protection against environmental disasters, and also against illegal practices and crime, what are needed are fresh, global responses.
We expect the Portuguese Presidency to give that strategy a decisive boost at the appropriate moment.
On that subject, I would like to say one final thing.
Concerns such as peace, security, the fight against terrorism, economic development in our neighbouring countries, the prevention of illegal immigration and energy supplies are all issues that will benefit from an approach that creates allies and includes partners in the South.
There is, moreover, an increasing need for a new partnership for the Mediterranean and the Portuguese Presidency is in a good position to promote a revival of that strategic dialogue for the European Union.
Prime Minister, we wish you good luck and the greatest success in the next six months.
We know that if it goes well for you, it will certainly go well for Europe.
Mr President, I wish to begin with an urgent matter.
I have just received the news that in Libya the death penalty has just been confirmed on the Bulgarian nurses.
I should like to make a direct appeal to Mr SÃ³crates to act on behalf of the European Union to ensure that there is a kind of grace or there is direct contact with Mr Gaddafi that this verdict should not be implemented.
(Applause)
We are very shocked that the courts in Libya have reconfirmed the death penalties for Europeans, who should be freed and allowed to go to their homes in Bulgaria.
Prime Minister, I urge you to do whatever you can to make clear to the Libyan authorities the view of the European Parliament and the European Union in general.
I should like to hear your views on foreign issues: how you see further developments in relations with Russia; the preparation of a partnership and cooperation agreement; what steps you will be able to take to ensure that, in this second half of 2007, we will be able to develop a mandate to restart and start negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement.
It is very important to have these talks with the Russians on more transparent energy relations, on the problems in our shared neighbourhood, but also to be able to restart the human rights dialogue, the democracy debate between Russia and the European Union, but also to be able to further develop our multilateral agenda, whether it concerns Iran, the future of the United Nations system, Kyoto and so on.
Secondly, I should like to hear your comments on how you see the further developments concerning Kosovo, which is also related to our relations with Russia.
We are pleased that there is now a period of three or four months that will allow for further talks, especially with the new government, which we support very much, given the important role of the democratic party in that government.
What can you do to ensure that, in the end, there is a result that is acceptable - maybe not completely acceptable, but more acceptable - to Serbia, and which will have the support of Russia in the Security Council and will also keep the European Union united?
Mr Ahtisaari's proposals should be a basis, but we should also have a situation in which there is a UN resolution as a basis for the operation of European Union in the future.
We expect that Kosovo will define its status in the end.
(Applause)
Thank you, Jan Marinus Wiersma.
With your consent, I will comment on the question of nurses later, once the plenary is full and before the vote.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we have been given our homework, and plan to send the right messages to Africa and Latin America.
The Intergovernmental Conference needs to discuss the technical details and implementing the substance of the Treaty and the decisions made at the summit, not to negotiate a new Treaty.
Today you will have noticed that the problem is not the European Parliament, not the Commission, and not Europe's citizens.
The only problem you may encounter is the vanity of some Heads of State or Government and Member States in the Council.
So I say to you: make sure that under your Presidency everyone keeps to what has been agreed, that everyone keeps their promises, that they make good on their financial commitments - I am thinking of Frontex - and that they take responsibility for doing at home what they promised at the European level: that they implement real projects and respect the rules, rather than presenting clever interpretations - particularly France.
If you ensure that what has been agreed becomes reality, you will generate new momentum in the European Union and have fewer problems.
- (PL) Mr President, each EU presidency brings with it new challenges, new aims, and new opportunities, but also new potential mistakes and setbacks.
I carefully read the interviews the Portuguese premier gave to the press on the European Union's eastern policy, and what I read worried me deeply.
You said, and I quote, '...when negotiating with Russia we should not just emphasise our differences, but also our similarities...'.
This is a surprising statement which may be interpreted as heralding a change in tone of the EU's eastern policy to a very acquiescent, and, I am not afraid to say it, appeasing tone.
The European Union must continue to steer the course of the German presidency, which is one of solidarity and unity.
Only solidarity will allow us to act effectively in our relations with Russia.
Any lack of consistency will only be interpreted as weakness by our eastern partner.
There are many issues that need to be addressed: the unresolved dispute about Polish food exports to Russia, and the need to conduct a policy of energy solidarity to prevent Moscow from putting pressure on individual Member States.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by thanking you for all your comments in this debate, and your criticisms of my speech and of the Presidency's plans.
I would like everyone to know that those comments and criticisms are very helpful to me in the tasks I have to perform as President of the Council.
I think it is also fair to say that, from what I have heard overall, the MEPs' comments regarding the Union's tasks for the next six months largely coincide with the programme I have presented to you here.
I am delighted to see that there is broad political consensus on what we have to do in the next six months.
This is extremely important for Europe.
It has not been difficult, furthermore, to identify those priorities, because we are all aware of one very simple fact: what Europe expects - what the European economy, European society and the world expect - is that this time Europe will resolve its institutional crisis once and for all, because for the last two years the idea on which we have been reflecting was one that everyone has seen as an institutional crisis that Europe has been incapable of overcoming.
The clear signal that we must send to the world and to Europeans is that we are going to succeed in overcoming that crisis and breaking that deadlock.
That is why I am pleased to hear in all the Members' speeches the idea that concluding a Treaty at the earliest opportunity should naturally be our priority.
I do not know whether it will be a penalty, but the fact is that we need to score that goal, and as quickly as possible.
I am also pleased that the Members support the Presidency's view that, to obtain a Treaty, it is also necessary to take advantage of the current political situation, the current political climate, the current political convergence, so as to transform the mandate into a Treaty as quickly as possible.
I am therefore pleased to see that the timetable I have presented here, the idea that we must move quickly, also corresponds to a political consensus.
There is no reason, furthermore, why we should not do so.
That, as I say, is what the European economy expects, what the other European institutions expect and what the world expects: in other words, that we should move quickly.
The final consensus, the agreement, the mutual commitment we are reaching is such a clear and precise commitment that nobody expects us to get bogged down in interminable discussions, especially given that discussions are conducted behind closed doors.
I am therefore pleased to see that there is general agreement on the idea that priority should be given to converting the mandate into a Treaty.
I have naturally addressed the issue of the mandate and have stated that, if there is one thing the Presidency does not have, it is a mandate to reopen or alter the mandate it has received.
This is of the greatest importance and also seems to me to be the core issue.
No one expects that and I am sure all the Member States in attendance that night and that made a commitment to a firm agreement are fully aware of what that would mean in terms of discrediting the institutions and Europe itself.
I am therefore certain that none of the Member States and no political leader advocate such a possibility, and that you will support me when I say that our whole duty is to keep the mandate as it is and transform that mandate into a Treaty.
I would also like to state the obvious: that this Union depends on everyone, and everyone is necessary.
I am well aware of the task facing the Presidency, which is to make it possible to reach an agreement between the 27; not the 26, the 25 or the 24, but the 27.
That, furthermore, is what distinguishes a union from an alliance.
We are not an alliance, we are a Union, and because we are a union we are all indispensable and must all be 'on board'.
That is why I say that we will do our best to move as quickly as possible to obtain what we all desire, which is that in October, at the first opportunity, not the final opportunity, but the first opportunity, Europe should be capable of giving a clear signal to Europeans and the world that it has overcome its institutional crisis.
I would also like to say a few words on the ratification of the Treaty.
Ratification at national level is a problem for the Member States, it is not a European problem.
At this moment, having heard what I have heard, I would like to point out that nowhere in the world, in liberal democracies, is Parliamentary ratification considered illegitimate or incompatible with the best values of modern democracies.
I believe that the attempt to devalue parliamentary ratification does no credit to representative democracy.
I fully understand that there are those who advocate referendums and argue for direct democracy at certain times.
I find that very positive and believe that referendums and more participative democracy make democracy richer. But never, never, in any circumstances, have I argued that such a more direct and participative democracy can be used against representative democracy.
I consider that a bogus argument and would like to make that clear.
Parliaments are legitimately empowered to approve treaties and to do so on behalf of the people.
That is what the theory of democracy teaches us, and I have lived with those values for so long that I am not willing to relinquish them, particularly at this time.
A second point I would like to speak to you about, honourable Members, is external policy, which is set to be one of our priorities under this Presidency.
It will be one of our priorities because it cannot be otherwise.
If we look at EU foreign policy, it is easy to see that there are some gaps in it.
We naturally want to fill those gaps.
We have already filled one, namely that of Brazil.
The fact is that the EU has held summits with China, India and Russia but not with Brazil, the other BRIC country. This has not happened, but ought to happen, because such a summit lends consistency to our policies towards the emerging economic powers and attaches greater importance to relations between Europe and Latin America.
Those strategic relations are also vitally important when dealing with questions of world governance.
I feel that Europe is now in a better position to influence global political issues having entered into a strategic partnership with Brazil.
There is one thing of which I have no doubt.
European foreign policy has become richer as a result of the agreement reached at the summit with Brazil.
It remains to be seen, but I have high hopes that that summit may have helped create a better climate for dialogue between Europe and Brazil, which will in turn help the Doha Round and the negotiations for an agreement on world trade to continue.
I have high hopes of that and I am among those who believe in the benefits of a successful Doha Round, and an agreement in that framework, for the whole world, for the regulation of globalisation and also for the promotion of greater freedom of trade and more development, particularly in the least developed countries.
A word about Africa as well, and what I want to say is that we need a specific policy on Africa, too.
Europe has to decide whether it wants to move forward or stay as it is, and we have already been in the latter position for seven years.
Something has to be done, and I would like to remind you all that we have already made that choice, at least nine months ago.
The European Council has already decided to hold a Summit, and at the last three meetings it was declared that the summit should be held this year, during the Portuguese Presidency.
The time for thinking about a summit, therefore, is over.
Let us hold the summit.
I should like to say this about the EU-Africa Summit.
For a start, I consider that Europe cannot go on paying the price for not having a structured, institutional and strategic dialogue with Africa.
I think that is a mistake that is already costing us dear.
We in Europe are paying the price, but the Africans are also paying the price, and there are people whose lives are the worse because we do not have that dialogue with Africa.
If we in this Chamber think of human rights and hunger, we must also think that a great deal would be contributed by holding a summit with Africa, not only to resolve development problems and to provide a better response to the problems of hunger in Africa, but also to provide a better response to the problems of governance and human rights in African countries.
That is how I see this issue.
Now, the surest way of contributing nothing towards resolving problems is to stay as we are: doing nothing.
I consider that the wrong option.
On the subject of Africa I would also like to tell you, honourable Members, of my sadness on hearing the news about the Bulgarian nurses, as previous speakers have mentioned.
I should also like you to know that we have been monitoring that case for a long time.
As you know, Portugal is one of the countries that has the best relations with the North African countries, including Libya, and we have been keeping a close eye on the matter.
We have for a long time been talking to the Libyan authorities about it.
We now have more responsibility during these six months and are well aware of the importance of the case.
We are working on it, and indeed, I did so recently, in conjunction with the President of the Commission, when we were in Accra.
We shall do everything possible to ensure that the case has a happy ending.
There is still leave to appeal the decision.
As I say, we are monitoring the case and hope you all appreciate the diplomatic delicacy of the matter.
Our objective is to see that the case be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.
As you will appreciate, political rhetoric is not always helpful, but you all know how committed we are to securing a satisfactory outcome to the case.
Two more comments.
Firstly, with regard to climate change, I should just like to say that I have been Minister for the Environment, I have spent a term of office as Minister for the Environment, and I remember the difficulty we had at the time, in 2000, talking about climate change.
That difficulty belongs to a different era.
The situation is now totally different and I believe we have all realised that the operational synthesis between innovation and energy is climate change.
There is a great desire in various sectors for action to be taken quickly, but I think, as you must all agree, that the decisions we took at the last spring European Council were absolutely essential to give Europe credibility in that field and to put Europe in a political position to lead, to be in the front line, to provide a political response to this global problem.
We are going to monitor this subject very closely.
I myself - if I can fit it into my timetable, although I intend to do so - shall be in Bali, representing the EU, to give a speech expressing the Union's willingness to provide leadership for the post-Kyoto framework and for the world's response to climate change.
I should like to make it clear, however, that we have an internal agenda to which we must adhere and that agenda includes the Technological Energy Plan, which we shall deal with in conjunction with the Commission, and the creation of the European Institute of Technology, which we firmly support and which will be launching its first Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) and that first initiative is rightly, and indeed symbolically, targeted at climate change.
Finally, a word on biofuels: there are no magic solutions, but biofuels are the most efficient way at the present time of reducing CO2 in the field of transport.
I have no doubts about this and if there is a way forward, an appropriate solution that contributes towards such reduction, I consider that we have no right to overlook it, if only because it naturally has a less than favourable impact on other areas.
I consider that the balance-sheet on biofuels is highly positive and one that should encourage us to continue with them.
Finally, I turn to immigration.
I want to make it clear that the subject of immigration will be one of the most important during our Presidency.
We shall attach great importance to this issue.
Europe needs to set out a clear way of thinking on immigration.
I think the only way we can have an immigration policy commensurate with the problem and also compatible with our values is to define a policy constructed on three pillars.
The first is to prevent illegal immigration, to strengthen border security, and fight this crime against human dignity.
The second is to fight for an inclusive, human policy.
Europe today is a continent that provides shelter for many millions of immigrants, who are also waiting for a definition of immigration.
Thirdly, as a third pillar, we must have a policy that has been agreed with the countries of origin, to make it possible to regulate migratory flows to our mutual benefit.
These are the three pillars that should form European policy, but they should be formulated in documentary form, and therefore, during the next six months, we shall be organising conferences and shall continue to work in conjunction with the Commission and Mr Frattini to make it possible to structure and publicise a consistent and comprehensive European Union immigration policy compatible with the response the problem demands.
Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to thank you once again for all your comments and wish to conclude as follows.
We have our plan, we are embarking on these six months with confidence, with the energy and willingness of those political leaders who, throughout their political lives, have always believed in the European project.
I have said several times before that I was born in 1957, the Year of Europe, and elected to Parliament a year after we came into Europe.
I am a European politician and, therefore, when I come here, I do so with the greatest honour as one who has this opportunity to serve Europe in such a place.
We therefore start out with confidence, the confidence of someone who is thoroughly familiar with the European project.
We have a plan, but a plan is only a plan.
Naturally there will be unforeseen events, situations that were not in the plan, events that will take us by surprise, and it is just as well that politics is like that, because if it were not so it would not be a matter for politicians, inasmuch as politicians are there to deal with unforeseen situations.
The plan guides us in our actions and, if unforeseen and unexpected events occur, we shall be here, armed with what is important for a politician: the set of values, principles and guidelines that have always guided us in the construction of a stronger Europe in the service of a better world.
Thank you, Mr President.
President-in-Office, we have confidence in you.
The European Parliament will be at your side making sure you succeed.
If you succeed, the European Union will succeed.
We wish you all the best for the Presidency.
President of the Commission. (PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, I also should first of all like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the Bulgarian nurses and their families, and also with the Palestinian doctor, following the disturbing news we have received.
We are extremely disappointed by these decisions, but I would also like to say that I am confident that a solution will be found.
In particular, I would like to assure the Bulgarian nurses and their families that the European Commission, in conjunction with the President of the Council and the Member States, will do everything possible to safeguard their right to life and freedom.
Prime Minister, the debate has clearly demonstrated that Parliament supports the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.
As Mr Schulz said, a message of support for the European project has come from the various political and ideological areas.
The European project cannot be seen as merely the property of one political or ideological sector or another.
It should unite political forces that have that common objective of making a stronger Europe, a Europe that responds to the aspirations of its citizens.
That is what we have seen here today.
We very much agree with the your analysis regarding the need to resolve the institutional issue.
The fact is that the non-resolution of the institutional issue has cast a shadow of doubt, of scepticism, of negativity and at times even of cynicism, over everything Europe has done.
Europe has not been deadlocked.
In recent years, and the cooperation between the various institutions has been important in this, we have succeeded in dealing with difficult issues, we have approved a budget for the next seven years, we have achieved a hard-won consensus on an issue as divisive as the service directive, at the March European Council, we succeeded in adopting the most ambitious package of measures so far presented concerning the fight against climate change, the relaunched Lisbon Strategy has borne fruit, thanks to a new system of governance.


The fact is that at present Europe is, broadly speaking, enjoying a successful period; we have economic growth that gives us fresh cause for hope, we are creating more jobs now than our US partners and Eurobarometer results confirm that we have the highest level of confidence in Europe for eight years.
Times are, therefore, better.
The fact is, however, that until the institutional issue is resolved, this doubt is always present and, particularly when we are outside Europe, we are confronted with questions to which we have to attach due prominence.
We are asked how Europeans can want to lead the world in the fight against climate change, how Europeans can ensure energy security, how Europeans can want to transform their economy into one of the fairest, most inclusive and most competitive in the world, when they are incapable of deciding how their own institutions should function and how decisions should be taken.
This, therefore, is a matter of credibility.
That is why it is absolutely essential that we resolve the institutional issue and the Prime Minister, the President-in-office of the Council, will leave here today, with, in my view, the very clear support of both Parliament and certainly the Commission, to find a solution in full compliance with the mandate and if possible a solution as early as the October European Council.
That should be our objective and in that, Prime Minister, you have our total support.
Lastly, I would like to say that we have taken careful note of the priorities established at the December European Council: immigration and matters related to the new Agenda for Security, Justice and Freedom in Europe.
One of the improvements we have made to the Treaty is to increase our capacity to take action on matters of justice, freedom and security.
As previous speakers have mentioned, immigration issues are crucial from a human point of view - they are human dramas that we have to deal with.
As regards the Agenda for Innovation, the Prime Minister has just now taken the opportunity to lend his clear and unequivocal support to the creation of a European Institute of Technology, to the launch of the first Knowledge and Innovation Community, innovation precisely targeted at the issue of climate change, and anything we can do to give fresh impetus to the Agenda for Innovation.
This is one of the issues in which Europe cannot afford to lag behind, or to give ground, not only in relation to our US partners but also in relation to other, emerging powers; Europe needs to make more determined efforts in this area.
I feel that if we achieve these objectives we shall be entitled to be proud of ourselves.
Finally, with regard to Africa, a problem that has been discussed here, honourable Members, we cannot accept that our relations with a continent like the African continent should be dependent on one dictator or another, whoever it might be.
The fact is that Europe has partnership relations at the highest level with Asia, where there are dictators, and with Latin America, where some countries are also not democracies.
What is more, the red carpet is laid out for some of those dictators in certain European capitals.
I therefore cannot understand why we are prevented from having high-level relations with Africa, whilst we keep the door open for those who are sometimes actually hampering Africa's democratic development, because we are in some way being held hostage by one dictator or another.
We therefore resolutely support this priority of the Portuguese Presidency, and it is certain that the objectives, or one of the objectives, of the summit should be to discuss democracy, freedom, human rights and the need to develop our relations for the benefit of good governance in Africa, and all areas of relations between our respective continents.
If so, I think we can be happy with this Presidency because we are sure that, during these six months, we shall continue to advance towards a stronger Europe for a better world; a Europe where it is demonstrated in practice that only by working together can we produce results that are really in the interests of European citizens.
(Applause)
The debate on the Portuguese Presidency is closed.
Written statements (Article 142)
in writing. - (IT) As well as the reform of the institutions, without which the European Union will not have the role that it should within the world, and the challenge to achieve competitiveness within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be able to tackle vigorously that which, as I have already emphasised on various occasions, is the main stalemate that we need to overcome, namely energy independence and the fight against climate change.
Energy will represent at the same time the business and the problem of the future, as we can see also from the alarm over the imminent total consumption of non-renewable energy sources and the Kyoto protocol commitments.
Only with proper independence from external suppliers will we be able to ensure that Europe has a leading role in the world economy in the long term, as well as a stronger position on the geopolitical stage, and is not subject to external threats.
This is an essential condition when it comes to promoting stability, democracy and respect for human rights throughout the world.
Let us therefore try to focus our attention, energies and resources on what we already have, which is nuclear power, and on what we can have, which is renewable energy sources, promoting research, cofinancing by the Member States and the private sector, action on tax, reform of the transport sector, and a call to European experts who have gone abroad through lack of opportunities.
in writing. - (FR) The Portuguese Presidency must focus on the priority objective of the signing by the 27 of a new institutional treaty, in October, in Lisbon, all the more so because the mandate entrusted to the Intergovernmental Conference by the last European Council is clear and precise.
The launch of a new round of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment is an opportunity to give the social dimension the importance and visibility that it deserves, not least through the improved coordination of employment policies and through the development of 'flexicurity', with the aim of reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe and its reformed economic model.
I am sure that the Portuguese Presidency will pay special attention to the EU's outermost regions - the specific circumstances of which it is well aware - together with Madeira and the Azores, in order to give fresh impetus to the Community measures benefiting them, not least those concerning the neighbourhood policy and the additional costs generated by the outermost regions.
It is imperative that the last Brussels summit has beneficial consequences and bears witness to the fact that Europe's renewed spirit is stronger than the national self-interests.
I sincerely hope that the Portuguese Presidency succeeds in making the most of the major political boost observed at the end of the German Presidency.
Statement by the President
Today the Libyan Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence passed on the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor detained in Libya since February 1999.
They are accused of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV.
I am greatly disturbed by this news, which is distressing for everybody, especially, of course, for the nurses and the doctor, and for their relatives and friends.
I met members of their families in April, and I should like to pass on to them our solidarity and support at this difficult time.
I should also like to send them a message of hope.
This is not the end of the procedure.
The matter will now be referred to the Libyan High Judicial Council.
We believe that the Libyan authorities will take the necessary steps to review and quash the death sentence, paving the way for an early resolution to this situation.
Once again, we reiterate our fundamental opposition to the death penalty, which is against human dignity.
We express our solidarity with the victims of the HIV/AIDS infection in Benghazi hospital.
We appeal to the Libyan authorities to show clemency and to release the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor.
(Sustained applause)

Convening of the Intergovernmental Conference: opinion of the European Parliament (vote)
- Report: Leinen
- Before the vote
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, in this opinion we have given the green light to convene the Intergovernmental Conference.
We had a very tight deadline for producing the report and holding consultations.
There was no alternative, although there has been criticism from some members.
There are two minority opinions appended to the opinion: one from Marco Cappato and the other from Bernard Wojciechowski, but as I said, time was limited.
Exceptional circumstances require an extra degree of flexibility, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of my committee for their willingness to make constructive contributions, for the discussions on the proposal and for giving their approval on Monday evening.
We have respected the rules of procedure and so can vote today.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Leinen for having emphasised the presence of the minority opinions.
Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure states that we shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate.
This applies with regard to issues and, in my view, also to methods.
A system whereby, in connection with a decision that will have consequences for the next few years or decades, we have had one and a half hours in which to table amendments to the original versions, and not even that amount of time in committee, is a sort of binding mandate not to be debated, which Parliament has received on this highly important issue.
This is not just a formality: since this Parliament's opinion is mandatory, we could have used such an obligation to have a positive influence on decisions during the opening of this intergovernmental conference.
Instead, we ourselves abdicated from doing so, and also abdicated from being a Parliament and exercising the powers available to us.
This is the reason for the minority opinion.
- Before the vote on Amendment 1
(DE) Mr President, since several Members addressed me before the vote, I would like to use this opportunity to stress once again that the proposal to include the question of representation for the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference mandate was supported by many Members of this House.
So, if this is a signal you want to send, here is an opportunity to do so.
- Before the vote on Amendment 9
Mr President, I would like to propose an oral amendment to this amendment to add the word 'European' before 'referendum', so it would then read 'European referendum'.
(The oral amendment was not accepted.)

Specific Programme 'Civil justice' (2007-2013) (vote)
- Report: SegelstrÃ¶m
- Before the vote
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission would like to make the following declaration before the vote.
'The Commission hopes that it will be possible today to find an acceptable compromise in all the institutions on account of the importance of adopting a civil justice financial programme as soon as possible.
We are already late.
If an acceptable solution is not found today, it is clear that the civil justice programme will not be adopted in time to be executed in 2007, with very negative consequences.
Without this financial programme, the Commission will not be able to support associations or other actors from civil society, or the studies and projects that are fundamental to the development of the civil justice policies.
The Commission could support the compromise set out in amendment 2, which adds a recital to the Council's common position specifying the right of Parliament to be informed in accordance with Article 7(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC and, more particularly, to receive the draft annual programme relating to the civil justice financial programme when it is submitted to the management committee.
Parliament should also receive the results of voting and a summary record of the meeting of the management committee.
The Commission, moreover, confirms its commitment to transmit directly to the chair of the competent parliamentary committee - the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - the draft annual programme, and to inform Parliament without delay about any modification being made to it.
Finally, the Commission confirms, as firmly stated in the letters addressed by Vice-President Frattini to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, its availability to attend the competent parliamentary committee upon its request, in order to provide its members with all necessary information on the draft annual programme'.

rapporteur. - On this paragraph, I propose withdrawing the oral amendments but asking the PPE-DE Group if they can agree that both amendment 5 from their side and amendment 17 from the ALDE Group are compatible and that we can vote on both of them.
If that is the case, we will vote in favour of your amendment as well.
If not, we will vote against it and I can then withdraw my amendment 23.
- Before the vote on paragraph 34
rapporteur. - I should simply like to add 'group' to paragraph 34, so that it is the 'European Investment Bank Group' instead of just the bank.

Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century (vote)
- Report: Protasiewicz
- Before the vote on Amendment 11
, rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I would just like to explain to my fellow Members that Amendments 11 and 12 are not new texts being added, but existing paragraphs being moved from elsewhere.
As one of the groups has requested a roll call vote, I would like to inform them that voting against it will not change the fact that this text remains in the report, but that it will be in a different, less suitable place.
For this reason I ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 12.
- Before the vote on paragraph 3
, rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, One further clarification: just because we are now voting separately on paragraphs 3 and 4, that does not mean the amendments announced by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be excluded.
That text will be inserted elsewhere, in the form of Amendments 20 and 21.
They are therefore not being deleted from the report, but simply changing position.
- Before the vote on paragraph 4
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I have heard the explanation given by the rapporteur, I would like to say that if we adopt paragraph 4, on which we are about to vote, we ought to bear in mind that the text of Amendment 21 is exactly the same as that of paragraph 4.
So if we act in this way, we will have the same text twice in the report.
If we wish to change the text, we ought to reject the first paragraph and then approve the amendment.
(ES) Mr Protasiewicz, please clear up Mr Cocilovo's doubts.
, rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Cocilovo is right.
Voting against the deletion of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 means that if a vote is held on Amendments 20 and 21, we will simply be covering the same ground.
For this reason I would ask this House that now we vote against, and then vote in favour of Amendments 20 and 21, which means that the text itself will remain the same, but it will only be moved to a more suitable place in the report.
- Before the vote on Amendment 37
(FR) Mr President, please could you tell the French booth that we are talking about paragraphs, not recitals.
It would appear that people are closing ranks in defence of the French language in this House.
That is very good.
- Before the vote on Amendment 21
, rapporteur - (PL) Mr President, may I point out that as a result of the vote on paragraph 3, which was not deleted, and Amendment 20, which we adopted, in the report we now have two paragraphs which say the same thing.
I therefore ask you to vote against Amendment 20, as we previously left that text in its old place.
(EL) We do not recognise you today, you are somewhat slow.
Thank you for that morale boost, Mr Sifunakis.

Motion for a resolution (vote)
- Resolution:
- Before the vote on Amendment 10
Mr President I have a brief comment concerning amendment 10.
The initial amendment was apparently mistranslated into German to mean exactly the opposite of what the English said because the English text was ambiguous.
So the purpose of this is to remove the ambiguity.
I am sorry that there was not time to clear this with all political groups, but I hope that they will support it because it is not trying to change the text. It is merely trying to clarify and remove the ambiguity.
(FR) Mr President, I believe that it is humanly reasonable to stop this vote, even if it means restarting it tomorrow, at 11.30 a.m.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse that comment.
We need to stop the vote now.
It would be unreasonable to continue voting now, especially given the length of the reports.
If necessary, we will have to curtail the speaking times tomorrow or keep strictly to them, so as to be able to start voting at 11.30 a.m.
In response to your request, we shall now suspend the vote.
Voting time
The next item is voting time.
(For results of the vote and other voting information: see Minutes)
Mr President, it is a ludicrous state of affairs to commence voting at 12.40 on 48 pages of votes.
You, Sir, have been doing remarkably well in organising Parliament so that we vote at proper times in order to deal with these large voting lists.
We should have started at 11.00, not at 12.40.
I urge you to revert to type and ensure we do not do this again.

Eurozone (2007) - European Central Bank (2006) (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on
the report by Dariusz Rosati on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Eurozone annual report 2007 (2007/2143()INI) and
the report by Gay Mitchell on behalf of the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs on the European Central Bank's annual report for 2006.
I am very pleased to welcome the President of the Euro Group, the Luxembourg Prime Minister and Finance Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
I am also delighted to welcome the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet to the European Parliament.
Let me also extend a warm welcome to Commissioner JoaquÃ­n Almunia.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to present the second ever report of the European Parliament in response to the Annual Report of the European Commission on the Eurozone.
The Commission's report presents the economic situation in the Eurozone in 2007.
The results of the report are cause for satisfaction.
The economic growth rate in the Eurozone rose to 2.7%, which is the best result since 2000, whilst unemployment fell to 7.6%, the lowest in 15 years.
At the same time the Eurozone has become an increasing factor in stabilising the world economy.
This generally optimistic picture, however, should not conceal some negatives, and these are what we focus on in our report.
Firstly, the rate of fiscal adaptation, particularly in countries with large budget deficits, is too slow, bearing in mind that the stability and growth pact obliges Member States to maintain as balanced a budget as possible in the medium term.
That involves building up a budget surplus in good times to have a financial reserve for times of recession.
In this context we are critical of the behaviour of some Member States who are not making use of the current period of growth to implement the necessary cuts in public spending.
Secondly, Parliament points out that the good average results for the whole of the Eurozone cover up substantial differences in the economic situation from one Member State to another.
Of particular concern is the declining international competitiveness of some countries' economies, most frequently due to wage rises in excess of the increase in productivity.
Thirdly, we call for a continuation of the structural reforms required by the guidelines of the new Lisbon Strategy.
We have to increase the speed at which the remaining barriers in the markets for goods and services are removed, and help further integration of the labour and financial markets, which will become an important element in the proper functioning of the Eurozone.
We would like in particular to draw attention to the speedy implementation of the services directive, which has brought accelerated growth in labour productivity and cut inflation in the services sector.
This is particularly important, as services make up 70% of the GDP in the Eurozone.
Fourthly, Parliament stresses the importance of further extending the Eurozone to strengthen economic and monetary union and the common currency.
We are pleased at the decision to accept Cyprus and Malta into the Eurozone, and look forward to other states joining it in the not too distant future.
We would like to point out that the process for ascertaining the readiness of countries applying for the Eurozone should be transparent and based on uniform criteria, whose economic rationale and political importance should be in no doubt.
In this regard we call upon the Commission and the Council to start a serious debate on the nominal convergence criteria.
Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of good governance and intensified policy coordination in the Eurozone.
We need this if we are to make full use of the opportunities provided by the common currency.
I am pleased at the decision taken by the Euro group in April this year to adopt benchmarks for the fiscal policies of Member States.
We expect the implementation of these decisions to be closely monitored.
I would like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Juncker that in this matter he has the full support of Parliament.
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Almunia on preparing the Commission's second report on the economic situation in the Eurozone and express the wish that the reports prepared in coming years bring just as good news as this one.
rapporteur. - Mr President, I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone.
I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Starting with the economic situation, in 2006 the economic recovery in the eurozone became a self-sustaining process with domestic demand acting as the main driver.
Two million jobs were created in 2006 and unemployment fell from 8.4% to 7.6%.
In the context of this recovery, I would like to stress the main points of the report.
Against the background of the recent recovery, any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth.
It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment.
Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth.
The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth, with notably Ireland, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments.
The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies.
Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised.
The report calls on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination.
The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and, in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro, to quantify and analyse the effects of this, particularly as regards exchange rates.
Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices.
This remains a concern of mine.
Therefore, the report calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments, which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy.
The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages, such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets.
I refer later on to the Fed formula.
Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices.
My report also raises the issue of sub-prime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of sub-prime lending.
I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members.
Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by 9% by estate agents Hook and McDonald, by between 8% and 10% by Sherry Fitzgerald and by 7% by Friends First and IIB, while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between 3% and 6%.
The recent Irish Permanent tsb/ESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by 2.1% between January and May 2007 and a further decline in Ireland is expected.
Sub-prime lending - that is lending to poorer people, those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans - is projected to grow to EUR 4 billion in Ireland this year.
If the average loan was between EUR 200 000 and EUR 400 000, then between 10 000 and 20 000 such loans exist in Ireland alone.
Sub-prime lenders are relatively new to the Irish market and generally charge about twice the going mortgage rate to 'compensate' - as they put it - lenders for higher risk.
In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since 2005 has already repossessed 30 homes.
There are also signs of concern in Britain about sub-prime lending.
It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States.
The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve, according to one of its former economists, shows that typically, when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates, when interest rates increase, prices begin to decline roughly 18 months to 2 years later.
I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because, at present, we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts, and they are the people - the financial institutions and others - who have most to gain.
The report urges the Commission to assess the quality of supervision and offshore location of hedge funds.
It reiterates points made in the past about democratic scrutiny and the need to publish summary minutes.
It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from 7% to 13.5% and asks that the ECB evaluate this.
It ends by saying that the number of banknotes in circulation stood at 11.3 billion with a value of EUR 628.2 billion last year, but that it is concerned about the growth in the number of 50 euro, 100 euro and 500 euro banknotes.
500 euro banknotes alone have increased by 13.2%.
My report, with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB.
I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and, in particular - not today, but perhaps over a certain period - to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knock-on effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone.
President of Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, Madam President of the committee, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen,
We, in Europe, have replaced the fundamental debate with simple words.
We are invited to Parliament - I hardly ever see it - to the plenary, as it is called, and we talk, I note, of the everyday living conditions of Europeans, something that undoubtedly enhances the credibility of our institutions.
European newspapers, especially this week's, report the words that were supposedly exchanged, during a recent Eurogroup, with an evening visitor whom we had the pleasure of hosting.
I have read a summary of these long debates in editorials that take up scarcely 25 lines, and we complain that Europeans are poorly informed of what is really going on in Europe!
So be it.
On the other hand, I am pleased to note that, one or two nuances aside, there is very little difference between the substance of the report by our friend, Mr Rosati, and our, the Eurogroup's, joint consideration, since our joint finding is that growth in Europe is on the up again, is expanding, is continuing, and everything rests on our knowing whether, in a few months' time, we will be able to see whether or not this prolonged recovery, this renewed growth in Europe, will enable us to say that the growth potential of the European Union, and of the eurozone in particular, has substantially increased.
We are agreed in our finding that the levels of underemployment, of unemployment, are going down.
We have had the lowest unemployment level for a very long time now.
There is no doubt about that.
The fact remains, however, that it must be stressed that the European Union, which is meant to be a model for the world but which still has an employment rate that is structurally higher than 7%, has no reason to seek plaudits from others or to proclaim itself victorious over the phenomenon of unemployment on our continent.
The deficits are decreasing.
We saw a distinct upturn in the situation of Europe's public finances during the period 2005-2006.
That is true above all where the deficit is concerned. Its level of 2.5 in 2005 decreased to 1.6 in 2006, which clearly proves that the corrective arm of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact has proven itself, and this, despite all the generally poor warnings that were given to us when we amended the Pact.
It is true that, where the preventive arm of the Pact is concerned, we struggle to produce the same successes that we have been able to produce with the recovery of public finances in its corrective part.
We, the members of the Eurogroup - there are 13 of us now and there will be 15 of us as from 1 January - remain committed to the effectiveness of the policies that must be implemented in order to make the preventive arm of the Pact really develop, really take off.
When the economy is going well, when growth rates provide so many grounds for satisfaction, when economic growth gets back on track, it is clear that those times - which, in Franglais, we call good times - must be turned to good account, so that the structural deficits in our public finances can be brought down.
Hence the huge importance that we accord to achieving the medium-term objective quickly, something that requires Member States of the eurozone to redouble their efforts in order to achieve their medium-term objective in time.
It will not have escaped you that, on this point, the informal Eurogroup that was held in Berlin on 20 April took a decision that involves a commitment being made, since we said that all the Member States should meet the medium-term objective in 2008 and 2009. Some of them managed to delay this until 2010, without having their cases clarified.
There was never a question of not meeting the objective until 2012.
This was, of course, the main topic of discussion when, recently, at the start of the week, we met the French President, who came - and we ought to welcome this - to explain to us, at Eurogroup, the new headings and the new aims of France's economic and budgetary policy.
We approve heartily of the set of reforms under way, because they are structural reforms sought by the French Government and by the French President, but we would emphasise that which we expect and demand from France: like the other Member States of the eurozone, it must meet the medium-term objective that we have set ourselves on 1 January 2010.
This is a remark that applies to France; it may easily apply to countries farther south and, in an ecumenical way, to all the Member States of the eurozone.
However, we have been given reassurances regarding a reduction in the deficit in 2008, as compared with 2007, regarding the principle, which has been accepted by the French authorities, of allocating all the profits from revenue made in relation to budget estimates, in so far as the revenue is short-term revenue, and regarding the reduction in the deficit and the debt.
We all believe, since this is a subject that is brought up by the press, both in France and across the border into Germany - we are, after all, in Strasbourg - that no countries tried, in any working language of the European Union, last Monday, in the setting of Eurogroup, to call into question the independence of the European Central Bank.
Moreover, if someone were to take the liberty of doing so, it would not be enough for them to be expressive in voicing a misguided thought, for respect must still be shown for the Treaties.
We wanted an independent Central Bank; we have an independent Central Bank.
It will, of course, remain an independent central monetary authority.
(Applause)
The strength of the euro is another subject that gives rise to debate. However, we do not see the ministers of Eurogroup, under the present circumstances - today, even - claim that a strong euro is liable to jeopardise economic growth in the eurozone.
Rather, we believe that the Member States that are uneasy about this strength of the European currency in relation to the outside - strength that reflects the robustness of Europe's economic recovery - should ensure, within their countries, by introducing the necessary structural reforms, that their national economic systems, that is to say, their systems under the eurozone, become more competitive.
I was sensitive to the remarks made by your rapporteur in his report on the derailing of certain elements of wage policy.
A large number of company managers are being granted allowances that in no way correspond to the appeals made again and again, both by the Bank and by Eurogroup, for a wage moderation policy that is understood properly, that is, for wage moderation that keeps up with the pace of the increase in productivity.
We ought not to be surprised that European workers can no longer get to grips with a Europe in which some people earn a fortune without working, when one sees the volume of work that that requires, and the others have to resign themselves to accepting this, to being subjected to the appeals that we launch to them to encourage them to support wage moderation.
(Applause) It is economic and social injustice that is now taking hold.
We must react to it.
I agree with your rapporteur that, when viewed from the outside, the economic zone must be represented as being more solid, more of a single entity, but I cannot say that I understood the full scope of his ambition, when he advocates a single representation of the eurozone internationally.
In spite of his qualities, Mr Trichet will not succeed in making me withdraw from the European scene.
I am here, and here to stay.
And, as far as I am concerned, I have no ambition, no vague desire, that is driving me to force the other Jean-Claude to step down.
Which one of us, moreover, could have the idea of eliminating the Commission from the external representation of the eurozone?
The eurozone may be represented externally by one party, even if there are three of us, provided that there is an agreement among the three partners representing the eurozone externally.
That agreement exists.
It will have escaped no one that, on the key points of monetary policy, be it internal or external policy, we share exactly the same ideas and convictions.
I have restricted my remarks to the key points, Mr President, because that is what is asked of us by your Rules of Procedure, which I find particularly strict when the aim is to talk more vividly about the crucial and, as Parliament often says, everyday, problems of Europeans.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting to you today the annual report of the European Central Bank for 2006.
This is an important tool for giving an account to the people of Europe, to their elected representatives, to Parliament, of monetary policy and of our activities in our areas of responsibility.
ECB. - (DE) I would like to start by giving a short review of economic and monetary developments in 2006 and explaining the monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB.
I would then like to say a few words on financial stability and on the issue of payment systems.
I will start with the economic and monetary issues.
In 2006, the ECB's monetary policy continued to anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, reflecting the credibility of the ECB in conducting its monetary policy.
As has been said by the rapporteur very eloquently, in 2006 the euro area economy expanded at the highest growth rate since 2000.
Notwithstanding the impact of high and volatile oil prices, real GDP rose by 2.9% compared with 1.5% in 2005.
The economic recovery gradually broadened in the course of 2006, and the nature of economic expansion became increasingly self-sustaining, with domestic demand acting as the main driver.
The latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive, supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates.
Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable and the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate.
Regarding price developments, average annual HICP inflation in 2006 was 2.2%, unchanged compared with the previous year.
This was above the ECB's aim to keep inflation over the medium term below, but close to, 2%.
Although this outcome mainly reflects the increases in oil and commodity prices and although inflation has been slightly below 2% in the first half of 2007, there is no room for complacency.
The outlook for price stability over the medium term remains subject to upside risks.
As capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets are gradually improving, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments.
In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment.
Our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevailed has been confirmed throughout the period from the start of 2006 to mid-2007 by cross-checking with the monetary analysis.
The marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in 2006 and 2007 reflected a continued persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, adding further to liquidity accumulation.
To address the upside risks to price stability identified by the ECB's economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council has, as you know, adjusted the monetary policy stance gradually in eight steps since the end of 2005.
As I said last Thursday in explaining the assessment of the Governing Council, after the adjustments in the key interest rates, the ECB's monetary policy remains still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample.
Firm and timely action continues to be warranted to ensure price stability over the medium term.
The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks over the medium term do not materialise.
As regards fiscal policies, the ECB shares the view expressed in the draft resolution that fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth.
For the Governing Council as was very eloquently said I have to say by both the rapporteur and by the President of the Eurogroup, it is important that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007.
As agreed in Berlin, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest.
I have to say that we also very much welcome the emphasis which has been placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances.
Turning to structural policies, the motion for a resolution adopted by the ECON Committee refers several times to economic divergences in the euro area.
Let me stress first that, overall, inflation differences among euro area countries have fallen and are currently relatively limited by historical standards.
The magnitude of current inflation and output differentials at the moment I am speaking is similar to those that are observed across regions or states within the United States of America, a vast continental economy which has an order of magnitude, a dimension, which is of the order of magnitude of ours.
That being said, a single currency means a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate vis-Ã -vis other currencies.
It is therefore all the more important to ensure that all the national shock adjustment mechanisms function perfectly.
The efficient and smooth functioning of economic adjustments within the euro area requires the removal of institutional barriers to flexible wage- and price-setting mechanisms as well as the completion of the Single Market and thus greater cross-border competition.
Indeed, well-designed structural reforms implemented by national governments are crucial to improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets and to reinforce competitiveness.
We also consider that free and undistorted competition fosters long-term economic growth and job creation and facilitates the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.
Let me say a word now on financial stability, which I know is a very important issue for Parliament.
We would acknowledge the positive role that hedge funds play by contributing to enhancing the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets. We should also be aware, however, that hedge funds can represent also a source of risk to the stability of the financial system.
Against this background, the report which was issued in May 2007 by the Financial Stability Forum at the request of the G8 on highly-leveraged institutions is welcome.
The report contains a number of recommendations addressed to supervisors, hedge-fund counterparties and investors, and the hedge-fund industry itself, which I fully share.
As for the role to be played by the industry, more than ever we will support the proposal that the hedge-fund sector would strive for best practices and that industry-led benchmarks would be a suitable tool to pursue this objective.
In this vein, the recent initiative that has been undertaken by the industry to set up a working group to review best practices is a very welcome development and I look forward to the result of such work.
My final remarks perhaps concern the integration of payment systems in Europe.
I have noted with satisfaction that the approach of the Single Euro Payments Area and the Target 2 project is very positive and we will continue in the Eurosystem to play our role in this regard.
As far as T2S is concerned, we have put into place a governance model for the development phase which seeks to involve all stakeholders through the creation of an Advisory Group on T2S where market players are well represented.
In April 2007 we launched an official public consultation on the principles and proposals underlying the T2S Project.
The first preliminary assessment of these comments shows that their feedback is generally positive.
Out of 67 proposals, we have obtained a total of 3200 remarks from 56 institutions and we have noted that 60% of these 3200 remarks indicated full agreement to the proposals, while only 6% indicated full disagreement.
All the feedback received has been published and is being very carefully considered.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Member of the Commission.
(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Central Bank, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is very positive that, for the first time, we are holding this debate on the situation of the eurozone, which is the second we have held, following the first resulting from the first Commission report on the eurozone, and the report on the European Central Bank simultaneously, leading to an overall reflection on the situation of the eurozone, on the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union and on the prospects for the future.
I must thank both Mr Rosati and Mr Mitchell for the wonderful reports they have presented to us and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the work it has done in the debate on the proposals that we are currently discussing.
The proper functioning of the eurozone is a matter of crucial importance to our citizens.
I must tell you from the outset, however, that I am worried that many European citizens, who carry and pay in euros every day, are not showing any great satisfaction with the single currency, at a time when the eurozone's economy is clearly recovering, when economic growth is above our potential - and above that of the United States - when the eurozone is enjoying a recovery, as Mr Trichet has said, based on internal demand, which was not the case a few years ago.
It is a recovery with investment that is growing in a very satisfactory manner and which heralds future improvements in our economy and with an economy that is helping to generate - in the case of last year - two million jobs in the countries of the eurozone.
And all of this with a practically even trade balance, with an inflation rate currently below 2% and a stability that any of the world's economic areas would want.
I believe that everybody, the Commission, of course, but also the Council, and in particular the Eurogroup, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament, have the responsibility to explain to our citizens that this European project, eight years after its creation, is currently yielding very good results.
I believe that this debate must serve to do that.
But it must also help us to learn from experience, to establish which elements of the Economic and Monetary Union are not functioning as we had imagined eight years ago, and to implement the adaptations and political decisions required in order to make the future better than the present, however positive the present may be.
Following the Ecofin meeting yesterday, more Europeans are going to share in this positive present.
Yesterday, Ecofin formally adopted the latest decisions required in order to confirm that the eurozone would be enlarged to include Malta and Cyprus on January 2008.
On 1 January of this year it was enlarged to include Slovenia.
Next year three new Member States will also have joined the Economic and Monetary Union, sharing the single currency with 318 million other Europeans.
I believe that that is a very positive element which was debated yesterday and agreed to everybody's satisfaction, not just by the 15 members of the eurozone, but also by the other 12 States that do not yet share the single currency, and I believe that that is worth stressing at this point.
With regard to the economic situation, I am not going to refer to it in detail, since both Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet have already done that.
With regard to the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, which I believe relates to this improvement in the economic situation and this economic stability that we are enjoying in the eurozone, I must say, as Mr Juncker has already said, that the application of the corrective part of the revised Stability Pact, the application of the excessive deficit procedures, is having a very positive effect.
This year, we have abrogated three excessive deficit procedures relating to three members of the eurozone, including the zone's two leading economies, France and Germany, which are no longer in a situation of excessive deficit.
We have also abrogated the excessive deficit procedure relating to Greece.
Excessive deficit procedures are currently still in place for two countries of the zone, Italy and Portugal.
If things carry on as they are, by the end of the year Italy will have corrected its excessive deficit and it will be well below 3%, and, if things carry on as they are, then Portugal, if not this year, then next year, will have corrected its excessive deficit by the end of 2008, as requested by the Council.
With regard to the eurozone, therefore, the application of that element of the Pact, which is the best-known element, and most striking element and the element with the strongest and most powerful instruments in the hands of the Commission and the Council, is being carried out satisfactorily.
It is the preventive part that we are concerned with now.
The Eurogroup debated it on Monday and Ecofin debated it yesterday.
This is the most topical and most difficult debate during economic good times, because during economic good times, it is more difficult, not in economic terms but in political terms, to carry on consolidating public finances and the instruments in the hands of the Commission and the Council to assist in that correction of public finances beyond the 3% limits and towards the mid-term objective of balance in structural terms.
They are weaker instruments from a legal point of view and they must be based on political consensus, on peer pressure and on the conviction that that is a necessary condition for sustained growth.
We have recently debated once again - this very week - the situation in Italy, which is one of excessive deficit, but we should now be considering how to move its consolidation process forward, and it is being considered with great difficulty.
We are lucky enough not to have to debate the situation in Germany so much, because a lot of progress has been made on fiscal consolidation in Germany.
And we have begun to debate the situation in France.
I am going to tell you my opinion on Monday's debate in the Eurogroup, expanding on what Mr Juncker has said.
There is one very positive fact.
The French President has promised the Finance Ministers of the eurozone and the President of the European Central Bank and of the Commission that he is going to promote a very serious programme of reforms which he will set out in detail between now and September.
There is also a second very positive fact.
He has promised to allocate all of the budget surplus to fiscal consolidation and debt reduction.
And something new, at the meeting of the Eurogroup he said, 'if I can adjust the deficit in 2010, I want to adjust the deficit in 2010', something that was not clear before the meeting of the Eurogroup.
Though it is also true that he added, 'if I cannot do so, I shall have to do so in 2012'.
That explanation, however, did not end on Monday, because another element of that meeting that I believe to be very important is that the debate on the French budgetary strategy, and the debate on the budgetary strategy of any other country, will take place, just has it has been until now, within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, with France presenting a revised stability programme, which will be analysed by the Commission and by the Council and it will be the ministers, meeting within the Council, in the Eurogroup and also within Ecofin, who will give their opinion on the programme of fiscal consolidation and adjustment presented by France.
I believe that this should be stressed because some people have interpreted what has happened over recent days as the second death of the Pact - which some people had claimed was dead in 2003.
I believe that it is alive and kicking.
The problem is that it is difficult to apply it during good times in the cycle, in certain countries in particular.
That is what the pact's instruments are for, however: to help overcome those difficulties.
I would like to make a final brief comment, Mr President, relating to the importance that the new Treaty will have when it enters into force in terms of giving the Eurogroup more institutional capacity, in terms of improving the governance of the Economic and Monetary Union, which still has a long way to go, both internally and externally.
I hope that, in the next debate, the Commission can present you with a full analysis of how the Economic and Monetary Union is functioning and how it should function, on the tenth anniversary of the decision to launch the euro, in May 2008.
Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking the rapporteurs, Mr Mitchell and Mr Rosati, for their work.
With single monetary policy set by the ECB and the euro as a single currency, the Member States in the Eurozone have achieved the highest conceivable level of integration in the area of monetary policy.
Unlike the common monetary policy, economic policy is not set at Community level, and so economic policy decisions remain in the hands of the national governments and parliaments.
A high level of long-term economic convergence within the Eurozone countries is a prerequisite for a strong, stable European currency.
So I am delighted by what Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet have said today.
A lot has been published in the press over recent weeks, and even at the start of this week.
It can be summarised in just one line: the mountain laboured and gave birth to a mouse.
I am pleased that you have been so clear and firm in your statements, but I think that discussions will continue on how the euro and the criteria that shape it will develop in future.
This discussion will require all participants to stick firmly to their guns.
As a representative of the younger generation, I would urge all Member States in the Eurozone not to give up on their efforts to consolidate and to apply budgetary discipline in their national budgets.
In this context, I would like to quote Montesquieu, who said that what counts is applying 'the spirit of the law'.
The terms of the Treaty on economic and monetary union must be respected, even if the governments have changed.
Here Montesquieu's excellent advice should definitely be applied lock, stock and barrel.
For example, if one Member State that has produced a lot of inflammatory material in the last few weeks were to change tack, then other, more northerly Member States would follow suit, with disastrous results for consolidation and budgetary policy in the European Union.
For that reason, Mr Juncker and Mr Trichet, I urge you to be tough, to stand firm - do not allow anyone to alter your course in the coming years.
Mr Schwab, it is of course particularly appropriate to quote Montesquieu in this case.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot resist the urge to react to the remarks made by Mr Juncker and his evening visitor, by first recommending that he ought not to let himself be taken advantage of by this evening visitor, especially with regard to the nature of the deficits that he is in the process of examining closely in France.
That said in passing, these deficits have nothing to do with new investment in research, development and innovation, as the Lisbon Strategy suggests, but are basically due to a EUR 14 billion tax reduction, targeted at the most well-off people in France, a reduction that prompts most economists to wonder about its supposed positive knock-on effect on EU growth.
I shall digress no longer.
At present, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell for his report and the work he has done in this regard within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
This report makes some important progress and advances, not least in terms of transparency in the work and decisions of the European Central Bank and of the democratisation of appointment procedures.
This text also calls for more caution regarding a possible rise in interest rates in order not to jeopardise growth; it calls for caution, too, regarding hedge funds, so as to enhance surveillance and regulation in the interests of financial stability and transparency.
Finally, we can be pleased with the consensus that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been able to reach on the need to invest huge sums in research, education and training.
That being said, I would return to the issue of exchange rates because, contrary to the fatalism and to the prevailing ultra-conservatism, we would like to point out that the instruments with which we can take action do exist.
Article 111 of the Treaty merely stipulates that, I quote, 'in the absence of an exchange-rate system in relation to one or more non-Community currencies (...) the Council, acting by a qualified majority either on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the ECB or on a recommendation from the ECB, may formulate general orientations for exchange-rate policy in relation to these currencies'.
That is what we are asking you for, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet and Mr Almunia: general orientations for exchange-rate policy in relation to the currencies of our major partners and competitors, rather than a general laissez-faire policy and not very credible declarations on the lack of economic impact of a largely over-valued euro.
Finally, I should like to say a few words about an issue on which there is major disagreement between the two sides of this House: wage policy.
Like you, Mr Juncker, we note that the share of wages in the GDP of the Eurozone keeps on falling and that, at the same time, the wages, golden parachutes and other stock options of the directors and managers of large companies are a real provocation for European workers, whose purchasing power is weakening.
Like you, Mr Almunia, we are calling for a legal minimum wage in every EU country or at least in the Eurozone.
Encouraging the social partners to agree on significant wage increases, as the social partners of Germany's metallurgical industry have done, means not only aiming for a better distribution of the fruits of growth, but also, in our view, helping to perpetuate growth by giving households more confidence and by increasing consumption.
Agenda
In view of the heavy workload this week, and given that we were unable to complete today's votes, I declare that tomorrow morning's sitting will begin at 9.30 a.m. with voting time from 11.30 a.m.
(Parliament gave its assent.)
Eurozone (2007) - European Central Bank (2006) (continuation of debate)
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Eurozone 2007 and European Central Bank report 2006.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, President Trichet, President Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament can state with satisfaction that the Eurozone is a fundamental factor for stability within the global economy.
As has already been brilliantly explained by the rapporteurs, Mr Rosati and Mr Mitchell, in this second report, Parliament can compare the unquestionable improvement in the economy in 2006, which led to a positive change in terms of economic growth and particularly employment, with the creation of two million new jobs, as has already been pointed out.
This is a positive trend that the Member States of the Eurozone have been able to achieve thanks to a healthy and cautious fiscal policy and to the efforts made to carry out the requisite structural reforms, which are also the fruit of a greater degree of interdependence required of the Member States by the Eurozone.
Nonetheless, we need to ask some questions, the main one having already been raised in the report by Commissioner Almunia: how do Europeans perceive this favourable economic situation?
What are the benefits for individual citizens?
Unfortunately, over and above the official data, the tangible effects have still not really been recognised by the public.
We must note that the repeated requests for wage moderation, under certain conditions that have a solid basis from an economic point of view, are in fact far from the daily lives of individual citizens, and it is therefore clear that, at the moment, some Member States, including Italy, which is experiencing severe social tensions, are having real difficulties in channelling all additional revenue towards debt reduction.
I therefore believe that, while fulfilling the commitments made in the medium term, we must respond to a challenge: how can we make the rigid rules of the economy compatible with the demands of social justice?
Mr President, in taking the floor in this debate, I would like to raise two points.
Firstly, we should note with satisfaction that 2006 was unusually good for the Eurozone countries.
GDP increased by 2.7%, compared with 1.4% in 2005, unemployment stood at 7.6%, which was the lowest in fifteen years.
These results were achieved against an inflation rate that has remained at a steady 2.2% since 2005, and a reduced fiscal deficit.
It is puzzling, however, that these figures are consistently worse than the growth, unemployment, inflation and budget deficit figures in three countries outside the Eurozone, i.e. the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark.
They also fall behind the annual figures achieved by the US economy.
Secondly, both reports are full of figures, and we have concentrated on these.
However, it would seem that not everybody regards figures as having the greatest importance.
The newly-elected French president said in an interview that economic growth and full employment are so important that the heads of state should deal with them directly, and also that the excessive strength of the euro, brought about by the latest increases in interest rates by the European Central Bank, harms European exporters.
In addition to this diagnosis, the French president also wants to reduce taxation and increase the budget deficit in order to increase economic growth and reduce unemployment in the future.
I am nearly done. But I have not heard any words of criticism, either from the President of the Europe...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by saying to Mr Juncker that he should not take offence at the small number of us in this House.
I myself would have willingly stayed in my office to have the pleasure of seeing him close-up on my television screen.
The debating conditions in this room are rather difficult.
I should like, first and foremost, to express my emotion at seeing just how in line the Mitchell report is with the debates that the entire Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been holding for several years now.
For the first time we have a relatively unanimous report, which will enable us to reach agreements on points that used to divide us.
Firstly, there is the idea that structural reforms can be implemented and can increase the potential growth rate compared with that which we had in the 1990s, and that they may perhaps have already increased it.
Secondly, there is what is, in short, the explicit affirmation that the labour market reforms do not relate to an unconditional wage moderation, but rather, as Mr Juncker said, to a moderation qualified by means of proportionality with productivity growth and that this growth is being created by means of improved human capital, training and research, and not by means of a reduction in social guarantees.
The third major advance of Mr Mitchell's report is that the issue of paragraph 111 of the Treaty has at last been properly addressed.
It is the responsibility of the Council to set exchange-rate policy.
I would say to Mr Juncker that he should also listen to what Mr Gallois says about the competitiveness of Airbus.
One cannot say that there is one country in particular that has difficulty in adapting to the current exchange rates.
In paragraph 10 of the resolution by Mr Mitchell, we call on Mr Juncker to agree with Mr Almunia, and this should be welcomed.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Madam President, it is not governance that the Union needs, but political action on its economies in order to promote a form of growth that creates stable and, above all, well-paid, jobs.
The European Central Bank is harmful because its sole aim is to have the lowest inflation rate possible, when it should include structural policy elements such as growth, as the US Federal Reserve does.
Creating the euro without implementing, at the same time, a federal budget at the level of the Member States concerned has resulted in the demise of the instrument of devaluation, without any other protection methods having been provided.
The undervaluation of the dollar is, from this point of view, a weapon for the mass destruction of Europe's industrial capacities, and your self-satisfied speeches cannot disguise this reality of the exorbitant and unbearable cost of the overvaluation of the euro.
Europe's workers and citizens are paying a very high price for this mistake.
The Eurozone can no longer function in its current state; we must, as a matter of urgency, resort to a change in the statute of the European Central Bank and in the organisation itself of the euro.
We must, as a matter of urgency, have recourse to customs protections.
It is time to implement industrial policies that ensure that the vital interests of the people of Europe are protected and that enable jobs to be created and the common interests of European workers to be protected.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, economic growth is higher, unemployment is down, government deficits are falling a little, but concerns are now being expressed that this growth may be threatened by the strong foreign value of the euro.
While Mr Juncker does not share these concerns, Mr Sarkozy and others have been calling for active management of the exchange rate.
Mr Mitchell's report draws our attention to the rules that give Member States the responsibility for exchange rate policy, and calls on Eurozone finance ministers to coordinate their influence on the exchange rate with the European Central Bank.
The report then says that this action should not undermine the ECB's independence to use its interest rates to control inflation.
We do not seem to understand how it works.
The way to bring down the value of the euro is for the ECB to reduce interest rates.
But then it would have to abandon its inflation target.
In these days of free capital flows it is not possible simultaneously to control inflation and the exchange rate.
There is another way, of course, and that is to impose exchange controls.
Maybe this is really what they are thinking.
It would not be out of keeping with Mr Sarkozy's remarks about defending French protectionism and it would also be disastrous for the market economies of the Eurozone.
(SK) I would like to emphasise that variations in the rate of inflation are largely the result of structural factors, not unsound policies.
There has been a two-fold increase in salaries in the new Member States of the European Union and the share of energy- and raw materials-intensive output in these countries is greater than in the more developed states of the Eurozone.
At the same time, a major portion of the energy- and raw materials-intensive output is destined for the Eurozone.
Because of such reasons, the new Member States are more susceptible to fluctuations in prices of energy and raw materials; by the same token, they serve as a buffer, absorbing price impacts on the states of the Eurozone.
However, inflationary pressures in the new Member States may also result from high growth, rising productivity and catching up with the standards of more developed countries.
After all, this is one of the goals of EU membership.
I therefore support the demand to review the convergence criteria, notably with regard to inflation, so that they do not become instruments for creating new divisions in Europe.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Trichet, Mr Juncker, I should first like to congratulate Mr Rosati and, in particular, Mr Mitchell, on the quality of their reports.
I believe that, economically speaking, these are promising times for Europe.
Our objective is to increase production and economic activity.
This is being reflected in new employment opportunities, and with inflation kept under control.
The challenge right now is to consolidate this economic growth, a goal we will not achieve unless our institutional problems are resolved.
The issue in the reports is whether what we are witnessing is a cyclical recovery or a more substantial economic movement.
In this context, we do not have to resign ourselves to the idea that Europe has potential growth of 2%.
The Member States must from now on synchronise their growth rates.
In short, more jobs and more SMEs need to be created.
On this issue, the European Central Bank must also pursue the recommendations contained in Mr Mitchell's report, namely prudence when it comes to raising interest rates, because decisions that should rest with governments, decisions on reform and much more far-reaching decisions in the fight against protectionism should not be pre-empted.
The major problem we face in Europe is the rhetoric of protectionism, which goes against the spirit of European integration.
To sum up, this is a positive economic time, which, among other things, must be used to ensure that this growth continues and that European citizens are encouraged to identify the euro as one of their sources of well-being, prosperity and, most importantly, fresh job opportunities.
Madam President, I want to use my short speaking time to express, on behalf of the PSE Group, our full support for the Stability and Growth Pact - it is necessary to repeat that several times - and in particular for the reform of the pact.
We have made it more intelligent to take into account the economic cycle and developments.
This is something that has to be applied properly and not deliberately as is now the case.
Therefore, I appreciate what Mr Juncker and Mr Almunia have said, and it is good that we also express this on behalf of my political group.
I wish to draw attention to two specific issues and I should like to hear the reactions from the three of you, whom I am very happy to see together here for this debate.
One is the wage moderation issue.
We support the principle that wage moderation should remain within the productivity growth, and this has been the case for more than ten years.
However, it is now time to look at the rebalancing of the fruits of growth and, where we see that wages lag behind and are a smaller part of GDP, it is also time to look at rebalancing this.
I should like to hear some comments on this.
I know that Mr Juncker and Mr Almunia have also expressed them in this way.
I should like to invite the President of the ECB in particular to comment on this issue.
The other issue I want to raise is not only hedge funds but also paragraph 19 of the Mitchell report on corporate debt restructuring.
This is a major concern for financial stability, and I should also like to ask you how to assess this and how to deal with this issue.
(SV) I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for their constructive work.
The European Central Bank is doing a good job of fulfilling its tasks.
Even if the debate gets a bit heated sometimes, Mr Trichet always succeeds is calming people down with a use of language worthy of a diplomat.
The ECB has become significantly more open and more transparent than it has been, but Parliament' demands for minutes to be published remain.
That system works well for other central banks and would strengthen the ECB and increase its reputation.
We also again express our desire for a more open procedure for elections to the Executive Board of the ECB.
It is extremely important to safeguard the ECB's independence and to support the goal of price stability.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe gives the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet and Jean-Claude Juncker its full support where this crucial issue is concerned.
We know that a firm stability policy is a basic condition for a growing Europe.
Unfortunately, there are quite a few of us who are concerned that the strident tones of the French presidential election campaign will now continue.
Monday's meeting in Brussels does nothing to reduce this concern.
That concern is also present in the committee, even if Mr Juncker is trying to reassure us, and it can be heard in the wide-ranging debate in this House today.
There are wordings in the report that could be taken as a pretext for calling the into question independence of the ECB and allowing it to interfere politically to a greater extent.
Those are developments that we reject.
I would point to the wording of paragraph 10 which, in turn, refers specifically, as did Mr Hamon, to Article 111 of the Treaty.
It would be extremely unfortunate if our report could in any respect be seen as calling the ECB into question.
- (PL) Madam President, the good macroeconomic results in the Eurozone countries confirm the huge impact economic and monetary union has on the results, which was in fact the aim of introducing a common currency in the European Union.
Higher levels of integration in various areas make it possible to increase development and progress.
However, the problems with the European Constitution, voting, and the strength of certain Member States, are currently preventing further integration.
The two-speed Europe predicted by President Prodi has unfortunately become a reality.
It is also evident in the introduction of the euro in Member States.
Introducing the euro in one, or even two, states over a three-year period cannot be regarded as a resounding success.
We must reinforce and accelerate these activities, as they will allow faster development and further integration.
Let us seize this opportunity.
In conclusion, let me extend my heartfelt congratulations to both rapporteurs.
(SV) Not quite four years have gone by since Sweden held a referendum on the euro and, by a very large majority, rejected introducing the euro as a currency.
There were, and are, many arguments against becoming a part of the Eurozone.
For one thing, it is a very unstable political project; for another, it is extremely problematic for a country not to be able to control its own interest rates in order to respond to trade cycles.
These fears have proved to be justified, and we now see how all this is affecting countries that have exchanged their currencies for the euro.
Has Sweden lost out by keeping the krona?
Recent studies show that trade has been affected, but to a negligible degree.
What Sweden has gained by not introducing the euro is much more valuable.
We are quite differently placed to control our development because interest rates can be adapted to prevailing conditions in Sweden without the Bank of Sweden needing to take account of the trade outlook in other countries.
I therefore think that, contrary to what Commissioner Almunia has said in this House, the Swedish 'no' vote must be respected and that Sweden too should be given a formal exemption from having to join the Eurozone, just as Denmark and the United Kingdom have.
Anything else would be extremely undemocratic.
(HU) I am glad this debate is taking place now, so that in relation to some commonalities between the two topics, I may call attention to some consequences for enlargement.
In the first place, I am pleased that not only representatives from candidate countries for the Eurozone and the rapporteur, but also my German fellow Member, Mr Schwab, noticed the problem that the understanding of the reference country with regard to the inflation criterion for admission to the Eurozone - that is, all Member States - is different to the one we use in setting the ECB target, which implicitly applies to the 13 Member States.
In spite of Mr Almunia's letter sent to us yesterday in reply, Parliament must continue to insist that the reform Treaty should contain a correction that follows logically from the creation of the Eurozone.
Besides, is this not a double standard, not having measures against excessive inflation for Member States of the Eurozone but setting up more stringent anti-inflationary expectations for those who want to join?
I would like to point out that, while the reference benchmark for the euro is based on 27 Member States, in the ECB board of directors the same definition applies only to 13 States, since I am not aware of any role played in that body by citizens of States outside the Eurozone.
Thus, I see a double meaning of the Treaty expression "European Union's Member Statesâ.
We hear a great deal of rhetoric about solidarity, but this is not apparent with regard to the use of euro banknotes.
As a matter of fact, the smallest denomination, the 5 euro note, will be worth many times the value of the smallest banknotes of new Member States' national currencies, forcing the residents of the latter to run around with bagfuls of coins on the streets.
At the same time, we have the largest, the 500 euro bill, which will often be worth half a year's pension in those countries.
But I myself have been unable to use this bill for weeks, even here in Strasbourg or in Brussels, to pay for anything.
If anyone could change it, I would be much obliged.
What then could one do with it in Riga?
May I add that Mr Rosati made a very thoughtful remark about extending the four fundamental freedoms to the internal market.
But I have a question in this regard as well: how is it possible that those participating in monetary integration today can block the free movement of manpower, fearful of Slovakian labour dumping?
How is it possible that EU regulations indirectly exclude labour-intensive activity from the provision of services?
Thank you, Madam President, and I hope the expansion of the Eurozone towards the East, towards the former Soviet sphere of influence, will also begin shortly.
(FR) Madam President, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, Mr Almunia, I believe that this is a good week for the euro.
Firstly, because this is the first time that this macro-economic dialogue on the Eurozone has been held here, in the European Parliament.
I hope that this is the start of a good routine; the euro has visibility in Parliament in this debate, and I welcome that.
And then, this is also the week that a newly elected President of the Republic felt that he himself ought to justify within Eurogroup what he was going to propose to his country.
It seems to me that, a few years ago, that would not have happened in this country in which it was felt that budgetary strategy came under national sovereignty.
The collective debate on what the management of the euro consists of has moved on, and I welcome that.
You have requested the right to judge the effectiveness of the EUR 13 billion in tax gifts that have been proposed, and I can only back your proposal.
However, as far as the future is concerned, I should like to invite you to go even further.
Firstly, because I believe that making use of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact does not make it possible to implement that which we need, that is to say, ex-ante coordination in order to organise future strategic investment in a coordinated way and to anticipate, together, the effects of the structural reforms, because what happens in a country in terms of structural reforms has an impact on all the other countries.
And then, I should like to invite you to open the debate on the issue of the exchange rate.
This is an issue that Article 111 of the Treaty permits you to address, including at Council level.
It must also be considered as an issue of common interest, as Article 99 of the Treaty calls on you to consider it.
(CS) Madam President, the introduction of the single currency was supposed to create a single internal market.
The European Union, however, is today in thrall to the concept of rigid political integration and the creation of an over-regulated superstate, rather than creating the economic freedoms which in 1957 helped form the foundations of the common market and which remain unfulfilled to this day.
The failure to adopt the original Bolkestein Directive, the existence of obstacles to the free transfer of production to more efficient areas of the Union, and restrictions on the free movement of labour from the new Member States, as well as other protectionist and regulatory restrictions on the freedom of the common market are turning the euro into an artificial currency.
As a result, we have a single currency in a non-single market.
A typical example of this is that there is on the one hand the brutal forcing through of concessions in the Stability Pact, which some of the large EU states decided they could not do without, and on the other hand the new Member States have nonsensical and long out-dated conditions imposed on them for entry to the Eurozone, which do not take due account of necessary inflation levels and other indicators that are no more than peripheral and incidental manifestations of very dynamic economies that are growing at a faster rate than the EU average.
The narrow-mindedness of the Eurozone and the failure to fulfil economic freedoms in an unfair and non-single market are turning the euro into an unsafe and half-hearted currency.
Madam President, please allow me to make a technical remark.
On the panel above you and on the display, my name has regularly been incorrectly displayed for several months now.
The 'Ãœ' at the end of my name is missing.
Please take note of this.
(DE) Madam President, I welcome the three-leaved euro clover too.
The euro has been a success: the euro is the EU's best response to global challenges.
The euro and the four freedoms are the cornerstones of a strong internal market.
To my mind, the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact are the greatest regulatory principles to have been achieved by the European Union.
From 1 January 2008, the Euro Group will have an absolute majority among the EU members.
That is good news, and we would like to extend a warm welcome to Malta and Cyprus.
I am struck by the fact that we are getting excited because a Head of Government has promised to do their homework.
Homework has to be done.
We need to respect the rules, rather than interpreting them in a protectionist manner.
We are glad that there are economic benefits, and we call for those benefits to be used to reduce trade deficits and public debt, whilst at the same time allowing the workers to share in the benefits.
We are not questioning the European Central Bank's independence.
The Bank stands guarantor for the euro's good performance.
But an independent ECB and unified external relations for the Eurozone are not mutually exclusive.
A single voice for the Eurozone in external relations has nothing to do with the fact that these three gentlemen influence foreign exchange rates.
The foreign exchange rate is determined by the market, and the European Central Bank decides interest rates.
I want to make that clear to the left.
Nowadays we all sing the praises of the euro and the economic data, but we have forgotten that the euro should also be seen and presented as beneficial for Europe's citizens.
Let us emphasise how much we are saving in exchange rate costs.
Let us emphasise the euro's effect on stability in the Eurozone and the internal market.
Let us not forget that we are currently doing better than the dollar: that is a real sign of success.
When we introduced the euro, that is what citizens wanted.
(FR) Madam President, I feel as though I am taking part in a debate of deceptions: the deception of our guests, who are faced with an empty Chamber, and deception on the right, where Members are getting worked up about the ECB's losing its independence, when the European Central Bank is and will remain independent.
France changed its Constitution so that the ECB could be independent.
For the statute of the ECB to be changed, it would take an agreement among 27 governments and 28 parliaments, including ours.
That is a mission impossible!
Furthermore, the ECB is doing some rather good work; the euro is the second currency of the international reserve and, since 2000, it has appreciated by some 25% against the dollar.
It costs us less to buy raw materials, petrol and gas.
Inflation is lower in the Eurozone than in the United States and the United Kingdom.
If I have one criticism to make about the ECB, it is that it is too obsessed with combating inflation.
Inflation is harmful, especially for the economically weak, but, as inflationary pressure is currently limited, the Bank could do more to support EU economic policy.
The purchasing power of many Europeans has decreased, which is not stopping the ECB from advocating wage moderation.
I hope that Mr Trichet will also recommend moderation to President Sarkozy, who is renouncing the commitments made by France in order to give tax gifts to the rich.
The final deception is this: what is the point of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights if it is not applied throughout the Union?
How can the European Court of Justice apply this Charter when it will not be applied in the United Kingdom?
This final question is obviously addressed to the great European that is my fellow countryman, Mr Juncker.
(FR) Madam President, Mr Juncker, Mr Trichet, ladies and gentlemen, it is neither paradoxical nor contradictory to endorse the conclusions of the excellent reports that have been submitted to us and to support the courageous and determined action of the French Government to carry out the necessary reforms and to promote growth.
It is neither paradoxical nor contradictory because France has made a comeback in Europe.
By solemnly declaring his commitment to European integration, the President of the French Republic has made a powerful contribution to reviving Europe and to breaking the deadlock that it was in.
The agreement that was reached during the Brussels Summit, thanks to the efforts of Chancellor Merkel, is the first practical example of this.
One of the aims is to improve the way in which the Eurozone operates.
The Stability and Growth Pact, which since 1999 has provided a framework for the budgets of the Eurozone countries and which defines the budgetary discipline that the Member States must apply in order to prevent any excessive deficits from emerging, must be applied systematically, because it helps to establish monetary stability.
Quite clearly, France, despite what may have been said, is not calling into question the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, which remain fundamental.
However, we need to adhere to its criteria without losing sight of the objective of growth.
It must be applied intelligently and dynamically.
It is in this spirit that the President of the French Republic was anxious to provide the necessary explanations regarding the ambitious structural reform programme that he is going to implement.
The fruitful dialogue that has begun has made it possible to clarify the positions.
Mr Sarkozy has confirmed his commitment to do everything possible to meet the objective in 2010, if the boost to growth that he expects from these measures produces the results that he anticipates in terms of tax revenue.
France has already committed itself to bringing its government deficit down to 2.4% as from 2007.
There will be no let up in the efforts to consolidate the budget in order to reduce the public debt.
I am among those who believe that Eurogroup's role must be strengthened.
Equipped with a stable and high-quality president, it must pursue its quest for consistent and coordinated national economic policies.
Finally, in this way, with respect shown for the independence of the European Central Bank, Eurogroup will be able usefully to counterbalance the implementation of growth- and employment-oriented economic policy.
(SK) Last week I attended talks at the Ministry of Finance in Dublin.
The Irish economy has been growing at the remarkable rate of 6% on average over the last 10 years.
Per capita GDP is 40% above the EU average.
Unemployment is at 4.2%, and the Irish will clearly manage to attain the Lisbon Strategy goal as regards unemployment.
Their concern, however, is that inflation will reach 5% this year.
Had Ireland not already been part of the Eurozone, it would not have been able to join today under the current regulations.
In this context I would like to recall that in fast growing economies structural inflation is higher.
Such a situation is part and parcel of the monetary union.
Inflation is a part of the process, particularly for the new Member States that are seeking to catch up with the more developed countries.
The Council and Commission should therefore develop a new analysis and review the convergence criteria.
It is essential to continue with political discussions concerning the application of these criteria to the future members of the Eurozone.
President of Eurogroup. (FR) Madam President, I am taking the floor at the end of the debate in order to make a few remarks further to what was said, or not said.
I shall begin by mentioning wage policy, since this is a subject that I am dealing with and that concerns me.
I remain convinced that, if the current policies are pursued, that is, the policies that consist in further widening the gap that exists between those who work and those who say that they provide work, we are heading for disaster.
Europeans, especially simple and modest Europeans, who are no less intelligent than the others, do not understand this gap that is getting bigger every day between those who have and those who aspire to have.
(Applause)
I believe that several us of have said this, including the President of the European Central Bank, who recently opposed these ever-widening gaps.
I believe that we must stick with the principle of wage moderation.
I believe that wage moderation can be explained simply: so long as wages evolve in line with advances in productivity, wage moderation will result in neither a loss of competitiveness nor surplus inflation.
If, on the other hand, wages were to deviate from the path mapped out for them by a development in productivity, we could - and certainly would - have a problem.
I believe that we need to look into a modern way of allowing as many people as possible to share in the fruits of growth.
Not everything depends on nominal wage increases.
We must look into the possible forms of worker participation; we must look into forms of profit-sharing; we must look into other forms of employee training that could enable as many people as possible to share in the fruits of economic growth, which, I might add, should not be vilified or criticised in principle, as it tends to be by some quarters. Rather, it must be perceived as an instrument enabling the Eurozone and the European Union to increase their rate of participation on the labour markets and, by extension, to reduce their unemployment rate in relation to what we are experiencing at present.
We want growth because we want jobs; we do not want growth to be an objective in itself.
As regards the free movement of workers within the Eurozone, I will say - together, I might add, with the President of the European Central Bank, which goes to show you just how completely aligned our positions are - that, yes, there is a contradiction between the fact of being part of the same monetary area and of not sharing fully in the four freedoms.
I therefore agree with those who say that Slovenian workers, for example, should be able to move freely within the Eurozone.
However, you will not find, either in the Treaty, or in the accession arrangements, provisions enabling us to say that, yes, Slovenian workers must be able to move within the territory of the 12 members of the Eurozone but not within the territory of the others, any more than you will find provisions enabling us to say that, no, Czech workers, Slovakian workers and Polish workers cannot move, only those who are members of the Eurozone are permitted to do so.
I did not write all the passages of the Treaty, or even the smallest part of it, but you will not escape the cumbersomeness that at times characterises all of these texts.
It follows, then, that this is a debate that we must have, but we need to realise that we cannot resolve the issue at the level of the Eurozone alone; we really must resolve it at the level of the European Union as a whole.
Much has been said about the person whom I called 'our evening visitor', last Monday in the Eurogroup.
This is, moreover, Mr Hamon, an expression that I have taken from a period in the history of the ElysÃ©e Palace that does not entirely correspond to that of today, since others, before the President of the Eurogroup, used to be in the habit of receiving evening visitors.
This was more a phenomenon of the 1980s, in France.
In Europe, this phenomenon is rather new, and we will see whether this is the start of a great tradition or whether it will amount to the epiphenomenon that was.
That being said, I should like briefly to point out some commitments made by France.
Firstly, France has not put an end to budget consolidation, France has not started to put its financial consolidation effort on hold.
Secondly, the 2008 deficit ...
(Addressing Mr Goebbels, who had heckled him)
...
Yes indeed, Mr Goebbels, we shall see.
I am not responsible for French budgetary policy, so we shall see ...
Finally, I should like to say to you, my dear friend, Mr Goebbels, that, if France's public finances were in the same health as the finances of the country for which I am responsible, we would not be having this debate, and we would not have had our visitor on Monday evening.
(Laughter)
That being said, France is fully committed; France will do everything it can to meet the objective in 2010, just as we all made a commitment to do in April this year.
France is not the only country to have problems in meeting the objective by the deadline set.
We will be as strict and tenacious in analysing the results of the other countries, which may not perhaps manage, under the conditions set, to meet the objective at the desired time, but Eurogroup expects all the Member States of Eurogroup to meet their medium-term objective in 2010, at the latest.
As for France, it will submit an updated stability programme to us in September so that, together, the Commission and Eurogroup can see whether the structural reforms begun by the French Government will be likely to lead to the desired result, that is to say, the return of buoyant French growth and the guarantee of the viability of French public finances in the longer term.
I am quoting the Stability and Growth Pact in its amended version.
With regard to the enlargement of the zone, and independently of the debate that we could have on the accession criteria, I should like to repeat before Parliament that, of course, the Eurozone and the Eurogroup are neither a zone nor an exclusive club.
All Member States that meet the accession criteria not only can join the Eurozone, but must join it.
No member of the Eurozone, State or politician can turn down a request to join the Eurozone.
On this point, the Treaties are crystal-clear.
We can of course, and will no doubt, discuss this, but we must discuss it in depth, and not avoid the fundamental questions, such as: should we base the criteria more on a nominal reading, as the Treaties call on us to do, or should we think instead about real convergence?
I have already guarded the new Member States - an expression that I still detest - against the notion of real convergence.
The Member States, those that are referred to as the new Member States, in fact have nothing to gain by our having recourse to analyses that are based more on real convergence than on a nominal reading, but this is a debate that we can have over the next few months.
I did not understand very well the question that my friend, Mr Goebbels, put to me at the end of his speech, when he questioned me about the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Europe.
I do not really see the connection with the debate that we are currently having, unless it is to suggest that there is no more reason for the United Kingdom to request an opt-out concerning the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and that there is no reason for it to persist in wanting to opt-out at any price on monetary matters.
I am, moreover, of the opinion that the United Kingdom will one day apply the declaration of fundamental rights on its territory - because the time will come when it wants it, for one cannot forever defy common sense - before applying the single currency there.
The virtuous union of the declaration of fundamental rights and that of the Council of Europe, which relates to the same subject, will therefore create a solution that, by combining these two sources of law, will enable the European Court of Justice to ensure that, on this point as on others, praetorian law will have demonstrated that it is sometimes ahead of the reality that is shaped by those who want more Europe and those who, unfortunately, want less.
The great contribution that the European Parliament makes to our debates is, as a general rule, to find itself on the side of those who want more Europe.
We have nothing to gain from wanting less Europe each day or from selling off the Europe that we have in sections that we make available to those who would like to dismantle a project that has not stopped expanding or impressing the world ever since we started work on it.
(Applause)
ECB Chairman. Madam President, I have five points to make in response to the question.
First of all, I should like to say again that the reports by Mr Rosati and Mr Mitchell were very impressive and full of very important ideas and recommendations.
First, on Mr Schwab's remarks: it is clear that there is a question of institutional philosophy.
There are 13 exemplary political democracies in the euro area, and next January there will be 15.
In the future, there may be 25 or even more.
It is inconceivable that changes would occur three or four times a year because of changes brought about by the normal functioning of our democracy.
Clearly, commitments made within the Eurogroup are either kept or they are not.
If they are not kept, then it is impossible to have a Eurogroup which has authority - which, I am sure, is the wish and the will of all the countries concerned.
My second point concerns jobs.
Figures are figures.
I regularly hear that the euro is not designed to create jobs, that we have a problem with growth and jobs and so forth. The euro was created on the basis of a philosophy that is shared the world over: that price stability, and credibility in ensuring price stability, are prerequisites for sustainable growth and job creation.
That is the decision that Europeans have taken, but they are in good company, because it is a consensus.
What are the figures?
More than 12 million jobs have been created since the euro was set up - more than 12 million; two million, as the rapporteur said very eloquently a moment ago, were created in 2006.
Since the euro was launched, we have created more jobs even than the US.
We have the lowest unemployment rate for 25 years.
We are not satisfied, and we are right not to be satisfied, because we have to do much better.
However, let it not be said that the euro is playing against job creation - it is not true, and we can prove it.
As regards the obsession we might have with price stability, I have already said that price stability is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and sustainable job creation.
Let me also say that this sentiment is fully shared by our fellow citizens.
All the surveys show that they are fully in favour, by an incredible margin, of price stability, and that they are not necessarily fully satisfied with the present situation; they are encouraging us to be as credible as possible.
If, today, we have a 50-year rate of 4.67% and a 30-year rate of 4.65% (the 50-year rate applies to France, where bonds are issued for 50 years, and the 30-year rate to Germany), these figures are still much lower than the 10-year rate in the United States.
Why are they so low?
Because we are credible - on ensuring price stability over 30 years and, even, over 50 years.
That is the contribution our credibility makes in Europe.
Let me mention the exchange issue, which is very important.
Firstly, the rules are clear - they are set out in the Treaty.
They are exactly the same as the rules in operation in Germany since the foundation of the Bundesbank after the Second World War.
They are exactly the same as those used under the French system introduced in January 1994, when the Banque de France became independent, as called for by the Treaty of Maastricht and agreed unanimously by the French Left and Right, who decided, as Mr Goebbels said, to change the Constitution of the Fifth Republic to make the central bank independent.
So, the rules are clear.
They are the same as in a number of countries.
In practice, as has been said here very eloquently by an honourable Member, this means that we are in a floating exchange rate system, and we have a forum to discuss those matters: the G7.
To my knowledge, Jean-Claude Juncker and I signed the G7 statement, together with our US partners - the Federal Reserve as well as the Secretary of the Treasury - with our Japanese partners and with our other partners, the UK and Canada.
