It is a long time since Europe was the sole and exclusive partner for financial and political support.
Other countries are beginning to exert their own influence in and on Africa in a very emphatic way: look at China, for example.
We can no longer take our relationship with Africa for granted.
Madam President, the report highlights three priority policy areas: peace and security, good governance, and economic growth and investment in people.
As far as European policy areas are concerned, the report draws attention to the importance of greater coherence between development activities on the one hand and other policy areas on the other hand, such as trade, agriculture and migration.
Only if Europe can make more coherent, better coordinated use of its support and improve its financial accounting can the development policy of the European Union become more effective and more efficient.
Peace and security are a grave problem in Africa.
The report emphasises the importance of an integrated approach to tackling conflict situations.
The top priority in this area should be our responsibility to protect people and to make a contribution to preventing and resolving conflicts, as well as reconstruction.
Obviously good governance, a functioning rule of law and stable democracy are conditions for stability and development.
Capacity building in these areas is vitally important.
We support the Commission's ambitions in this area.
Madam President, the second EU-Africa Summit is to take place in Lisbon in December after a gap of seven years.
The Joint EU-Africa Strategy and the Action Plan will be decided on there.
There is a great deal at stake and it is in all our interests that this summit is a success.
Moreover, although the situation in Zimbabwe is a cause for very grave concern, we should remember that this is an EU-Africa summit and not an EU-Zimbabwe summit, that it is about a people-centred approach and not a president-centred partnership.
It is good that the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament will get the opportunity at the summit to articulate the parliamentary view on the joint strategy.
The delegations from the Pan-African Parliament and our Parliament met last week to prepare a joint declaration.
I hope that our Presidents will be able to present this to the heads of government at the summit.
Madam President, of course there is a great deal more to say on this but my time is up, I see, and so I will leave it at that, but not without first thanking my colleagues and the Commission for a very fruitful cooperation.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur, Europe, Africa and the world have changed a great deal in the last decade.
Europe is now a block of 27 Member States bringing together at times extremely diverse foreign policy priorities and approaches.
Although it is not fair to say that the African continent has been neglected, given the volume of public development aid that Europe makes available to this continent, we can, however, talk about a strategic vacuum in the relationship between Europe and Africa.
In recent years the negative consequences of this vacuum have become more apparent.
The European Union and Member States now recognise the need to bring relations with Africa onto a new level, with the second EU-Africa Summit being the right moment to clearly vocalise this desire.
There are various reasons justifying this new recognition of the importance of relations between the European Union and Africa: the widespread realisation that all the global challenges such as peace and security or international trade require concerted action on the part of the international community, thus justifying the emergence of new forms of cooperation; the search for answers to problems affecting both Europe and Africa, particularly the effects of climate change; the management of energy resources or migration flows; the desire of Africa to collectively tackle common problems, and the need to adapt to specific geopolitical changes in the international context.
This new relationship between the EU and Africa is set out in the documents that we hope will be adopted during the December summit: the Joint EU-Africa Strategy, its First Action Plan and, we hope, the Lisbon Declaration.
These documents reflect the specific nature of the relationship between Europe and Africa.
They set out an approach which, on the one hand, favours multilateral channels and, on the other, aims to deal with the various aspects of our relationship in a more integrated manner.
This approach constitutes the difference that the EU can point to, particularly in comparison with other international actors.
Africa's recognition as a strategic world partner is also reflected in the method used to prepare for both the summit and the documents to be adopted.
While the EU-Africa strategy adopted in 2005 is an EU document which is only binding on the Union, the new strategy - for the first time a joint strategy - and the action plan are the result of joint work with our African partners.
From the beginning the summit documents have been prepared by a joint group of experts and we hope that they will be endorsed at the EU-Africa Ministerial Troika Meeting to be held on 31 October, in a process that has also involved non-governmental actors and civil societies, both African and European.
The joint strategy and the first action plan are therefore the result of joint work.
As a result, their current wording reflects and responds to many of the concerns and suggestions contained in the report of Mrs Martens, a report which is clearly very complete and comprehensive.
The partnerships between the European Union and Africa identified both in the joint strategy and in the draft action plan must cover subjects of common interest.
Their fundamental criteria must be to add value to the cooperation and political dialogue that currently exist and, in our view, to ensure a positive impact on the everyday lives of European and African citizens.
The partnerships that we want to build will also seek to ensure a balance between the commitments made by both parties, which will alter the unilateral and assistance-based logic of the relationship between the EU and the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries.
Experience has also shown that political commitments require implementation and monitoring mechanisms so that they translate into something more than just good intentions.
Between summits, in parallel with the regular meetings between the two Commissions and the Ministerial Troika, the possibility now exists of complementary sectoral ministerial meetings whenever appropriate.
However, a true change in the relationship between the EU and Africa can only come about if the process is also effectively taken on board by various other actors.
In this respect, we want to establish informal joint groups of experts for the implementation of each of the partnerships.
These will be open to participation by a large number of stakeholders: European and African parliaments, local authorities, European and African civil society, African sub-regional organisations, research institutes, specialised international organisations and institutes, and the private sector.
At the same time, cooperation and dialogue between the Pan-African Parliament and this House will be extended and these institutions will also act as channels for the implementation of the joint strategy and action plan.
Although such profound changes cannot occur instantly, we are at a crossroads for change in the relations between the two continents.
The challenge facing us is to take full advantage of this opportunity, by starting to implement this new strategic vision for EU-African dialogue.
It is with this goal in mind that we plan to hold, with confidence and an awareness that what we are doing must be done, the next EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate and thank Mrs Martens for her most excellent report, which raises various issues and offers a number of useful leads, and which certainly provides us with a source of inspiration as Parliament's contribution to what is in fact an extremely important subject, and one that calls for a new approach in the area of EU-Africa relations.
As you all know, 2007 will be a special year for the future of relations between Europe and Africa.
Five years after the report on the Lisbon Summit of 2003, and no less than seven years after the first Africa-Europe Summit that was held in Cairo in 2000, it seems to me that we urgently need to redefine this relationship on a new basis.
Africa has changed profoundly in recent years and has acquired a continental institutional architecture that resembles our own in many respects.
The new institution that is the African Union now needs to be strengthened and consolidated.
This institution has developed ambitious continental policies in key areas such as socio-economic development, peace and security, and indeed good governance too, and all these elements clearly deserve our support and recognition.
Africa has now undeniably taken on an international dimension.
Here I am thinking of the diverse nature of its relations with the international community, as mentioned by Mrs Martens, and I am thinking about the new role that China is playing, for example, and its influence on investment projects in that continent.
I am also thinking, of course, of the global challenges that Africa, like all the other world players, has to face, namely climate change, energy supply, reform of multilateral institutions, the risk of pandemics, emigration and so on, and it is evident that Africa must make itself heard, must bring its influence to bear and, above all, must assert its rights.
For after all, these global challenges that I have just listed are ours too.
All these challenges and issues are common to us both and, what is more, they serve to highlight the interdependence that exists between Europe and Africa.
For we share the same destiny.
A joint strategy of a more political nature may make a difference to Africa and indeed to Europe too, and it has to be said to the rest of the world.
The two continents therefore urgently need to establish a new framework and acquire a new set of instruments in order to place the EU-AU dialogue on a much higher level. The Joint EU-Africa Strategy that we have developed in recent months with our African partners should provide this framework.
However, this does not mean that we turn our backs on the traditional relationship of solidarity. Instead we need to take a qualitative leap that will usher EU-Africa relations into a new era, one that brings together two partners with equal rights and equal responsibilities.
These are the concerns that have been very well documented in the report and I can only support the significant new ideas that Parliament has put forward for monitoring and supporting the implementation of this strategy and the action plans that will follow from it.
In this regard I view the setting up of a joint EP/PAP (Pan-African Parliament) delegation as crucial for completing the institutional architecture that will have to be put in place.
To this I would add the regular meetings that will have to be held between the Presidents of these two institutions, together with the joint organisation of hearings and the preparation, also on a joint basis, of political reports detailing the progress that has been achieved.
All this will be essential to maintain the momentum of the process and to give it the political vigour that it will need to succeed.
We are aware that this approach also calls for solid and stable institutions to be set up by the African Union, bodies that will be capable of acting and interacting with our own.
It is clearly with this in mind that we shall continue to support the African Union as it transforms and strengthens its institutions.
As an early confirmation of this commitment I am pleased to be able to announce that the first action plan put forward by the Pan-African Parliament will be funded to the tune of EUR 275 000 from the institutional support programme, which is currently financed by the ninth European Development Fund.
This was one of the particular concerns that was expressed to me by Chairman Borrell.
I hope that this initial funding will allow the Pan-African Parliament to participate fully in the initiative you have taken towards organising a joint parliamentary event in advance of the Lisbon Summit in December, as the results of your work can then be presented to the heads of state at the summit.
Finally, as I have said on a number of occasions, the involvement and commitment of the civilian populations of our two continents and of the elected assemblies that represent them constitute an essential factor in the success of an effective process of dialogue and cooperation between Europe and Africa.
Perhaps we sometimes tend to forget, but we are speaking here about the common destiny of 1.5 billion human beings and it is they who are the most important actors in the partnership that we are now setting up.
Mrs Martens, I am completely in agreement with the need for coordination; this is why we proposed the code of conduct, which should provide for a better division of labour between the different donors, which means greater harmony.
I believe that we have been consistent in this regard because, as you know, in the tenth European Development Fund we have provided a special financial envelope for governance, which is one of the aspects, and clearly a very important one at that, of the political dialogue that we intend to establish with our African partners.
As far as the EPAs (Economic Partnership Agreements) are concerned, I have no doubt that I will have to respond to questions on this subject after your interventions.
I shall therefore save my reply for the interventions, so as not to say too much at the moment and therefore take up too much time.
My last reference is to something that the President-in-Office of the Council also highlighted: there is no denying the importance of the EU-Africa Summit.
It is now time to hold such an event because the momentum is there, and it is for a change in objectives.
In some respects it is for a change in the nature of the relations between our two continents.
We need to leave behind the traditional - we might even say banal - relationship, this fairly archaic partnership of beneficiary and donor, or donor and beneficiary, and move on to a much more political association involving two partners with equal rights and responsibilities.
In my view this is clearly much more important.
So that is it for now, and I am sure that I will be returning to some of these points when you have had the opportunity to put questions of a more specific nature to me.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which I represent as draftsman, is in favour of all these efforts.
It is concerned about Africa and it supports everything that has been said.
It only wants to know whether we are really bold enough for the task.
What we cannot write, although our report suggests it and indeed I am able to say it, is that when it comes to Africa there is a lot of politically correct and asphyxiating hypocrisy that has to be got rid of before we can really achieve our objectives.
As regards enabling Africa to develop by allowing its products access to our markets, it must be remembered that some forty African countries have nothing whatsoever to export.
This slogan is quite simply dishonest.
Not a single African country is self-sufficient in foodstuffs. They have to import to eat, while exports from here and from Brazil are killing off the local subsistence agriculture.
We have to help Africa to protect itself. This is the message that we have repeated in the report.
Of course corruption acts as a destructive blight on Africa.
Yet this problem is endemic in extremely poor countries.
We therefore need to start with the big fish and focus on them.
This means the usual well-known suspects, even if they are ministers, and those on our own side who engage in bribery.
Small-scale corruption will only disappear with economic development.
Let us not start accusing them of the very same things we were doing a few centuries ago, for our expansion and development too were based on corruption.
Finally, a dictatorship cannot become a democracy even with the help of trade and foreign aid.
However, it can become an enlightened despotism.
Putting an end to torture and abduction, allowing freedom of expression and establishing the independence of the courts and their control over the police all have to take priority over the pluralist elections that are organised simply to please the West, while all the time they are abducting people and murdering journalists and election candidates.
The conditions that we impose should take account of these factors.
There is still much to be said on this subject.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Martens has prepared an excellent report that was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Development.
For the first time ever Africa and Europe are slowly beginning to work in partnership and establish a common approach to the development of democracy, support for development and strengthening peace and security across the African continent.
I share the hope expressed by the representatives of the Council and the Commission that this report will prove a good source of inspiration in the run-up to the Lisbon EU-Africa Summit.
Many of the provisions in the report, and more especially their implementation, will be of crucial importance to the development of relations between Europe and Africa.
It will be difficult to make progress in our mutual relations without improving the consistency of various Union policies, such as the trade, development, environmental protection, agriculture and migration policies.
It is also important to honour the decisions and commitments made in the past.
In 2005 the Council of the European Union determined that at least 50% more resources for development aid would be allocated to African countries.
In my own country, Poland, development aid has increased significantly in recent years.
The difficulty is that last year barely 1.4% of all Polish bilateral aid was allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.
The fact that certain Member States have been slow to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement and the internal agreement regarding the 10th European Development Fund is also cause for concern.
As things stand at present, only half the Member States of the Union have ratified the Partnership Agreement with the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries due to enter into force on 1 January 2008.
If full ratification does not take place, it will be very difficult to carry forward the African programmes and the plans for supporting Africa will remain on the drawing board.
I therefore urge Members of this House to put pressure on their national parliaments and governments to ensure the revised Cotonou Agreement is ratified.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has always strongly supported the principle that those people directly affected should have control over development strategies, as this means that their priorities are really taken into account.
In this report we have therefore naturally emphasised that national parliaments and civil society need to be involved in the new EU-Africa strategy.
This involvement has to a large extent been missing from the preparations that are currently being made for this new strategy, which seeks to open up a new form of strategic partnership.
We urgently need to put this right.
In this context we very much welcome the initiative by the Portuguese Presidency to invite delegations from the European and Pan-African Parliaments to attend the December summit in Lisbon.
Let us hope that this is not just a symbolic gesture.
We have also insisted - and Mrs Martens mentioned this just now - that there must be real coherence between the different European policies.
This means that the measures adopted as part of our policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and immigration, for example, have to take special account of any repercussions there may be for development in the countries of the South and in Africa in particular.
We have also recalled that the European Union promised to do everything possible to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to take all necessary steps to eradicate poverty.
With this in mind we are insisting that the new EU-Africa strategy should clearly state its commitments and specify the concrete measures needed to ensure that they are honoured as far as Africa is concerned.
As regards the Economic Partnership Agreements our position is quite clear: we are in no way opposed, either ideologically or on any other basis, to the signing of agreements sanctioning the terms of a partnership that would be beneficial to Europeans and to the peoples of the ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) countries alike.
However, we will resolutely oppose any agreement that, once signed, puts the peoples of Africa, in particular, in a position that is less favourable than the one they know today.
This is the aim of the amendment that we have tabled.
Finally, I would like to point out that, as things stand at present, we still do not know the wording that is to be put forward at the next Lisbon Summit.
You informed us that the document in question was being drafted.
We shall therefore pay very close attention to the manner in which the recommendations we have made in our report are taken into account in the drafting of this document and shall naturally reserve the right to react accordingly as soon as the text is made known to us.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Maria Martens's report contains a number of interesting recommendations, though I have to admit that my Group has a bit of a problem with the rather negative undertone and the lack of a clear, coherent vision for the future in the report.
Seven years after the first summit in Cairo, the Portuguese Presidency together with the Commission is trying to draw up a new EU-Africa strategy in an - I really do think - honest attempt to divest themselves of the old model of donors and beneficiaries.
The fact that this summit is taking place is extremely important, and not only for negative reasons, not only out of an anxious reaction to the growing influence of China.
On the contrary, the growing realisation on both sides that Europe and Africa are no longer each other's exclusive preferential partners creates a unique opportunity to develop a totally new, more balanced relationship.
At first sight the water between Europe and Africa does not look all that deep.
It is essential for Africa that each new partnership should get away from the traditional aid dependency and the culture of charity and conditionality.
Calls for more industrialisation, more development of the private sector and more investment in the knowledge economy are getting louder and louder.
Awareness is also growing in Africa, fortunately, that people have to be responsible for solving their own problems in the first instance.
Europe should now make clear how it will support these promising developments, without falling into the trap of paternalism and interference.
Any future partnership between the EU and Africa will inevitably have to be based on the principle of mutual accountability.
In that sense, an unconditional abolition of agricultural subsidies could, more than any other gesture, strengthen the credibility of the EU among its African friends.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their intervention but also in particular our rapporteur, Ms Martens, for her work on this issue, because the reality is that we are dealing with a new partnership, a new arrangement between the European Union and Africa.
I congratulate the Council for coming forward with the EU-Africa Summit in December and I would hope that the summit will not rest on whether or not one single person attends that summit.
There is too much at stake with regard to the relationship between Europe and Africa to be determined by whether or not Robert Mugabe will be there.
We all know and criticise the actions of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe.
We all defend the rights of democratic institutions and democratic movements within Zimbabwe and we all call for the protection of those democratic rights, but that should not hinder the proper development and the proper work that must go on between the European Union and Africa as a whole.
The issues with regard to governance, the issues with regard to development aid and, in particular, the issues with regard to free trade are vitally important for future developments of Africa.
When we speak about development, the European Union is the largest donor of aid in the world.
Ireland, my own country, per capita is the sixth largest donor of aid in the world.
But that should not be about giving aid to get something back.
That should be about giving people the freedom to free themselves, to trade out of difficulties, to create education, health and infrastructure to ensure they will no longer rely on or be dependent on aid in the future.
There are issues with regard to China's involvement because China does not give the same credence to governance, lack of corruption, openness and transparency that Europe does.
We should take cognisance of the influence that China has in that developing world.
Thank you very much, Madam President, for your licence.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, in spite of stated intentions we cannot really say that any new elements have been introduced to the debates that have been taking place in recent months on the partnership between the European Union and Africa.
Of course peace and the rule of law must be absolute priorities; the EU is now playing an increasing role in this respect and this is only to be welcomed.
We also have to ensure that the support provided for the organisation of elections, for example, is subjected to real care and scrutiny so that the communities concerned see the practical benefits that democracy can bring to their everyday lives.
As far as the other measures are concerned I would say that all in all the European Union's proposals are fairly typical, lying somewhere between promoting good governance and free trade, with the accent on economic development and the provision of health care.
However, while there are burning issues to be dealt with, these EU-Africa strategies, in our opinion, fail to deal with two key problems.
Firstly there is food security, which has to be seen in the context of rising prices for basic foodstuffs, especially cereals, and the upsurge in biofuels, along with the need to protect and develop agriculture, although the next European Development Fund - like most of the governments in Africa - has only allocated a small percentage of its budget to this objective.
Even the World Bank recently stressed that a rethink was needed in this area, and that is saying something.
The question of food provision has now become absolutely crucial, as has the future of small farmers who are all too often neglected by development aid policies.
The second key aspect is that Africa, as you know, is an immense reservoir of natural resources that the African people, unfortunately, are unable to profit from, even though the price of these commodities has risen enormously.
All the major economic powers, along with emerging nations like China, are rushing to get their hands on these resources which are becoming increasingly rare.
This latter-day gold rush, this hunger for materials, is now having extremely brutal social and environmental repercussions and is continuing to fuel wars and corruption.
In the light of all this the European Union is talking in theoretical, even angelic tones, while all the time it too is engaged in exploiting Africa's natural resources.
How then do we rationalise, manage and share access to these reserves in such a way that the communities concerned really derive benefit from them without seeing their environment vandalised?
This is a major question and one that the EU-Africa strategy needs to take more seriously, for it will be imposed on us in any case, given the speed of events in this sector.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mrs Martens, especially for the way in which we were able to work together in committee, for her attentiveness and also for the divergences that emerged, the differences between us; but I think the outcome, apart from a few points, is a very significant one.
EU-Africa relations have come a long way since the Cairo Declaration of 2000.
Much has changed in Africa, a continent that is full of diversity and wracked by war.
Progress has been made with the formation of the African Union, the policy of unity in diversity.
The Pan-African Parliament has adopted the motto 'one Africa, one voice'.
Social movements in Africa are vibrant and calling for what Mr Ãger was referring to just now.
They are vibrant and forming themselves into networks, and they had a very high profile at the Nairobi Social Forum.
There has also been real progress in the formulation not of a European policy on Africa but a joint African and European policy of partnership.
The meetings between the Pan-African Parliament and the European Parliament, and their presence at the Lisbon Summit, are putting into practice what we said in the document was lacking, namely the role of this House.
We are not only demanding a role but also to perform it in practice, and I think the assistance from Louis Michel has been extremely important, obviously in addition to that of the Portuguese Presidency.
Nonetheless, our differences of opinion are clear.
The various aspects of the strategy are important, but we must carry them forward with coherent policies, and I am referring here to arms sales and trade.
We must therefore proceed along this road, in the knowledge that the road is strewn with obstacles.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, education is the bridge from misery to hope.
It is a tool for daily life in modern society.
It is the bulwark against poverty and the building block of development.
Thus Kofi Annan described the strategy in the Millennium Goals, which are similar to those in the EU development strategy for Africa.
It places education alongside trade as key to the development of the continent.
Despite this, the EU is set to join wealthy nations like the USA, Australia, Canada and New Zealand in systematically exporting the skilled and educated from Africa and Asia.
Commissioner Frattini announced last month that, to ensure Europe will get 'the migrants its economy needs', over the next 20 years the EU would import 20 million skilled workers from these continents through the blue card system, similar to the American Green Card.
Though having a steady supply of skilled workers to fill in the gaps left by our ageing workforce will have benefits for us, this kind of braindraining will be devastating for the poor and underdeveloped countries of Africa.
Europe is also engaged in asset-stripping among Africa's poor.
Children are our countries' future, yet EU development funds are routinely tied to population control programmes aiming at eliminating future Africans.
The EU Green Paper on demography clearly states that, without population growth, there will be no economic growth.
Africa is now the only continent in the world with a birth rate above replacement.
If we keep our Millennium Goals and if we keep our promises, Africa will emerge in this century as a world leader.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Madam President, no one can deny that this report describes in great detail the many problems of the African continent, and the various challenges for the partnership between the European Union and Africa.
However, although I have the utmost confidence in the rapporteur's expertise in the field of development policy, I still think that this report fails to put sufficient emphasis on the fundamental cause of Africa's problems and does not come up with answers to some very basic challenges.
It may not be politically correct to say so but that is the way it is.
Contrary to what this report claims, Africa and the European Union do not currently share the same way of thinking about more democracy, good governance and human rights.
The main cause of the poverty, the hunger, the lack of security and the socio-economic problems plaguing the continent - and which are rightly listed in this report - is in fact the very bad and corrupt regimes which make no effort at all to observe good governance, democracy and human rights.
No one, for instance, disputes any more that Robert Mugabe is a criminal who has brought his country to its knees and who terrorises his own population.
What though do the developing countries of southern Africa have to say?
That the elections were conducted properly and that western countries should mind their own business.
I really do have my doubts about the promises made by these same leaders on good governance.
This report rightly looks at peace and security.
In Africa, with its innumerable undemocratic regimes, spending on weapons always far outstrips the massive amount of development aid that goes to those countries, according to Oxfam.
All of these problems come back, therefore, to the same cause.
Finally, I have to say that I do not agree with the section on immigration, because anyone who thinks that the concept of circular migration can put a stop to the brain drain from Africa and the pressure of immigration on Europe is, I fear, seriously deluding themselves as far as this is concerned.
(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur for her sound and comprehensive report.
There is a broad consensus on the general principles here in the House.
The EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon in December cannot come too soon.
I welcome the fact that we will be agreeing a joint strategy.
The European Parliament's position on the special case of Mr Mugabe has been known for years.
However, this gentleman must not become a stumbling block to a new chapter in European-African relations.
I believe there are enough European heads of government who have a clear and unequivocal message for that gentleman.
That is why he needs to be present and endure the message that will be delivered.
As Chairman of the delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament, may I express some specific parliamentary wishes for the future cooperation which we agreed last week in Midrand.
Africa's parliaments have tended to be neglected institutions.
They have an important constitutional role on paper but their own governments and, indeed, donors tend not to take them very seriously.
Yet with proper resources and after successful and comprehensive capacity-building for Members and staff in the parliamentary administrations, committees and groups, these parliaments have the potential to perform their true role of exercising proper political scrutiny of the executive.
The irresistible appeal of this scenario is also that we would thus have scrutinising bodies at local level with democratic legitimacy, and when problems arise, their criticisms would be more likely to be accepted than those of foreign donors.
I therefore urge the Commission to incorporate parliamentary capacity-building on a targeted basis into its country programmes, so that in a few years time, we can genuinely see that African politics have become much more responsive, in practice, to the public's needs, also thanks to the involvement of the national parliaments.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to compliment Mrs Martens on her work and acknowledge the political will of the EU and the African Union to build a joint strategy comprising numerous subjects of interest to both communities: from security to the environment, from migration to development and the promotion of human rights and democracy.
In order for this strategy to be truly effective, the EU must build this partnership as of now, properly involving civil society and local parliaments.
The EU must promote tangible, incisive action to safeguard human rights, freedom of expression and association and the principle of democracy, so that economic and social development on the African continent can be truly sustainable and involve all strata of African society.
Furthermore, I would echo other colleagues in calling for the strongest possible commitment from the EU to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, combating AIDS - which is decimating the working population - and elaborating European policies that are genuinely consistent with the spirit of development cooperation, above all in the context of international trade.
(LT) I would like to congratulate Mrs Martens on her report on the state of play of EU-Africa relations and for the proposed measures for improving these relations.
It is a shame that Africa is still the poorest continent of the world.
Despite the international aid granted by the EU and other countries, the poverty level has not been reduced; in fact it has increased.
The Millennium Goals still need to be achieved.
This is happening in Africa, the continent of the world richest in natural resources.
The main reason for this is because raw materials are exported at the lowest prices, while high prices are paid for finished products.
The situation could be transformed through the development of the processing industry, small- and medium-sized enterprises, the introduction of new work places and the encouragement of regional cooperation.
There is no doubt, as pointed out in the report and highlighted continuously by the European Parliament, that education remains one of the key factors in the development of Africa's independent economy.
On the subject of the future of Africa, I would like to mention the military conflicts that continue to plague certain areas, such as Sudan, for years on end.
On the one hand, this situation spells insecurity for both local and foreign investors.
On the other hand, some countries exploit the conflicts for the purpose of increasing the production of raw materials under advantageous conditions.
The EU and the international community should put more effort into resolving the military conflicts in Africa.
This would boost the efficiency of the implementation of the Development Cooperation Programme.
(DE) Madam President, a very important factor in African development policy is trade, and trade, if it is used properly, can of course help to reduce poverty and it can also help to improve health care in Africa.
It can help improve education and it can help eliminate illiteracy.
However, it cannot do so in the way the Commission sees it.
I am very pleased that - either because common sense has prevailed, or because pressure from the African countries has become so intense - since last Monday, the Commission is taking a different approach to the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs).
As a result, there are no more nonsensical demands for reciprocity in market liberalisation and no more insistence on the inclusion of the Singapore issues.
There is now an agreement that individual topics will be taken out so that now the talks will only focus on goods, with other issues being discussed at a later date.
If we were to pursue the same approach with the Doha Development Round, then perhaps we might achieve some success there as well, for this is why it has repeatedly failed until now.
That is why the WTO has failed and the Doha Development Round has failed, because the Commission always insists on sending out the same message.
It says, 'you need to understand that we only want the best for you, and if you do not grasp that, then we will not get an agreement'.
Fortunately, if we look at the report by this Parliament - which in this case was much cleverer than the Commission - that was drafted by my colleague Mr Sturdy back in 2006, it is clear that Commissioner Mandelson could have conceded much earlier on to the demands that he now has to bow to, and perhaps we would not have let things go this far.
You yourself appeared before us in committee and we asked you quite specifically about it.
What was your response?
You said that Commissioner Mandelson is doing a wonderful job!
Frankly, the Council also has a responsibility here, given that it will have to endorse the Partnership Agreement at the end of the process.
It could get involved in the negotiations once in a while, rather than simply saying, 'we'll let the Commissioner get on with it until he finally comes up with something'.
No, you have a responsibility and in my view, when it comes to the EPAs, you have not fulfilled this responsibility, at least judging by your statements to our committee.
Madam President, I am rather surprised to find myself agreeing with a colleague from the other side of the House so wholeheartedly.
I congratulate Ms Martens on her report.
There have been a lot of excellent words said in this Chamber this afternoon, but we have failed Africa.
We have failed Africa in the past and, as the rapporteur on EPAs, I hope that this European Union will not fail Africa again.
Yesterday the Commission published a communication on EPAs, which at long last acknowledged the impossibility of completing negotiations by the end of 2007, as was previously planned and reported in my report.
But the Commission continues to insist that Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries must commit to signing up fully to EPAs in 2008 and that some countries in the region should sign up to EPAs while others do not.
Is that not unbelievably farcical!
Too much is unclear and uncertain in these talks, with so little time left.
The communication is deliberately vague and, while I understand what it is, it worries me: I never sign up to a deal about something that I do not understand, and yet we are asking Africa to do precisely that.
Furthermore, these new proposals to create subregional agreements within regions with African countries which are willing to sign up would create a spaghetti-like mess of different agreements in neighbouring countries.
The idea that other countries and ACP regions should join later would mean them signing up to a deal they had not negotiated.
How is that a good idea?
Were EPAs not meant to be about regional integration?
So who is focusing on implementation, monitoring mechanisms and impact assessments while negotiating parties struggle to find an agreement on these smaller packages?
ACP countries should not have to choose between trade agreements which may damage their local/regional markets or barriers which cripple their export markets.
There is still a choice to be made, and last-minute policy shifts from the Commission do nothing to restore the confidence of the disconnected.
(ES) Madam President, Commissioners, Minister, this debate should move us further along the road to Lisbon and the summit, and we must thank the Portuguese Presidency for having focused its attentions on the relations between Europe and Africa.
We hope that it will help Europeans to understand, finally, that their destiny is inextricably linked to that of Africa, that we can understand that Africa's development is a condition for our prosperity and that we will not be able to control the migratory flows or have a secure energy supply without a strong partnership with Africa.
We must be clear that it is not to help the poor people, but in our own interest.
We must also be clear that the Africans sometimes listen to our declarations with little confidence and see them as rhetorical because we have not yet got beyond the colonial past to establish this solid partnership between equals that we all desire, that we announce, but that is still far from the reality.
The job of modernising Africa is a huge one.
The Africans have a great responsibility in this respect, but so do we.
Without us - without our help, without our cooperation - they will not get out of the situation described in the Martens report, because they need not just trade but also aid and equal relationships to enable them to move beyond their past, for which, clearly, we are partly responsible.
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
In December, the first summit for several years will take place between the African Union and the EU.
It is an important meeting for the EU, which has a great responsibility for supporting economic and democratic development in Africa.
The Portuguese Presidency deserves credit for this initiative.
The EU must become more active on the African continent.
What concerns me, unlike Brian Crowley, is that Zimbabwe's dictator Robert Mugabe will probably be attending the summit.
It is not worthy of the European Union to sit at the same negotiating table as Mugabe.
Mugabe's misrule and corruption are paralysing the entire country.
The political opposition are harassed and thrown into prison, free speech does not exist, there are food shortages in a country which was once Africa's granary, and hundreds of thousands of people have no homes.
The economy is falling to pieces, inflation is more than 7 000%, the average age is the lowest in the world, and 25% of the population are infected with HIV.
Madam President, Commissioner, Manuel Lobo Antunes, one way to show our disgust at Mugabe's dictatorial ways is for the EU not to accept his presence at the summit.
Mugabe's terrible rule must be ended.
Dictatorships need plain speaking, my friends.
Thank you.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Martens, for this important report.
On the one hand, it is a clear indication to the Commission that the parliamentary dimension must this time have a role in the drafting of the Joint EU-Africa Strategy.
The fact that the Commission ignored not just its opposite number, but also Parliament, when it was preparing the EU Strategy for Africa in 2005, has, unfortunately, been a common approach for the Commission.
On the other hand, the report, to its credit, raises a number of important questions of content which need an answer, and the matter of the strategy to adopt.
Firstly, history clearly shows that universal human rights require universal protection if they are to be realised.
For this reason it is vital that the priorities for peace and security in the EU's Africa strategy incorporate a view which recognises the concept of the responsibility to protect, and promotes it.
We have a responsibility to protect, and that must also be the subject of a debate within the EU.
Secondly, as the report laudably stresses, climate change must be a top priority in the strategy.
Water, its quality and sufficiency, will, with energy, become a serious political problem, and then Africa will be its very first victim.
I would nevertheless like to remind everyone that Africa's most serious environmental problems are for the present erosion and overgrazing.
Climate change obviously makes things worse.
Adaptation and support measures are needed.
Besides, for the EU Africa is a natural partner in international contexts in the fight against climate change.
Thirdly, I would like to stress the importance of small businesses and local entrepreneurship as a condition of sustainable and real economic development in Africa.
We should ensure that the action we take supports it.
Only the local population itself can get Africa on its feet.
(PT) I must congratulate Mrs Martens on this important report at a time when the EU is redefining its relationship with Africa, largely due to the emergence of China as a player in that continent.
However, the EU-Africa relationship can only move forward if the dual-aspect approach of development and security is coherent, particularly with regard to human rights, democracy and good governance.
Given the importance of the joint strategy and its associated action plan to be adopted at the EU-Africa Summit, I want to ask the Portuguese Presidency to duly inform the European Parliament about the progress made in the negotiation of these documents and their contents.
This will be useful for ensuring that the measures set out in the joint strategy and action plan subsequently become reality, with the support of the European Parliament and under the control of the various applicable financial instruments.
Here in this House we hope that the joint strategy and action plan will reflect the commitments made by the European Union, with due priority being given to the fight against poverty and to the Millennium Development Goals, particularly access to basic health care and education.
We want joint measures to be included on controlling trafficking in small arms and light weapons, which are the true weapons of mass destruction in Africa, and also measures for the empowerment of women and civil societies in whom lies the force for change, peace and development which Africa so desperately needs.
(CS) Europe used to have a bad conscience over Africa due to its past colonial policies.
Today we are trying to help the developing countries enter the globalised world.
That is why the spotlight, in relation to these countries, has shifted to global challenges.
Besides disease, starvation and drinking water shortages, these issues also include security, trade, migration, brain-drain and climate change.
Besides charity, our task is to oversee responsible decision-making based on democratic principles on the part of the African institutions.
In this light I regard Commissioner Mandelson's development strategy as hazardous as it focuses exclusively on trade relationships in the Pacific.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must insist that the Commission step up the capacity-building in the area of the human rights agenda.
Without it democracy in Africa or for that matter in any other place in the world does not stand a chance.
What troubles me is how deeply rooted the former communist block ideology is in Africa.
What is also worrying is the growing influence of the totalitarian Chinese market model, which mines African raw materials and takes work away from the African people.
I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Martens, on the comprehensive and balanced definition of the new strategy as set out in her excellent report.
We have to, however, also look to its financial framework and learn to read the outcomes from the appropriate indicators.
It also appears to me that the Commission does not sufficiently divulge to European citizens the importance of EU collaboration with its most immediate neighbour of Africa.
I hope that the December summit in Lisbon will adopt, based also on this report, a new vision of relations rooted in the human rights agenda.
I would like to conclude by saying that the summit will be fundamental for a shift in EU-African relations, therefore I do not approve of the fact that the Czech Republic and the UK intend to block this pan-African summit because of the participation of the dictator from Zimbabwe.
That said his presence ought to be categorically challenged and condemned.
(NL) Madam President, relations between the European Union and the African countries have become unacceptably strained due to the negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries about the Economic Partnership Agreements.
If these negotiations fail, then Cotonou will end in a black hole for a number of countries from 1 January because our trade relations will then become the far less favourable Generalised System of Preferences.
It would, however, be a disgrace if poor countries were to be penalised in this way, because they feel that the EU and the ACP countries are not equal partners at this moment.
We must give poor countries the right to protect their markets in sectors that are weak and which would keel over in the buffeting of free trade.
These negotiations stand in sharp contrast to the good principles and aims in Maria Martens's report and I share those aims.
We, as Socialists, wanted to add that the trade and agriculture policy of the EU should not be allowed to stand in the way of development policy.
We need coherence, and it goes without saying that the policy should still be aimed at emancipation and women's rights.
It is up to the Commission to develop this into a concrete policy.
After that the Commission will monitor development cooperation closely.
(PL) Despite the several billion euros allocated to Africa, poverty is getting worse in that continent, as the sound report prepared by Mrs Martens indicates.
I have not consulted with Mr Antunes, the representative of the Portuguese Presidency, or with Mr Van Hecke, but I wish to emphasise that cooperation with local African entities is a sine qua non for financial aid to be effective.
The economy needs assistance regarding the introduction of technology, awakening the spirit of entrepreneurship, encouraging citizens' commitment and supporting individual initiative.
Missionaries, for example, are engaged in such activities even though they do not have any funds, whereas the Union is not involved despite being able to count on substantial financial resources.
One of the main challenges is education, that is to say, investment in human capital, which brings great benefits.
Africa has also entered into certain commitments too, however.
These include halting the import of arms and introducing certain legal provisions, notably regarding the right of property, which is essential for the development of the economy.
I should like to conclude by saying that the role of governments must be understood as serving the people, and not benefiting from our aid as symbolised by the luxury cars used by representatives of African authorities.
(FR) Madam President, the Africa of today has two faces: first there is the one of extreme poverty and human tragedy, as in the case of Darfur and Somalia, and then there is the other face, which is all too often ignored, of a continent that in spite of everything is innovating, that is becoming more democratic, although too slowly, and that little by little is returning to the path of growth.
The new EU-Africa strategy therefore needs to take this dual reality into account and support this still fragile process by means of a genuine political partnership: one that is based on unity, for it is Africa in its entirety, through the voice of the African Union, that has to be our main point of contact; on equity with an agenda that has been drawn up together and not imposed by the North, and on humility, for Europe is not the one and only partner Africa has.
The EU must also support the process by using the Millennium Development Goals as a roadmap, by keeping to its promises and meeting the financial commitments made by the EU and by the Member States and, finally, by recognising the role played by the African parliaments.
The Martens report is in fact the message that we are sending today to the Commission and the Council, and we shall be in Lisbon in December to see if this message has actually got through.
(PT) Madam President, as stated in Mrs Martens's report with which I agree to a large extent, the fact that the current EU strategy for Africa was not established in partnership with the people of Africa is one obvious limitation on its potential.
This was a mistake that must and will be corrected in the next EU strategy which must reinforce the role of the African Union and be based on concepts of partnership and equality.
The issues causing concern that must be covered include peace, the problem of displaced persons and the fight against serious diseases such as AIDS and malaria.
Development must be our goal and trade one of its weapons.
To this end, we need to support small and medium-sized enterprises and promote equitable international trade.
However, we will only be successful in this strategy if we can help to reinforce democracy and human rights across the continent.
In reformulating and renewing the EU strategy for Africa, the new local and global circumstances must be taken into account.
The fact that we are talking today with an African Union is in itself significant.
On the other hand, the generalised increase in consumption of both oil and food implies a need to increase global production capacity and, in that regard, Africa is a continent rich in oil and gas, but also with enormous agricultural potential to be exploited.
Finally there is the issue of the summit.
There is no need to hold a summit in order to determine a strategy for Africa.
However, as the Portuguese Presidency has gone down this route, it would be wrong not to continue to the end, otherwise we will lose an opportunity to positively impact on the life of Africans.
The talks cannot only be about debt cancellation as greater wealth in the world can and must be, Madam President, an opportunity for greater wealth in Africa.
This wealth must benefit its people and not just its elite.
International cooperation cannot continue to be a problem for Africa, as someone else has said.
That is why we must improve this so that education, promotion of health, democratisation and development can be ensured.
(ES) Madam President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and say that I agree with Mr Michel about the creation of a new type of partnership and relations between Europe and Africa.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Lobo Antunes on the Portuguese Presidency's organisation of a Europe-Africa summit.
However, while that new type of relationship is being built, official development assistance continues to be, and will remain for some years, a very useful instrument in Europe's relations with Africa, and not just Europe as a whole but the Member States too.
We should promote healthy competition between the Member States in terms of improving the quantity and quality of development aid.
My country, Spain, has tripled its aid in this parliamentary term and compared with the previous government has increased its contributions from EUR 200 million in 2004 to an expected EUR 850 million in 2008.
Spain is now the second largest donor of development aid in the world and it is also the country on the Development Assistance Committee whose contribution has increased most in that time.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I must thank you for your comments, suggestions and even criticisms of what the Presidency is proposing in its plans for EU-Africa relations.
I have of course taken due note of all these suggestions, observations and criticisms.
I should like to make it very clear that what we are proposing in terms of a new relationship with Africa has two aspects that I would say are innovative, or at least we hope they are innovative or may prove to be so.
Firstly, we plan to establish an effective partnership with our African partners; this partnership must also prove to be effective in terms of ownership.
As I have already mentioned, the strategy that we are developing for Africa is not a unilateral strategy.
It is a joint strategy, in other words a strategy that is being drafted, analysed and debated together so that what results and what is proposed is actually what our African friends are hoping for and expecting from us and what we would also of course like to receive, in a positive sense, from our African partners.
On the other hand, we also want to increase the number of actors involved in this strategy so that it does not just involve governments as usual.
In addition to governments, we want other public institutions, parliaments, as I have already mentioned, and also broad sections of civil society, their representatives and actors to be involved.
The second aspect which in my view is extremely important is that we want to modernise the agenda between the European Union and Africa.
We want this to respond to the new global challenges, to take account of the profound changes that are occurring in the world and, in particular, to genuinely offer Africa the opportunity to become fully integrated within the new world order.
That is why we are going to discuss and debate with Africa such new and modern issues as the energy issue, the climate change issue, and issues linked to migration, mobility and employment, but obviously without forgetting those issues which continue to be fundamental in our traditional partnership, such as peace, security, democratic governance and human rights, and also issues linked to science and the information society.
I believe this agenda is comprehensive, ambitious and, as I have said, thoroughly modern.
We must modernise our agenda with Africa as this must be able to effectively respond to current needs.
I would also say that the Portuguese Presidency and Portugal have never hesitated to name dictators in Africa or in any other part of the world and consequently to denounce them and we will continue to do so whenever necessary.
Finally, I must also say a word of thanks for the work carried out jointly with the Commission in preparing everything for the second EU-Africa Summit.
We have received from the Commission and from the Commissioners with specific responsibility in these areas, namely trade, external action and humanitarian aid, very committed and high-quality support and we are sure that we are all working towards a common goal of making the difference in Africa and for Africa.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Council for having responded so fully to the interventions, and would add that I endorse the points that have been raised.
I too share many of the concerns that have been expressed.
The Commission is endeavouring to apply greater coherence to its overseas activities and, as a matter of fact, the nature of the dialogue between Europe and Africa should gradually allow us to eliminate some of the contradictions, including those highlighted by Mr Rocard.
It goes without saying that we sometimes pursue contradictory policies: you only have to think of the subsidies paid to agriculture.
This is a contradiction.
Unfortunately, a choice has to be made here between divergent interests and this sometimes just has to be accepted.
I see that Europe is probably the only international actor that continuously self-corrects itself and manifestly tries, at any rate, to go in the right direction.
A second point that has been raised is that of Zimbabwe.
I do not wish to go back over this question.
Mrs Martens has responded better than I ever could.
What we are dealing with is an EU-Africa summit, not an EU-Zimbabwe summit.
This is element number one.
Element number two is that I am well aware of calls for Mr Mugabe to be denounced.
I could do that too, but it would change nothing.
The decision to invite Mr Mugabe does not depend on us.
I am sorry but we cannot stand in for our African partners.
Speaking as the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, with special responsibility for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and for political relations and dialogue with Africa, I have to tell you - and I am sorry to have to say this - that we do not have the right of coercion that enables us to say to our African partners: 'You can invite anyone apart from him.'
At the risk of being too forward I will also say this: if we are to judge things by the yardstick of dictators, or rather those whom we consider as being fit for this role, we would have problems with more than just Mr Mugabe.
And let me just say something else on the subject: this is the reality.
What is important is that the summit takes place and what is also important is that during this summit we are able to discuss matters and raise the issue of human rights in Zimbabwe.
This is what appears to be useful and important to me, and I do not mind saying so.
The summit therefore has to take place.
We have waited long enough.
There has already been an Africa-China summit.
What is more, an Africa-Japan summit is in preparation and we will be there when it happens, though I do not know exactly when.
I would also like to say that we have enlisted the help of South Africa.
If there is one African country that has made considerable efforts to try to resolve this question in everyone's best interests it is South Africa.
Moreover, that country is now most likely engaged in generating, inspiring and working on a major agreement between the majority and the opposition in Zimbabwe, and this should result in honest and fair elections in March 2008.
These talks are still ongoing, but in any case the last conversation that I had with President Mbeki seemed to offer real hopes of success.
So let us not criticise South Africa, for it is doing what it can and it is not doing a bad job.
As regards the proportion of funding allocated to agriculture, I would simply point out that, between the ninth and tenth European Development Funds, the figure set aside for this sector increased from EUR 663 million to EUR 1.1 billion.
It is true that, despite the increase in funds between the ninth and tenth EDFs, there was a reduction in absolute percentage terms, but as far as hard cash is concerned the actual increase was not insubstantial.
In addition I should mention that I was delighted to hear the President of the World Bank announce several days ago in Washington, at a meeting that I attended, that there would be a much greater focus on agricultural development, and so I fully share the concerns that were raised just now.
As regards the role of civil society and the parliaments, and the Pan-African Parliament too, I can do no more than wholeheartedly approve of the approach taken in the report.
In a word, and to be brief because the allotted time is very short, I would again like to touch on the question of Economic Partnership Agreements or EPAs, which I promised to do.
You will be aware of my position as regards these agreements.
They are an essential condition for the integration of Africa into the world community.
As experience from Asia has shown, it is not aid that is the most decisive factor for progress but rather economic development and integration into the global marketplace.
I personally believe that EPAs represent an opportunity whereby the ACP countries can integrate gradually into the international trading community by first building up their regional markets.
All the same, I would point out that 1 January 2008 will not herald the start of sudden and dramatic market liberalisation.
So what will it mean?
In fact it will mean the gradual opening up of markets subject to varying transitional periods depending on the products in question, with the assistance of regional funds that will provide financial support and will also help alleviate the problem of net fiscal loss as a result of liberalisation.
Of course there is no shortage of interesting proposals that could be applied in this area.
What is more, we will also be able to mobilise quite substantial resources in a whole series of areas that could create optimum conditions whereby this process of liberalisation could in fact be made progressive, and this gradual opening up of the markets rendered useful, positive and productive.
I understand only too well the apprehensions that some have expressed. However, as regards the call to extend the date for concluding these Economic Partnership Agreements I must say to you that I do not see any advantage in this.
The WTO will not grant us an exception for the ACP countries - and it is all very well pretending that they might - because our current system is harming other developing countries that are asking to be treated in the same manner as the former colonies.
The only alternative is therefore to use the Generalised System of Preferences.
The least developed countries (LDCs) will have access to everything apart from arms, but for the non-LDCs - and I would just like to point out that there are 36 of them - this would represent a reduction in their current level of access.
The EPAs will allow us to continue to guarantee this preferential access to our traditional partners, but more importantly they will help support the process of regional economic integration.
I believe that this is where the real potential lies for trade to be able to contribute towards economic development.
We are of course aware of the problems that this will pose for our partners, we recognise their reluctance and, it has to be admitted, we understand their legitimate fears.
It is precisely for this reason that we have initially proposed concluding staged agreements that in the first place will resolve the trade problem by including market opening on a reciprocal basis that is compatible with WTO rules.
As I have always said, market access offers from our ACP partners will of course be based on the principles of asymmetry.
Remember that we for our part are opening up our markets completely, we intend to be as flexible as possible and shall make use of all the leeway available to us to incorporate the concerns about development, particularly the need to protect the main body of agricultural production and fledgling industries.
We are at the moment continuing to work on this question.
The real challenge is to prevent non-LDCs from slipping into a disastrous trading situation on 1 January.
These countries clearly have huge commercial interests at stake.
If by 1 January we have still not solved the question of market access it is obvious that they will be back with the Generalised System of Preferences, which means they will be on the sidelines and then they will be in a truly disastrous position.
We therefore have to get a move on if we are even to have temporary agreements in place.
This essentially is it as far as the EPAs are concerned.
Finally I would like to say that I am in complete agreement with the views that Mr Borrell expressed so clearly.
The forthcoming summit and the EU-Africa strategy will be all about bringing a fundamental change to the nature of relations between Europe and Africa.
Let us therefore try - and here I borrow his expression - to create a strong partnership between two sides that respect each other and have rights and responsibilities towards each other, and let us leave behind what we have at present - I would not call it banal, it is more serious than that - this outmoded, archaic and counterproductive relationship, this often humiliating association, of donor and beneficiary.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
The EU-Africa Summit should mark a change in the EU's policies on respect for the sovereignty and right to development of the African countries and peoples, by promoting a fairer, more peaceful and more human world with a greater level of solidarity.
This requires, for example:
immediate solidarity measures to meet the most basic needs of millions of human beings;
respect for national sovereignty and independence, non-interference in the internal affairs of each country and a peaceful solution to international conflicts;
demilitarisation of international relations and a gradual reduction in armaments and military expenditure;
equitable and fair international economic relations, rejecting the impositions of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization and the 'Economic Partnership Agreements' on liberalisation of trade;
cancellation of foreign debt, which has already been more than paid;
proper policies of cooperation and active and mutual support for development;
guarantee of immigrants' rights.
This relationship must no longer be based on neo-colonialist ambitions or paternalistic views aimed at recovering the ground lost when the African peoples gained their national independence - after being conquered in the second half of the 20th century - and promoting interference, the military presence of the EU's major powers, and the control and exploitation of natural resources by transnationals.
in writing. - (FR) If we are to highlight the importance of Parliament's report on relations between the European Union and Africa, given the forthcoming EU-Africa Summit in December, then we must above all welcome its realistic approach.
The report calls for a true partnership between the EU and Africa, a democratic and realistic partnership that is based on effective and coordinated aid, but also on trade.
I would particularly like to express my support for the negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) for, as the report stresses, international trade has to be conceived as an instrument working for development.
Poverty can only be reduced on a permanent basis by means of economic growth that is fair, sustainable and properly supervised, growth that is the result of commercial activity stimulated by market access.
Free trade is not an end in itself, it has to serve the needs of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries; this is why the ACP group of nations has to be involved gradually and asymmetrically, so as to take account of local characteristics.
We cannot be satisfied simply by providing aid selectively, otherwise we will not be solving the problems, we will merely be forever postponing them.
Africa is not just a theatre for humanitarian aid, it needs to be an actor in its own development, with the European Union as a partner.
An international treaty prohibiting cluster bombs (debate)
The next item is the debate on:
the oral question to the Council on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions; follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0319/2007);
the oral question to the Commission on an international treaty to ban cluster munitions - follow-up to the Oslo Declaration, by Josep Borrell Fontelles, on behalf of the Committee on Development - B6-0320/2007).
author. - (ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, the calls for a ban on cluster bombs are getting louder and louder.
Use of these bombs in summer 2006 in the Lebanon war showed the extent to which they can cause a human disaster.
They are weapons that are a danger to both civilians and military personnel, but in practice 90% of their victims are civilians.
In addition, 10% of these deadly bombs do not explode: they remain in the ground and have the same effect as landmines.
Therefore, clearing the land contaminated with these munitions is dangerous, both for the populations and for the international peacekeeping forces.
These bombs are not only used for war; they act as a long-term obstacle to transport and agriculture, and they create trade barriers and obstacles to humanitarian aid.
They are thus one of the main problems affecting the development of poor countries: it is the poorest countries that are most affected by them, and in those countries the main victims are the poorest and least-educated sections of the population.
We can no longer say that bombing one's opponents from a height of 10 000 metres and showering them with bombs that remain in the ground is an efficient way of maintaining peace or taking military action.
The deployment of peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid are today essential to stabilise and rebuild the areas affected by conflict and these bombs now lack any justification, including from a military perspective.
Today we are going to talk to the Commission and to the Council precisely about the initiatives that have come about as a result of the widespread change of attitude among the international community towards cluster bombs.
The European Parliament has repeatedly adopted a very clear position: we want to see international regulation of a global nature prohibiting the use, production, transfer, financing and stockpiling of cluster bombs.
Pending this, the EU Member States should implement unilateral actions to prohibit the use and transfer of these bombs, as many states have already done and others are preparing to do.
Commissioner, Minister, the European Parliament wants to thank the Presidency of the Council, the Commission and the Member States for their efforts to negotiate a new protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons, which deals with all the humanitarian problems associated with the use of cluster bombs.
Unfortunately, however, we must recognise that very little progress has been made to date.
We therefore need a solid Oslo Process on the basis of which the states, the NGOs, the Red Cross and the international organisations can draw up and fulfil an ambitious agenda.
For the moment, Oslo has been backed by 80 countries, including many developing countries, but it is far from clear yet whether this process will eventually result in a complete ban on cluster bombs.
What is clear is that we need an integrated, comprehensive approach that has a humanitarian slant and that focuses not just on disarmament, but above all on the protection of civilians, helping them to cope with the consequences of war while ensuring that the existing stockpiles of these bombs are destroyed and that the contaminated areas are cleared.
With a number of important events coming up, such as the Vienna meeting in December and the Brussels meeting the following week, as well as 5 November, the Global Day of Action to Ban Cluster Bombs, when there will be many events around the world, what are we going to do?
In this context I would like to ask the Commission and Council representatives what we are going to do, what our position will be?
What is the European Union's position on the state of the discussions in the framework of the Convention on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons?
Are we going to have a common position of the Council in this matter?
What initiatives are we developing to encourage the Member States to adopt national measures aimed at prohibiting cluster bombs?
What are we doing to support third countries in terms of clearing the areas affected by these munitions, providing education on the risks and destroying the stockpiles of munitions already prohibited?
Finally, is the Commission going to consider organising an international conference on the European Union's role in tackling the socio-economic, humanitarian and development consequences following conflicts in which these weapons have been used?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Borrell, I should firstly like to thank you for your three questions on this specific issue of the ban on cluster bombs.
I will try to briefly and as objectively as possible answer each of the three questions put to the Council.
As regards your first question, I must say that, within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons - to keep my speech short I will simply refer to this as the 'Convention' - the Presidency of the Council of the European Union has, as you know, voiced its concern, on behalf of the European Union, about the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions.
In particular, at the Third Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention which was held in Geneva from 7 to 17 November last year, the European Union expressed the view that cluster munitions represent a particularly important element of the future work of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons.
The EU presented a proposal supporting the establishment of an open-ended Group of Governmental Experts with the purpose of drafting recommendations for further action in the context of the Convention.
This proposal was not adopted by the Conference of States Parties.
However, it was agreed to convene, as a matter of urgency, an intersessional meeting of the Group of Governmental Experts on Explosive Remnants of War, with particular focus on cluster munitions.
This meeting was held in Geneva from 19 to 22 June 2007 when the EU submitted a draft negotiating mandate for a legally binding instrument to address all aspects of the humanitarian concerns raised by cluster munitions.
This instrument should be adopted by the end of 2008.
The EU Troika carried out extensive consultations with third countries to promote the EU approach.
The Group of Governmental Experts decided, however, to postpone any decision on a legally binding instrument until the 2007 meeting of the High Contracting Parties to the Convention which will be held next month.
In parallel with these efforts to address the concerns relating to cluster munitions, as you know, a number of EU Member States have subscribed to the Oslo Declaration and participated in a series of meetings organised within the so-called 'Oslo Process', aimed at a total ban on cluster munitions.
EU Member States have participated in their national capacity.
So far no agreement has been reached on an EU position concerning the Oslo Process.
The majority of Member States perceive these two processes as complementary and consider them to be parallel efforts leading to a common goal, namely an international legally binding instrument on cluster munitions.
As regards your second question, I must say that, in relation to the forthcoming meetings in Brussels and Vienna, as already mentioned, EU Member States, including the Presidency, will participate in a national capacity if they so decide.
No EU common position is planned.
Finally, as regards your third question, I can say that the recent decisions taken by Austria and Belgium on the prohibition of cluster munitions, as referred to by Mr Borrell in his question, have been taken, as you know, on a purely national basis.
The Council has not taken any specific action on this issue.
Let us hope that it will express its view soon.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Borrell Fontelles for putting this oral question to us.
I am glad because I think this is an opportunity for us to comprehensively answer this question on something which has particularly appalling consequences.
It has a highly negative impact on human beings, particularly on civilians.
The question is, therefore, very dear to me because things that affect human security are always very close to my heart.
I fully agree with the position expressed by our Council President, but I would like to mention a few other things also.
Over the past year I have had the opportunity to discuss it in several formal and informal fora, including in meetings organised - the first in Paris and then a later one in Alexandria - by the Institute for Peace Studies and chaired by Ms Mubarak.
She took on this issue very strongly and I think she has tried to bring things forward.
As in the case for antipersonnel landmines, explosive remnants of war pose great threats to the lives and safety of civilian populations and I would like to comprehensively answer the questions that Mr Borrell Fontelles has asked here.
Their effects can be both immediate and long-lasting.
By scattering explosives over wide areas they can kill and injure, as we all know, large numbers of civilians, very often children.
In addition, many of the bomblets or submunitions fail to implode and to explode on impact, and their lethal effects remain after conflict so furthermore cluster munitions seriously hinder international humanitarian assistance.
We have seen it in the war in Lebanon.
As regards crisis management and post-conflict reconstruction programmes during and in the aftermath of conflicts over the past several years, we in the Commission have been very active in countering the problems created by landmines and also by other explosive remnants of war, including cluster ammunition.
Through the two European Commission mine action strategies covering the period 2002-2007, over EUR 300 million have been committed worldwide in projects covering activities such as demining, stockpile destruction, mine risk education, mine victim assistance, rehabilitation and social economic reintegration.
Projects covering cluster munitions have also been carried out in countries which are highly affected by these weapons, such as Afghanistan, Laos and Cambodia to name a few of them.
As for the future, we will maintain our engagement through mainstreaming actions against antipersonnel landmines and explosive remnants of war in our Community external assistance strategies and programmes - so this will be everywhere.
The Commission also makes use of the humanitarian aid instrument managed by ECHO to fund humanitarian demining efforts.
The most recent case of humanitarian demining support has been in Lebanon, which received significant humanitarian aid following the conflict in December 2006, which I mentioned before.
Concerning the Commission's role in the negotiation of disarmament treaties or conventions, I would like to recall that such negotiations are sometimes not in our competence.
If the Community is not a party to the disarmament treaties or conventions, it can then legally only encourage partner countries to engage fully in multilateralism, in particular via participation in treaties and conventions.
I think our President has said a lot on this already.
We took part in the EU troika dÃ©marches carried out in key countries such as the United States of America, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Canada, Pakistan and Ukraine, to promote the multilateral initiatives on cluster munitions in the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, and in particular a negotiation on a legally binding instrument addressing humanitarian concerns about cluster munitions.
The objective is to conclude negotiations by the end of next year.
At the same time, the Commission closely follows the Oslo Process and intends to participate as an observer at the meetings planned in that context in Brussels and in Vienna.
In conclusion, I would like to assure you, Mr Borrell Fontelles, and also the European Parliament, that the Commission will continue to make its best efforts to support all the multilateral initiatives that are aimed at a comprehensive and effective ban on cluster mines.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I should like to say to the Commissioner that I am encouraged by the fact that we share the same worries and goals and I thank her for her presentation and description of the developments.
I am also glad about the good cooperation between the Members of Parliament in preparing a relevant motion for a resolution.
First of all, it is a matter of urgency. It has a human and political urgency because, in spite of warning signals from all around the world, cluster bombs are still being actively used.
So there are two problems we need to address.
Firstly, the use of cluster bombs has an especially inhuman aspect.
Those who launch these bombs are usually not able to target them very specifically.
The failure rates happen to be much higher than might be expected.
The tragic result is extremely high numbers of casualties among civilians, more than 90%, as has been said.
Another problem is the multitude of unexploded cluster bombs that lie in the former conflict areas.
This is a major handicap to states that have resolved to start to rebuild their economies after conflicts.
Against this background I think the EU should take the lead in trying to ban any kind of production, use and sale of cluster munitions.
The first step should be to introduce an immediate moratorium on the use of these weapons.
Further, our resolution insists that EU troops should under no circumstances make use of any kind of cluster ammunition until the relevant international agreements have been achieved.
We ask Parliament and the Commission to urgently increase financial assistance to communities and individuals who have been affected by both exploded and unexploded cluster munitions, using to this end all available instruments.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
These questions exemplify the leading role played by this House in relation to conventional disarmament, controls on the transfer of munitions and the strengthening of international humanitarian law.
We fought for the extension of the Ottawa Convention to all types of mines.
Well before the European Council, we argued for a global treaty on the arms trade.
The vital need to convert the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports into a legally binding instrument has also been a constant demand of this Parliament.
These questions on cluster bombs look to the future and to what Europe must do to eliminate these weapons which make no distinction between civilians and military personnel and which destroy so many human lives.
We are calling for an immediate moratorium on using, producing, stockpiling and exporting these weapons.
The moratorium must in due time be converted into a legal instrument which has the effect of banning these barbaric munitions, in the long term, from arsenals and battlefields in the same way as anti-personnel mines have already started to disappear.
In addition to calling on the European Union to begin a diplomatic offensive in favour of this new instrument, we want the Member States to lead by example and eliminate the use of these weapons by their Armed Forces.
Not only that, they must also permanently stop their export, production and stockpiling.
Every day in the Lebanon, Chechnya, Afghanistan and dozens of other countries where the wars have already ended, people are paying the ultimate price for the criminal and immoral irresponsibility of Armed Forces which have lost any sense of the ethical and legal limits that should guide the actions of civilised people.
It is up to Europe to lead a global alliance to re-establish, reaffirm and reinforce these limits.
We urgently need a common position in order to eradicate cluster bombs and other cluster munitions.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, civilians - many of them children - are indiscriminately killed or injured by cluster bombs.
Dreams are shattered and lives are destroyed.
Take the case of the Iraqi boy, Ahmed Kamel.
Attracted by a shiny object, Ahmed picked up a bomblet and it exploded. He lost both of his hands and his sight.
How is a 12-year-old supposed to make sense of this?
And yet the shocking fact is that cluster munitions are stockpiled in over 15 EU Member States.
Horrifyingly, at least 10 EU Member States are producing these weapons: France, Spain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Sweden and Bulgaria.
It is my view that these countries, as well as those that have used them, including the UK, have blood on their hands.
Whilst I welcome moves by countries such as Belgium to establish national legislation to ban cluster munitions, all other EU Member States must follow suit.
I urge the Council and the Commission to endorse the Oslo Process, as we have already called on them to do.
Diplomatic manoeuvres by the UK Government and others to suggest there are 'dumb' and 'smart' cluster munitions must be given short shrift - they all kill and maim.
The word 'smart' could not be more misleading or more inappropriate.
We need an immediate moratorium on the use, investment, stockpiling, production, transfer or export of all cluster munitions by all EU Member States.
All states which have used them must accept responsibility for their clearance, and the Commission must urgently increase financial assistance to the communities affected by unexploded bomblets.
I urge you all to support this resolution.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Oslo Process offers an historic opportunity to achieve an international agreement - not just a declaration, but an international agreement - banning cluster bombs.
For two decades, there have been campaigns and international initiatives, but they have been repeatedly bogged down in the diplomatic mire of military and economic interests.
Now we have an opportunity to reach an agreement in 2008.
This requires support not only from Parliament, which has a clear position here across all parliamentary groups.
I was very pleased and interested to hear, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission also supports this position, which is most welcome.
The Council now needs to follow the clear stance that has been adopted by Parliament and the Commission; that is very important.
It is not just about banning the use and stockpiling of cluster bombs and the trade in these weapons; it is also about production.
We should have a ban on the production of these bombs, and the European Union is still one of the main producers of these weapons.
They are still being manufactured in Germany, in the United Kingdom, in France, in Spain and Belgium.
Legislation has now been adopted in Belgium and Austria to ban production but I know that production has still not stopped entirely in Belgium.
There are loopholes in this legislation as well.
We must press ahead with a ban on these weapons.
The Member States must move forward towards a ban, and the Council must defend the clear position that has been set out here.
That is the only way to ensure that, in 2008, we actually get an agreement.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Madam President, the first time I dealt personally with this issue was during NATO's war of aggression against Yugoslavia, one of the wars which I opposed and which like many other wars was waged by Western countries.
Some 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians.
Between 5 and 40% of the submunitions of cluster bombs do not explode.
Let me be blunt: it is mainly the major Western industrialised countries which produce and equip their armies with fragmentation bombs and deploy cluster bombs in wars.
There are 34 countries which produce cluster bombs, including 13 EU Member States.
Cluster bombs are a factor in wars being waged by EU countries, for example in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, so please, let us not shed any crocodile tears here!
The EU must bite the bullet.
In specific terms, this means that we need the European Union to adopt a common position condemning these murderous weapons.
That means an end to the production of cluster bombs, and of course no use of fragmentation bombs as occurred in the Gulf War, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon.
It cannot be allowed to continue.
(FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, much has already been said on this subject and we of course deplore - the word is hardly strong enough - the use of cluster munitions, which have caused so much serious damage in a number of countries, and I wish to thank Mr Borrell for having in fact raised this disturbing issue.
However, if this ban is to be effective, and if the resolve expressed in the resolution is to succeed, we of course need to go much further than banning the use of such weapons. We also need to deal with their manufacture and sale, because we cannot have a humanitarian debate on the one hand - and it is true that these bombs that do not explode but that lie hidden in the ground in all kinds of places, thereby preventing communities and refugees from returning to their homeland, also prevent the distribution of humanitarian aid - we cannot have such a debate that seeks to highlight the humanitarian side of the problem without at the same time taking effective measures against those industries here at home that, regrettably, are still producing and selling these weapons.
I would like to conclude by saying that this resolution perhaps gives us an opportunity to appeal to the Member States too.
In this respect my own country, Belgium, has passed the necessary legislation, indeed I think that it was the first to do so, and I believe that we could be inspired by the law that has been adopted in Belgium to appeal to the other 26 Member States to follow suit.
(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to use my turn to speak to support both the question and the way it has been worded by Mr Borrell, as well as our joint motion for a resolution on this issue.
I am all too well aware that all the efforts being made on arms control are always very difficult and are sometimes more like a procession of Echternach, where you take two steps forward and then one step back.
I think that we must intensify these efforts, because it seems to me in the last few years as if people who are working for disarmament, for arms control, to control weapons, are old-fashioned specimens from a bygone age, because now rearmament is the order of the day.
I find that extremely alarming.
When you think that a head of state of the only remaining superpower in the world recently threatened a possible third world war, that strikes fear right to my heart.
In this context, which is far less conducive to joint efforts, I think that it is more important than ever that both the Council and the Commission continuously underline that the Member States must act together on this, which unfortunately has not been the case up to now.
(SV) Thank you Madam President.
I am also speaking on behalf of my colleague RaÃŒl Romeva.
He comes from Spain, I come from Sweden, and both countries produce these dreadful weapons and both countries have promised to ban them.
But what is my own country doing?
At the talks in Oslo, Sweden argued that we should have restricted use rather than a ban.
That is a disgraceful position.
No civilised country can defend these cruel weapons, and I am delighted to see the great unity that exists between the Council, the Commission and Parliament today in support of a total ban.
When these weapons strike, they constitute a weapon against innocent children.
It is an effective weapon against human rights and economic development.
We must therefore be highly effective in our fight to ban them.
This is the beginning - let us complete the process as soon as possible, as another child is dying every minute.
Thank you.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to echo those who have already talked about banning the production, export and stockpiling of these weapons - cluster bombs - which are so harmful to civilians, and to express my support for the Oslo Process, despite the fact that, as the previous speaker said, my country manufactures, stockpiles and exports these types of weapons.
I must make one point, however: on 21 September - i.e. just a month ago - the government, in the shape of the party that supports it, the Socialist Party, tabled in parliament an amendment to the Law on control of external trade in defence and dual-use material aimed partly at restricting - and, where appropriate, prohibiting - cluster bombs that are particularly dangerous for civilians.
In other words, the trend is changing in my country: the manufacture, stockpiling and export of these weapons were approved by previous governments.
This government is fully committed to the Oslo Process and wants to see the gradual elimination and, eventually, complete prohibition of their manufacture, stockpiling and export.
This was the important point that I wanted to make.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to raise two vital points, but I will be very brief as I know we are overrunning.
The first is that this debate has given me a very clear idea and conviction that this issue will be followed very closely by the European Parliament and is something that concerns many Members.
I will therefore of course duly take this into account.
Secondly, I would point out that the European Union is also playing a leading role in this issue, possibly not with the energy that many Members would like, and certainly with some difficulty, but, despite everything, with a certain optimism.
We have already voiced in the appropriate place, in other words in the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the European Union's concern about the humanitarian consequences of this type of weapon.
We have also already proposed the negotiation of a legally binding instrument to be adopted by the end of 2008 at the latest, although possibly not with the ambition that many of you desire.
However, the fact is that we are here to take decisive steps.
This is a process that I hope will amass ever more political will, enthusiasm and effort so that we can ultimately achieve the proposed goals.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to add one thing to what I said before.
I can, of course, only speak on areas within the Commission's competence, and you know that this area is a particular competence of the Member States.
However, I can speak on the financial assistance to those affected.
I can reconfirm what I said before, which is that we have already done our best to alleviate the problems caused by explosive remnants of war, including cluster munitions, in particular through our mine action strategies and the related horizontal budget line, which accounted for about one third of the funds spent in this domain.
I can assure you that actions against mines and explosive remnants of war will continue to be carried out through the new geographical instruments, and are even being mainstreamed now - and this is new - into our external assistance strategies and programmes.

Some actions can also be funded under the new instrument for stability, so we now have more instruments on hand to address this major challenge, and will take clearly into account the strong position expressed by Parliament in using these as effectively as possible, where necessary, because I totally share the objective that you have expressed.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
(The sitting was suspended for a few moments before Question Time)
Council Question Time
Ladies and gentlemen, the next item is questions to the Council.
As happened yesterday during questions to the Commission, we are going to experiment with some new rules which are proposed as part of the reform of Parliament.
These are being studied by a special group and basically cover two areas.
Firstly, I would invite Members to move to the front benches so that the sitting feels more inclusive and, secondly, supplementary questions will be answered in one go by the President-in-Office of the Council after they have been asked. As a result, as we usually have two supplementary questions, instead of each being answered immediately, the Council will respond to both questions together at the end.
The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0318/2007).
The following questions to the Council have been tabled.
Subject: Solidarity Fund for major disasters
Given the gravity of this summer's forest fires in certain countries of the Union such as Greece and Spain, and in the light of the Union's failure to respond quickly and effectively, will the Council be reviewing the Solidarity Fund rules so that in the future we may be armed with appropriate mechanisms to face up to these disasters and mitigate the damage caused?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in answer to this question I would say that, as you know, the current European Union Solidarity Fund was established to respond to disasters of major and extraordinary proportions, following the floods which affected Central Europe in the summer of 2002.
In 2002, on a proposal from the European Commission, the Council adopted a Regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund.
Article 14 of that Regulation on the Solidarity Fund provides that the Council shall review this Regulation on the basis of a proposal from the Commission by 31 December 2006 at the latest.
In 2005 the Commission proposed that Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 be replaced by a new Regulation on the Solidarity Fund.
This proposal particularly aimed to extend the scope of the instrument in order to cover industrial and technological disasters, public health emergencies and acts of terror and to reduce the thresholds used to classify a disaster as major.
The proposal was that the regional exceptional criteria should be removed from the Regulation in force, but that, in exceptional circumstances, the Commission could recognise that a major disaster had occurred.
The European Parliament issued an opinion in that regard in May 2006 and, still in 2006, the Council discussed the Commission's proposal and Parliament's opinion at the appropriate levels, although no agreement was reached.
As a result, Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 continues to apply, with the Commission having proposed its mobilisation during 2007.
As I had the opportunity of telling you last month in answer to a similar question, as far as the Council is aware, in cases of disasters provided for by the Regulation, its application has been effective.
The European Commission periodically prepares reports which describe in detail the use of the Solidarity Fund.
(ES) The Council's proposal was perfectly clear.
This new regulation is hugely delayed.
The complementary and concrete question I want to put to the Council is the following: this summer the cradle of Western civilisation, Ancient Greece, along with the Olympic stadiums were almost burnt down.
Is the Council waiting until the Vatican is burnt down, until the Prado is burnt down, until BelÃ©m Palace is burnt down, or can we hope that before next summer we will have a regulation that can cope with these types of disasters?
(PT) Mr President, Mr Medina Ortega, we are obviously not waiting for Rome, Lisbon, London or Paris to suffer natural disasters before we look at this issue in more detail.
We truly hope that BelÃ©m Palace and BelÃ©m Tower will remain standing for many centuries, as they have done to date.
As regards specific deadlines for amending the current rules, I cannot of course, on behalf of the Council, commit to any specific date.
Thank you for your reply, but I would concur with the follow-up question.
We do need to know when this is going to be changed.
I am speaking particularly about flooding in the UK.
Obviously this refers to fires, but the solidarity fund covers flooding.
My region in the West Midlands was very badly hit.
My particular village in Worcestershire was hit, along with the rest of Worcestershire and the surrounding areas in Hereford and Shropshire.
Obviously the UK Government has put in a bid for solidarity fund money.
I am hoping the Commission is going to look favourably on that and the Council will actually try and make changes to the way the solidarity fund operates so that in future we can get this funding at a faster rate.
Also, can the Council representative tell us what he feels about the rapid reaction force and whether this is going to be brought forward so that emergency flood defences could be brought into affected areas?
(DE) Mr President, first of all, let me say that I think it is very good that we can now sit together down here.
I think that is a very good idea.
As to the question itself, I would like to say a few words about the fires, Minister, which in some cases are due to natural causes but in others are started deliberately.
This fire-starting is encouraged by the legal position in some countries because it offers certain advantages to certain people.
Has any thought been given to the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on these countries to change the legal position so that this incentive no longer exists in future?
(PT) Very well.
I believe that I have already answered at least some of the questions that have just been asked.
I have also already said that our assessment of how this Solidarity Fund has functioned in the past was positive, in the sense that it functioned properly.
The issue of the rapid reaction force is being considered.
No decision has yet been made as this is still being assessed and debated by the Council.
No decision has been made either on the prevention of fires, although a great deal has been done.
Much remains to be done and I suppose that this is an area in which the exchange of experiences known as 'best practices' and cooperation between Member States at EU level may prove useful.
Efforts still need to be made in this area.
I must say that my own country is somewhere that is systematically, year after year, badly affected by fires, arson and all the issues relating to fires, particularly forest fires.
Nationally, we have adopted a series of measures and initiatives that have proven to be very successful in terms of preventing fires and arson and of course we are very happy to share our experiences with all the Member States.
Subject: Integrated European policy for persons with special needs
Is the Council envisaging the adoption of a joint decision with a view to establishing an integrated European policy to support and provide vocational training for citizens with special needs and ensure their integration in society?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Thank you for your question, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou.
As you know, the Council can only act in its legislative capacity on the basis of a proposal made at some stage by the Commission.
As things stand, the Council has not yet received any legislative proposal for a Council decision with a view to establishing an integrated European policy to support and provide vocational training for citizens with special needs and ensure their integration in society.
As you will know, in 2000 the Council adopted Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.
This prohibits discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability.
In addition, this year (2007) was designated the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities for All' through a decision which the Council and Parliament took jointly under the codecision procedure.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council.
The elimination of discrimination in employment is not an effective way to address the problem of disability.
Only yesterday the health programme involving new technologies was announced.
Could this proposal not be used to enable a large proportion of European citizens, who could be active and useful to society as whole at a time of demographic decline, to reach their potential and live in social cohesion?
(PT) Mr President, Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, I feel that speech was more a general comment than a direct question.
However, I believe that, despite everything, we have seen a gradual increase in awareness among the Member States and also at EU level of the need to work together in order to adequately respond to the issues involved in this area.
I must also say that, during the Portuguese Presidency and as part of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Presidency will be hosting, in Lisbon on 19 and 20 November, a major conference on this issue during which we will of course try to review the situation as regards the relevant issues.
We will also of course try to obtain political commitments on this issue for the future.
(DE) What measures is the Council planning with a view to making public transport more accessible to the disabled?
Do you see any opportunity for the use of best practice and benchmarking in order, quite simply, to help improve the situation here?
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, we have explicitly enshrined the rights of the disabled in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which will be part of the Lisbon Treaty and will thus be fully and legally binding.
Do you see any opportunity for the Council Presidency to call on Member States to react very practically to the new opportunities that have been created and take appropriate measures to ensure that the disabled have more and better prospects?
(PT) I should like to make two comments.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights is not yet fully in force and has not been published.
Neither has the Treaty of Lisbon and we therefore have to wait for the time being.
I obviously cannot predict in October what initiatives or decisions the Council may adopt in this area.
Furthermore, as you know, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is not in itself a legal basis for legislative initiatives.
With regard to the issue of transport, as the Commission does not propose initiatives to be adopted by the Council in this area, this issue still comes under the competence of the Member States.
It will clearly be up to them, at national level, to propose the necessary measures as they see fit and according to specific circumstances.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next three questions by Marian Harkin, Avril Doyle and Esko SeppÃ€nen were put down in yesterday's debate.
In accordance with Annex II(A)(2) of the Rules of Procedure, these questions are not admissible so we will move on to the next question.
Questions Nos 3, 4 and 5 are not admissible as the subject in question is already on the agenda for this part-session.
Subject: Sex offenders
Is the Portuguese Presidency satisfied that the EU and its Member States are taking all possible measures to identify, bring to justice and monitor after conviction perpetrators of sex crimes against children, to exchange information on child sex crime and to protect and rescue children who may be missing, abducted or at risk?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mrs Ludford, protecting children from sexual exploitation and combating trafficking in human beings are extremely important issues for the European Union.
In this respect, I would refer to the Council Resolution of 27 September 2001 on the contribution of civil society in finding missing or sexually exploited children in which the Council declared that combating the disappearance and sexual exploitation of children is a priority for the European Union.
To this end, the Council has adopted various legal instruments which tackle specific aspects of this issue, including the Joint Action of 24 February 1997 concerning action to combat trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children, said Council Resolution of 27 September 2001 on the contribution of civil society in finding missing or sexually exploited children and, finally, the Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography.
The recent proposal for a framework decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, presented by the Kingdom of Belgium, has been assessed by the Council together with other proposals, such as the proposal for a Council framework decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings and the proposal for a Council framework decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States.
Following the negotiation process, the Council has decided to merge the provisions of the initiative presented by the Kingdom of Belgium with the instrument on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records.
As a result, information on a person's conviction for the sexual assault of children should be made available to the competent authorities of Member States.
The Council Framework Decision of 22 December 2003 on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography contains a definition of offences concerning sexual exploitation of children and child pornography and calls on Member States to take measures to ensure that these offences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of one to three years and, in some cases, the maximum of five to ten years.
Said Framework Decision sets 20 January 2006 as the date for implementation by Member States.
On the basis of the notifications received by the Council and the Commission on the implementation measures and the report prepared by the Commission, the Council must assess, by 20 January 2008, the extent to which the Member States have complied with the obligations arising from this Framework Decision.
I thank the Presidency very much for that reply.
The case of Madeleine McCann has aroused a lot of interest and, indeed, controversy.
I am not going to go into the details of that case, but what concerns me here is what lessons we can learn generally about the adequacy of European action in the case of missing children.
I want to ask about three issues.
The first is a missing children's hotline.
Yesterday, Commissioner Frattini told us that he was not at all satisfied by Member States' action to implement the Council decision from February for a single 116 phone number for missing children, which should have been in place in August.
Only four Member States have chosen a service provider, three Member States have failed to respond to a request for information at all.
That is not very impressive!
Will you chase up the other 23 Member States?
Secondly, a few weeks ago, Justice and Home Affairs Ministers called for an EU database on missing children.
I believe that some private attempts have been made in cooperation with YouTube and Madeleine McCann's parents.
Will the EU support having a proper database?
Thirdly, you talked about work on the exchange of information on sex offenders, but when are we going to have a computerised database?
(PT) Mr President, Mrs Ludford, I should just like to say the following in response to the various questions asked.
Firstly, many of these measures are relatively recent or very recent and their effects therefore need to be assessed.
This is happening and we will of course be assessing what has worked and what has failed and whether we are making good progress in this area.
This is what we have to do, not go hounding the Member States, trying to lay blame or apportion responsibility.
This is a cooperation process which requires dialogue between the Member States based on experiences which we must exchange.
Despite everything, I consider that we have made good progress in this area in response to situations which are truly terrible in humanitarian terms.
Finally, I consider that the Reform Treaty is also good news in this respect as it effectively encourages and enables wider and better cooperation between the Member States in combating this type of offence.
President-in-Office, you mentioned - and I was glad to hear you use the word - the 'trafficking' issue, because I think that, while we have publicity about children, including the McCann case, there are many children and young adults who are trafficked into Member States of the Union.
I would like to ask you if you believe that enough is being done on this issue.
And I would also ask to assist those when they are found in the Member State: to rehabilitate them and either get them back to their own countries or to make sure that they do not become criminals within the Member State in which they are trafficked.
I think this is a really serious problem in the Union.
(DE) Minister, I tried to listen very closely to your response to Mrs Ludford.
She asked you a very specific question which you have not answered, namely how you propose to chase up the Member States which have not yet set up the hotline.
Perhaps you could be more specific in your answer.
(PT) I am neither an expert in criminal policy nor a Minister for Justice.
I am here representing the Council and I can only tell you what, at the moment, seems to be the general feeling of the Council.
It is always possible to do more and to do it better, but the truth is that, as I have already said, there is a series of legal instruments which duly correspond to this desire to effectively combat this type of offence.
As I have said, many of these measures are recent and they will all need to be properly assessed.
There was one new question: raising the awareness of Member States and their citizens about a phenomenon which, in terms of raising awareness about its extent and gravity, is actually new.
As always happens with new phenomena which must be considered and assessed, there is of course a procedure to be followed.
We will, where necessary, continue to call on those Member States which have perhaps not yet complied with their obligations in relation to implementing initiatives or legislation to do so as quickly as possible.
If a commitment has been made, then this must be fulfilled and implemented in this and all other areas.
Subject: Merger between Suez and Gaz de France
On 3 September it was announced that the boards of the French energy company Suez and the state enterprise Gaz de France had decided to proceed with the planned merger.
This would create the fourth largest energy company, after Gazprom, ElectricitÃ© de France and EON.
The Commission has already ordered the merged company to hive off a number of operations in Belgium and France.
Does the Council believe that these merger plans still accord with the current principles which it espouses with regard to liberalisation of the energy market in the European Union?
To what extent have the new merged company and the French State promised to carry out the divestment of ownership of the main networks which the Commission has called for?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly say that, as you know, the conclusions of the 2007 Spring European Council comprehensively covered the EU's energy policy, including the issue of the internal market for gas and electricity.
The Council cannot venture an opinion as to whether the merger plans, as they currently stand, are in accordance with that part of the conclusions.
The Council would point out that these European Council conclusions formed a contribution to the European Commission's Third Energy Package, presented in September 2007, which has the goal of subsequently opening up the internal market for gas and electricity.
Only after obtaining agreement on the proposed regulations and directives and after these have entered into force will it be possible to assess whether the merged company GDF Suez complies with the relevant legislative provisions.
Secondly, the Council must point out that, under the Treaty provisions on competition, the European Commission is responsible for ascertaining the compatibility of all inter-company agreements with the Community rules.
(NL).
I think that it is entirely right that policy and concrete steps are evaluated by the Commission.
I do have an additional question relating to the European market, the realisation of the single market.
The explicit aim behind the unbundling of companies is to bring about real investment in the networks, and we can see that in this area, including between countries, we have not kept up with the agreements that have been made.
Countries are supposed to be able to exchange 10%, this was called interoperationality, and we are lagging behind on that.
My question is this: what activities is the Council undertaking to actually prime the investments in order to improve the connection between France and Spain, for instance?
People can buy in cheaper from their neighbours but if there is no mains connection that is not possible.
What are you going to do about that?
(PT) Mr President, Mr van Nistelrooij, the Council adopted a series of measures on energy issues at the last European Council in March.
These must of course now be implemented, based on Commission proposals.
Each body and each institution must assume its own responsibilities: the Commission by presenting its proposals, the Council by adopting, rejecting or amending these, and then the Court by ascertaining whether or not the legislation and penalties of Member States comply with the legislation in force.
That is all I can say for the time being.
Question No 8 has been withdrawn.
As the author is not present, Question No 9 lapses.
Subject: Facilitation of visas for citizens of Moldova and Georgia
Citizens of Moldova and Georgia are confronted with considerable difficulties in obtaining visas for the EU Member States.
In addition, the entry into force of the visa facilitation agreement between the EU and the Russian Federation has brought about a paradoxical situation whereby the inhabitants of the separatist regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria, who mostly hold Russian passports, now benefit from a less restrictive visa and travel regime.
What action will the Council take to contribute towards easing the visa regime for Moldovan and Georgian citizens and implementing the respective agreements?
It is also necessary, as a matter of urgency, that the Common Visa Centre in Chisinau should be able to count on the cooperation of more EU Member States with a view to transposing the practical process of facilitating visas.
How does the Council explain the fact that so far only a small number of Member States have done so, and how it will ensure that the rest cooperate forthwith?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mrs Anastase, in a decision of 19 December 2006, the Council mandated the Commission to negotiate an agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Moldova on the facilitation of visas.
This agreement was initialled in Chisinau on 25 April 2007 and signed in Brussels on 10 October 2007, by myself in fact.
Given the rapid conclusion of this agreement, the European Parliament will be consulted on the draft decision on the conclusion of this agreement.
On 17 October the Moldovan Government passed two bills ratifying the agreements with the European Union on visa facilitation and readmission.
On behalf of the Council, I can tell you that the Commission does not currently have a mandate to begin negotiations on a similar agreement with Georgia.
As regards the Common Visa Centre in Chisinau, cooperation between Member States is a matter to be decided by them alone.
(RO) Congratulations on signing the agreements with the Republic of Moldova.
As regards this issue, I would like to point out two things: first of all, I consider it necessary to include in the discussion regarding the relations between the Council and the Republic of Moldova a situation that occurred immediately after signing these agreements: on 12 October, at the border of the Republic of Moldova, some official delegations coming from Romania were refused access to the territory of the Republic of Moldova.
Since I believe that a visa facilitation for a third country should be followed, eventually, by its reciprocity, I would be interested to know if the Council intends to approach this subject.
Secondly, in the agreements you signed, a reference to the Moldovan language is made, a language that is not recognized.
I would like us to point this out especially since there is only one language, the Romanian language, recognized in the European Union.
As regards Georgia, I believe things should move toward avoiding the situation that the citizens of Georgia deal with as compared to the citizens of South Osetia.
(PT) Mr President, as I said, I signed this visa facilitation agreement with Moldova and I can tell you that this action, this initiative, this agreement was duly appreciated and recognised by the Moldovan Government.
This is an extremely important instrument in terms of both our relations with Moldova and all our relations with our neighbouring countries.
I sincerely hope that this agreement will help, as intended, to strengthen relations between the EU and Moldova and in particular to reinforce the 'human dimension' of the European Neighbourhood Policy, in other words to bring people closer so that we can all get to know each other more and better, because undoubtedly this is what reinforces European spirit and understanding.
Any difficulties in applying this agreement will of course have to be assessed.
Such difficulties are very recent but I can say that, whenever agreements concluded by the European Union with third countries result in problems or difficulties, when they do not produce the desired results or when they produce the wrong results, the Commission, possibly in cooperation with the Council, must look into what is happening and, if applicable, make the necessary changes.
With regard to Georgia, I have taken note of your comment, Mrs Anastase.
(LT) Are there any plans to adopt an agreement on a visa facilitation regime for visas to Belarus?
After the expansion of the Schengen area, Lithuania, having extensive borders with Belarus, will have difficulty inviting people from that country to visit and, in addition, Belarusians will not be able to visit relatives living across the border.
Are there any plans for this?
(PT) Mr President, Mrs BudreikatÄ, as you know, decisions on the conclusion of visa facilitation agreements are taken on a case-by-case basis.
They naturally take into account the country in question, the type of relationship that we have with that country, technical security issues and so on.
As a result, where applicable, with regard to Belarus or any other country, a decision would have to be duly proposed by the Commission to the Council and the latter would have to decide on this.
However, as I have said, a decision cannot be simply made to conclude this type of agreement or to begin negotiations without certain technical and political conditions being met.
However, where it is technically and politically feasible to conclude these, visa facilitation agreements do help, as I have said, with the 'human dimension' or 'humanitarian dimension' of the Neighbourhood Policy.
We cannot be strangers to one other; on the contrary we must and can get to know each other more and better.
Subject: Creation of a European civil defence force
On 4 September 2007 the European Parliament adopted a resolution (P6_TA(2007)0362) on natural disasters that makes particular reference to the lethal fires that affected Greece this summer.
Like other documents, both the resolution and the report on establishing a Community civil protection mechanism of 18 September 2006) recognise the importance of the Community civil protection mechanism and call for the creation of a European civil defence force that could react immediately in emergencies, as also proposed in the report by former Commissioner Barnier.
Given that the creation of a civil defence force would be of particular assistance in supporting Member States' national authorities responsible for civil protection, what are the Council's views on the creation of a civil defence force?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Papadimoulis, the Council would point out that, on 15 and 16 June 2006 and also on 14 and 15 December 2006, the European Council endorsed or took note of Presidency reports on reinforcing the Union's emergency and crisis response capacities in order to improve coordination and delivery of available assets.
The June 2006 European Council also provided further guidelines on improving the Union's emergency, crisis and disaster response capacities, both inside and outside the European Union.
It called for particular attention to be given to further developing the European Union's rapid response capability, based on means made available by Member States, including civil protection modules, and to work on the Commission's proposals on reinforcing the Community's civil protection capabilities.
As regards the report submitted by Michel Barnier in May 2006, the Council would also point out that the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006 welcomed this document as an important contribution to the debate.
Although certain ideas in the Barnier report have been incorporated in Community rules or practices, no proposal has so far been submitted to the Council aimed at creating a European civil defence force.
In its conclusions of 15 and 16 October 2007, the Council, taking into account the recent devastation in some Member States and recognising the need for the European Union to be able to respond effectively and in a timely manner to crises and emergency situations following natural disasters, invited the Commission to continue examining the issue and to submit relevant proposals before the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 10 December 2007.
(EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, but in familiar Council terms, he has chronicled 18 months of inertia and delays.
The text you have read to us manages to undermine the entire Barnier proposal.
I ask you: how many more fire and flood victims must we mourn?
How many properties must be lost?
For how long can the Member States waste their resources before you finally propose, in Council, the inquiry the European Parliament has long been demanding?
I ask you: will you, as President-in-Office, propose on 10 December that the Council examine what the European Parliament recommends, namely that this auxiliary civil protection force should be set up, or will your successor again tell us, 18 months from now, another tale of yet more delays?
(PT) Mr Papadimoulis, the Council is naturally awaiting with great interest the Commission's proposal on this issue, in other words on the possible creation of a civil defence force.
It is hoped that these suggestions or proposals will be made by the Commission before the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 10 December, in fact in less than two months.
We hope to look at and assess the Commission's proposals and we will then act accordingly.
(LT) I too would like to point out the importance of this issue, so I am pleased that the Council has addressed the Commission and is awaiting an answer.
Nevertheless, I would like to ask: what are the Commission's views on the force as regards extraordinary situations, and, bearing in mind all these floods and fires, climate change and the events taking place far from here, in America, what are the Commission's views on the actual role of such a force in extraordinary situations?
(DE) Mr President-in-Office, you have mentioned the Barnier report several times.
This report has prompted fears among the aid organisations because it seems to provide for quasi-military leadership structures or preliminary decision-making at military level.
Is the Council aware of these fears about the 'militarisation' of this civil protection force, and how can, and will the Council, respond to these concerns?
(PT) Mr President, as I have already mentioned, the Council's proposal and conclusions on Mr Barnier's report were that this could form a working basis for future decisions.
This was not a 100% endorsement nor even a partial endorsement that this should form a working basis.
It was simply what the Council agreed at the time.
As I have just said, I cannot pre-empt the Council's reaction to proposals, models and methods that do not yet exist, as that would be to pre-empt history.
We must await the Commission's proposals and assessment.
We will then discuss these in the Council and come to conclusions.
We will also decide on the direction to be taken in that respect, which brings me to an important point.
The Council, by asking the Commission to submit proposals on this issue, has unequivocally indicated its interest in the subject and its desire to move forward in this respect.
In my opinion, that is an undeniable and positive sign.
Subject: Fate of Professor Ukshin Hoti
The internationally recognised scientist and peace activist Professor Ukshin Hoti, Foreign Minister of the democratic underground Republic of Kosovo led by President Rugova in the nineties, was arrested by the Milosevic regime and disappeared without a trace many years ago.
Can the Council ascertain from the government in the now democratic Serbia what happened to Professor Hoti and determine if the Belgrade authorities are prepared to conduct an investigation into this matter?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr Posselt, Professor Ukshin Hoti is one of more than 2 000 people included on the list of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) whose families reported their disappearance during the Kosovo conflict.
The ICRC has, since January 1998, been gathering information on people who disappeared in Kosovo.
This information has been sent to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina, together with a request for them to do their utmost to discover the whereabouts of these people.
The ICRC in Kosovo is also working on this issue in strict cooperation with the United Nations Missions in Kosovo.
As part of the dialogue on issues of mutual interest between Pristina and Belgrade, the working group on missing persons which has representatives in both governments has met periodically since March 2004 under the auspices of the Red Cross.
Work is being carried out on both sides in order to discover the whereabouts of missing persons, but progress is slow.
The right to know the whereabouts of missing loved ones is a fundamental issue of humanitarian law and human rights.
As a result, the Council of the European Union is supporting the work being carried out by the international and local authorities in Serbia and Kosovo to this end and is encouraging them to increase their efforts.
(DE) Mr President, every victim is of course equally important, and so I welcome this inquiry.
However, Professor Hoti really was very well-known.
I am in close contact with his family.
He was the closest aide of Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov Prize Laureate, and he has been formally detained by the Serbs.
In that case, they must have some knowledge of his whereabouts!
This is an issue which has to be clarified formally with the government in Belgrade, with the involvement of the Council.
What does the Serbian Government have to say about the whereabouts of its prisoner, for whom it has assumed responsibility, given that it is holding him in custody?
(PT) Mr President, as I have already said, the Council is of course supporting all efforts being made by the authorities with direct responsibility in this area to try and determine the whereabouts of Professor Ukshin Hoti.
We also understand, as I said, that this is an issue of human rights and protection of human rights.
In that regard, it must form part of our political dialogue with the respective governments which are responsible in this respect.
Subject: Climate change
Does the Council still feel that the European Union's goal of keeping the global temperature rise to 2Â°C is likely to be met?
Has the Council discussed what additional measures need to be considered at EU level to meet the concerns expressed in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, as you know, the European leaders decided to send the international community a clear signal of their determination to combat climate change by assuming the following commitments, with a view to encouraging negotiations on a global agreement for the post-2012 period.
Until said agreement is reached, the European Union has made the firm and independent commitment to achieve, by 2020, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to at least 20% of 1990 levels.
Secondly, the European Union is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if the other developed countries make similar reductions and if the developing countries which are economically more advanced also make an appropriate contribution.
The European Union believes that it must take the lead in terms of ambitious emissions reductions so that the developed countries can convince the developing countries to contribute to the global effort.
Clearly, an ambitious target will also reinforce the global carbon market which must remain in place in order to limit the costs resulting from emissions reductions.
Various measures have already been taken under the European Climate Change Programme and others are planned within the strategic analysis of energy policy in the European Union in order to achieve a significant part of the greenhouse gas reduction target.
The emissions trading scheme will play a central role in achieving the EU's long-term targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and its analysis will be vital in realising the overall targets set for the European Union.
Thank you, President-in-Office, for that quite encouraging response.
You said you want to send a strong signal and that we need a global agreement.
I was interested to hear about a 30% target.
I agree with you that we need to be ambitious.
Of course, this is an area that not only affects most European citizens but also one about which they are very concerned.
I wonder if you could outline a little bit more about your thinking on what positive real steps we could be taking to encourage those countries that ought to be able to do more - like the United States - and to assist those countries - whether it is China, India or Russia - that are perhaps struggling at the moment.
What more could we actually be doing to push this process forward, rather than talking?
I am not suggesting that is all you were doing, but, rather than just talking about the issue, what are we actually going to do to make it happen?
(PT) The tools available to the European Union are diplomatic tools and also our conviction and, shall we say, political determination.
I feel that the best way of persuading others to follow us is to set the pace and lead by example, which is exactly what we are doing.
Clearly, by setting ourselves ambitious targets which correspond to what our citizens expect of us, we are leading by example, not only within the Union but also globally.
This inspires public opinion in other countries which in turn forces the respective governments to take measures on a par with our ambitious targets.
As regards the United States, this leadership effect has, in my opinion, been very evident.
The example set by the European Union in this respect at world level has led to pressure being applied by US society on the respective authorities in the sense that they must also be more ambitious.
My personal view is that Mr Al Gore having received the Nobel Peace Prize for climate change issues has a lot to do with this, with our ambitious policy, with our desire for change, with our desire to make others commit to our targets, all of course in a context of multilateral diplomacy via the United Nations.
Could I urge Parliament to show leadership by turning off the air conditioning, because I am frozen and it might help our contribution to climate change?
President-in-Office, you have answered one of the questions I wanted to ask, but it will probably take more than Al Gore to get the public engaged in this.
I would therefore ask the Council to outline how it intends to translate public concern into public action within the European Union, and also to take into account that we do not want to stop the developing world making progress, because we are actually gaining from the fact that they are developing.
We will try to solve this problem of the temperature in this House.
(PT) Mrs McGuinness, thank you for your question.
What we must do is engage in a constant campaign of awareness-raising and information.
We must also lead by example.
This has been done.
Clearly there still remains much to be done, but I feel that the process of raising awareness among people of the climate change issue is increasingly gaining ground because the effects can be seen every day, they are real and people can feel them.
I could mention my own personal experience, if it would be of any interest.
The climate in Portugal when I was six or seven years old is not the same as it is today when I am fifty.
In fact, I have observed, as have others, that things have changed.
As a result, people are asking why things have changed and what are the consequences of these changes.
On the other hand, the Member States must adopt the legislation needed to deal with, halt or minimise the causes of climate change.
The Member States have made political commitments at EU level and must now make the commitment to adopt the legislation needed and ensure that this legislation is effectively observed.
Once again, we must lead by example at world level.
I would not wish to underestimate the campaign of former Vice President Al Gore as I believe that this has had a significant impact on public opinion worldwide.
Subject: Turmoil in global financial markets
During a recent informal meeting of the EU Finance Ministers (Porto 14-15 September) the crisis that has arisen in Europe because of instability in US financial markets was discussed.
Could the Council outline the nature of these discussions?
Did the Council consider the particular case of Northern Rock which is currently experiencing financial difficulties as a direct result of instability in the US?
Does the Council consider that this matter has broader implications for Europe's financial markets?
Finally, is the Council satisfied that existing safeguards in the financial services arena provide adequate protection to consumers, particularly those who have purchased financial products outside their 'home' Member State?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, what I have to say on this issue is as follows.
At the informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors which was held in the Portuguese city of Porto on 14 and 15 September, various issues were discussed, including developments in the economic and financial situation.
As indicated on the Portuguese Presidency's website, our assessment is in two parts.
On the one hand, we believe that we are experiencing a period of volatility and re-appraisal of risk in global financial markets, triggered by difficulties in the subprime mortgage market in the United States which have been passed on to the global financial system through complex financial instruments.
The functioning of the money markets has also been affected and this has required prompt and firm action by the main central banks, including the European Central Bank.
On the other hand, although it is undeniable that the financial turbulence has heightened uncertainty about economic prospects, the macro-economic fundamentals in the European Union are strong and world growth remains robust, despite the slowdown in the US.
European financial institutions appear to be strong and their healthy profitability in recent years ensures that they are in a position to weather the current period of increased volatility in the financial markets.
However, I would point out that specific cases in the Member States were not discussed.
During this assessment, we also discussed the lessons that may be drawn from recent financial market volatility.
It was stressed that, although we have a sound regulatory and supervisory framework in the financial sector which has been reinforced by recent legislation such as the implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive and by the work in hand on the Solvency II Directive, we must remain alert, particularly in light of the rapid and innovative developments in the area of financial products.
Accordingly, the recent episode of financial turbulence has increased the urgency of certain issues which are still on the Council's agenda and has heightened the need for the European Union to find, alongside its international partners, ways of reinforcing transparency, improving valuation processes, continuing to reinforce risk management and improving market functioning, particularly with regard to complex financial products.
The Ecofin Council on 9 October agreed on a detailed work programme to be carried out until the end of 2008 by relevant bodies at EU level, in strict cooperation with the main international partners.
At the same Ecofin Council meeting in October, conclusions were also adopted on reinforcing financial stability mechanisms in the European Union.
These conclusions are available on the Council's website and are the tangible result of over a year's preparation.
In particular the Council adopted a set of common principles to guide cooperation between national authorities in the area of financial stability.
In addition, it was agreed to extend the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation and Exchange of Information signed in 2005 between EU Banking Supervisory Authorities, Central Banks and Finance Ministries in order to include three new elements: firstly, the common principles formally adopted at the meeting; secondly, a common analytical framework for the assessment of systemic implications of a potential crisis and, thirdly, common practical guidelines on procedures to be followed in potential cross-border crisis situations.
A work programme was therefore defined with a timetable for this and other actions to be carried out in order to reinforce the effectiveness of the financial stability mechanisms in the European Union.
Clearly, all this work is intended to protect consumers and investors who depend on the proper functioning of the financial markets.
Please allow me to conclude by highlighting that, as I understand it, the Council, together with the European Parliament and the Commission, subscribes to the goal of achieving effective levels of prudential supervision and regulation in order to ensure financial stability, global competitiveness and consumer protection.
Thank you, President-in-Office.
I shall have to study your very detailed response, which is one that I appreciate because this is a very serious issue.
One would have to agree that the confidence of depositors in Northern Rock has been shattered, and that there is a knock-on effect.
Confidence is indeed the key to stability in the banking system and also to cross-border services and business in the financial services sector.
Do you think that the actions you have outlined are enough to restore that confidence?
(PT) The Council can always surprise the Members.
As I said, the Ecofin Council asked a working group to analyse the situation in great depth and detail and also any new instruments or measures which might in the future prevent situations such as these from affecting the European financial markets.
It is therefore alert to the problems as it has asked the competent bodies to carry out detailed work.
It has asked this working group to propose the measures which might need to be adopted in order to prevent situations such as the one we have seen recently.
We will have to wait and see whether or not these measures prove effective in practice.
However, the Council will be advised of the measures which might have to be taken in order to prevent our economy from being affected in the future by any further financial turmoil.
I must mention that this issue was also covered at the Informal Meeting of Heads of State and Government which was held in Lisbon last week.
At this meeting the following message was heavily underlined by our Heads of State and Government: firstly, that the European economy is presenting what the economists call 'good fundamentals', in other words our economies remain sound, and, secondly, that it supports the measures which have been taken by Ecofin and which are proposed in this area.
Subject: Growing number of European agencies
There are currently 23 European agencies, spread over a number of EU countries and cities.
There is scarcely any scrutiny of their activities or operation.
The latest agency set up is the Agency for Fundamental Rights, which has its seat in Vienna and currently employs 100 people.
The purpose of the agency is to monitor the protection of human rights in the European Union, although this task is already perfectly taken care of by the European Court of Human Rights and, in fact, also the Council of Europe, both of which have their seat in Strasbourg.
All these agencies spend around 1 billion euros a year of taxpayers' money.
Some observers take the view that hardly a European Council summit goes by without a new agency being set up.
Does the Council intend to set up more new agencies?
Is the need to set up an agency carefully considered in each case?
Is the Council aware of the financial impact on the European budget?
Is the Council prepared to abolish some agencies if their existence is not justified?
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Van Hecke, I would point out that questions on setting up and closing down Community agencies should be put to the Commission which has the exclusive right of initiative in this respect.
The legislative bodies, Parliament and the Council, act solely on the basis of proposals presented by the Commission.
As regards the Council, the honourable Member may be sure that the need to set up a new agency is carefully considered in each case.
As for the budgetary aspects of agencies, I would refer the honourable Member to the Joint Statement of 18 April 2007 in which the three institutions agreed on a common set of principles for the budgetary management of existing or future Community agencies.
(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister for his reply.
My concern in putting this question was twofold: first, the explosion in the number of agencies opened up after each Council session; 12 new agencies in five years, with an increase in the number of staff working for these agencies from 166 to 3 700.
The second part to this question is: does the Council re-evaluate the need to retain these agencies on a regular basis, when the reason for their existence may no longer be evident?
My second concern is how does the Council itself organise its internal control over the expenditure of all these agencies, and what role does he see for Parliament in this?
(PT) Mr Van Hecke, as I have already mentioned, the proposal to set up an agency is presented by the European Commission and then, in dialogue with the Commission, the Council assesses whether or not the Commission's proposal is justified.
Decisions are then taken in accordance with the Treaty rules.
I must say that Portugal hosts one agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency which has its seat in Lisbon, which we feel is definitely a very useful European agency.
As regards the specific management of agencies, as you know, these have their own supervision mechanisms which, in my view, are pretty rigorous.
In addition, the institutions have also agreed, as I mentioned, a set of common principles which very directly apply to the budgetary management of these Community agencies.
