This means in short that globalisation is a challenge but also a great opportunity.
It is a challenge in the sense that opening-up means more growth, more welfare and more employment, and this is something we must explain to European citizens.
What concerns me again is hearing the word 'protect' in this Chamber.
Protectionism is a denial of globalisation and a denial of the European Union.
Protecting citizens is not necessary when they are the protagonists of their own economic growth and their own well-being.
We must hand that ability back to the people and we must therefore also conduct an exercise in self-criticism in the European Union.
This is because we in the European Union are not doing what we must when our growth is inadequate, when we also have our share of responsibility for the crisis in world financial markets and, in short, when we do not do everything we must at home, on our own doorstep, to foster economic growth among small and medium-sized enterprises and create more employment, because we need much more employment than the process of opening up the economy will be able to provide.
The Lisbon Agenda is really a marker: achieving the internal market, putting public finances in order, reforming, modernising our labour market, committing ourselves to environmental reform, renewable energy and in short opening Europe up really means greater social cohesion in Europe.
(ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think it most appropriate for the debate on globalisation to have taken place under the Portuguese Presidency because Portugal is a country whose flag is on the map, because the Portuguese were at the forefront when we Europeans began globalisation, and because globalisation is not a plague upon our heads.
The Europeans began the process of globalisation during the Renaissance, when we were less developed than the Chinese and the Indians, and that is how we are seen in the rest of the world.
Now, with the Treaty of Lisbon, we will also be pioneers in what I would call 'post-imperial globalisation'.
We are not going to conquer new continents; what we are doing is giving a response in which we bring together, of our own volition, the values shared between States and peoples and we can be an example of the type of globalisation which is most needed, namely political and social globalisation.
Here we have talked about impetuous, uncontrolled financial globalisation despite the fact that we have, for example, a European at the head of the International Monetary Fund.
We are the principal bloc at the WTO and have a specific responsibility.
What is missing?
What is missing is precisely for us to be able to find answers in a globalised world which are in line with this.
Specifically, there are two very important, challenging aspects on which we must be very active: not only in terms of trade and technological development but in the universal defence of human rights, especially workers' rights, for which the International Labour Organisation exists, and also the negotiations and policies necessary to tackle climate change.
In any event, Madam President, and on this I shall close, I believe that we Europeans have no right to hold a pessimistic view of globalisation.
We sought it and must now come up with innovative answers.
(PL) Madam President, Mr President, it is obvious that we will not be able to solve all the problems of globalisation with one statement and one measure to promote the Lisbon Strategy.
However, the statement of the Council and of the Commission is good because it draws attention to the fact that globalisation is not a curse and does not have to be a threat, in fact, it could be something positive for the citizens of Europe, and that it is the citizens and their activities that should be the principal guide behind the actions of the EU.
I am in favour of four areas of activity.
First of all, the knowledge triangle, particularly innovation, and I understand that here it is essential to act quickly in order at least to launch the European Technological Institute.
Secondly, the business environment, and this means a fully open and free internal market without monopolies, with open competition, less regulation and less bureaucracy, which is something that the Vice-President of the Commission, GÃŒnter Verheugen, is fighting for so courageously.
Thirdly, human resources, entailing the problems of migration and, primarily, counteracting the brain drain, which means better education, attractive investments, and a social dimension to the EU based on the achievements of the economy.
Fourthly and finally, energy and climate change, which means a common energy policy, which I believe is something we are all aware of, and reductions of emissions.
However, there is no way that a reduction in greenhouse gases in the European Union alone can save the world's climate.
For this reason we need to have an EU that is politically strong because only a strong EU can influence the United States, China and India towards compliance with climate protection guidelines.
As regards a reduction of emissions in the EU - yes, I am in favour, but I am also in favour of an EU that is politically strong and this means full ratification of the European Treaty as quickly as possible.
Madam President, hopefully, and I say hopefully, the Lisbon Treaty is going to represent the closing of a chapter in the history of the European Union, the chapter of the growth of the EU, the consolidation and peace and stability on the continent, the dismantling of trade and economic barriers between Member States, and the institutional development which was needed to achieve those things.
Now, though, we need to open a new chapter, a chapter of looking outwards, of rising to the challenges of globalisation.
We need a global Europe which sets a completely new agenda for globalisation, resting on the principles of openness, fairness and the importance of cooperation between Member States.
We know what the challenges are - they have been well explored in this debate.
Climate change and migration are, in my view, the two biggest, but we need to maintain high growth and jobs.
We need to have a modern effective social agenda.
We need to deal with terrorism and crime and promoting security beyond our borders and dealing with poverty.
And indeed, as Ms Bowles has said, we do have policies towards those.
But let us be frank: progress has been slow, it has been uneven and it has not always been very effective.
If we really are to deal with globalisation, we need a radical and fundamental shift, not only in our policies but in our entire thinking in the European Union.
We have to focus now simply on action and delivery.
We have to ensure that Member States fulfil their promises, because we have an EU framework.
What we do not have are 27 Member States that all do as they say they are going to do, and our focus must now be on delivering on promises and fulfilling all the potential that the EU has.
(DE) Madam President, sum up globalisation in two minutes - well, here goes!
My first request is that we deal a little more honestly with the subject of globalisation in our discussions.
My native region of Bavaria earns half of its GDP from exports.
Many people are critical of globalisation, but if we asked them whether they agreed that their local companies should not be allowed to serve the world market any more, they would say 'no'.
Likewise, if we turned to the public galleries and asked whether anyone was prepared to give up the opportunity to buy competitively priced goods - be they electrical appliances, textiles or other products - there would be no volunteers.
Everyone knows that imports from low-cost countries are the reason for the low inflation rates of recent years.
It is only right and proper to acknowledge that, even if we regularly speak of globalisation as a threat.
Europe must shape the globalisation process, for it has been benefiting our manufacturers as well as our consumers.
That is the purpose, for instance, of eliminating red tape, which is an important objective both for Commissioner Verheugen and for Europe.
I do not wish to imply that this is a task for the Commission alone; I am also referring to Parliament and the Council.
We are speaking about globalisation now, but afterwards we shall be adopting the Soil Protection Directive and creating more red tape.
In short, our actions need to be rigorously consistent in Europe, and it is our mission to shape Europe.
When we consider the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, we need to realise that international financial markets are intertwined and that we Europeans must help to make things happen.
How do we deal with rating agencies, and how do we deal with hedge funds?
Regrettably, Commissioner McCreevy, who is responsible for these matters, has not yet taken the lead in the movement to rein in the Americans and other markets, and so Europe is lagging behind.
Nevertheless, I firmly believe that Europe is well prepared for globalisation.
We are benefiting from it, which we must explain to the public, and we must press for minimum standards, although these would not be European standards, and then we shall be prepared and fit to win the globalisation game.
Whether or not globalisation takes place is not determined in Brussels or Strasbourg.
(HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I speak as a representative of a region that was not able to choose its fate after the war.
There was barbed wire between our country and the luckier part of Europe, but not even that was able to stop the unexpected effects of globalisation.
In 2000 we started to familiarise ourselves with competitiveness and solidarity in the strategy for work and workers, and in the Lisbon Strategy.
Since then, the balance has tipped in favour of capital recovery many times and it came to be feared that the human face of the strategy was becoming obscured.
Competitiveness and work are incontrovertibly and historically inseparable concepts, and we are starting to realise that worthwhile work is only part of a worthwhile life.
A worthwhile life also includes basic security, a contribution to a healthy life and development, a lack of discrimination and acceptable living conditions.
But Europe should not only view itself as defending values, but also as shaping the dreams of generations, creating an opportunity for European citizens and for those coming from third countries who want to make things.
And it is for precisely this reason that solidarity should not merely remain a slogan; it should be the chance for people who are able to make things, or to enable them to do so.
Ladies and gentlemen, the labour market and the capital that demands a return is ruthlessly selective, and new human resources require investment at a price greater than capital, whose movement is ever easier, can acquire labour.
The Europe of values cannot accept that those starting their careers, the elderly, those who are isolated by poverty, those forced to learn new skills, and the gypsies who carry the burden of many kinds of disadvantage, will not have work.
Especially so that the burden of disadvantage should not weigh heavily on the shoulders of coming generations, the Community funds spent on us not only keep them within the framework of a worthwhile life, but also continue to increase the prospects of European competitiveness.
Thank you, Madam President.
- (EL) Madam President, the conclusion that is naturally drawn from the debate is that projecting the European model onto the global 'megascreen' entails both risks and opportunities.
As a rule, globalisation is perceived by European citizens as an external phenomenon: it has no obvious European regulatory or political intervention.
It is therefore up to the European plan of action to show that a visible, measurable European interest is indeed being defended, while at the same time promoting global understanding.
As regards the Union's external commercial agenda, my view is that priority should among other things be given to ensuring terms of market access reciprocity and competition on equal terms, as the French President, Mr Sarkozy, emphatically pointed out yesterday in this House.
The strict European regulatory framework for environmental protection and public health protection for consumers and workers is a significant indication of the Union's political and institutional maturity.
However, if this is not to be a protracted competitive disadvantage for the Union, it must meet with an equivalent response from other leading international players.
The give and take between the internal and external aspects of the Lisbon Strategy will help to promote the European model in the global arena of governance. However, it clashes with a lower degree of regulatory rigour and legally binding completeness in both the WTO and other international organisations.
The Union is called upon to play a leading and constructive role at an increased level of international cooperation.
It is called upon to prioritise the undertaking of binding obligations and the adoption of international standards in the interests of upwardly escalating regulatory convergence.
Madam President, this has been a very wide-ranging debate and at the end I would like to bring it back to a focus on social policy as a productive factor.
The launch of the integrated guideline package was supposed to lead to a balanced delivery of the economic, social and sustainability strands of the Lisbon process but in practice, when it comes to the employment guidelines, it has been a case not of integration but of subordination.
The employment guidelines have become virtually invisible, hiding the very wide variability in Member State performance against the range of indicators and targets they are supposed to meet under the employment strategy on youth unemployment, integration of older workers - a range of factors.
In some Member States, spending on lifelong learning and active labour market measures has actually declined over the last five years - not improved but declined.
That is disastrous for the Lisbon process overall.
The employment strategy therefore needs to be given much greater visibility in the next Lisbon cycle.
One other point - the joint resolution that we are debating here today in several places emphasises the need to deliver decent work and to focus on improving the quality of work.
This focus is not helped by the Commission's concentration on the idea of employment security as opposed to job security, which is repeated in both the Green Paper on labour law and the communication on flexicurity.
In our work on flexicurity in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs we make clear that both employment security and job security are important.
What a fast changing flexible firm needs - a firm changing its production line every six months, its IT configuration every four months - is an adaptable, skilled, loyal and dedicated workforce, not a casualised and fragmented labour market.
So we will do our best to help produce a good set of principles on flexicurity but they must then lead to an amendment to the guidelines.
President Barroso said earlier, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'.
Well, it is broken and it needs fixing.
Madam President, I congratulate the Commission on an excellent paper and I would just like to highlight these four points.
The first one is on the knowledge economy.
I think the way this has been expressed in the paper, about the free movement of ideas and researchers being perhaps seen as 'the fifth freedom' of the EU, is a beautiful way of expressing it, and I would like to see that developed.
In reaction to what Mr Hughes has just said, I think this point really reflects where we are, debating in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that we want to move away from the idea of just simple job protection towards employment protection, by promoting employability and by strengthening skills; in that way, success for Europe in the age of globalisation can mean success for individuals - success for people - which is what the EU should be very much more about.
The second point concerns SMEs.
There is a reference to a wide range of new proposals for the end of 2008.
I welcome that, but there is a 'but': please let us not shift our focus towards new proposals for agreement tomorrow before we first focus on delivering against existing commitments for action today.
Here, particularly for Mr Verheugen, I would draw attention to this 25% reduction in simplification of existing EU legislation.
Let us please see some real delivery on this across the board, sooner rather than later, as this will particularly benefit SMEs.
I would encourage, in this context, a wholesale review of the Working Time Directive, where much more lateral thinking is required of us all - and I do mean of us all, including MEPs.
Thirdly, the single market: adding an external dimension is all very well, but let us get the internal dimension first, completing our own single market before we develop grand ambitions outside.
I would say to Mr Schulz, as well as to Mr Hughes, I agree absolutely that this is not just for our economic progress but also because this will deliver social progress.
Finally, on a more personal point, the only thing I really stumble over in the document is the very first line of the front page, which says 'Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions'.
I recognise that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions exist - although I am never clear why - but please do not elevate them to the same level as the two codecision institutions.
(SK) The phenomenon of globalisation is becoming more and more perceivable.
In such a situation, the European Union has to react fairly quickly and determine whether Europe's competitiveness has not only been preserved but whether it has also been growing; whether the Lisbon Strategy, the tool that is supposed to ensure that this happens, is capable of providing solutions in the areas of innovation, energy, migration, education and demography, in particular.
All of this must facilitate growth and the ability to create jobs.
New challenges are appearing in relation to the environment, such as CO2 emissions, the use of pesticides, concerns about clean water reserves and sources, the protection of soil and agriculture.
Last but not least, there are also challenges concerning health and epidemics, as well as fighting obesity, cardiovascular diseases and the growing occurrence of all types of cancer.
Ladies and gentlemen, globalisation brings further challenges in the areas of security and migration, and there is a growing danger relating to criminality and terrorism.
Very soon we will witness the fall of the last remains of the Iron Curtain and the divided Europe when nine new Member States join the Schengen area.
We have to do everything possible to guard this common area comprehensively so that illegal migrants, who aggravate the security situation in the Member States, cannot get in.
On the other hand, I am advocating a responsible approach in the area of work permits for legal migrants: we must think about it properly and we must choose qualified employees for the employment sectors most in need.
I also believe that the older Member States of the European Union - and I would like the Commission to take note of this - will do away with the nonsensical restrictions on the employment of citizens from the new Member States.
In today's situation this is an incomprehensible anachronism.
(FR) Madam President, the European Union cannot let itself become a victim of globalisation or give its people the impression that they are caught up in something they cannot influence.
So the question now is not whether globalisation is good or bad: it is whether we are prepared to bring our own weight to bear on it and to regulate it.
To face that challenge, the European Union needs to reconcile competitiveness and economic and social cohesion.
Strengthening multilateral rules is part of the process.
In an open economic system, the best way of ensuring that consumers' and citizens' right are respected is by observing the rules of competition and establishing a fair and equitable market, reflecting environmental and social standards.
Therefore, until we have a set of rules that are internationally recognised, it is crucial that we retain and do not water down our existing trade defence instruments, which are our only effective tools against dumping.
And yes, it is possible for Europe to protect its citizens without being protectionist.
Europe also needs to invest in those sectors that will determine its economic clout in the future: namely research, innovation and the development of clean technologies.
Furthermore, in order to support those who have most difficulty in benefiting from globalisation, Europe needs to step up its arrangements for putting solidarity into practice, for example through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and flexisecurity.
It is in Europe's interest, in terms of coping with international competition, to anticipate adaptation and to embark on reform.
The European Union possesses all the necessary capabilities and resources to meet the challenge.
(FI) Madam President, success in globalisation is vital for European prosperity: it is the producer of its material content.
Now that the three-year cycle for the renewed Lisbon Strategy is coming to an end, we need to focus attention on the external dimension in particular.
I wish in particular to highlight three elements.
Firstly, energy, its supply and sufficiency, raises and lowers the position of societies in the global competitive environment.
The situation in Europe does not seem to be a happy one.
The decline in energy self-sufficiency is a serious challenge for the EU.
Even now we import half of our energy from outside the EU and dependence on imports is predicted to grow.
In addition to making a determined effort to increase energy self-sufficiency, we need a strong foreign policy on energy, a common voice, solidarity and security of imports.
The second central issue is climate change, a global phenomenon, which is having a negative global impact on the environment, the economy and society, and which calls for global solutions.
Unilateral actions distort competition and cause carbon leakage.
The following assume prominence where globalisation is concerned: the inevitability of a global emissions trading scheme, the compulsory commitment to such an idea on the part of all industrialised countries and rising economies, and the removal of barriers to market access for clean technology.
Thirdly, the EU should always remember Schuman's brilliance, i.e. that in our success story the economy would be made to serve common objectives, the human good, peace and stability.
Our cultural tradition obliges us to strive for a more human world which respects human rights.
Only then can globalisation be in the interests of everyone.
Only then will we prevent the world from slipping out of our hands.
- (EL) Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, European citizens generally seem to be greeting the historic phenomenon of globalisation with scepticism - many of them, indeed, with fear and an entirely negative attitude.
This is because of the revolution taking place in the global economy and the social fabric of Europe.
Prejudice, fear and above all inaction and passive observation of developments are, however, no way to face the new order on the world stage.
The situation cannot be reversed.
Globalisation is here to stay, whether we like it or not.
The great global village is being built, as President Barroso said.
The EU has European interests to protect.
It must therefore become involved in a methodical, planned, collective and dynamic manner in the globalisation process, in order to develop proper rules of operation in the new world system.
The EU must move forward; it must aim for the wellbeing both of European citizens, of course, and of world citizens.
As a commonwealth of principles and values, the EU must give pride of place to its human-centred character and promote it internationally.
It must convert economic competition into genuine emulation to promote freedom, democracy, the principle of legality, social justice, respect for human rights, environmental protection and the peaceful coexistence of nations and individuals.
This is the role that the EU can and must play in the process of globalisation.
(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes none too soon.
Globalisation is a fact.
Every generation has its own challenges, so they say.
Well, the challenge for us is to respond as best we can to the new circumstances brought about by globalisation.
The best response is of course not to resist globalisation - as some would still have us do.
We cannot and we do not seek to.
That would in any case be particularly counterproductive for us in Europe since more than anyone we depend on the rest of the world for raw materials, energy, markets to sell what we produce and even, given our ageing population, labour.
Our response must be to go along with globalisation and shape it better.
That means concluding agreements and setting rules internationally.
As Europe, we are well schooled in concluding intra-Community agreements.
So let us use this experience to give more of a lead internationally.
We should do that, Madam President, with the necessary self-confidence and inspired by the values which also inspire our actions within the EU, the values we have expressed so well in the Reform Treaty and Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday's assurance that the Commission Legislative and Work Programme 2008 is focused on the desire to shape globalisation to best effect is a good sign, a sign that things are getting serious.
The fact that globalisation was also a topic discussed at the informal Lisbon summit indicates that the Lisbon Strategy needs a new external dimension.
As group coordinator on the Lisbon Strategy I would emphasise that this strategy has galvanised us into action.
Gradually, in fits and starts, we are now getting somewhere.
The first three-year cycle following the mid-term review has almost ended and maybe a new adjustment is needed.
I would suggest, Madam President, that from now on we focus less on targets, percentages and statistics and more on the real objectives: innovation, a good business climate, competitiveness, growth, and more and better jobs.
Ultimately we must work towards the goal which hopefully we all share, namely good chances of a decent quality of life for as many people as possible.
(CS) Europe's ability in the past to cope with the modern age has to be admired, but when it comes to globalisation we are not sure how to find an adequate strategy that would enable Europe to play a key role.
The first step in this search is to understand that the Lisbon Strategy lacks an external dimension and that it will have to become a part of a more complex economic and social strategy.
This strategy should properly identify the conflict between the highly regulated European economy and liberalised global trade, and should give us a tool to minimise this conflict, which makes Europe much less competitive.
The two reasons that justify regulation inside a common economic area are fair competition and a high level of consumer protection.
However, both of these are being increasingly eroded by floods of cheap goods from third countries and counterfeit items.
We are facing frightening tasks, such as checks on the gigantic volume of imported goods that do not comply with European safety standards.
The key point of our complex strategy must be to promote the convergence of regulatory mechanisms, in other words the creation of global rules and standards, not only technical but also ecological, social and safety rules and standards.
One way to help this process is to insist constantly on respect for human rights in third countries.
Freedom of speech will enable the citizens of these countries to demand higher living and working standards, and thus contribute to convergence from the other side.
Our new energy policy provides a good response to the challenge of globalisation and sets a good example.
However, we need to revise other policies, too, which will subsequently become part of an appropriate and complex strategy for the managing globalisation.
We have to do away with relicts such as the agricultural policy, for example.
If we want to continue to be an important player on the global stage, we must not just react: we must actively cooperate in setting up global convergence rules both within and outside the EU.
Europe must change slightly.
If not, we can expect to meet the fate of the boiled frog: the water will come to the boil very gradually and then it will be to late to leap out of the pot.
(DE) Madam President, one of the previous speakers, Alexander Radwan, said that Europe was well prepared for globalisation, yet the modern-day version of globalisation has already been with us for eighteen years.
We, meanwhile, are sliding straight from the globalisation trap - the talk of what used to be, the reversal of mass prosperity and the onslaught against democracy - into the European trap, a product of the political original sin of failing to secure a decent treaty back in Nice, where overhasty enlargement was preferred to deeper union.
As a result, the core of today's problems consists in bureaucracy, wastage of billions of euros and - yes - mistakes in the political recruitment of Europe's elites.
Indeed, you yourself, Commissioner Verheugen, are a case in point.
The despicable personal attacks on you began when you tried to bring the bureaucracy under control.
Now there is a new man, and they are already trying to pull the carpet from under his feet.
We shall see what progress he manages to make on red tape.
This is no way to proceed.
If we cannot cure these ills, the Union will remain in the grip of political paralysis, and the challenges of globalisation will defeat us.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this has indeed been a long and full debate, and of all those I have taken part in here on behalf of the Presidency, this one had the longest list of participants and Members to have given their opinion.
This is clearly a highly topical issue of major importance, but let there be no illusions that it is also a difficult and controversial one that has generated a broad variety of opinions, analyses and comments.
I take there to be a common conclusion, however, which is that globalisation is here to stay and to develop and to manifest itself in new ways.
There is no turning back, there are no steps backward, we cannot reverse history.
Globalisation itself is the result of our march towards the future.
What we must do, what we must analyse and what we must decide naturally concerns how to make the most of and get the greatest benefit from globalisation, while reducing or eliminating all the known risks associated with it and always bearing in mind - a very important point for me - that globalisation must be at the service of humankind and citizens rather than the other way round.
It is not humankind, citizens or human beings who must be at the service of globalisation.
There is also little doubt that to be able to make the most of and take full advantage of what globalisation has to offer, we in Europe must equip our enterprises, whether large or small and medium-sized, with tools and policies enabling them to face the challenges of economic globalisation.
We must raise qualifications and train European citizens and we must also reform our social model.
It is not a question of reducing or weakening that model, quite the contrary in fact.
We must reinforce it and adapt it so that it can successfully meet the challenges and threats that globalisation raises.
In the environmental field it must be recognised that the European Union has proved itself in protecting the environment, and it has proved its capacity to lead and point the way to the future like no other regional bloc in the world has done.
The negotiations that will begin in Bali in December will clearly demonstrate this.
Finally, I must also refer to the 'external dimension' of the Lisbon Strategy, which is so closely linked to globalisation.
The idea is to invite others who share this pathway, these difficulties and these challenges of globalisation to share economic, social and environmental values and principles with us, and naturally to make it very clear that globalisation will be successful for everyone only if we can actually agree on a social, economic and environmental world which is truly regulated for and at the service of all.
This aspect is fundamental.
Let us not be naÃ¯ve, ladies and gentlemen.
We believe that with solid policies, solid principles and solid values, we can as I have said really achieve what is a fundamental objective for us: globalisation at the service of humanity.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Communication from the Commission on the European interest that has served as the basis for today's debate is nothing more than a kind of discussion paper.
It is not the Lisbon plan for the next three years.
It is a document which is intended to stimulate discussion in the European Council and the European Parliament, so that the Commission can feed the results of that discussion into its proposals for the next Lisbon cycle.
These proposals will not be made until December.
They are not yet on the table, and so those honourable Members who criticised the Commission for not having presented any tangible proposals were labouring under a misapprehension.
That is not what today's debate was about.
The Commission's aim was to find out what you, the representatives of the European voters, have to bring to the Commission's attention for the formulation of the Lisbon plan.
I am pleased to say that I can respond favourably to much of what has been said here.
The guidelines will remain the core instrument of the new Lisbon package.
As President Barroso made clear, the instrument has worked, and we shall not change the instrument as such, but it will, of course, be formulated so as to enable us to take due account of the experiences of the past three years and to attach greater weight to the issues that have come to the fore during that period.
Let me cite a few examples.
We shall have to place greater emphasis on the connections between competitiveness, energy and the environment.
There have been several requests to that effect in today's debate.
That is entirely correct.
It is time to stop considering policies in isolation.
We need a fully joined-up approach.
We must attach greater importance to the formulation of firm proposals designed to ensure that global competition, which is certainly what we want, takes place on a level playing field with the same rules for everyone.
We must devote more attention to finding ways for social policy to underpin structural change.
In today's debate, there seemed to be a cross-party view that this is the real big issue, and indeed that view is justified.
Let me say something on that subject.
I believe it is wrong to see investments in social stability and social security as nothing more than charitable handouts.
On the contrary, they are also investments in economic potential, for there can surely be no doubt that Europe's economic potential depends on a highly motivated and highly efficient labour force, and the reason why we possess this asset is that we have high wage levels and a high level of social security.
It is not the case that economic growth and social welfare are mutually incompatible.
In actual fact, as several speakers have said today, each complements and nurtures the other.
I regard that as a major consideration.
I should also point out that, if only because more and more regions and sectors are suffering from a lack of trained and skilled labour, the question of employability must be addressed far more forcefully than hitherto.
So I believe we are on the same wavelength in many of these matters.
The Commission, let me add, shares the view that the turbulence we have recently been experiencing in the financial markets calls for international, multilateral action.
Things cannot simply be allowed to run their course because what we have here, as has been said, is an inbuilt structural defect in the international financial system.
It is not about human error on the part of those managers who are now being put out to grass with severance packages worth 100 to 200 million dollars; no, it is the result of a structural defect.
I would like to make another three brief comments on the keynote debate that has taken place here today on the subject of globalisation.
Firstly, it is so difficult to forge a common European policy on the basis of this debate because there is no agreement as to what the European interest actually is.
In our everyday work, in fact, we are constantly confronted with a kaleidoscopic definition of Europe's interests.
Depending on the situation at any given time, Europe's interest may lie in low supermarket prices in one Member State or in a high level of industrial employment in another, and this is a conflict of aims which is not easily resolved.
Europe's interest may lie in a high level of employment in the steel industry in LiÃšge, to cite a very topical example, or in high environmental standards in European emissions trading.
We are continually faced with these conflicts, and there is no uniform line that 27 Member States can follow in order to define their common European interest.
Secondly, we cannot adopt the attitude that globalisation was fine as long as it meant the poor countries of the South being dominated by the rich countries of the North, that it was good as long as those circumstances obtained but is bad when the countries of the South become competitors.
That is no way to react.
Nor is it acceptable to come up with demands for high environmental and social standards in the developing regions while refusing to change our own policies.
What I am hearing in Europe today is that China and India must change their environmental and social standards.
So they must, of course, but the Chinese and Indians perceive such demands as pure European protectionism, as we rose to prosperity with the aid of low social standards and low environmental standards, and now we are telling others that we want to keep what we have but that they cannot have the same.
Such a policy, ladies and gentlemen, is doomed to failure, I can assure you.
The only viable approach for us is to demonstrate to these developing economies that there is another way, that it is possible to turn the environmental and social challenge into an economic opportunity.
Hence the term 'environmental industrial policy'.
I believe we are largely in agreement on that point, and against that backdrop the Commission will now work hard to present its proposals for the next Lisbon cycle.
These will then be dealt with at the spring meeting of the Council in March, which gives the European Parliament ample opportunity to voice its opinion on the specific initiatives and proposals before the final decision is taken in March of next year.
(Applause)
Thank you for the summing-up, Commissioner.
I have received seven motions for resolution in accordance with Article 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - (HU) Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the consequence of developing globalisation is that more and more countries become democratic and switch on to free global trade.
As such, it shows the success of Europe's half-century policy of peace and democracy.
On the other hand, the fact that some countries sometimes gain an advantage in international trade by using illegal instruments is a sign that the switch-over to constitutionality is gradual and is not perfect immediately.
It is for precisely this reason that Europe's goal should continue to be the promotion and reinforcement of democracy.
How successful we will be in the global competition arising from this depends on us.
As the author of the Parliament's report on globalisation, I know that we have recognised the challenges, and it is time for action.
We must think about the fact that the prosperity we have today should remain for our grandchildren, and in such a way that in the meantime the other peoples of the world should develop in this way.
Will they have energy?
Will they have an inhabitable environment?
This is what the European energy policy and the building of a 'low-carbon' economy are about.
We must ensure that every person in Europe, irrespective of their origin and situation, and every business, irrespective of their size and registered office, can develop all their talents and their best abilities.
This is what equal opportunities, the building of a knowledge-based society, innovation policy and the new European SME policy are about.
We must switch over to the digital age, for which we must implement e-inclusion in all areas and for everyone.
In short, we have all the tools ready; we just have to do it.
Let us get to work!
in writing. - (PL) Globalisation is an unstoppable process, but the success of the European Union in this globalisation is not a foregone conclusion.
For certain, the Lisbon Strategy, implemented as it has been so far, is no recipe for success.
In fact, it is just a paper strategy and even at the halfway stage, in 2005, it was clear that the main objective, which was the race against the USA in the areas of competitiveness and innovation, had not been achieved.
In the meantime other challenges have presented themselves in the form of the economic offensive from China, India and other Asian countries.
So far, the multitude of sensible objectives have hidden the fact that there is not the political courage to undertake structural reforms at national level, which is the level at which the possibility of an innovative and dynamic Europe is decided.
Due to the lack of this courage, the European Union is looking for replacement solutions.
For example, by placing its hope in a radical change in the Community budget, meaning increasing public expenditure on research and development.
This is not enough if it does not go hand in hand with an ability to take risks together with support for innovative companies from the private financial sector.
A solution in the form of the European Institute of Technology illustrates the tendency towards institutional solutions, while the Globalisation Adjustment Fund shows the extent of exaggerated European concerns.
The proper response to the challenge of globalisation is full market liberalisation and courageous reform of the European social model.
in writing. - In order to succeed in this era of globalisation, the European Union needs to develop a Foreign Direct Investment Policy for Europe.
We need a policy to cover:
Incoming Foreign Direct Investment, that is direct investment into the European Union and originating anywhere else in the world;
Outgoing Foreign Direct Investment, that is direct investment anywhere in the world originating in the European Union; and
Internal Foreign Direct Investment, that is direct investment in any European Union Member State originating in any other European Union Member State.
It is true that we have elements of such a policy, such as the Seventh Framework Programme, which provides the conditions to attract research and development investment.
But this is only one part, albeit an important one, of the story.
Facts and figures show the immense importance of foreign direct investment in today's world economy, or Europe's foreign direct investment position in relation to the rest of the world.
These facts show that if we are to put any real strength in the Lisbon goals, we need an overall FDI Policy for Europe to reap the maximum benefits of FDI for our people.
in writing. - Nowadays Europeans don't find it at all strange to backpack in Latin America, chat online with friends from Africa and order cds from US.
Because of globalisation, the world is shrinking.
Especially the young generation regards Europe as the backyard and the globe as just the hometown.
Still the term globalisation has a bad ring to it.
A common fear is that due to globalisation, countries with low labour costs will deprive Europe of jobs.
The EU has a significant role in changing these attitudes.
And it has - by proving that together the member states are strong enough to not only survive globalisation but even gain from it.
As mentioned in the statement, Europe is the worlds' largest exporter of goods and services and the second largest destination of foreign direct investment.
And talking about employment: in 2006 altogether 3,5 million new jobs were created!
Sure, there are things to improve: Europe's innovation policy would do with a boosting, global market regulation is needed and climate change prevention should not be only Europe's problem.
Still, all in all, I have no doubt that the EU will pass the test of globalisation with flying colours.

Deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (implementing powers conferred on the Commission) (vote)
- Report: Gyula Hegyi
- Before the vote:
rapporteur. - Mr President, I do not want to steal my colleagues' time, but as we did not have a plenary debate and we have reached the first reading discussion, I would like to inform you about the basic elements of the new legislation on GMOs.
The compromise package gives Parliament the right to control the deliberate release of GMOs.
Parliamentary control means transparency on this sensitive issue.
The Eurobarometer opinion poll showed that, with regard to GMOs, 94% of our citizens want the right to choose, 86% want to know more before consuming GMOs and 71% simply do not want GMO food.
That is why our greatest success is that the Council and the Commission have agreed to Parliamentary control of the implementation of the labelling requirements of GMOs.
I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency.
Having greater openness on genetically modified organisms makes Europe more democratic.

EU-Russia summit (vote)

- Before the vote:
(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the discussion on the compromise version of this resolution, we had precisely 16 minutes to submit amendments and to review the results of our work.
I believe that this undermines the rights of every Member of this House and every political group in this House to be able freely to influence the texts of our resolutions, including by submitting amendments.
I would ask that this situation should not be allowed to reoccur in the future.
- Before the vote on amendment 1:
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to propose the following amendment to Paragraph 6.
This will require a split vote.
The first sentence should be changed to read:
'emphasises that the situation in Chechnya continues to be a point of dissent in the relations between the EU and Russia'
(NL) replacing the text as it currently stands. The rapporteur is in agreement.
( The oral amendment was accepted)
- Before the vote on paragraph 23
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, we must allow the realities to speak for themselves, and the summit on Siberian overflights.
This has not taken place, so we ask that the reference to it in the text be replaced by a reference to the next summit.
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
- Before the vote on recital O:
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we speak about frozen conflicts.
We mention two conflicts - Abkhazia and South Ossetia - but I would like, on behalf of my Group, to introduce after 'frozen conflict' the phrase 'such as Transnistria', so that Transnistria is also mentioned in Recital O.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, Mr Swoboda has already informed you of our amendment, which was about Transnistria.

(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes)
Membership of political groups
I have today received letters from Ms Daniela BuruianÄ-Aprodu and Mr Cristian StÄnescu announcing their decision to leave the ITS Group.
Parliament takes note of this decision with effect from today, 14 November 2007.
Taken together with the announcements already made this week concerning three Members leaving the group, I conclude that the number of members of the ITS Group has now fallen below the minimum of 20 Members required to form a political group laid down by Rule 29(2).
(Loud applause)
Parliament therefore takes note of the fact that the ITS Group no longer fulfils the conditions of the Rules of Procedure for the formation of a Group.
As a consequence, the group ceases to exist with effect from the moment of this announcement.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, I should like to bring to your notice that, when I, like many other Members, was applauding your last announcement, Jean-Marie Le Pen made this hand gesture, signifying (EN) 'Fuck you!' (DE) directly at me.
May I ask you to check that on the video recording.
I believe such an action really must have consequences.
I find it appalling that anyone should behave towards me in such a downright aggressive manner.
Thank you, Mr Martin, I did not see it myself, but I take note of your point.
Explanations of vote
in writing. - Conservatives have supported the Vakalis report but have grave reservations about paragraphs 16 and 17.
We believe that both prevention and rapid reaction capabilities in relation to earthquakes should be concentrated on the resources of the Member States and do not support 'the establishment of a European Civil Protection Force.'
in writing. - I am in favour of this report on the regional impact of earthquakes.
As a geologist and oceanographer - in fact my thesis was on the seismicity of the mid-Atlantic ridge from 12Â°N to 20Â°S. I am all too well aware that the United Kingdom is almost immune.
According to records in the UK, only one person has died as the result of an earthquake and that was in the mid-seventeenth century.
Yet across Europe the same is not true, with thousands killed, and massive devastation across the centuries from Lisbon to Sarajevo.
Part of my own constituency, Gloucestershire, was devastated by floods in July that caused billions of euros of damage to road and rail, hospitals and schools, water treatment plants and power stations.
We are likely to get assistance from the European Solidarity Fund.
I hope it will not prove necessary, but if it does Europe must prove willing to assist nations, regions and committee hit by earthquakes.
in writing. - (PT) As has been pointed out, the whole of southern Europe is delimited by the edge of two tectonic plates that cross the Mediterranean and go on through the Atlantic Ocean via some of the Azores Islands, which means that earthquakes are one of the most frequent natural disasters in this region.
This EP report contains a variety of concerns and proposals that we appreciate, particularly when it recognises that the outermost regions suffer these phenomena regularly, or when it points to the need, among other things, to support national action in terms of prevention, response and repairing damage, public information, scientific research, civil protection and solidarity at Community level.
As far as coordination is concerned, the report proposes cooperation between Member States and between the latter and third countries to implement the measures referred to.
However, despite supporting the creation of a 'European Civil Protection Force' as a 'centralised prevention and management instrument' - a policy we disagree with - it states that this 'only makes sense on the basis of improved national civil protection schemes, and of better instruments for coordination between Member States', which in our opinion raises the question again as it should be raised.
in writing. - (PL) Our fellow member Mr Cornillet has presented us with a very thorough report, noting that earthquakes have a negative impact on social and economic cohesion in the regions.
We should remember that severe earthquakes also occur frequently in the countries and regions of the European Union, especially in southern Europe and by the Mediterranean Sea.
For this reason we need to ensure that the necessary prevention and rapid reaction capabilities are in place to deal with any such disaster.
It is important to initiate social education and information campaigns throughout the EU and to provide education and training to the staff of the relevant technical authorities in the Member States, and this should include training at regional and local levels as well as for all the specialists involved in earthquakes.
In addition we must take into account the role to be played by the many national, regional and local authorities and ensure that instructions exist for effective protection of essential infrastructure, such as access to telecommunications infrastructure, power networks, hospitals, bridges, ports, airports and so on.
In future, cohesion policy should give thorough consideration to the damage caused by earthquakes and this should be taken into account in the framework of a new financial instrument for the protection of the population.
I also believe that issues of coordination, cooperation and flexibility in the activities of authorities at Community, national, regional and local levels should be included in the debate, as these create considerable problems when dealing with natural disasters.
(LT) Today we have voted in favour of the resolution, drawn up on basis of the report by Mr Cornillet, on a European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and confirm once again my approval of this important document.
We are well aware of the fact that the European Union - and here I am thinking of the Commission and the Member States - is the leading provider of humanitarian aid.
The EU contribution for 2006 amounted to only EUR 2 billion.
I completely agree with the opinion that the EU should determine where to set the limit for the new level of humanitarian aid.
On the other hand, the EU has to define its position in view of the new international initiatives and the implementation of the reform initiated by the United Nations.
As a member of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to point out the third problem that the EU needs to solve, namely improving the coordination of Community and Member States' resources with a view to making them easily accessible for the victims of humanitarian disasters.
I hope that Parliament's concrete and precise position will facilitate the achievement of our common objectives and help find consensus on the subject of humanitarian aid.
(NL) Mr President, I am glad to hear there is a European consensus on humanitarian aid and of course no reasonable person objects to aid for countries that do really need it.
But we must also be honest and admit that there is manifestly no European consensus on a code of conduct as regards dictators.
The UK's intention to boycott the EU-Africa summit if Mugabe attends is simply being ignored by other Member States, and humanitarian tragedies - as we all know - very often arise as a result of wars or criminal misrule, as is the case in Zimbabwe.
The enduring truth is that Africa is the scene of bloody conflicts and that Africans spend more on arms than they receive in development aid.
It is equally true that states with a democratic system, where rulers and government are not above the law, hardly ever go to war with one another.
If dictators like Mugabe are allowed to take part in a European summit, that totally undermines Europe's credibility on human rights and democracy.
It is because of this ambivalence that I abstained in the vote on the Cornillet report.
in writing. - (PT) Irrespective of our support for various aspects of humanitarian aid which are stressed in the report, we cannot endorse a 'consensus' on the EU's principles, objectives and strategies for the delivery of humanitarian aid in third countries that calls for the promotion of 'the right, or indeed the duty, of intervention in cases of serious violation of IHL and/or human rights', considering that 'coercive measures, including military intervention, may only be used as 'a last resort'.
We know the results of such a policy of 'good intentions', i.e. the aggression and military occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies and the resulting hundreds of thousands of deaths.
As has been said, so-called 'humanitarian intervention' very often conceals other real objectives that use and manipulate it according to the interests and unscrupulous calculations of the major powers and multinationals, calling the basic principles of international law into question.
We believe that the resolution of the serious problems affecting millions of human beings involves, among other things, respect for the sovereignty of all peoples and countries, the peaceful resolution of international conflicts, meeting the urgent needs of the economically poorest countries on a basis of friendship and solidarity, and their effective development.
in writing. - (PL) The rapporteur Thierry Cornillet is right to emphasise the need for the Community and the Member States to extend the debate on political strategies in humanitarian operations to the relevant Council forum by creating a new special working group.
The creation of such a group (e.g. COHUMA, that is, the working group of the Council on Humanitarian Aid) would help to develop coherent methods that would enable rapid and systematic activities in this area.
It was also quite right to point out that the frequency of natural disasters has increased and that their effects are becoming increasingly significant, which means there is a need to strengthen intervention.
For these reasons I agree with the proposal that the EU should increase its rapid reaction capabilities.
The readiness and ability to react will certainly follow on from improvements in coordination and early warning mechanisms as well as stores of appropriate materials and reserves on the international level.
in writing. - (DE) Humanitarian aid is often very difficult to deliver because of adverse circumstances or security problems.
This makes good harmonisation and coordination of aid activities all the more important.
Efforts to achieve that objective, however, must not in any way be used as a pretext to make European institutions even more bloated, nor can either an EU civil-defence agency nor an EU rapid-response force provide effective protection in the event of natural disasters.
Moreover, consideration must be given to yesterday's criticism from the Court of Auditors, which identified a 'material level of errors' in various areas, including the EUR 5.2-billion budget for food aid, humanitarian aid and the part-funding of non-governmental organisations.
Since the present report, in my view, is not a suitable basis for the resolution of all these problems, I have voted against it.
in writing. - As a strong supporter of humanitarian aid projects when they are timely, well targeted and effectively resourced, I voted in favour of the report on humanitarian aid.
However, I have serious objections to many of the formulations that are used.
It is unfortunate that there are references to the so-called Reform Treaty - the revived EU Constitution - to which I am fundamentally opposed.
It is unrealistic to imagine that humanitarian aid can be free of all political considerations; the report itself is a very political document, advancing the EU agenda.
In any case, priorities, scale of assistance, and delivery of aid in a way that avoids the clutches of abhorrent regimes are all political questions.
Apart from many other objections to EU involvement in military matters, it is a distraction from a clear focus on humanitarian aid.
The EU is not a unique humanitarian actor.
It should focus on adding value to the humanitarian efforts of our nations through improved coordination of effort in particular areas and in ensuring that there is proper control of its resources and evaluation of their impact.
(DE) Mr President, I regard this Framework Directive for Soil Protection as a serious mistake which jeopardises the competitiveness of European agriculture and food supplies in Europe.
What image do the supporters of this directive actually have of our farmers?
Let me tell you: they believe that we need a fat bureaucratic directive, that we need to map 420 million hectares of farmland, wield the threat of horrendous fines and finally create priority areas for soil protection before farmers will take proper care of their soils.
I say to you, however, that this image is completely divorced from reality.
Soil is a farmer's most precious asset.
Any farmer who does not treat his soil with care will not be a farmer for long.
Most of the soils in the EU are cared for; they are worth preserving and are nurtured by our farmers.
I regard this directive as an example of ivory-tower bureaucracy, and I hope we can rectify this mistake quickly before any serious damage is inflicted on our agriculture.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
As the MDF MEP, I have voted in favour of the creation of the European Soil Protection Directive because I am convinced that it is necessary.
Without an appropriate amount of good-quality soil, European agriculture too will be jeopardised.
I trust that, if this legislation is created, an opportunity will open up for us to work using Union resources on cleaning soil from pollution and protecting its quality.
However, at this point I would like to draw the attention of the Member States to the fact that this is possible only if the Member States also take their duties seriously.
In my home country, for example, the action mostly amounts to the preparation of plans, and their implementation drags along.
There is a national remedial programme in Hungary, but not a word about consistent implementation of it.
The government does not guarantee the necessary resources.
EUR 18 million is earmarked for the future, which is risible in comparison with the scale of the problem.
At this rate, we would need more than 220 years to finish cleaning up the soil pollution we know about today.
Let us be more serious, please!
Thank you.
(DE) Mr President, I voted to reject the Commission's proposal. The proposal breaches the principle of subsidiarity.
Soil has no cross-border aspects, which is why this matter can be regulated equally well or even better in the Member States than at European level.
Many countries already have soil protection legislation.
The Commission's proposal takes scant account of that.
In the final vote I also voted against the report and most of the compromises, although I do believe that the report adopted by Parliament is a marked improvement on the Commission's proposal.
There were improvements, for example, with regard to the identification of potentially contaminated sites.
The redraft offers greater flexibility in the application of the criteria enumerated in Annex II.
In general, however, there are still many provisions that make this directive an elaborate bureaucratic and expensive instrument.
One good thing is that the criteria listed in Annex I will at least be non-binding now.
Another is that the directive recognises the special character of agricultural land use.
The cons outweigh the pros, however.
On the question of funding, for example, we ought to have spelled out more clearly that the Soil Protection Directive will have no impact on the Community budget and that no new funds will be set up to implement the directive.
Only the existing support mechanisms are to be used.
For these reasons I have voted against the directive, and I hope that the Council will now make the necessary corrections.
(CS) Mr President, some time ago this Parliament asked the Commission for a directive on soil protection.
Commissioner Dimas gave it to us five years later.
We do not need it any more, and that is no secret.
We have other Directives on the protection of specific, transnational problems relating to soil.
The Commission ignores the fact that many countries - and the Czech Republic is one example - have their own legislation and good systems in place to protect soil from further erosion and degradation.
What some countries (including Flanders) need is a common strategy and enhanced coordination.
Thanks to an enormous effort by the rapporteurs, Parliament was able to vote for the reworked Directive, which will probably not cause too much harm because it will at least make it possible to maintain national legislation where it already exists.
In his presentation yesterday, the Commissioner did not show any understanding for a sensible solution painstakingly negotiated by the rapporteur in Parliament.
By not being receptive to Parliament's hints, the Commissioner is helping to bury his own Directive.
He as good as asked me to vote against his report.
I believe that the Council will behave in a similar manner.
(PL) Mr President, I am convinced that the clauses that we have approved are absolutely necessary and that they will help to improve the state of the environment and also people's health.
The soil is a finite and non-renewable natural resource. It deserves special protection because of its social, economic, environmental and cultural functions.
I share the view that soil protection should be subject to regulation at Community level in order to guarantee a minimum level of protection in all the Member States of the EU.
I look very positively on the proposal to create publicly available national inventories of polluted locations.
An inventory should be drawn up of locations where the soil may have been contaminated in the past.
Guided by the principle of providing assistance, help should be given to EU Member States to return contaminated soil to cultivation and to assist in the removal of dangerous compounds that remain in it.
The introduction of proper regulation restricting soil degradation and ensuring sustainable soil usage, while at the same time returning degraded areas to cultivation will undoubtedly constitute a step forward as regards protection of the resources of the natural environment.
I also believe it to be particularly important to harmonise legislation in Member States as regards the issue of soil protection.
(DE) Mr President, all the Austrian PPE members advocate an ambitious set of measures to protect soil, but they must be adopted at the right political level.
We consider the proposal and the report to be in clear breach of the principle of subsidiarity, which is why we have voted against many of the amendments and also against the report in its entirety.
In spite of the sterling work of the rapporteur, Mrs GutiÃ©rrez, who drew many of the fangs in the proposal, we take the view that this report overshoots by far the proper bounds of EU legislation.
The Member States should, however, be urged to involve themselves deeply in this area because soil is the basis of all economic and agricultural activity.
It must also be said that the Member States are responsible for funding their own programmes.
(DE) Mr President, I have voted against this so-called soil protection directive because I find we lose any credibility if we talk every day about eliminating red tape and then we create this bureaucratic monster of a directive.
Unlike air and water, soil is not a cross-border issue but a national matter.
We need this directive like a hole in the head.
The Commission and President Barroso ought to have withdrawn this draft.
President Barroso speaks eloquently of eliminating red tape, but his actions do not match his words.
Where I come from, people like that are called Dampfplauderer - patter merchants.
For 46 years I have been tilling my soil.
My soil is more fertile now than it was 46 years ago.
I am all for a European soil protection regulation, but one that protects my soil from European bureaucracy.
(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the directive.
The implementation of the provisions of the directive will allow economic use to be made of degraded areas, while at the same time protecting greenfield sites from being used for industrial and commercial purposes.
This directive will also make it possible to classify soils in accordance with an evaluation of their plant and animal production capacity, with particular attention being paid to the production of high quality food.
I would like to emphasise the importance of preparing a European strategy to recognise and resolve problems associated with soil degradation.
The considerable diversity of different types of soil means that, irrespective of the steps taken by individual countries, a European strategy is required, based on prevention and increasing awareness of the need for protection of the soil as well as a description of existing risk factors, in order to solve this problem on the European level.
We have chosen to vote in favour of the report even though a number of EU countries already have fully functioning legislation in the area of soil protection.
We supported Amendments 106, 107, 108 and 110 which read as follows:
'Member States which already have specific national legislation in place to protect their soils shall be exempted from the obligations under this Article, on the condition that their legislation secures at least an equivalent level of protection.'
Even though the directive can be seen as superfluous in certain Member States, we have hopes that it can bring about an improvement in the large number of Member States which currently lack functioning legislation for the protection of soil.
We also hope that the Member States which have functioning legislation in this area can work together with Parliament in the ongoing negotiations to ensure that the directive does not entail unnecessary duplication of administrative work for them once it has entered into force.
Carbon storage is of great significance in connection with the reduction of greenhouse gases.
The overexploitation of the soil involving the combustion of carbon is causing considerable pressure.
That is therefore an issue that requires an international initiative.
The June Movement is therefore in support of the EU's dealing with soil protection in the Member States.
It is very good that the European Parliament has endorsed the examination of the possible use of the 'polluter pays' principle under Article 22, and the assessment of land use under Article 28, given its great significance in connection with carbon sequestration.
Both proposals are the initiative of Mr Bonde.
in writing. - On balance, I voted in favour of the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report as I believe her text has substantially rewritten the soil proposal to restore subsidiarity, remove duplication of obligations and introduce a voluntary code of conduct for agriculture, without imposing further red tape.
It also recognises, very validly, the important role of farmers as the custodians of the soil.
It is important that the soil proposal both protects peatlands as valuable habitats under threat, while at the same time allows for the appropriate extraction of peat as a raw material.
It is not clear whether Amendment 36 of the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report (on the adjustment of the list of functions in Article 1) allows this and I urge the Commission and or Council to clarify this in their considerations.
in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the protection of soil and amending Directive 2004/35/EC because I consider soils to be a vital resource that must be protected to mitigate the effects of climate change and to ensure that the activities of future generations can take place in a safe and healthy environment.
I therefore believe that this proposal contributes to effective soil protection insofar as it defines the objectives on which there is no Community and/or national legislation.
According to their specific situation, however, Member States will have to decide what their priority measures should be, in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
in writing. - (PT) We understand the importance of protecting soil, firstly for agriculture, which will need to produce more food and will require more water.
Protection of soil is therefore essential to safeguard food production and to guarantee sufficient clean water for future generations, since the earth has a social function that no private interest should threaten.
Soil is a platform for human activities, including cities and infrastructure, but also for nature and landscapes.
Its protection is therefore crucial to the preservation of our cultural heritage and natural resources.
The proposal tabled by the European Commission, however, is not the most appropriate because of its partial vision, the conditions it imposes and its scant regard for agriculture.
The European Parliament has amended it significantly, with proposals in support of the principle of subsidiarity, recognising the importance of agriculture and stating that 'each Member State, in accordance with its climate, soil characteristics (...) may decide upon its own agricultural policy in relation to the soil', and recognising the different approaches towards soil protection.
It nevertheless retains aspects on which we have reservations. Hence our final vote to abstain.
in writing. - (PT) I consider the existence of a framework directive on soil protection to be extremely important, since soil is a non-renewable resource that provides vital services for human activities and the survival of ecosystems, particularly when climate change is an increasingly worrying issue, and when there is as yet no specific European legislation on soil protection.
I therefore support the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report and vote against all the proposed amendments that seek to reject the Commission proposal or significantly weaken the report.
in writing. - (PL) The proposed framework directive consolidates legal solutions in the area of soil protection policy that are contained in a fragmentary way in other legislation relating to waste management, the use of pesticides and environmental protection.
The document proposes not only measures for the protection and sustainable use of the soil, in order to prevent its degradation by climatic changes, but also measures to remediate soil that is already degraded.
The framework directive is an instrument that will make it possible, first and foremost, to take account of the differences in soil in individual EU Member States and will guarantee flexibility in its implementation.
Its objectives are already being achieved, although to different degrees, on the basis of legislation in individual Member States.
On the other hand, the directive offers a great opportunity to those countries which do not as yet have any soil protection regulation.
In this regard the decision to introduce a definition of contaminated land would seem quite significant, as well as the obligation to draw up national lists of such land by EU countries, which would be made public knowledge and updated every five years.
In addition, the clauses concerning the obligation to draw up a remediation strategy that includes objectives for repair measures, a financing mechanism and identification of priority areas requiring particular protection from erosion, salinisation or acidification, over a period of seven years from the introduction of the directive, is very encouraging.
Thank you for your attention.
in writing. - (FR) The geological and climatic conditions within the European Union differ widely from one country to another, and sometimes indeed within the same country.
There are something like 300 different types of soil.
Nevertheless, the European Commission is bent on regimenting soil use right across Europe, and the Committee on the Environment actually wants more regimentation.
I support subsidiarity and I oppose over-regulation.
That is why I voted against this indigestible and pointless report.
There is no need for a framework directive on soil protection.
The soil situation in the Member States varies.
The problem areas included in the directive are of a national character and are therefore best managed at national level.
The soil protection which is needed is already governed by existing EU and national legislation.
The proposal will only lead to increased bureaucracy and more complicated rules for the parties involved.
Detailed provisions and exhortations are typical EU ideas which lead to increased costs and irritation with the EU machine.
Some of us in Sweden question the compatibility of the directive with the EU's work to simplify rules and want Sweden's Parliament to examine the proposal in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
We have therefore, as a matter of principle, chosen to reject the proposal in its entirety.
in writing. - Amendment 112: I am rejecting the Commission proposal, as a Soil Framework Directive would simply mean increased bureaucracy and duplication of regulations without bringing about any additional improvements to soil protection.
A wide range of measures exist under the CAP reform, as well as under the reform of environmental legislation, and these will bring about benefits for soil protection.
in writing. - (DE) Soil is a vital asset.
As a non-renewable resource, it is of the utmost importance in sustaining biodiversity, as a source of raw materials and also as a storage and filter medium for nutrients and water.
Soil, however, is not something that crosses borders, nor can it be shifted by the European Union.
Protecting our soils is in the best interests of those who own land and therefore falls within the responsibility of the Member States.
This application of the subsidiarity principle must remain intact.
There is no justification for ignoring all the existing European legal provisions and the dedication of farmers right down to the present day and to enact new provisions running parallel to the European directives, national statutes and cross-compliance rules that directly or indirectly affect the protection of soil.
Among the numerous soil-related directives and regulations enacted by the EU are such instruments as the Nitrates Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Emissions Trading Directive and the Plant Protection Products Directive.
The bureaucratic commitments that could hit the Member States and the farming community is in stark contrast to the common efforts to eliminate red tape.
In addition, the precautionary measures envisaged in the draft directive impinge on every aspect of the law as it relates to agriculture.
I consider a European soil protection directive to be superfluous and inexpedient, and I have voted against this proposal.
in writing. - (DE) Healthy soils are the basis of human health and wealth.
They must be protected.
We cannot be content with the current state of soils in all parts of the EU.
Nevertheless, wanting to regulate this problem paternalistically and bureaucratically at European level is a step too far.
Soil, which is already protected by the directive concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive) and the Habitats Directive, does not migrate, as we all know, from one country to another, although the same cannot be said for water, which is a potential factor in soil pollution.
That, however, is already covered by the Water Framework Directive and the Groundwater Directive.
If we now add a soil protection directive, the result will be duplicated regulation and costly bureaucracy, which nobody wants.
Open coordination and sharing of experience on best practice would be a better approach.
Adopting a framework directive on soil protection would be putting the cart before the horse.
It is unthinkable that countries which already have exemplary legislation on soil protection should have to invest a great deal of time and money re-examining their entire territory for possible risk areas.
I tried to engage in damage limitation in this vote, but I am afraid I did not succeed.
I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report.
I want to know that I can still look our farmers in the eye.
in writing. - With my fellow Labour MEPs, I voted against this proposed directive.
While we supported the general thematic strategy on soil protection yesterday, as it stands, the directive on soil protection is over-prescriptive.
It does not take into account existing and well-functioning legislation that is already in place in the Member States.
in writing. - Despite my stated opposition to a proposal for a Directive on Soil Protection, I voted in favour of this report at the final vote.
I have already placed my opposition to such a Directive on the record in relation to the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection.
I do not believe that there is a need for additional legislation relating to soil protection.
We already have a range of legal instruments in place to ensure the protection of soil, and until these pieces of legislation are fully implemented and the effects are fully analysed I do not believe that further legislation in this area is either necessary or desirable.
However, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur go some way towards reducing the level of overlap between this new proposal and existing legislation and this is to be welcomed.
in writing. - (NL) Soil protection is very necessary in order to prevent the destruction of natural soil systems, erosion, contamination and desiccation.
Without measures of this kind it becomes impossible to grow plants in densely populated areas where soil use is intensive.
In many places in Europe I see wasteland which has lost all value for nature and human use.
Yesterday, along with a majority of this House, I voted for the Prodi report which spells out the need for proactive measures to protect our soils.
Today we are looking at what those measures should be.
I am in favour of encouraging Member States which have not yet taken the necessary measures on their own initiative to remedy the omission now.
Their failure to act affects not only them but neighbouring states too, for example in producing erosion debris which causes rivers to silt up and flood.
But EU rules must in no event mean that Member States which already regulate these matters properly have to face more bureaucracy or obstacles to dealing with them efficiently.
I support amendments to the effect that those applying equal or higher standards must be free to do so.
But it is irresponsible to reject, delay or limit the soil protection package in the way the largest group in Parliament is proposing.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines report because it proposes positive steps forward for the protection and sustainable use of soil - a non-renewable resource which it is vital to preserve, and the quality of which is crucial if we are to ensure adequate levels of food production and access to clean water.
The European Parliament has called for clearer identification of contaminated sites where dangerous substances, present as the result of human activity, constitute a significant risk to health and the environment.
National or regional lists of such sites will be compiled and they will be available for the public to consult.
Each Member State will have to prepare remediation strategies so that the number of contaminated sites can be limited, and sustainable agricultural policies will be encouraged, taking account of national soil characteristics, so that clean soil can be preserved.
In adopting this report the European Parliament is underscoring the need to protect the earth's resources and use them more wisely.
in writing. - This is yet another example of the one-size-fits-all approach which gives the European Union a bad name in our Member States.
With more than three-hundred types of soil in the European Union, how can we expect to cover them all by means of a single directive?
Surely this is a prime example of an area in which we should allow Member States to determine their own legislation on the basis of their own soil types.
It is very disappointing that, with all the scientific expertise at its disposal, the European Commission has produced a legislative proposal which fails to take account of simple scientific facts.
If the United Kingdom suffers floods and Greece suffers a heatwave during the course of one summer, it is obvious that the impact of those weather conditions on the soil in those Member States will be entirely different.
The only real consequence of this proposal will be to tie up the agriculture industry in yet more red tape and burden it with yet more expense.
It is frustrating that, yet again, the agricultural community will have to pay for the pursuit of useless uniformity.
in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption by the House of Cristina GutiÃ©rrez-Cortines' report, urging the introduction of a single, coherent European policy for soil protection.
Soil protection has become a priority for the EU because Europe's soils are becoming more and more degraded.
The factors to blame are rampant urbanisation, an increase in the number of contaminated sites (to more than 2 million at the most recent count) and intensive farming practices over the last 50 years, with abusive use of pesticides and nitrate-based fertilisers.
In my view, the 225 MEPs who voted to reject this directive were either driven by nationalist fanaticism or, at the very least, have lost touch with ordinary people's concerns!
Europe can offer genuine added value in the matter of soil protection, an issue on which only nine Member States have their own legislation.
I would add that the directive leaves the Member States a considerable freedom of choice, with two precise targets to be achieved within generous deadlines: within, respectively, five years and seven years from transposition of the text, they must compile a list of contaminated sites and adopt a national remediation strategy.
I think there can be no doubt that this constitutes respect for the principles of flexibility and subsidiarity!
in writing. - I am afraid I will be voting against this report because it is my view that a framework on the protection of soil is not needed.
I voted for rejection initially because I believe this issue should be left to Member States under the subsidiarity principle.
What we have before us is a piece of legislation that is disproportionate, has little flexibility and merely repeats what is already covered in other directives.
It tries to cover desertification on the one hand and cleaning up soil on the other - a wide remit indeed - but ends up being a report that covers neither adequately; but creates problems in how it will be implemented.
In my own region where local authorities are trying to recycle soil, this proposal would make that so difficult that the viability of the whole operation is put in question.
Sorry to say, I think this is a poor and unnecessary piece of legislation, and I will vote against in the hope that I can save farmers, horticulturalists and local authorities from a bureaucratic nightmare.
in writing. - (DE) I reject the framework directive on soil protection, because it is a gross breach of the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore unacceptable as European legislation.
Even if the European Parliament votes in favour, I shall take my fight to the Federal Government with a view to ensuring that the Federal Republic of Germany challenges this directive before the European Court of Justice.
in writing. - (FR) In line with the vote in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I believe that the Commission has exceeded its brief here and that the European Union does not need to issue new instructions to the Member States.
It is a matter of national responsibility.
I see it as an artificial exercise to seek to issue identical prescriptions to countries with extremely diverse legal traditions and environmental circumstances.
The Commission should therefore review its proposal and identify specifically those situations where European legislation is called for.
in writing. - (DE) I reject the framework directive on soil protection, because it is a gross breach of the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore unacceptable as European legislation.
Even if the European Parliament votes in favour, I shall take my fight to the Federal Government with a view to ensuring that the Federal Republic of Germany challenges this directive before the European Court of Justice.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the justification for the Commission's proposal to the European Parliament is a new comitology procedure that significantly increases the powers of the European Parliament.
It is a regulatory procedure combined with scrutiny.
The rapporteur's view, which deserves to be supported, is that the new procedure will apply to matters in regulations concerning securities prospectuses, such as measures relating to exemptions from the obligation to publish a prospectus, the format of the prospectus as well as third country equivalence.
This is the basis for the amendments tabled on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the plenary vote.
The report under consideration also gives additional impetus to the idea of significant progress in the harmonisation of regulations for European financial and stock markets.
This is due in large part to the inexorable process of globalisation and partly to the Financial Services Action Plan from 1999.
At the same time it confirms the sound choice made at the beginning of the 1990s in countries such as Poland, where the reconstruction of capital markets was based on European standards, which is now simplifying the harmonisation of regulations across the European Union.
in writing. - (PT) In 2006 the decision amending the previous 1999 decision laying down the rules for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission was finally adopted after years of negotiations between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament.
The regulatory procedure with scrutiny was thus introduced.
This must be used for adopting measures of general scope which seek to amend (by deleting or supplementing) non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with Article 251 of the Treaty, i.e. under the codecision procedure.
This is therefore a new comitology procedure that must be applied to a list, drawn up by the Commission, of 25 instruments that have already been adopted and that must be adapted, including the present Regulation on the Schengen Borders Code.
I therefore support the technical proposals introduced by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, to take into account the specificity of the Schengen Borders Code since it constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis.
in writing. - (DE) The Schengen acquis is a particularly sensitive area in which we must be able to respond to any contingency.
Organised human-trafficking gangs are constantly on the lookout for new gaps in our defences through which they can flood the EU with migrants.
For this reason there must be no overhasty enlargement of the Schengen area.
Steps must be taken beforehand to ensure that the Member States concerned have fully mastered the task of protecting their external borders.
Since this is extremely doubtful in my opinion, I have voted against the Cashman report.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Hegyi report because we have repeatedly criticised the democratic deficit that exists with regard to genetically modified organisms.
We know that a proper decision for or against the authorisation of GMOs has scarcely ever been taken by the Council or the Committee of Permanent Representatives.
It has always been more or less the same story of the European Commission exercising its responsibility for risk management by authorising GMOs against the will of the EU population and in spite of the reservations of many Member States and experts.
The European Commission cannot be allowed to have the final say.
Its decisions must be subject to scrutiny by the European Parliament.
Although Mr Hegyi's report goes in the right direction by insisting on a binding parliamentary right of codecision on GMO authorisations, we reject the negotiated compromise, because it leaves the undemocratic comitology procedure in place.
There can really be only one solution, namely codecision rights for the European Parliament in all matters relating to GMO licensing.
I therefore find it rather regrettable that we have not made the most of this vote and grasped the opportunity at long last to exert more pressure against the continued existence of this democratic deficit.
in writing. - (PT) It is true that the long-term consequences of GMO technology are still unknown.
There are contradictory scientific statements, and many people are afraid of the possible dangers and risks.
Precautions must therefore be taken and their use in agriculture must not be insisted upon.
Directive 2001/18/EC concerning the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms is in force.
This directive covers the experimental release of GMOs into the environment, in other words the introduction of GMOs into the environment for experimental purposes (such as for field testing) and the placing of GMOs on the market (products containing or consisting of GMOs), such as for cultivation, import or processing into industrial products.
We believe it is important as a minimum to have wider control of GMO technology, at least in relation to procedures, as the European Parliament now intends, but we stress the need to exercise caution, whether in relation to agriculture or processed foodstuffs.
in writing. - (DE) 70% of the European population are opposed to genetic engineering.
In Austria people are even more afraid of toxic residues in food products than of terrorist attacks or bird flu.
Besides the suspicion of a link between genetically modified organisms and increasing incidences of health problems, there is more and more evidence that the use of genetic engineering will cause farmland to degenerate into wasteland as well as making farmers dependent on multinational conglomerates.
in writing. - Conservatives voted in favour of this report but have regrets over the approach the Council has taken during the parliamentary process.
In early stages of drafting the report, a great deal of undue pressure was placed upon Parliament by the then Presidency of the Council.
This we find unacceptable, given Parliament's role as scrutineer of legislation.
in writing. - (PT) This directive is extremely important because of growing concerns regarding money laundering and its role in funding international crime and terrorism.
A Community approach is therefore required to create uniform rules, close loopholes and strike a balance between the need to control and requirements concerning the protection of the internal market and the free movement of capital.
I support this initiative, which seeks to update Directive 2005/60/EC on money laundering, particularly as regards all the implementation measures listed in Article 41 of that directive.
This is therefore yet another case of updating the legislation in force in line with the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny under the Comitology Decision.
This will give the European Parliament greater control over the implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal in its entirety.
It is important that international standards are introduced and respected in order to protect the financial system against crime and money laundering in general, while at the same time the Member States' own measures must not be incompatible with the rules of the single market.
However, we find it repugnant that through the frequent use of the concept of terrorism the EU is seeking to extend its power at the expense of the Member States.
Money for terrorism is a tiny part of money laundering.
The large sums go to other kinds of well-organised crime.
in writing. - (PT) The proposal submitted amends the provisions of Directive 2005/60/EC on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing, which imposed a time limitation on the implementing powers conferred on the Commission in this area.
According to the recent decision on the exercise of the Commission's powers, this limitation has been removed, but the European Parliament retains the right to scrutinise the implementation of acts adopted under the codecision procedure.
It is therefore now clear that any amendments to this directive must be submitted for consideration to the European Parliament as well as to the Council.
This should not mean, however, that national parliaments are excluded from the legislative procedure or are restricted merely to transposing directives adopted in this area at Community level.
And what is more, as the 'Reform' Treaty seeks to establish, gradually transforming justice and internal affairs into a future common policy, which we obviously reject.
Finally, we must highlight the inconsistency of the European Union, which promotes total freedom of movement of capital and tax havens at the same time as it champions the fight against money laundering.
in writing. - The justification for this legislation is to protect the EU financial system from money laundering and terrorist financing.
The UKIP would always seek to cooperate internationally on these matters, however, the EU has no agreed competence on defence.
Moreover as an organisation that has been unable to get its own accounts signed off for thirteen years the EU Commission cannot be considered to have any expertise whatsoever on finance or to be a fit body to put forward legislation on control of the financial system.
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report because we consider that there is a need to increase knowledge about BZP, which is a synthetic drug, and to make the substance subject to control measures and criminal sanctions.
However, we voted against all proposals which aim to prevent the introduction of decisions on control measures and criminal sanctions, as that is contrary to the precautionary principle.
in writing. - (PT) Since 2005 listed companies have been required in certain circumstances to draw up their consolidated accounts in compliance with international accounting standards.
These standards were developed by a London-based private organisation (the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation/International Accounting Standards Board) and were subsequently incorporated into Community legislation by means of a regulation.
Despite certain reservations, this resolution accepts the Commission's proposal (amending that regulation) to endorse a standard (IFRS 8) which in turn incorporates a US standard (SFAS 131) into EU law.
This is accepted, as stated in the resolution, even though the impact assessment carried out by the Commission did not take sufficiently into account the interests of users as well as the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises located in different European countries and enterprises operating only locally.
We therefore cannot support this resolution.
Mr President, I requested explanations of votes on the EU-Russia Summit resolution.
I regret that some important paragraphs have been sacrificed for some strange reason, in order to have a shorter resolution instead of having a longer resolution but covering important issues.
I think it is very important to call on the Commission and the Council to pursue joint initiatives with the Russian Government aimed at strengthening security and stability in the common neighbourhood, in particular by means of enhanced dialogue over Ukraine and Belarus and joint efforts to finally resolve the frozen conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh as well as in Moldova and Georgia by guaranteeing the full territorial integrity of those states and, as far as Transnistria is concerned, by withdrawing the remaining Russian troops, who if necessary should be replaced by a force of international monitors.
(CS) I emphatically voted against this motion for a resolution on the outcome of the 10th EU-Russia Summit.
The Russian KGB regime is seeking legitimacy.
I refuse to become a puppet and I feel ashamed for all those who are becoming Russia's puppets due to ignorance and cowardice, especially in order to gain minor economic advantages.
Russia is not Europe's partner.
I completely reject the opinion that Russia is our partner on the issue of Kosovo's independence.
Why does this House attach so much importance to the partnership?
Russia continues to throw the bodies of Chechens from helicopters above Chechnya, keeps thousands of opponents of the regime in prison, institutes illegal court proceedings against politicians from the Other Russia and detains Mikhail Khodorkovsky in prison illegally.
Who and when will we find out the truth about the death of Anna Politkovskaya?
When is Russia going to stop threatening human rights activists?
Why have we not been invited to observe the Russian parliamentary elections?
Why does Putin not want us, his partners, to be there?
They put up with us in Morocco as well as in Palestine.
Someone who breaches the fundamental principle of solidarity, helping Poland in relation to free export, equal export conditions, is considered a partner by this House.
Russia is holding us hostage.
If we do not support a democratic and stable Russia, but we do we support a secret service regime instead, then we are our own worst enemies.
Finally, our country has the right to be free to contribute to Europe's safety, to protect Europe from a possible attack by Iranian forces.
How can we ask the US not to jeopardise peace in Europe through its policy, while we make allowances for the Russians' more than obvious support for the Iranian regime?
This resolution is an example of perfidy and weakness.
As we Czechs know, being weak in relation to Russia really does not pay off.
I emphatically reject this resolution, if for no other reason than as an expression of respect for the legacy of the Czech political prisoners, of all whom had opposed the occupation.
Mr President, after having voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit, I still regret that the amendment I proposed as a new recital was rejected by the rapporteur.
Therefore I quote it now, 'whereas Russian Federation did not fulfil any commitments of those undertaken by its accession to the Council of Europe in 1996 and two years ago bluntly denounced already signed new border agreement with EU Member State Estonia, thus leaving this sector of EU-Russia border unregulated up to now; whereas the actual legislation of Russia Federation still contains aggressive positions as that on social privileges for its military servicemen in a case of losses caused or injuries got during armed actions in Baltic States, or that about procedures of accession of foreign states or their parts with Russian Federation'.
I am convinced that those positions will be reconsidered by this House later.
in writing. - I supported this resolution with a degree of reluctance.
Russia and its leader Vladimir Putin have proved difficult of late in a number of areas, especially energy.
Nevertheless, the one issue on which I have some sympathy is their response to the highly contentious US plan to deploy Theatre Missile Defence in the EU supposedly to defend against a scarcely credible threat from Iranian nuclear-tipped ICBMs, but which equally poses threats to Russia's own defence.
I therefore regret that Amendment No 3, which I voted for, by the Green Group, was defeated by 242 to 362.
in writing. - (PT) A great deal could be said on this resolution about the recent EU-Russia summit, and we will therefore only mention certain examples concerning its aims.
For example, at the same time as it glosses over the US Administration's initiatives and profound responsibilities in promoting a new escalation in the militarisation of Europe - with the support of NATO members, it should be noted - it considers that the 'declarations made by the Russian authorities' and the '[...] inappropriate threat to pull out of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe have raised serious concerns about the preservation of peace and stability on the European continent'.
It more or less directly stresses the essential aspects, for example, which are that Russia has allowed EU companies to buy strategic stakes in Russian companies, the importance of improving the climate for investment in Russia (to the joy of major EU financial groups), and 'equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment' on the basis of the principles of the 'Energy Charter Treaty'.
And in line with the above examples, it maintains the political pressure on the Russian Federation, even seeking to promote intervention instruments, while ignoring the unacceptable situation of the most basic rights of the Russian-speaking population in Latvia, an EU Member State.
in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports this resolution and its aim to build a strategic cooperation with Russia based on common values, democracy and respect for human rights.
In particular we support calls for a positive Russian contribution to finding a sustainable political solution on the issue of Kosovo.
We voted in favour of Amendment 3, as there are concerns which should be raised regarding any further build-up of conventional or unconventional weapons on the European continent, and we support continuing bilateral discussions between the US and Russia on this issue.
in writing. - (PL) Mr President, the EU-Russia summit in Mafra illustrates the change in relations since the 1990s when the partnership and cooperation agreement, which expires in 2007, was born.
Three principal factors have affected these relations.
First of all, European Union enlargement, marking a definitive emancipation of a whole group of countries from the Russian sphere of influence, which the former empire is unwilling to accept.
Secondly, the authoritarian nature of the Putin presidency, which has put back the democratisation of Russia.
Although there is wide acceptance of it in Russia and while it provides a basic economic order, the EU cannot remain passive in the face of instances of violations of human rights, which creates an additional area of friction.
Thirdly, the situation in the energy markets, which makes it easier to use Gazprom for political purposes and has also made European countries more sensitive to the issue of energy security.
Taking the above background into consideration, the resolution proposed by the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats provides a balance of criticisms of Russia with hopes for a warmer diplomatic climate, fortified with principles reflecting our system of values.
Particularly worthy of notice are the points about respect for human rights as well as a demand, which is important for Poland, for the suspension of the impasse as regards Polish agricultural exports to the Russian market, which is a confirmation of the much-desired solidarity between European Union countries in relations with Moscow.
in writing. - I voted for the joint motions for a resolution arising out of the EU-Russia Summit, where Parliament, among other things, called on the Russian Government to create, together with the European Union, the necessary conditions for a rapid start to the negotiations on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Russia.
Other issues covered included Russia's pending accession to the WTO, human rights issues in Russia, the climate for investment and ongoing concerns over the upholding of the Conventional Forces Europe Treaty.
in writing. - (PT) The 18th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall came after the EU-Russia summit, which was held after this report was discussed but before it was put to the vote.
Eighteen years later, what used to be Eastern Europe is now a democratic area in which the market economy is an established feature.
Russia, meanwhile, is far from democratic and far from being a reliable partner.
In relation to energy, Kosovo, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Ukraine, Moldova or on the Iranian nuclear issue, Russia's contribution to the solution has been found wanting.
In the same week the European Council on Foreign Relations presented a report stating that the Russians are making the rules in relations between Russia and the European Union, and that Europe has shown a lack of unity and of strategy, in some cases not appearing to have put memories of the Soviet era behind them, while in others being overly pragmatic.
It then rightly suggests that EU strategy should encourage Russia to respect the rule of law.
Even though it is not a liberal democracy, Russia must be a predictable and reliable state, and Europe must work hard to that end.
We consider the freedom to disclose information to be an important principle.
Civil servants should, without risk of reprisal, be able to provide information, obtain information in order to exercise their freedom of expression and freedom to disclose information, have the right to anonymity and an investigation ban which means that authorities and other public bodies are not allowed to investigate who has provided information under the freedom to disclose information.
in writing. - I strongly disagree with the Atkins amendment (Amendment 1 to paragraph 15) to the Committee on Petitions' report by Carlos JosÃ© Iturgaiz Angulo.
The Ombudsman's Special Report regarding OLAF concerns the allegations made by the Office against a journalist who covered the story regarding its investigation into allegations made by Mr van Buitenen.
Regardless of whether Mr van Buitenen's allegations are right or wrong, we should defend the right of journalists to report on matters of public interest, even those who work for newspapers which are not very supportive of our views.
The Ombudsman's Special Report found that OLAF acted incorrectly in making accusations against a journalist.
The Petitions Committee agreed to request an own-initiative report on this issue in order to pressure OLAF into accepting it had acted incorrectly.
By voting for the PPE-DE amendment, we will be failing to defend the independence of journalists doing their work, failing to support the Petitions Committee in its work, and failing to support the Ombudsman in his work.

Situation in Pakistan (debate)
The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission Declarations on the situation in Pakistan.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we know, the European Union has observed recent developments in Pakistan with great concern, particularly the events leading to the establishment of the state of emergency on 3 November last, and consequently to great social unrest and numerous arrests, including the Chief Justice, who is currently under house arrest.
Have no doubt that this is a serious backward step in the structure of the rule of law and the democratic process in Pakistan, which I would say destroys any hope the Pakistani people and the international community in general may have entertained of strengthening the legitimacy of democratic institutions in Pakistan.
This is why the Presidency issued a statement on 6 November on behalf of the Union expressing our profound concern regarding the introduction of the state of emergency and the suspension of the Pakistani constitution and fundamental freedoms.
On 4 November, two days previously, the Heads of Mission in Islamabad and the High Representative, Javier Solana, had expressed their concern at the course of events.
Our words, the words of the EU, were thus added to the many others reiterating how important it is to reinstate the Constitution, restore civil order, guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the mass media, release all political prisoners, journalists and defenders of human rights and create the conditions required for the legislative elections to take place as planned, i.e. in January 2008.
We have no doubt that any nation's stability and development can only be guaranteed in an atmosphere of total democratic credibility.
We are seriously concerned by reports of numerous arrests, the boycott on freedom of information, repression of the essential freedom of expression of citizens and attacks on professional people, such as judges, lawyers, journalists and human rights activists.
At the same time, however, we appeal strongly for all parties to exercise the utmost restraint and to work together to seek a democratic and peaceful solution to the present crisis that will allow a rapid return to normality.
Although recognising the challenges currently faced by Pakistan in relation to its security situation and the Pakistani people's sacrifices and efforts in combating extremism and terrorism, the European Union firmly believes that the solution to these challenges cannot involve an interruption in the democratic process.
We cannot, however, fail to acknowledge the ally that we have always been able to count on in this battle against extremism and terrorism.
We must therefore ensure that Pakistan remains committed to the battle against this global threat, in which international cooperation is an essential tool.
Finally, the Union hopes that the current climate of uncertainty will be resolved swiftly and peacefully and calls upon President Muscharraf to honour his pledge to remove his military uniform and abandon his position as Chief of Staff.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, Pakistan is on the agenda of this plenary for the third time within a few months.
This bears witness to the very difficult transition the country is currently going through.
The imposition of emergency law by President Musharraf on 3 November in his capacity as Chief of Army Staff has sent a deeply worrying signal to Europe and the wider world and has damaged the course of democracy in Pakistan.
Before the emergency was imposed we had witnessed some encouraging developments, with hope for a more inclusive political process and stronger democratic institutions, but regrettably this has now been put in question and today we ask ourselves whether this situation is still reversible or whether it is not too late to restore confidence and conditions in advance of the parliamentary elections.
President Musharraf, in his televised address on the night of 3 November, told us that he was suspending the Constitution because of threats to the nation due to a visible ascendancy in the activities and incidence of terrorist attacks.
There is no doubt that Pakistan is currently facing a very serious threat of religious extremism and violence as recent events in the North-Western Frontier Province and the attack on Ms Bhutto's convoy on 18 October in Karachi have clearly demonstrated.
But what we are also witnessing now is the arrest of thousands of lawyers, journalists, political party workers and human rights activists, including such distinguished persons as Ms Asma Jahangir, the Chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, or Mr Aitzaz Ahsan, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association.
These are people who stand for an open and tolerant Pakistan.
They are not terrorists and it is wrong to detain them.
They should be set free immediately.
I would regard the drastic action taken against Pakistan's judiciary as particularly serious.
Rule of law is at the heart of any democratic process and the functioning democratic system cannot be sustained without an independent judiciary.
The statement by the Presidency, just mentioned also by our President on behalf of the EU, is therefore very clear, and this remains our position.
Last Sunday President Musharraf announced at a press conference that he hopes parliamentary elections can be held in Pakistan by 9 January 2008.
This would be a step in the right direction but there are a lot of remaining problems.
When can we expect the state of emergency to end?
How can we have free and fair elections when print and electronic media are censored, other civil rights and liberties suspended and the independence of the judiciary has been undermined?
How will parties be able to campaign when freedom of assembly is curtailed and party leaders like Benazir Bhutto are kept under house arrest?
These issues are not at all clear at this stage.
To end this uncertainty it is of fundamental importance that a firm date for elections should be announced as soon as possible, along with a clear timeframe for ending the emergency.
For these elections to have any chance of being at all democratic and transparent, it will be essential for all restrictions on political rights and fundamental freedoms to be lifted.
And, as things stand, at present it seems it will not be possible to deploy an election observation mission.
Certain minimum conditions laid down in the Commission communication on EU election assistance and observation for the holding of democratic elections are not met.
However, if the emergency rule was lifted rather quickly and conditions were significantly improved soon, I might yet be able to review the situation.
In any case I have made the necessary preparations for possible deployment of an EU election observation mission to Pakistan should the conditions noticeably change for the better quickly.
But, as I say, I am very much concerned as to whether this is likely to happen.
There have been calls to suspend or review our aid to Pakistan, and some EU Member States have taken steps or are considering some action in this respect.
The European Commission's support to Pakistan focuses, I would like to remind you, on key issues such as poverty reduction and education, including in the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, which are the most disadvantaged provinces in Pakistan.
Therefore, I think we will need to consider how best to proceed but, given the nature of this assistance, I think we have to reflect very carefully on that.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the truth is that the situation is very worrying: suspension of constitutional guarantees, state of emergency, detention of many members of civil society, including lawyers such as Mr Ahsan, who is the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and of opponents, house arrest of the opposition leader Mrs Bhutto.
What do we do in this situation?
We have learnt that the Deputy Secretary of State at the US State Department, Mr Negroponte, will shortly visit Pakistan and that one Member State, the United Kingdom, has joined the United Nations in its call for the President to renounce his leadership of the army and lift the state of emergency within ten days.
What can we, as the European Union, do?
I believe that as a first step we must act with utmost caution.
I believe that the representative of the current Presidency has noted, very correctly, that Pakistan is a vital partner in the fight against terrorism and also a country with nuclear weapons.
I therefore believe that on the one hand the European Union must ask the Government to re-establish as far as possible - because we must not lose sight of the fact that terrorism is a factor in Pakistan, a major factor - to re-establish to some extent order and stability and constitutional rights and freedoms, and to release those people who have been unlawfully detained.
Furthermore, Commissioner, I would ask you to marshal your considerable capacities and efforts to ensure that free and fair elections can be held and, on the basis of the guarantees you referred to in your speech, that the European Union is present and has a presence in the process in Pakistan which is so very important for the stability of the region and all relations between that region and the European Union.
Therefore, Commissioner, we have great confidence in your capabilities, great confidence in your diplomatic action, great confidence in your efforts and we hope that they will genuinely have a successful outcome which will allow the European Union to have a presence in the electoral process.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission, especially the Council for its tough declaration on 8 November.
I do not think that anyone would doubt that the situation in Pakistan is very serious and very volatile.
It is perhaps hard to register that everything that has been going on has really only taken place in the last ten days or so, since the state of emergency was declared.
Several Members here met General Musharraf some months ago, both in Brussels and later in Islamabad, and we received a number of assurances.
He was adamant that he would follow the constitution and that free and fair elections would take place.
I welcome his announcement that elections can take place by 9 January, but I share the Commissioner's apprehension and beg the question: in the light of what has gone on and the present emergency measures - the suspension of certain television channels and other human rights - are free and fair elections possible in less than eight weeks' time?
Whilst I refer to the Commissioner, I would also like to draw her attention in particular to our paragraph 14 of this resolution where we invite the Commission to consider expanding aid to Pakistan for education, poverty reduction, healthcare and relief work, but channelling the funds through secular NGOs rather than directly to the government under these circumstances.
We have no issue with the Pakistan people.
We recognise that Pakistan is a key ally of the West, as Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra said.
We recognise the important role they played in many, many areas and that they have also been victims of terrorism.
But I do not think, colleagues, that means we should stand aside and ignore what is happening at the moment.
My group also wanted to have a paragraph in about possible sanctions, inviting the Council ...
(The President asked the speaker to speak more slowly)
I thought I was speaking such clear English that they would manage perfectly but I will, of course, slow down.
I am also inviting the Council to consider targeted sanctions, which is what the Socialist Group would have liked to have done but we did not get any support for it: travel bans perhaps, the freezing of assets.
But we hope all of this will not be necessary and we hope that Pakistan can still come back from the brink, that the state of emergency can be withdrawn and that General Musharraf will step down as Chief of Army.
Mr President, my apologies for going too quickly.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Pakistan is a vital ally for the European Union.
Today we find that Pakistan finds itself at a crossroads.
But I believe that it wants to engage with us and we have re-established a recent history of engagement with Pakistan, which I understand is progressing reasonably successfully.
But we must not forget the historical context in which we find ourselves today.
I know Pakistan reasonably well and by far the biggest issue and problem facing Pakistan internally today is the terrorist threat coming from across the border in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is a common global problem.
We in the West turned our backs on Afghanistan some years ago.
It is important that we do not turn our back on Pakistan today.
Pakistan has been at the forefront of this battle, sometimes carrying a very heavy burden on behalf of the international community, a heavy burden sometimes carried on weak shoulders, a burden the people of Pakistan have carried, absorbing so much violence and carnage which would otherwise have made its way into other parts of the world.
The solution is not to isolate liberals and liberal values and to take away those liberal values from the people of Pakistan.
Today I see that the Commission has again called for the release of prisoners who are currently being held and I support that call.
This includes people like the Chief Justice of Pakistan, and indeed Mr Aitzaz Ahsan, who is a leading lawyer in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan must - and these must be our baselines - end the state of emergency immediately.
He must reinstate the Constitution.
He must reinstate the Supreme Court and he must move towards free and fair elections.
President Musharraf should recognise that we have not turned our back on Pakistan.
We remain engaged.
It is now time for him to roll back from his current position, to acknowledge our core values, to make them shared values.
In a distinct way, despite the desperate situation, he has a unique opportunity even now to deliver power to the people of Pakistan, the true custodians of that power.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I too recognise the importance of Pakistan to all of us in the fight against terrorism and it has been an ally to all of us in that fight.
However, I do not believe for one minute that it justifies in any circumstances what has happened in Pakistan in recent weeks.
Any deviation from the general democratic process cannot be a solution to solve political problems within Pakistan.
One of the things that really worries me about this is why he did it: because he was afraid that he was not going to get the decision from the Supreme Court that he expected or that he wanted.
It is a fairly trivial matter in one way and it seems that he has gone to extreme measures in his dealings with the people in Pakistan, with the judiciary in Pakistan, in the way he has dealt with it, which is extremely dangerous.
I welcome the fact that he has given a commitment that he will hold elections, but the international community must not allow him to turn his back on this commitment.
The state of emergency in Pakistan must be lifted immediately and the Government of Pakistan must respect the boundaries of its Constitution.
The scrapping of the Supreme Court did immeasurable damage to the separation of power systems within Pakistan.
It is a very, very poor example for the General to have undertaken.
I fully condemn the wholesale arrest of political opponents of the General, which include 3 000 peaceful protestors and civilian and human right activists.
The European Parliament today must send a very strong message out to General Musharraf that his recent actions violate all respected international conventions and he is moving Pakistan in a very negative and very dangerous direction.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, like many others, I think we are here with a deep sense of regret and a certain feeling of anger that, once again, we are having to discuss the situation in Pakistan.
I would agree with virtually everything that has been said this afternoon.
We are in a serious situation, not least because this is a nuclear state and the risk of a failed nuclear state is one that should make us all feel very nervous indeed.
People are right to say that the power to step back from the brink here is basically with President Musharraf and his supporters.
This idea that there is a state of emergency but the elections should go ahead undisturbed does not hold water.
It is certainly not an undisturbed election if the leaders of the other political parties are under house arrest or in jail.
If there is no freedom of the press, if people cannot even get satellite dishes because imports of those have now been banned, then there are no circumstances for free and fair elections whatsoever.
It is clear that we want the release of all those political prisoners, that we want freedom of the press and we want the judiciary to be able to operate freely because, if all those with stated commitments to democracy are locked up, who else is left out on the streets?
The message that is being sent by the actions of the Government in Pakistan at the moment is therefore extremely worrying for a state that says it is committed to democracy.
I would agree with what Mr Robert Evans has said.
We do need to have certain sanctions ready for use if the deadline of 22 November set by the Commonwealth and the UN is not observed and we do not see President Musharraf stand down as military leader or, indeed, an end to the state of emergency.
We should be supporting Amnesty International's Day of Action tomorrow to remember the political prisoners held in Pakistan, and we certainly need to be looking at aid and the way in which it is spent.
Pakistan has had USD 10 billion dollars of aid from the USA in about the last five or six years, mostly for anti-terrorism measures, and not for the maintenance and development of education.
Mr President, I have seen that the entire western world, with the United States at the forefront, is demanding an earlier election in Pakistan.
They want an election before the opposition is out of prison and Mr Ahsan, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, is released from house arrest.
The consequences will certainly be felt in Pakistan.
There will also inevitably be political instability and a negative impact on the economy of a country that is in a bad enough situation already.
The crisis is likely to have other repercussions at regional level, and wider developments affecting stability throughout Asia.
I find it impossible to disassociate developments in Pakistan and Kashmir from those in Afghanistan.
I propose that the EU should insist on securing Pakistan's considerable nuclear arsenal, if necessary through the UN, at least until the country returns to its former political and, if possible, democratic state.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, for years now we and the rest of the western world have thought of Pakistan as an important ally.
The threat of terrorism and the Pakistani Government's promises and hardline rhetoric with regard to stopping this threat have also been words of assurance to the EU.
There have, however, been too many drawbacks associated with this alliance and mutual solidarity.
Now at last it is time to open our eyes.
The state of emergency declared by General Musharraf on the third day, a crack in Pakistan's constitution, is just the tip of the iceberg, which we gave warning about here in July and October.
The society has been gradually militarised over the years, and the litmus test for the state of human rights, freedom of religion and the rights of minorities, has shown that these are restricted.
Instead of Pakistan getting itself ready for the triumphal march of democracy this year, there have been clear signs of a hardening dictatorial system of government.
The arrests of members of the opposition, the disruption of the work of the Supreme Court, the refusal to allow one opposition leader into the country and the house arrest of another, the detention of a UN representative, and the violence used by the authorities against peaceful demonstrators all show that Pakistan is on the brink of a precipice.
Commissioner, the EU should now send the strong and united message that it is popular democratic power and a society that respects human rights, and not an army, which is the strongest barrier to the rise to power of radical groups.
We understand that the country has internal threats to its security and that there has to be a response to these, but democracy is not a threat to security.
Democracy is also precisely the answer in the struggle against talebanisation.
The EU must dare to speak up and say that we see the building of a stable and democratic society as being crucial to our alliance.
The first step for Pakistan's stability is to guarantee that the Supreme Court can work independently and in peace.
Then there are the parliamentary elections in January.
The supply of international assistance to the authorities in the investigation into the bomb attack in October would show our concern.
A society which is at least officially constitutional, with long democratic traditions and where the people have a genuine desire for democracy, peace and stability, will not give up that easily.
Pakistan is, therefore, full of hope.
(CS) Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the long-term experience of many countries shows that the rule of law and democracy are the best and most effective way of preventing extremism, instability and chaos.
Seen from this angle, President Musharraf's decision to declare a state of emergency is a serious mistake and gaffe.
Pakistan is not a country without democratic traditions: on the contrary, as seen from the courageous and responsible conduct of Pakistani judges, lawyers, journalists and other representatives of non-governmental organisations, civil society has deep and strong roots in Pakistan.
However, this civil society needs help.
We therefore appeal to President Musharraf to end the state of emergency, to release all political prisoners and to restore all the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution, including freedom of movement, speech, association and assembly, so that truly democratic, free and transparent parliamentary elections can be held at the beginning of next year.
Mr President, the last couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster of shocking events in this turbulent and troubled country.
The imposition of martial law in the guise of emergency rule is an underhand attempt to destabilise Pakistan for the personal ambition of one man.
President Musharraf justifies his actions as an attempt to stop the country from committing suicide, but it is not that the country is committing suicide but that the actions and deeds of a dictator are killing the country.
It is totally unacceptable that the leader of the opposition, Benazir Bhutto, has been put under house arrest and banned from political activity and that other activists and the media and independent judiciary have all been muzzled.
While recognising that there are real threats from extremists within the country, I believe that General Musharraf's actions will only embolden the extremists instead of eradicating them and will serve only to weaken the democratic and moderate voices within the country.
Some say that Pakistan is on the brink of collapse.
We must prevent this by giving a strong response.
Moderate people in Pakistan are feeling frustrated and angry and they are disappointed by Europe's soft response.
Therefore I call upon Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Council to give an unequivocal, clear message to the President about the severe consequences if the suppression of the constitution, of politicians, of the media and of the judiciary does not end immediately.
(NL) Mr President, almost all the previous speakers have made the point that the declaration of a state of emergency in Pakistan and the way in which it was done is totally unacceptable.
It is unacceptable that Musharraf should show such a cavalier disregard for democracy.
Moreover, this state of emergency aggravates a serious problem still further because in a manner of speaking it opens up a second front, that of Islamic terrorism.
As you know, there is already plenty about Musharraf's regime to criticise: it is ineffectual in its measures against the Taliban, for example, and groups associated with Al-Qaeda which are operating along the border with Afghanistan.
Well, declaring a state of emergency has opened the door to terror organisations of this kind and the situation can only get worse as a result.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the European Parliament for scheduling this debate, which, in view of the situation in Pakistan and the cooperation we have had with that country in such an important battle against extremism and terrorism, is very opportune indeed.
We cannot and will not remain indifferent to a country like Pakistan.
This debate also shows that the three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, share the same fundamental and immediate objectives, i.e. the rapid and complete restoration of the rule of law and democratic freedoms in Pakistan and the holding of free and democratic elections.
This is the goal that unites us and the goal that we must all work towards, particularly the three institutions, in the area of our respective competences and powers.
I would also like to say that in the capacity of the Presidency we also understand, as the Commissioner has said here, that any measures that might lead to a possible suspension of cooperation affecting a population which is already suffering many shortages must be considered and examined with care.
The people of Pakistan have already suffered enough and must not suffer further.
This too is a question that must be considered with some care, should it arise.
Whatever the case, our objectives are now clear and defined, and I can assure you that the Presidency and the Council will take all the initiatives and measures deemed appropriate to respond to developments in the situation.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think it has been shown very clearly that we all feel that what has happened is very difficult to understand.
It is very serious.
We are all concerned, because the imposition of emergency rule has greatly endangered the strengthening of democratic institutions and the building of a more inclusive democratic process.
It is therefore of fundamental importance that civil and political rights are fully restored, media restrictions withdrawn and essential improvements made to the framework and conditions for elections.
Stability and development can only be achieved with democracy and the rule of law.
We therefore have to reflect further on the question of a possible election observation mission.
As I said, we might be able to send a smaller team of advisers to follow the process under the current circumstances.
If not, as I said, the state of emergency would have to be lifted very quickly and civil liberties restored.
With regard to aid, let me say that we had already substantially increased our aid to Pakistan, particularly in the fields of education and rural development.
Therefore, as I said before, I think at this stage we must sit back, wait for a moment, and judge very carefully.
Of course we should not endanger the poor people in Pakistan, but we have to go about things in the right way.
To wind up the debate I have received seven motions for a resolution tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 15 November 2007.
Written declarations (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. - Pakistan is a vital ally in the war on terror.
As a result it has faced enormous internal pressure and threatened instability.
President Musharaff has responded to this situation by declaring a state of emergency.
He argues that an abnormal situation requires abnormal actions.
