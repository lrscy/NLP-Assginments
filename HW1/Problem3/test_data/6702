in writing. (SV) In today's resolution on the situation in Gaza, which I have voted in favour of, I would like to have seen a more balanced discussion of the reasons why Israel and its army have been compelled to use methods that, viewed on their own, can be regarded as unreasonable.
The right of a country to protect its own citizens is a fundamental one, and it is the whole picture, and not individual events, on which judgments must be made.
in writing. Britain is in the forefront of research into defences against biological and toxin weapons and Britain must have continue to have freedom of action and independence in these matters.
We deplore the use of weapons against civilian populations and fully support the existing Geneva Conventions, including the Fourth Convention, which already provides legal protection for civilians in time of war and has been ratified by 194 countries.
in writing. I support the demand that next week's Sixth Review Conference should reconfirm the commitment of all 155 States Parties to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) the first multilateral disarmament treaty banning an entire category of weapons and their commitment to the complete prohibition of biological weapons.
There must be a thorough review of the operation of the BTWC to identify, discuss and agree on how to further strengthen the Convention and achieve a ban on biological and toxin weapons that is a universally binding rule of international law.
The EU must take up this issue in the transatlantic forums, in particular NATO, to convince the US Administration to move away from its unilateral standpoint and to contribute to the relaunch of an enhanced multilateral framework.
I welcome the entry into force this month of the CCW's Protocol V on Explosive Remnants of War and hope many more States will sign it and ratify the five Protocols.
I urge the EU and its Member States to urgently establish protocols on relevant weapons systems and establish a protocol unambiguously banning the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of all types of cluster bombs (fragmentation bombs).
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party has today decided to join fellow MEPs in voting to support the international campaign for a ban on the use of cluster bombs.
In addition, we draw attention to the fact that although white phosphorus is a conventional and not a chemical weapon, Britain - but not America - has signed Protocol III of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons banning the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations.
Labour accepts the assessment of health consequence from depleted uranium made by Britain's Royal Society and supports further research by the World Health Organisation.
British troops always deserve the best available equipment to protect themselves, but reports that white phosphorus grenades were used in Iraq have been shown to be wrong, and neither does Britain have any DU stocks in Iraq.
in writing. The British Conservative Delegation fully supports the BTWC and the international efforts to universalise the Convention and to implement it effectively.
We are also long-standing and consistent supporters of the ban on anti-personnel landmines (APL) although we do not believe that it is a priority to clear APL from uninhabited and economically unused terrain (for example, parts of the Falkland Islands) provided that areas of possible danger are properly indicated.
We are also very wary about campaigns to extend the scope of international conventions to include cluster and other munitions.
We support moves to minimise the negative after-effects of conflict, such as explosive remnants, and to introduce 'smart' (self-destructive, precision-guided, etc.) weapons where appropriate.
We support a ban on the use of white phosphorus a weapon, but it has other battlefield uses, for example for smokescreen.
We would certainly not support any action that would put British military personnel at increased risk or deprive the British Armed Forces of essential ordnance.
Therefore, while we support most of the text of this resolution we are not able to support a sweeping ban on cluster munitions at this stage, or indeed on the use of white phosphorus.
We therefore voted against the amendments and abstained overall.
in writing. (SV) We support the Via Baltica highway project, on condition that a sound environmental study is carried out.
in writing. (SV) The June List welcomes the Baltic Sea being put on the political agenda.
There are many positive aspects to this report, including the fact that due attention is to be paid to the environmental problems in the region.
We are also very positively disposed towards paragraph 13, which states that those Member States that wish to do so should have the right to introduce environmental regulations more stringent than those proposed by the EU.
We do not agree, however, that the EU should fund the Via Baltica highway project.
It is also proposed that Europol cooperation should be increased. We do feel able to support this, provided that it only means that the exchange of information is improved.
It must not lead to a European arrest warrant or to a given State's police being able to take action in a different State.
We have supported this report as a whole in today's vote as we have concluded that the positive elements in it outweigh the negative ones.
in writing. (SV) The primary aim of this report is to stress that the Baltic is a particularly sensitive sea of brackish water.
Paragraph 13, which grants the Member States the right to more stringent legislation in order to protect the Baltic Sea, and paragraph 11, which requires that environmental impact assessments be carried out for all energy projects, are critical to saving the Baltic Sea.
I am therefore voting in favour of the report despite the negative points in relation to increased border checks and more unsustainable infrastructure projects in the region.
in writing. (SV) The report on which we are voting today is a wish list for advocates of a militarised EU state.
Fortunately, it is only an own-initiative report, but, all the same, it is a clear signal to the other institutions of the EU of the direction that Parliament's majority wants the EU to take.
The establishment of a standing naval force in the Mediterranean is one of the most preposterous ideas put forward.
What is more, the majority of the committee advocates the creation of a separate budget heading for military operations, and attempts are also being made to revive the dead draft Constitution.
As always when the European Parliament gets the chance to give its opinion, there is a desire to give more power to the Members of this House.
We have also adopted a position on the amendment calling for a coastguard under the aegis of the EU.
The development described in the report is very disturbing and should be a wake-up call, even for the most inveterate advocates of an EU state.
In view of the insecure situation with which we are faced nowadays, as a result of the numerous conflicts that are going on around the world, we should instead be asking ourselves whether the establishment of an EU army is the right way to address these problems.
Whether or not a nation state is to send in troops is something that must always be decided by the national parliaments, and never by a United States of Europe formed from the EU.
We have therefore voted against this report and most of the amendments to it that have been tabled.
in writing. The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports much of this report, in particular the emphasis on ensuring that ESDP is made more effective, so that it can be used as a tool to help in crisis zones throughout the world.
We also welcome the support given to greater cooperation between the EU and NATO, building on past experience, and the need for further development of capabilities.
However, we do not support the provisions in paragraph 52 concerning the establishment of a European Defence Minister, or the establishment of a European standing naval force.
In addition, we do not support paragraph 44, which recommends military operations be funded centrally from the EU budget.
Concerning paragraph 51, it is important to remember that we are currently in a period of reflection on the future of the Constitution and to underline that ESDP does not constitute the development of a Security and Defence Union.
in writing. - (FR) Some of the points in Mr von Wogau's analysis coincide with our views, particularly those concerning the threats to Europe's security, such as terrorism, the vulnerability of our oil supplies and the permeability of our borders.
In fact, contrary to the assertions of our governments, which have dismantled the systems that used to defend our nations, the world has become more dangerous than it was before the Berlin Wall came down.
The proposals contained in the report, however, are built on a second illusion, namely the idea that nations can rely on supranational bodies to guarantee their security.
In actual fact, when the chips are down, a nation always stands alone.
Today the United States devotes 3.5% of its GDP to defence, compared with the one per cent spent by the 25 Member States of the European Union.
European harmonisation of defence equipment is certainly necessary, but do not let us dissolve our armed forces into a Eurocorps, in which orders would be given in 21 languages and which, via NATO, would be under US command.
Let us rather strengthen the defence of each of our countries.
Only independent nations, conscious of their identity, will make that effort.
To that end, the soulless and borderless Europe of Brussels must first be replaced by a Europe of sovereign nations.
in writing. - (PT) The document proposed here has earned my support since it is both realistic about what is desirable and ambitious about what is possible.
Security is one of the most important issues for European citizens, particularly as regards the risk of threats on European soil, and on that subject the rapporteur has sought to be realistic and to understand the immediacy and nature of the threats and the real danger they pose.
On the other hand, he has been ambitious in wanting to take a global approach, not just in the military field but also in the areas of technology, information and intelligence.
We too have to be ambitious as regards the need to promote peace and economic development in third countries, insofar as that is essential for our own security and for a better world, which is a goal that we should be pursuing with just as much commitment.
I have therefore voted in favour of this agreement, since I agree in essence with its analyses and concerns, even though I neither share nor think it necessary to share all its axioms and conclusions.
in writing. (SV) The EU's common cooperation on foreign and security matters must not be allowed to become a competitor to NATO.
It is therefore pleasing to see that the European Parliament has come out clearly in favour of strengthening the transatlantic link and that it is stressing the importance of closer cooperation with NATO.
The EU does currently have a common foreign and security policy.
This report, however, represents a step towards a deeper level of cooperation on foreign and security matters through which Sweden could lose its ability to decide on its own foreign and security policy.
The Member States' own military resources should, in fact, continue to form the basis of this cooperation in future.
It is regrettable that the report expresses support for the European arrest warrant, which makes it possible for Swedish citizens to be handed over to other EU states without the opportunity of trial in Sweden.
The report also contains expressions of support for the Constitution.
The result of all this is that I voted against the report in the final vote despite the fact that I share the goals of the report in terms of strengthening the EU's cooperation with NATO.
in writing. (SV) We have voted in favour of the report on succession and wills in order for the conflict rules to be clarified.
However, as an aim of the report is to harmonise laws on succession and wills, we wish to stress emphatically our view that a harmonisation of the substantive law is undesirable and that, under the EC Treaty, this area must be, and indeed remain, a solely national competence.
in writing. - (FR) In seeking to regulate conflicts of law and jurisdiction regarding succession and wills, the European Parliament has for once refrained from encroaching on areas for which national governments have sole responsibility.
Succession cases with an international dimension, of which there are 50 000 to 100 000 every year in EU territory, do not actually warrant a new wave of forced standardisation of the provisions of substantive law but only require the harmonisation of the rules of private international law and the creation of a European certificate of succession.
Accordingly, we subscribe to the second parliamentary recommendation, which is designed merely to standardise the rules governing conflicts of law and jurisdiction.
This, we believe, is the only approach that will enable the Member States to preserve their own legal systems and their own legal customs and traditions.
Only then will it be possible to coordinate effectively the national legal systems involved in a given probate case.
To prevent any conflicts of law in the area of inheritance, it is necessary and sufficient to know for certain, with no room for dispute, which law will apply.
in writing. (SV) This report would create legal chaos and set differing national legal standards and practice against each other if its ideas were implemented.
The June List is a committed opponent of common civil and criminal legislation at the EU level.
The consequences if this proposal were adopted would include Swedish citizens losing their unconditional right to divorce (allowing for the rule on a six-month period of reflection).
One example of this is as follows.
A married couple with Swedish citizenship take up residence in Malta.
One of the spouses then moves back to Sweden and petitions a Swedish court for divorce.
Under current Swedish legislation, that spouse would get a divorce under Swedish law.
Under this proposal, however, it would instead be Maltese law that applied.
This could mean that it would simply not be possible to get a divorce, as divorce is prohibited not only in Malta but in a number of other European countries.
This would therefore mean that Swedish citizens would miss out both on maintenance for their children and on the right to half of the assets owned jointly with their spouses.
In the June List's opinion, this is entirely unacceptable.
Legislation in this area is an expression of national, religious and social values.
The EU must not be allowed to trample all over these values.
As usual, we are discovering that subsidiarity and pluralism only exist in grand speeches, while the reality is a ruthless drive towards harmonisation.
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Gomes report on women in international politics.
The political desire demonstrated at the Beijing Summit in 1995 and the existing international conventions have indeed helped to make the public and decision-makers aware of the issue of equality at every level of society.
Nevertheless, these declarations have not had the practical effect of eliminating the non-legal obstacles that continue to prevent women from playing a full part in public life.
The Member States need to adopt measures aimed at reconciling social, professional and family life, in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and of the Lisbon Strategy.
I support the creation of a European Institute for Gender Equality aimed at boosting the low numbers of women in politics and at promoting greater female representation in international politics.
It is therefore a matter of urgency to open up new channels that will allow women to become more involved in peace and security issues, particularly through more equal nominations at the United Nations or within the external delegations of the European Union.
in writing. The Lisbon Strategy placed gender- sensitive economic policies at the heart of the strategy for growth and competitiveness, but women's full participation in politics is an essential requisite to achieving gender-sensitive economic policies.
A milestone was reached by the 1995 Beijing Conference in advancing the gender equality agenda.
Yet, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, of the 43 961 members of parliaments worldwide only 16.4% are women.
The percentage of women elected to the European Parliament ranges from 58% to 0%, with an average slightly above 30%.
The percentage of women elected to the Member States' national parliaments varies between 45% and 9%.
This marks a fundamental democratic deficit at European level and in the wider international context.
I call on Member States to review their national legislation to promote parity and genuine democracy in politics, review their constitution, legislation and practice, enshrine gender equality as a fundamental principle in their constitutions and take measures aiming at the reconciliation of social, family and professional life, in line with the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council and the Lisbon Strategy, thereby creating an enabling environment for women's full participation in politics.
in writing. - (PT) Although this report is about women in international politics and it finds that there is a real problem, it ought not to have skirted around the constraints that prevent women from playing an effective part in political and social life.
The text contains no reference to the economic and social reasons why women's participation is limited.
For instance, it refers to the pay gap and the need to share domestic responsibilities with men, but it does not mention the real difficulties, particularly working conditions, over-exploitation, low pay, job insecurity, part-time work, and the lack of social facilities at an affordable price.
The approach taken to the subject ignores class differences, and includes only what happens in the dominant class.
Thus there is no explicit reference to economic, employment or social policies.
As a result, in the measures it puts forward, the report continually proposes something that I find unacceptable: a compulsory quota system with penalties for parties, while ignoring the fact that the problems and constraints that exist include, for instance, the economic and social conditions on the ground and the electoral systems themselves.
In Portugal, for example, the Socialist Party has approved the quota system but is preparing to throw out the current electoral system, which in practice may lead to fewer women being elected.
in writing. - (PT) Participation by women in international politics (as well as national politics, the economy and the arts) is a sign of developed, well-balanced societies.
A world just of men is worse than a world of men and women.
But that does not mean that, every time a woman is elected, or every time a government is composed of as many women as men, it should in itself be a reason to feel satisfied.
Women are not just women, contrary to what some of those who support quotas and equal representation seem to think.
Fortunately, the value of each of these women lies in what she thinks, does, supports and represents.
I therefore do not consider it reasonable simply to applaud the election of any woman, whoever she might be.
Similarly, I do not think the desired effect can be achieved by means of quotas and imposing equal representation.
Balance must be an outcome, not a gesture.
I can speak quite freely on this subject, because the Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) is the only party that has had a woman as parliamentary leader, minister of justice or secretary-general.
These women deserve my recognition, however, not for symbolic reasons, but on their merits.
in writing. - (FR) In Germany, Liberia, Chile and, even more recently, in the United States Congress, the appointment of women to key posts has been widely applauded.
I willingly join in this applause, while hoping that, one day, these female success stories will no longer have a symbolic value, but may become an everyday occurrence.
It is no longer enough for a female politician to centre her media discourse on the real or supposed male chauvinism of her opponents, as we can see from the sad 'example' provided by the French Socialist Party's internal campaign for the presidential nomination.
We need to demonstrate a more responsible and less demanding attitude, since equal gender representation is now the accepted approach.
The UMP delegation in the European Parliament, which consists of nine women and eight men, sets the trend in that regard.
I hope that we support the aspiration and desire of a new generation of women to get involved in politics.
However, rather than constantly churning out finicky and sometimes overly radical regulations promoting women, we must have faith in their ability to assert themselves and to project their beliefs at every level - local, national or European - as women, certainly, but also as elected representatives.
in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate Mrs Bauer on this very high-quality report.
Its unanimous adoption within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs testifies to its quality.
The report is timely in pointing out that the international trade in human beings affects between 600 000 and 800 000 men, women and children each year.
Around 80% of these victims are women and 50% are young girls.
The majority of the victims of this trade are sexually exploited for commercial gain.
In order to deal with the growth in this form of trafficking and with its increasingly international character, this report proposes a series of integrated measures to be taken at European level, which I feel are equal to the challenges associated with this scourge.
Above all, it highlights the EU's desire to follow an approach focused on human rights and on the victims, which I feel is crucial.
For these reasons and because the fight to uphold human dignity deserves our full support, I voted in favour of this text proposing the adoption of a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on fighting trafficking in human beings.
in writing. - (FR) Bizarrely, this report strives to make a clear distinction between human trafficking and illegal immigration.
In many cases, however, they are unquestionably similar, because illegal immigration has become part and parcel of genuine human trafficking, the most appalling form of which is carried out for the purposes of sexual exploitation.
Who are the real culprits, though?
Without doubt, they are the smugglers, the drug traffickers, the pimps and other oppressors who take advantage of a European territory that has no internal borders and that is wide open to migratory flows.
Yet, they are also the national and European leaders, who are taking no serious action to combat illegal entries, mass immigration, sham marriages - or, worse still, are implementing an overtly 'pro-immigration' policy.
Punishing the smugglers more severely, dismantling the criminal rings, and paving the way for further cooperation among States are undoubtedly objectives that must be attained.
The placebo effect will not last long, however, because the real difficulty - the lack of controls at the European Union's internal borders - remains.
If we do not challenge the free movement of non-EU nationals, that veritable dogma spouted by Brussels, then illegal immigration will continue irresistibly to develop.
in writing. (SV) The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings has already been signed by 30 countries.
The Convention has been ratified by Moldova and Romania, amongst others, and work on ratification is under way in Sweden.
The Convention applies to all forms of trafficking in human beings irrespective of whether it is national or international or linked to organised crime.
The Convention complements, in this way, the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime.
The June List believes that the EU should respect the national and international agreements already signed by its Member States.
In our opinion, it is for the democratically elected national parliaments of the respective countries to enter into legally binding treaties.
We support the struggle against the trafficking of human beings and we congratulate the governments of Romania and Moldova on their courage in having ratified this extremely important Convention.
We therefore do not see it as necessary for the EU to be calling for ratification.
The sovereign nations of Europe have already taken up the struggle amongst themselves, without interference from supranational bodies.
in writing. - (PT) On the whole we welcome the report, although we regret that certain proposed amendments have been adopted that do not help to make the fight against trafficking in human beings, above all women, any more effective.
We are unhappy at the removal of those paragraphs that referred to the need to 'criminalise the buying of another person's body for sexual use' with the aim of reducing trafficking for sexual purposes.
As many studies show, banning the exploitation of prostitution substantially decreases organised crime and trafficking, particularly of women and children.
The report has, however, retained a number of positive points, such as the need to impose extremely severe penalties on companies using cheap labour supplied through human trafficking, or the need for Member States to accept responsibility for the victims of trafficking in human beings, in addition to effectively clamping down on the laundering of the proceeds of the traffic in human beings.
Even so, the report could have gone further on fighting the problem at source, through a policy of cooperation with the countries of origin, including support for specific economic and social development projects, thus reducing the main causes of trafficking, which are poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.
in writing. - (FR) This report accomplishes the amazing feat of making an illusory distinction between human trafficking and illegal immigration.
The fact is that, since the disastrous 1985 Schengen agreements abolishing the European Union's internal border controls, these two phenomena - which no one doubts are closely linked - have developed at an exponential rate.
Ever since Europe took it upon itself, on behalf of the Member States, to implement 'an area of freedom, security and justice', the criminal gangs, the pimps and the organised smuggling rings have made profits such as they have never made before.
These networks are multiplying and prospering by exploiting more and more human beings.
In a bid to find a solution to these human tragedies, the Commission and Parliament are proposing to organise political dialogues among States and to introduce yet more programmes and cooperation plans.
What is the use in doing that?
It is high time we tackled the real causes of human trafficking and illegal immigration: the lack of secure, protected borders in Europe.
It is true, however, that it is impossible for our Eurocrats to challenge the sacrosanct rule of free movement of persons!
Trafficking in human beings is a modern version of the slave trade, but in some respects worse.
In this case, desperation makes the victims pay to be trafficked, and the authorities, often with the best of humanitarian intentions, may adopt policies that encourage trafficking and help the traffickers do business.
In this field, as often happens, we have to be cruel to be kind. That means being strict with those who provide work, strict with those who arrive, strict with those who stay and, above all, strict and rigorous in enforcing the law.
Shutting our eyes to illegal immigration is tantamount to aiding and abetting human trafficking.
I therefore believe that we should unhesitatingly recognise the benefits of legal immigration and, since the lack of a strong hand in fighting illegal immigration merely encourages the networks that traffic human beings, we have to stand firm in upholding legality.
It is not enough, however, to focus on immigration laws.
For an effective - and humane - approach, we must try and promote the economic success and development that we enjoy in the migrants' countries of origin.
That is the direction in which we should all be moving together.
in writing. - (FR) The figures and estimates concerning human trafficking are frightening.
Mrs Bauer's report quotes figures of 600 000 to 800 000 men, women and children who are trafficked throughout the world each year.
This is a form of exploitation that includes, at the very least, not only prostitution, but also forced labour or services, slavery and even organ removal.
Yet, what the report does not tell us is that there are more and more of these human tragedies, ever since the destructive Schengen agreements abolishing internal border controls were signed in 1985.
Europe's idea of heaven, the universally longed-for and coveted 'area of security, freedom and justice', proves not to exist in any of the Member States and, worse still, it proves to be dangerous and to be favourable to the development of all kinds of gangs and organised crime.
As long as our national and European municipal worthies refuse to see that the increase in this international trafficking is due to open borders and that all the policies for combating human trafficking and illegal immigration hinge on the immediate re-establishment of border controls in Europe, the programmes and plans that follow on from one another will be worse than useless.
in writing. - (PT) This report on a highly controversial Commission communication has ended up enshrining some of the most negative aspects of the methods, particularly propaganda, that are being developed in order to put the project for a so-called European Constitution back on the table.
After the defeat that Europe's ruling elite suffered in the referendums on the draft Constitutional Treaty in France and the Netherlands, they now want to go on as before without any further setbacks by investing as much as possible in a propaganda campaign, transforming a necessary democratic communication policy into a real propaganda campaign serving the interests of the dominant class.
Although the report also covers other, less controversial topics, such as sectoral programmes aimed at young people in education and the call to intensify parliamentary and other debates, the truth is that its predominant line overall is propaganda, especially about the quality leap that they want to achieve with a so-called European Constitution.
Hence our vote against.
in writing. - (FR) The aim of the European communication policy is ostensibly to 'counter the effect produced by the rejection of the Constitutional Treaty [...] and to halt the general rise of Euroscepticism'.
What is at stake, in your opinion?
Information on Europe, which is truncated, distorted and exploited by the media and the national political classes.
What is the solution?
A campaign plugging the benefits of the European Union, organised by a Brussels 'Propaganda Staffel'.
Who is the target?
The people of Europe, whose Euroscepticism is directly proportional to their ignorance of the paradise created for them in Brussels, Euroscepticism that must be converted into blind admiration and unconditional support.
Who are you trying to kid?
You have not listened to or understood a thing.
It is precisely because they were informed, and because they got their information from the source, by reading the text, that the people of France and the Netherlands overwhelmingly rejected the Constitution.
It is precisely because they live through the economic and social disasters of your policy each day that they are Eurosceptics.
It is precisely because, for once, they were directly asked their opinion that they took an interest in Europe.
It is precisely because you have a deep-rooted fear of the people that you prefer brainwashing to direct consultation of these citizens, whom you regard, deep down, as idiots.
They feel exactly the same way about you.
in writing. (SV) The EU's communication policy must not be an attempt to sell a United States of Europe to the citizens.
The institutions of the EU should only put out accurate and factual financial reports and reports on their activities and otherwise provide information on things such as the exchange projects on offer in higher education.
It is not the case, as seems to be assumed, that the more knowledge a particular voter has, the more he or she becomes a proponent of the construction of an EU superstate.
People's views on intergovernmental collaboration or supranationalism as forms of cooperation within the EU have their basis in values and not in factual knowledge.
We further do not believe that Brussels should arrange for top-down initiatives and funding to enable EU parties to engage in dialogue with their constituencies on EU matters.
The political interest in EU matters must be built from the bottom up through political parties and organisations.
It is also pointed out in the report that communication is to be based on initiatives promoted through popular communication channels such as cultural programmes (such as through the awarding of literary or film prizes), sporting events and the like. We would again state our view that such methods of marketing the EU are redolent of contempt for Europeans.
This is not how the EU should inform people of its existence and of what it does.
in writing. - (PT) While I agree in essence with the positions and concerns of the Commission regarding communication policy, particularly on the need to be transparent and to engage with the people, I still feel that it should be quite clear that a communication policy is not an end in itself, but a means.
That is how it should be understood.
The illusion that everything is communication and that communication is everything may lead us to a society devoid of meaning, in which all that matters is the existence of the message and little is invested in its content.
What that means, in my view, is that the key to a successful EU communication policy lies in the Union's ability to be seen to be useful to the citizens of the Member States.
I stress useful, and seen to be useful.
That is where the two issues - substance and communication - come into play.
The EU has to promote political reform that stimulates economic development, security, international order and hope.
That is the substance.
As for communication, if the substance is good, it is an art, but it is only part of the story, and not the most important part at that.
In addition, right now, it must not be confused with propaganda.
I agree with the former, but not the latter.

Famagusta/Varosha (debate)
The next item is the debate on the question put by Marcin Libicki, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the oral response concerning the incorporation of the return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants into the comprehensive measures for ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community-B6-0446/2006).
author. - (PL) Mr President, we have been waiting for quite a long time for the oral question on Varosha, in the Famagusta area, to appear on the European Parliament's agenda.
It so happens that we are debating matters related to the Committee on Petitions for the second time today.
This morning, our committee presented its report on the European Ombudsman's report.
I am very pleased that, although we have been waiting for a long time to discuss these two items, they have both been raised on the same day.
It is with great satisfaction that, since we are describing the Committee on Petitions as a body that is intended to bring the European Union institutions closer to the citizens, we can today discuss a very important petition.
I am also very pleased that some of the authors of the petition are here in the Chamber, and are sitting in the gallery.
I am pleased to welcome Mr Afxentiou and Mr Christofidis who, as I have mentioned, are two of the authors of the petition and are listening to the debate today.
Mr President, the decision to table an oral question was taken in our committee at its meeting on 14 July 2005. The authors of the petition, including those who are here today, were also present at that meeting.
They represent an organisation which is very important in Cyprus, and is called the Famagusta Refugees Movement.
This movement was created in 1976 by the displaced inhabitants of Famagusta.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament deferred the discussion a number of times. This resulted in significant delays to the staging of today's debate.
In the meantime, the whole problem has taken on even greater urgency.
The authors of the petition stressed that 30 years have passed since Famagusta was occupied by the Turkish army and the district of the town known as Varosha was closed off.
When presenting their problems and their petition during our committee meeting, the authors of the petition pointed out that Varosha, which has become a complete ghost town, is causing a great rift between the displaced inhabitants and their descendants.
It is an obstacle to the general economic revitalisation of the town and is doing nothing to promote better understanding between the communities in Cyprus.
The authors of the petition propose in particular that Varosha should be returned to its original inhabitants, under regulations to be adopted by the international community, and in particular by the European Union.
The authors of the petition declare their support for attempts to help Turkish Cypriots who, from a legal and social point of view, form an integral part of Cyprus.
They also express concerns regarding the regulations which have been implemented, and which favour the Turkish Cypriot community.
Their concerns relate to the fact that these measures are causing isolation and disassociation from the underlying strategy which aims to reunite Cyprus.
The authors of the petition stressed that, although this objective is contained in the explanatory statement in the Council regulation, which aims to create a financial aid instrument to foster the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, this package intends to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by supporting economic and social development, focussing particularly on economic integration.
There has been no consistent policy to achieve these aims.
For their part, the authors of the petition propose, first and foremost, measures to facilitate the promotion of trade and tourism, which could increase the prosperity of the community and improve its financial situation, as well as making full use of the potential of the port of Famagusta, which would then result in the regeneration of the whole surrounding region.
The authors of the petition also proposed that part of the European Union funding earmarked for providing support to Turkish Cypriots should be paid into a special fund managed by a non-governmental organisation, in which both communities would be equal stakeholders, under the auspices of the European Union and the supervision of the European Commission.
They also proposed that these funds should be earmarked for renovating, modernising and making use of the port of Famagusta.
The Committee on Petitions has, on behalf of the authors, addressed a question to the European Commission asking what instruments the Commission intends to use to ensure that the issues raised by the authors of the petition are resolved.
On 27 February 2006, the General Affairs Council decided to call on the Commission to undertake further efforts in the field of direct trade for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot communities, on the basis of negotiations which took place during the Luxembourg presidency, when the matter of the closed area of Varosha and the port was raised, together with matters relating to free trade.
At the same time, it was also said that this part of Famagusta, Varosha, is not currently being used.
It is an incredibly painful situation for the displaced inhabitants and their descendants. It also makes the economic regeneration of the town difficult and it does nothing to build trust between the Cypriot communities.
What action, then, does the Commission intend to take in connection with the above-mentioned decision, to ensure that the closed area of Famagusta can be returned to its rightful inhabitants?.
Mr President, this House has, on numerous occasions, debated issues in this House related to Cyprus, Turkey and the problems caused by the Turkish aggression against Cyprus.
This petition, and the oral question resulting from it, addresses this very problem, which is a fundamental issue for that part of Europe and has consequences for the whole of the European Union.
That is why I would be very grateful not only for an answer on this issue, but also to see the proposals put forward by various European bodies, as well as the demands of the authors of the petition, being implemented.
The matter is important, as the solution will, for Turkish, Greek and Cypriot society at large, serve to indicate how effectively the European bodies can resolve problems related to the hopes of European citizens.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would very much like to request a response and I hope that this response will satisfy the authors of the petitions, as well as the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Libicki and the Committee on Petitions for raising this question.
Personal friends I have known for a long time are refugees from Varosha and, therefore, I know the importance of the issue not only because of my portfolio but also because of my personal contacts.
The United Nations has the responsibility and competences to pursue a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue.
The Commission supports the United Nations in these efforts and encourages the parties concerned to resume talks on such a settlement.
The return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants is one of the key elements in the UN-led process.
If agreed by the parties, the return of Varosha will have to take place under the auspices of the United Nations.
The Annan Plan foresaw an early return of Varosha to its lawful inhabitants. However, the plan, supported by the United Nations and the European Union, fell in 2004.
The return of Varosha is a separate issue from the introduction of direct trade between the Turkish Cypriot Community and the rest of the European Union.
Direct trade is a matter of EU competence.
The Commission proposed a draft regulation to this effect in July 2004.
Successive EU presidencies, in seeking to establish a consensus in the Council on the direct trade regulation, have investigated possible solutions, but without success so far.
The Finnish Presidency is making substantial diplomatic efforts to unblock the current stalemate and the Commission fully supports the Presidency in its efforts.
The Finnish formula would create a genuine win-win situation for both communities and all parties concerned.
It would be a major confidence-building measure towards a comprehensive settlement, thus meaning also a prospect of the return of Varosha.
Creating a win-win situation has been the essence of European integration since the times of Robert Schuman and Konrad Adenauer, who united France and Germany just five years after the most bitter and devastating war on earth was fought on their soil.
Over the past 42 years there has been enough talk of 'red lines' and 'blackmail' in the eastern Mediterranean.
That is pre-modern talk in today's post-modern Europe.
It is high time to replace red lines with bridge-building and win-win thinking, because that is what the European Union is all about.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Famagusta question is primarily a humanitarian one.
That was precisely the basis on which the Famagusta refugee movement presented its petition to the Committee on Petitions.
For 32 years now, over 30 000 people have dreamt day and night about going back to their homes.
Thirty-two years is too long.
The beautiful city of Famagusta is still uninhabited.
It is a ghost town.
Turkey cynically insists on keeping it as a bargaining tool.
Naturally, the question the inhabitants of Famagusta are asking is what the international community is doing, and what the European Union is doing, to help them go back to their homes.
The Commissioner has said that everybody is trying.
However, the issue is very simple.
There is an empty city to be given to its lawful inhabitants.
There are other bargaining tools for Turkey to use.
Turkey is not being sent the right message on what should be done.
The deliberations on Famagusta are the first big step towards a proper solution to the Cyprus problem based on United Nations resolutions and European values.
Turkey has to take that step now, in the interests of justice, in the interests of Turkey and in the interests of Greek and Turkish Cypriots, as Mr Libicki has said.
The desperate appeal coming from those refugees from Famagusta who are still alive is: 'Help us to go back home'.
Let us help them, Commissioner.
Now is the time.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most of us are lucky enough to enjoy small luxuries, such as, for example, living in our own home, in a neighbourhood of acquaintances and friends.
Today, however, we are debating efforts by certain people who belong to the large European family to be able to regain exactly what we consider to be reasonable in our everyday lives.
The movement of refugees from Famagusta consists of displaced citizens from what has been a ghost town for 32 years.
These people have, of course, managed to rebuild their lives in Cyprus.
Just think, however, what it means to know that your first home or your parents' home lies abandoned and inaccessible a few kilometres away, for reasons for which you are not to blame.
The return of the town of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants in the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot community will have numerous economic and social benefits.
Famagusta was a popular tourist destination.
Its reconstruction can restore it to its former glory, as well as creating huge potential for trade, by making use of its port, which can be reopened as requested, using the latest technologies in order to make the best possible use of it.
If the town is restored to its residents in a way which safeguards the strengthening of ties between the two communities, with guarantees from the international community and, of course, the European Union during the period of reconstruction and development, reasonable ties will develop between the two communities.
If an environment of security, certainty and trust is created for economic development and cooperation, as cooperation in employment and the economy develops, social ties will develop alongside it.
Finally, what is needed is for the town to develop its own momentum, a momentum which will function as an example and precursor.
I wonder, given that the request comes from the residents of the town themselves and knowing the good ties between people on both sides, if we have the right to refuse, if we have the right not to help.
Nonetheless, this opportunity should not become a chance for us to blow up progress efforts in Cyprus.
We shall all have our responsibilities, responsibilities towards the people as well as responsibilities towards posterity.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the taking of hostages by terrorists and their subsequent holding to ransom has not been an uncommon occurrence in recent years.
It is a despicable act of satanic criminal perversion, and is widely and universally condemned by all those with even the slightest degree of common sense.
Equally, the taking of a city as hostage by a country which has invaded another and then uses that city to extract political gains by blackmail is a case of psychopathic barbarism of immense magnitude and unintelligible reasoning.
This is what has happened in the case of Famagusta.
Up until 1974, Famagusta was a thriving city full of life and vigour, with a rich history going back thousands of years, surrounded by blossoming citrus fruit orchards, lying on a golden sandy coast.
It was a city of enviable beauty.
Famagusta was widely regarded by many as the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean.
Its peace-loving inhabitants went about their daily lives, working hard to achieve progress and prosperity.
But in the summer of 1974, all their dreams were shattered.
After repeated severe and catastrophic air bombardments, the city was overrun by droves of Turkish soldiers, tanks and armoured vehicles, spreading death and destruction in their path.
In horror, the inhabitants fled, trying desperately to save the lives of their loved ones and carrying with them the bare essentials needed to survive.
Most of them found refuge on an area of high ground a few kilometres to the south of the city, where they lived in makeshift refugee camps, and from where they watched their homes being looted by Turkish soldiers.
Apart from furniture and other household effects, the invaders took away doors, windows, pipes, roof tiles and everything else they could lay their hands on.
Then they fenced off the whole city, declared it a military zone and put guards around it.
This state of affairs continues today, 33 years later.
Whenever an inhabitant, driven by homesick desperation, has tried to approach his fenced city, he has been shot dead on the spot or arrested by Turkish soldiers and tried in Turkish military courts on grounds of entering a high security military area.
The ghost city of Famagusta has many times been the focus of attention in various UN resolutions, and in between the 'ifs' and 'whens' and 'hows' of hazy diplomatic language, the people of Famagusta have tried to believe time and time again that they will return to their homes.
But this has all been an illusion, because in the real world of political diplomacy it is almost always the strong who have their way.
In the case of Cyprus, Turkey was, and still is, by far the strongest.
Just as the refugees from Famagusta were about to become totally disillusioned with the UNs and Security Councils of this world, new hope suddenly emerged in the form of Cyprus' accession to the EU.
Men, women and children were suddenly uttering words like 'the European acquis communautaire' and 'the principles and values upon which the EU is founded'.
Many were even convinced that after accession the EU would force Turkey to return Famagusta to its rightful occupants.
How simple-minded they were.
Little did they realise that the EU mainly cares about trading in the vast Turkish market and not about the old-fashioned principles of justice and freedom.
Little did they know that the EU mainly views Turkey as being of close to almighty importance in counteracting the threat of Islamic fundamentalists.
And so, dear colleagues, we find ourselves today talking, talking and talking about the right of Famagustians to go home.
Most probably, if Turkey has its way, we shall continue talking about it for a long time to come, while the great EU goes on being proud of its principles and values, and almost everybody will be happy - especially the Turkish Government - apart from the people of Famagusta.
We will gradually come to terms with their grief at having to watch their city, the jewel of the Eastern Mediterranean, slowly die away under the careful eye of the UN, the Security Council, and now the EU.
Mr President, the question of the return of the sealed-off area of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants has never formed part of the overall settlement of the Cyprus question, on which the relevant United Nations resolutions have been passed.
The long-standing decoupling of the return of the town from the overall settlement is one element I want to comment on.
The second element is that the Commission, in its last progress report on Turkey, emphasised that the application of the protocol is per se a legal obligation which cannot be linked to the status of the Turkish-Cypriot community.
Consequently, Turkey is wrong to link the matter of the honouring of its commitments to the lifting of the so-called isolation of the Turkish-Cypriots which, insofar as it exists, is due solely and exclusively to the Turkish occupation.
Circles in the European Union are likewise wrong to accept this link.
However, if this link is made, the proposal by the Cypriot Government on joint use of the port of Famagusta, under the aegis of the United Nations and with supervision by the European Commission, combined with the return of the lawful inhabitants of the town, may be the turning point which will help overcome the entirely unwelcome impasse that has developed.
Turkey will be satisfied in its demand for the so-called isolation of Turkish-Cypriots to be lifted.
The Turkish Cypriots, even though they have absolutely nothing to lose by returning the town which has been deserted for 32 years to its lawful inhabitants, are safeguarding the right to engage in export trade via the port.
Likewise, all the lawful inhabitants will move back to their town while, at the same time, the Turkish ports and airports will open to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes.
Finally, the coexistence of the two communities in Famagusta will help efforts to find an overall solution to the Cyprus problem.
To conclude, the return of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants is the key to addressing current difficulties in a way which serves the well-meant interests of all sides.
If everyone rises to the occasion and reason prevails, we are quietly optimistic that the complication that has arisen will be addressed with success.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, Famagusta is being held hostage.
It has been described as a ghost town; it is desolate, isolated and empty.
Famagusta is a city on the east coast of Cyprus.
In 1974 Turkish troops invaded Famagusta and since then the city has been fenced off.
At the moment it is unused and is guarded by Turkish troops.
Nobody lives there.
Anybody who attempts to enter is shot on the spot or tried in military courts.
Famagusta only enjoyed independence for 14 years.
During that time, it was of indispensable benefit to the Cypriot economy.
It had a population of 60 000 and 15 000 daily commuters.
It hosted a bustling port.
Despite housing only 7% of the population of Cyprus, it accounted for over 10% of the total industrial employment and production of Cyprus.
Despite these figures and the obvious benefit to Cyprus, the town has remained desolate.
This is clearly not a tolerable situation for Cyprus or the people.
Obviously something must be done.
I find it incredible that the EU is not demanding the immediate and unconditional return of Famagusta to its inhabitants who are, incidentally, EU citizens.
Instead we have this bizarre situation where the EU and many EU governments try to accommodate every one of Turkey's obscene demands and wishes.
We all know that Turkey desires to join the EU.
We know what a powerful country it is.
However, we must ask ourselves whether Turkey is ready to join the European Union.
Turkey is doing its accession cause no good.
When I first came to this House, I voted to open talks with Turkey.
I abstained in the latest vote.
Will I have to vote against Turkish accession or will I feel a little goodwill on the part of Turkey some time soon?
I can see no good in this situation.
Returning Famagusta would be an excellent opportunity for Turkey to show not only the original inhabitants of Famagusta but also the EU and the rest of the world that it is a peace-loving and peace-supporting nation.
Mr President, since the Turkish invasion of 1974, Cyprus has remained tragically divided and the city of Famagusta has been occupied by the Turkish armed forces.
We are now beginning to see a promising deal emerging under the Finnish Presidency of the EU, under which the Turkish-occupied north of the island can be reopened to direct trade through the port of Famagusta, under strict EU monitoring.
This would be in exchange for the return by Turkey of the fenced-off area of Varosha to its original Greek Cypriot residents, under UN control.
Fortunately, the original Greek Cypriot inhabitants can return with minimal disruption, as no one needs to be relocated because the depopulated Varosha area was sealed off in 1974 and is under the direct control of the Turkish military.
Reference to the resettlement of Varosha was included in the 1979 Kyprianou-Denktas high-level agreement.
It was agreed all that time ago that this would be implemented without awaiting the outcome of the discussion on other aspects of the Cyprus problem, or be used as a bargaining chip in dealing with other Cypriot issues.
Certainly its return cannot be linked to the issue of Turkey implementing its firm commitment as an EU candidate state to open its ports to all Cypriot vessels, as agreed by Turkey under the Ankara Protocol on enlargement of the customs union, which must be extended to all EU Member States.
These include the Republic of Cyprus, which Turkey ludicrously refuses to recognise legally, even though Cyprus is a full EU Member State.
The Green Line also needs to be carefully monitored if direct trade from the north is resumed, with regard to potential increases in illegal immigration and people-trafficking, particularly of women from Eastern Europe.
Furthermore, the so-called Republic of Northern Cyprus cannot be allowed to carry on as a sanctuary to escaped criminals, including notable UK fugitives from justice such as Mr Asil Nadir.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is, in European terms, intolerable that Varosha should be in the state it is: a ghost town, a town sealed off by barbed wire, yet, having formerly been home to some 30 000 people, it has been empty for 32 years.
The people who once lived there can, from a distance, see their houses behind the fence; the desire to go back to them has never left them, and I believe they have a right to do that.
I know, Commissioner, that we in this House and you in the Commission cannot sort out the Cyprus problem on our own.
If things had gone the way this House, or the Commission, had wanted, a solution based on the Annan plan would be in place today, but, disappointed though we are by the Greek Cypriots' overwhelming 'no', we do have to respect it, and - let me make this quite plain - we actually have done so.
We nevertheless hope for a solution soon.
What really could create trust and encourage further positive developments would be for Varosha to be returned to its original inhabitants and governed by representatives of both communities, and for Cypriots of both ethnicities to live together in Famagusta.
You have indicated, Commissioner, that the Finnish Presidency of the Council is currently endeavouring to facilitate the direct trade between the EU and Northern Cyprus that has been promised for over two years.
We have given the Turkish Cypriots our word that this would be done.
Opening up Varosha in line with the petitioners' request, though, could help people who have been waiting for thirty-two years to return there and would also make it possible for them to coexist in a new way, one that can open up the prospect of an overall solution.
I hope that the Finnish Presidency will rethink its proposal in this regard.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus has for a long time been divided into three sections.
Three percent of the territory is made up of British army bases.
None of the local people knows what happens there, but they are clearly places where a number of foreigners earn good salaries.
The General Affairs Council is calling on the Commission to support direct trade with the Turkish community in Cyprus in connection with the opening up of Famagusta - known as Varosha in Turkish - which is currently sealed off.
Given that Parliament has discussed the release of an amount of money to develop and renew the infrastructure of the northern part of Cyprus, I should like to ask when, if Famagusta belongs to the northern part of the island, reconstruction work using the above-mentioned resources will start and when it will be open to the local population.
If, on the other hand, it belongs to the south, when will it be open for the local inhabitants to begin rebuilding the town?
Or is there perhaps some third way forward, Commissioner?
Should the British units posted on the island be solving the problem?
(DE) Mr President, Strasbourg, this wonderful city, in which the European Parliament has its only seat, and will, it is to be hoped, continue to do so in future, was proposed, after the Second World War, as the capital city of an united Europe by the British Labour politician Ernest Bevin.
He said at the time, that, as no city had suffered as much from human stupidity as Strasbourg, it was ideally suited to being the place where human stupidity was to be overcome.
I wish we could soon be in a position to say something similar about Famagusta, which is symbolic of a brutal expulsion that is both contrary to international law and a violation of human rights, as brutal as it is senseless; yet it could, without difficulty, and by one simple act of goodwill, be made a symbol of the downfall of nationalism and expulsion, one whose impact would be felt a long distance away from Cyprus.
I recall how, on one occasion when I was in Northern Cyprus, I had a Turkish Cypriot driver who spoke good Greek, and said: 'I have deep sympathy with my Greek-speaking fellow-Cypriots, and it is not the Greek Cypriots that are our problem, but the Turkish army and the settlers that have been brought into the country artificially.'
It is these people who have a vested interest in keeping this dispute alive.
That is what we should do something about.
We should ensure that both ethnic groups can be reconciled and that the expellees can return to their original homes in Famagusta; that would send out a message to the whole of the Mediterranean, to Europe and the world as a whole, affirming that people belonging to different ethnic groups can live together in peace under the rule of law.
Cyprus could, in this respect, become an example for many, many other troublespots, and so I am grateful to the organisers of this petition for raising this issue.
We owe it to them to stand alongside them in every way and secure them that to which they are entitled and for which they have been waiting for so long, namely that Famagusta should once more become the flourishing place of commerce and culture that it has been throughout its history - a history filled with proud traditions which, let it be hoped, may be re-established in the future.
(Applause)
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 32 years after the military invasion and continuing occupation, the photographs emerging from the sealed-off area of Varosha, which is controlled solely by the Turkish army, bear irrefutable witness to the Cyprus tragedy, breaches of international and European law and the collapse of European democratic civilisation.
The request by Greek-Cypriot citizens - refugees themselves like their Turkish-Cypriot fellow citizens in their own country - for the chance to return to their homes and properties, is a basic request for respect for humanitarian principles.
At the same time, it is a vital initiative to build a climate of trust, security and reconciliation between the two communities, an initiative which surpasses the harsh reality of the partition and will help efforts to achieve joint development and coexistence and close the psychological gap between the two sides.
If the European Union works consistently and decisively in the direction of confidence-building measures - and it can, Commissioner - then the necessary preconditions can be created for the resumption of an honest dialogue with the objective of a viable and operational solution to the Cyprus problem.
The solution cannot be a matter for leaders and their political will alone.
It is closely linked to the community and the citizens and with the feeling of justice which must be consolidated.
In the history of Cyprus there have been many lost opportunities at political level.
We must not waste opportunities at social level for the peaceful reunification of the island for the benefit of all its citizens, both Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot.
(PL) Mr President, as far as the facts of the matter are concerned, a lot has already been said about Famagusta's status.
I would like to highlight three points.
First of all, the inhabitants have the right to their own property and have the right to return there.
Secondly, the problem of Famagusta is like schizophrenia, or like a cancer on the body of the European Union.
If we are unable to deal with this situation, I doubt that we will be able to cope with Turkey's accession to the Union at some point in the future.
Finally, Mr President, you yourself, all the European institutions, and European democracy as a whole, will one day be judged and accused of failing to protect the legacy of the culture in which we were all raised.
Famagusta is a good example of this cultural heritage and we cannot allow everything there to fall into ruin, as already appears to be the case.
If we are dealing with an occupying power, then it seems to me that we have to adopt a different strategy.
The current strategy is not effective and we are all responsible for that, yourself, Mr President, included.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, many speakers have said that the division of Cyprus is tragic.
I fully agree.
Reunification should have happened yesterday at the latest.
The European Union consistently supports these efforts, and the EU has tried to take its own part, with the Commission being actively involved in all these efforts.
With the involvement of all the presidencies in these efforts in the last couple of years, the European Union has invested an enormous amount of energy and effort in solving the Cyprus dilemma.
Today, the Finnish formula is likely to be the last chance for several years to unblock the current stalemate.
Therefore it should be taken extremely seriously.
Judging by last Monday's Council Meeting of Foreign Ministers of the European Union, the EU Member States are indeed supportive of the Finnish efforts. So is the Commission, with both the political ways and means and legal and other substantive expertise to facilitate solutions.
To sum up, everybody should seize this opportunity and thus create a real win-win situation for everybody, including the Varosha refugees.
The debate is closed.
1.
Ethiopia
The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Ethiopia.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the news of the ongoing arrests, humiliation and intimidation of opposition politicians and students in Ethiopia has caused outrage and these actions should be decisively condemned.
The recent arrest and expulsion from Ethiopia of two European Commission officials, who were accused of attempting to help Yalemzewd Bekele, a lawyer and women's rights advocate working for the European Commission in Addis Ababa, only serves to underline the gravity of the situation.
Neither should we forget about the fact that 111 people are still in detention following the mass arrest of opposition supporters during demonstrations held in June and November 2005.
I call upon the Commission and to the Council to do everything in their power to initiate a broad dialogue in Ethiopia, which would involve the participation of the political parties, civil society organisation and the authorities, to agree on a permanent solution to the current political crisis.
We have to do all we can to make sure that the enduring principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law are re-established in that country.
In order for this to happen, the Ethiopian authorities must show the world that they are willing to resolve the current crisis.
The immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners would certainly constitute such a gesture of goodwill.
author. - Mr President, the issue of human rights in Ethiopia has been the subject of numerous previous motions for resolution in this House.
Unfortunately, it seems that our advisory words of wisdom and strong condemnation have been falling on deaf ears as far as the Ethiopian Government is concerned.
However, who can blame it for behaving in such an arbitrary and totally unacceptable manner towards this Parliament when the Commission, for reasons best known to itself, invited Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to address the European Development Days specifically on governance issues?
That inevitably sent out the wrong signal with regard to the EU's policy on respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance.
Perhaps the Commissioner might be kind enough to explain to us today what the logic was behind that invitation.
We all understand the difficulties Ethiopia has been facing in its troubled post-colonial history and realise that some blame lies clearly and squarely with the ex-colonisers.
We all want to help the Ethiopian people to achieve an acceptable standard of living, free of the evils of internal fighting and regional conflict.
However, the governing regime in Addis Ababa must understand comprehensively and unequivocally that the highly-desired political stability will not be achieved through continuing arrests, harassment, arbitrary detention, humiliation and the intimidation of opposition politicians, civil society activists, students and other ordinary citizens.
Such actions are, on the contrary, bound to lead to a deterioration of the already fragile political situation in Ethiopia, and the feared further worsening of the situation will become a certainty rather than a possibility.
I urge colleagues to support this motion for a resolution, and I wait with interest to hear the Commissioner's comments on the issue of the invitation to Mr Meles Zenawi.
author. - (PT) The repression of students and of the Oromo, Amhara and other ethnic groups in Ethiopia; the continuing imprisonment and mock trials of elected opposition leaders, trade union leaders, journalists, teachers, human rights and development activists, and many other Ethiopians who are fighting for freedom and democracy; the manipulation by the Meles Zenawi government of the conclusions reached by the commission of inquiry into the massacre of 193 people in June and November 2005, following protests about election fraud, and the persecution of the judges in that commission who refused to alter their findings and were therefore forced to flee the country; the detention of the lawyer Yalemzewd Bekele, who was working for the European Union delegation, and the unjustified expulsion of European diplomats in violation of the Vienna Convention - all these events not only demonstrate how anti-democratic and totalitarian the Meles Zenawi regime is, but also expose its growing fragility and desperation.
Ever since the conclusions of the EU election observation mission in 2005, the Member States' governments in the Council and the Commission should have been working together to take action regarding Mr Meles Zenawi's regime.
As Teshale Aberra, one of the judges who had to flee the country, said, the Meles Zenawi government is just as bad as, or even worse than, the Mengistu regime.
Ethiopia receives financial aid from the European Union, and therefore the European Union must demand the immediate release of all political prisoners.
It must also demand that an international inquiry into the 2005 massacres be set up and that those responsible for the massacres be brought to justice.
The EU must adopt the appropriate measures provided for in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, of which Ethiopia is a member, as this Parliament demands.
Such measures include freezing the European assets of Mr Meles Zenawi and members of his government and denying them entry visas to Europe.
All these measures must be designed so as to hit those who are primarily responsible, and not to hurt the Ethiopian people.
Our governments and the Commission must stop justifying their tolerant attitude towards this anti-democratic regime that violates human rights, on the pretext that it is an ally in the fight against terrorism.
We in Europe and the United States must stop deluding ourselves.
Ethiopia's intervention in Somalia on the pretext of fighting terrorism has only served to entrench the Islamic Courts in Mogadishu, and the disastrous consequences do not stop there: discredited and lacking in popular support, Mr Meles Zenawi's regime has left Ethiopia itself, Africa's second most populous country, wide open to infiltration by terrorists.
author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last month, Mrs Kinnock and I, together with two African colleagues, had the privilege of leading a delegation to Ethiopia, where we had talks with both the government and the opposition, as well as with members of the families of detained dissidents.
We are very concerned about the situation there.
We have found a complete lack of willingness - particularly on the part of the government - to learn any real lessons from the results of the elections, or, on the other hand, from the findings of a commission of inquiry into the parliament that the government had itself set up.
We have urged the Prime Minister to take these findings from the commission of inquiry as the starting point for a nationwide dialogue.
To that he gave no clear response; on the contrary, indeed, we have discovered that the members of this commission have been subject to duress and that some of them have fled abroad.
If the report is published at all, it will no doubt appear in a polished-up and falsified form.
We are grateful to the President of the Commission for speaking to the prime minister in such very plain terms of the occasion of his visit, but it is unfortunate that the environment Commissioner should, by inviting Mr Meles to visit Brussels, undermine the Commission's stance.
I think it important that we should, now that we are equipping ourselves with a new instrument for democracy and human rights, ensure that it is an effective one and one that enables us to support democratic political forces.
The new regulation must include a form of words to this effect, for how else are we to provide the opposition with legal counsel or help newly-elected parliamentarians who have no money to exercise their constitutional rights?
It is for that reason that I call on not only the Commission, but also and in particular on the Member States to abandon their resistance to an effective instrument for democracy and human rights being drafted in these terms.
author. - Mr President, in these debates we regularly stress the importance of dialogue and frank discussion.
In Ethiopia's case that dialogue will be a critical one, both in the sense of it being important and in the sense of our being critical of the Ethiopian Government's current practices.
The omens are not good.
Some 193 citizens were killed in the riots in June and November 2005.
The report on that inquiry remains unpublished, sanitised and unclear.
Since that time a number of Ethiopians have been imprisoned, and recently two EU officials were expelled from the country.
All this is not news to anyone involved in this debate, but things are stacking up and do not look good for Ethiopia.
Dialogue will indeed be critical and, as Mr Matsakis says, paragraph 7 of this resolution expresses regret at the forthcoming visit of Prime Minister Zenawi to Brussels to tell us about good governance.
This is an irony that would be funny were it not so tragic.
However, let us be positive.
The Commissioner will hopefully tell us today that this will give us the opportunity to speak to Prime Minister Zenawi and tell him frankly of our concerns.
I hope the Commissioner will confirm that this opportunity will not be missed when Mr Zenawi comes to Brussels.
Ethiopia plays an important role in the African Union and an important role in development.
We could work much better in cooperation with one another.
However, that cooperation, as colleagues have mentioned, should not be taken for granted and must be based on mutual principles and, importantly, adherence to them.
If we do not stick to our principles we can hardly expect others to, so I hope we can have a frank and open discussion with the Prime Minister when he comes to Brussels.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the outcome of the parliamentary elections on 15 May 2005 saw an atmosphere of political repression fall over Ethiopia once more, and once more too, then, we find ourselves gathered here in this House discussing that country.
Its manipulation of the elections and its repressive response to popular unrest have cost the Ethiopian Government respect at home and abroad and have cost the country itself its stability.
The only way to counteract this is to resume the process of democratisation and involve the opposition parties in it.
A year ago, the Ethiopian parliament set up a commission to investigate the murders committed in June and November 2005, and we call on the Ethiopian Government to publish that commission's final report without delay, without alteration and at full length.
The findings must be put before the competent courts and used as the basis for fair proceedings in them.
We also call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners without delay and unconditionally.
Mr President, we are well aware of the fact that all countries and societies around the world have the right to freedom and independence.
I should point out that today, we are talking about a very specific country, a country whose history is older than the history of many, or even most, European countries, who consider their roots to lie in the times of the Old Testament rulers King David and the Queen of Sheba.
This country, which also adopted Christianity earlier than many, if not most, European countries, is a country that is also entirely unique on the African continent.
It has maintained its sovereignty throughout its history, with the exception of a short period in the thirties, when it was conquered by a European state.
Even then, it maintained its independence in legal terms.
Even during that invasion, which was an attempt to impose colonial rule, Emperor Haile Selassie, the country's honourable ruler, who was greatly respected throughout the world and in Ethiopia, represented his country when he was an expatriate and in exile.
In the seventies, Ethiopia was the victim of a communist plot, involving the Kremlin and Cuba.
Since then, it has not managed to return to normality.
I do not want to repeat that which has already been said about the current suffering of the Ethiopian people, but it really is our duty to aid this country and its society.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Commission has unfortunately behaved like a bull in a china shop by inviting the Ethiopian Prime Minister to the European Development Days.
This event, to which the Prime Minister of Ethiopia has been invited as a guest, began on the same day as the Parliamentary session and will end tomorrow.
The Ethiopian Prime Minister has even appeared as a speaker.
The European Commission has decided that it would prefer to turn a deaf ear to the reports of persecution that are emerging from Ethiopia.
However, we in the European Union cannot pretend that we are dealing with a normal country.
In fact, quite the opposite is the case.
We are dealing with a country which is a political prison for many journalists, trade unionists and human rights advocates.
We do not even know how large a prison it is, as the Ethiopian government systematically refuses to reveal how many political prisoners there are or how many people have been arrested.
Recently, members of yet another profession, namely teachers, were arrested.
Clearly the attitude of the European Commission and the Council towards Ethiopia must depend on whether Ethiopia upholds human rights and, first and foremost, whether it agrees to release political prisoners or not.
However, it should also be made clear that this is not only a matter that concerns the European Union.
The African Union must also take action.
That is why I stress that both unions need to deal with the issue.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, after the post-2005 election crisis the Commission, in close cooperation with the EU Member States and the international community, undertook efforts to defuse tensions and urged the Ethiopian Government to restore confidence in the democratisation process through the release of political detainees.
The EU, in line with the international donor community, has given priority to maintaining an open and structured dialogue with the Ethiopian Government as the most appropriate way towards improving the situation.
Following a visit to key political detainees, Commissioner Michel received commitments from Prime Minister Meles Zenawi during a dialogue in February that they would get a short and fair trial.
President Barroso met Prime Minister Zenawi in Addis Ababa last October to express the Commission's concerns about the trial and the prisoners.
President Barroso pointed out that he expected the trial to be speedy, fair and transparent.
He also stressed that he did not consider a trial to be an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political differences.
Instead, he suggested reconciliation and dialogue as the only way forward in building confidence.
When two members of the Commission delegation were arrested and expelled from Ethiopia and a local employee of the delegation was arrested, President Barroso, Commissioner Michel and EU Member States immediately expressed their deep concern at these events, which clearly breached the Vienna Convention.
The Commission strongly refuted the accusation against the Commission delegation and its staff.
The Commission headquarters expressed its support and solidarity with the delegation staff and we were satisfied that this immediate and strong reaction resulted in the release of the arrested local agent on bail.
There have been some doubts as to the wisdom of inviting Prime Minister Zenawi to the European Development Days.
The Commission believes that dialogue and further efforts have to be pursued to convey EU concerns to the Ethiopian Government and to obtain commitments on democratic reforms and good governance.
The meetings and debates planned for the European Development Days will provide an opportunity to convey these messages directly and express our deep concerns.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.

Bangladesh
The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Bangladesh.
author. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Bangladesh is one of the world's most overcrowded and poorest countries.
In the 1940s Bangladesh was divided into two sections on the basis of religion, which failed to ease an already complicated situation.
The subsequent war of independence with Pakistan only served to exacerbate the extreme poverty, and not only in the provinces.
In the country's constitution, there is a special mechanism for placing power into the hands of the incumbent government during the preparation of elections.
It is known the world over that microloans have been a great success.
Less well known is that this success has, in this strongly Islamic country, been due especially to the commitment of women.
As in any vastly overcrowded and very poor country, there are huge problems with inadequate infrastructure and with religious and ethic intolerance.
I believe that these problems can be reduced and that the secular tradition can prevail.
A difficult problem in any election, and not only in developing countries, is the question of who is eligible to vote.
In Bangladesh the problem is exacerbated by the fact that a section of the population is illiterate.
The next most important thing after factually correct electoral registers is for candidates to have the opportunity to present their manifestos.
It is no wonder that the proposed text of the resolution also highlights this.
I should like to emphasise at this point that I do not believe that the recognition or otherwise of journalists by any country in the world can serve as a yardstick of democratisation.
In any event, freedom of the press is closely associated with the democratic competition of ideas and manifestos.
This is something that must not under any circumstances be compromised in the run-up to elections.
Similarly, it is the permanent responsibility of all governments to eliminate terrorist groups.
A more complex issue is how to define the word terrorist, and how to fight terrorism in a democratic society.
At the last meeting of the group for cooperation with Southeast Asian countries, which I had the honour of chairing, those in attendance expressed the view that it is possible for genuinely democratic elections to take place in Bangladesh.
The observations contained in the motion for a resolution made their mark in the meeting I chaired, and I believe that sending a European Parliament observation mission will help towards the democratic running of the elections.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left supports the motion for a resolution before us, and I believe that we must support the process of democratisation in Bangladesh, including helping to make these elections as democratic as possible.
author. - (FR) Mr President, Bangladesh, land of democratic tradition, of respect for human rights, of independence of the judiciary and of freedom of the press that it is, is today plagued by the rise of violent Islamic fundamentalism.
The last 'Reporters without Borders' report reveals hundreds of attacks on freedom of the press.
This year alone, three journalists have been killed, at least 95 others have been attacked and dozens, if not hundreds, of correspondents have been forced to flee after being intimidated for writing articles that are deemed to be 'un-Islamic'.
If it was my wish for Parliament urgently to voice its opinion on this situation today, it is because, right now, in Dhaka, Salah Choudhury is standing trial for sedition.
This journalist, the editor of the Weekly Blitz, is a fervent supporter of moderate Islam, who advocates openness and dialogue between religions and recognition by his country of the State of Israel.
For these reasons and for these reasons alone, he is in danger today of being sentenced to death.
We urge the Commission to follow the developments in this trial so as to ensure that the rights of the defendant, together with the international conventions on freedom of the press, are respected.
Since I have a few seconds left, I should like to declare my support for the interim government's efforts to ensure that the pre-election process also complies with international democratic standards: the establishment of an appropriate electoral register, a truly independent electoral commission and, I shall come back to it once again, the balance and freedom of the media during the election campaign, of course.
It is quite clear that the country's four private television channels have difficulty in putting forward a different point of view to that of the government if they want to keep their licences.
Two terrorist leaders have been arrested in Bangladesh; continued efforts must be made to disarm the Islamic militias that are trying to put pressure on the voters on the eve of the election.
We expect the government to confirm its commitment in this regard, too.
author. - (PL) Mr President, Bangladesh is an important partner for the European Union.
It is a country which has made significant economic progress during the last few years.
At the moment, its most famous citizen is Mohammad Junus, who received the Nobel Peace Prize this year for his contribution to the fight against poverty by means of a system of microcredits.
However, Bangladesh is not struggling just with poverty, but also with corruption and an increasingly antagonistic attitude displayed by followers of Islam.
The creation of the caretaker government headed by President Iajuddin Ahmed was met with protests from Bangladeshi society.
According to reports by external observers and the Awami League, the authorities illegally increased the voting lists for the upcoming elections by 13 million surnames.
The caretaker government must guarantee free elections which comply with international standards.
The independence of the electoral committee also needs to be guaranteed and the electoral roll simply needs to be credible.
An agreement between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Awami League and the other parties on the creation of a common economic programme, which is vital in order to improve the living conditions and civil liberties of the people of Bangladesh would undoubtedly be a basis for political stability in the country.
Under the terms of key international human rights conventions, the interim government has to combat lawlessness, extra-judicial executions and torture, which are usually the work of the police or the security forces.
Meanwhile, the situation is as follows: last year three journalists were killed and nearly 100 people were victims of intimidation or sustained physical injuries.
Attacks on staff of non-governmental organisations are increasing from day to day.
Religious minorities, namely Hindus and Christians, are living in danger.
Rape and human trafficking involving women and children are commonplace.
The impression is that everything that has been achieved in terms of democracy in the country is disappearing as a result of the growing violence on the part of Islamic fundamentalists.
The Council and the European Commission should systematically monitor the human rights situation in Bangladesh.
They should also monitor the situation as regards freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
We hope that the planned European Union observation mission to Bangladesh, to supervise the forthcoming elections in January, will help to ensure that the election process is democratic.
author. - (DE) Mr President, it was a fortnight ago that it all started, when the outgoing prime minister of Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia, made a controversial address on the television, whereupon violent clashes broke out in the capital, Dhaka, in which three people were killed and hundreds injured.
The opposition charged Zia with filling the key posts in her interim government with sympathisers, accused the head of the electoral commission of being biased and asserted that there were 13 million invalid names in the electoral register.
More violence broke out at the beginning of this week, with all transit routes to Dhaka by land or water being blockaded, journalists attacked and seriously wounded, 20 000 members of the security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets in street battles, all of which left seventeen people dead and thousands injured.
There are increasing attacks by Islamists on adherents of other religions, and I condemn, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the acts of bloody violence and the constant assaults by Islamic extremists on religious minorities such as Christians, Ahmadis and Hindus, and the suppression of press freedom, which other Members have already denounced.
Those in power - who belong to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party - and the Awami League opposition, must bury their personal animosities once and for all and embark upon purposeful dialogue.
A date has been set for elections, and it must be kept to; the electoral commission must start preparing for them now, and that means, above all else, making sure that the electoral register is correct.
The conditions currently prevailing - which are tantamount to civil war - must be normalised as soon as possible, with the Islamists being disarmed.
The citizens must be enabled to avail themselves of their right to vote without fear of reprisals in order that democracy may be given a chance.
I welcome the Commission's willingness to send election observers to Bangladesh, and this House should resolve to do likewise.
author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, a few weeks ago, the European Parliament, in the context of its interparliamentary delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia, invited over a great many representatives of Bangladeshi civil society, and it was very interesting.
It was very interesting, firstly, to see the reaction of the Bangladeshi ambassador, who had been nominated, the poor man, that very day and who was getting to grips with what Parliament was all about on that occasion: he saw the devastation that democracy and transparency can cause when they are applied!
We did, indeed, learn many things that day, which was very useful because the representatives of your Commission who were present were not really keen, at the start of the morning, to go and ascertain what was taking place on the ground.
Having heard what we all heard, they were well and truly obliged, at the end of the meeting, to acknowledge that intervention was needed, so serious is the situation on the ground.
I shall not go back over what was said by my fellow Members regarding the poverty, corruption, violence and torture - torture inflicted not only by the squadrons of the various militias, but also by the police.
The figures in this regard are terrible: in 2005, 2 297 cases of torture were recorded as having been carried out by the police.
I shall mention the case of the journalist, Mr Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, who is in danger of being sentenced to death on the sole grounds that he expressed his opinion freely: this is totally unbearable!
I could also quote a figure that comes from your Commission, Commissioner: your own services estimate that more than 13 million invalid names have been added to the electoral register.
How can elections be contemplated when it is already clear that there will be such a huge amount of fraud, so much organised fraud?
That is why, over and above the vote in favour that the vast majority of us are, I hope, going to cast today, the Commission really must provide itself with all of the resources needed to send out signals on the ground aimed at making the government quickly move the goalposts, so as to bring it into line with the democratic standards that existed in this country a few years ago, and to thus put a stop to the institutional violence that is sadly degenerating into social violence.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it must be a top EU priority to ensure free and fair elections next year in Bangladesh, a traditionally secular and democratic country of 140 million people.
For many years since its foundation in 1971, Bangladesh was the exception in the Islamic world as it pursued its independent course as a Bengali nation in a peaceful and democratic fashion.
Regrettably, since 2001 there has been increasing Islamicisation of Bangladesh as Islamists have attempted to fill the vacuum left by corrupt warring secular parties.
The NGO Task Force against Torture has documented over 500 cases of torture and intimidation by radical Islamists who have also murdered supporters of the Communist Party.
Indeed, Hindus, Ahmadis, Christians, Chittagong Hill Tract tribal people and Buddhists have also been targeted.
Recent civil unrest took to the streets with violent outbreaks as the Awami League opposition doubted the impartiality of the electoral commission, the integrity of the voters' list or even the impartiality of the original caretaker prime ministerial nominee.
The EU-Bangladesh Cooperation Agreement of 2000 is based on respect for democratic principles pursuant to Article 1, and its breach can lead to the suspension of the agreement and with it the significant EU Generalised System of Tariff Preferences and EU foreign aid, which amounts to 70% of Bangladesh's total foreign aid.
The EU and all the major donors must now coordinate to keep up the pressure for reform and full respect for democracy, a free press and human rights for all of Bangladesh's citizens prior to the parliamentary elections scheduled to take place next January.
We must send short-term political observers from the European Parliament in substantial numbers.
These elections are crucial and it is essential that the EU maintains a visible major presence throughout the Caretaker Government period, as otherwise some frustrated, power-hungry general might consider launching a military coup.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I am sure we are aware, the people of the Ganges and Brahmaputra deltas do not conceal their admiration for the Afghan Taliban and also want, in their country, to emulate Mullah Omar's Emirate of Afghanistan.
In order to achieve their ends, these holy warriors resort unscrupulously to violence.
It was unfortunate that the government of Bangladesh did not take initial warnings about the rapid rise of these terrorist groups seriously enough.
Events have quickly proved that they are not a figment of the fevered imaginations of jealous opposition leaders or sensation-hungry journalists. Many of them have paid the highest price for revealing the truth, and many others have been forced to flee the country.
In this situation, it is reassuring to know that two people have been arrested on suspicion of leading terrorist groups.
However, we must not be satisfied with that.
If we thoroughly examine the situation in this country, which for many years has failed to comply with recognised European standards in the field of human rights, in spite of drastic measures taken by the government to prevent extremist violence against religious minorities, we are still witnessing chilling and nightmarish events.
The country is also beset by many other problems, which is why I wholeheartedly support the Commission's decision to send an Election Observation Mission and to ask the European Parliament to do the same.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, as Members of the European Parliament we claim to be committed to human rights.
I therefore hope we take a strong stance in relation to Mr Choudhury's plight.
Mr Choudhury is a journalist facing charges of sedition in connection with a series of articles he published that Bangladeshi authorities deemed favourable to Israel and critical of Muslim extremism.
His points in favour of moderation and dialogue will surely be supported by every Member of this House.
Nothing he said is without grounding and in any modern-day democratic country such articles would considered objective and informative to the public.
This is not the case, however, in Bangladesh, where Mr Choudhury has been put on trial and could be executed for his articles.
He has received death threats and been assaulted, imprisoned, beaten and tortured.
Mr Choudhury is now facing an unfair trial and has little chance of seeing justice.
The presiding judge has commented in open court that Mr Choudhury has hurt the sentiments of Muslims.
It is clear that the judge is hoping for a death sentence.
As Members of the European Parliament, we cannot stand idly by while an innocent journalist is facing an unfair trial and probable death.
I am glad to see his situation specifically mentioned in this resolution, as well as support for free and fair elections in Bangladesh.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission shares Parliament's concerns and welcomes the opportunity to discuss Bangladesh today.
The country is at a critical juncture of its fragile democracy.
Much is at stake with the forthcoming elections in this densely populated country.
Regrettably, however, the institutional framework and the acrimonious relations between the two main political parties do not bode well for a peaceful and democratic electoral process.
Over the last weeks and months, the Commission and the seven Member States with representations in Dhaka, as well as the wider international community, have been intensely engaged with the main party leaders and election stakeholders, urging all of them to agree on an electoral framework that achieves the trust of all parties.
The EU regional Troika in February, local EU Presidency representatives and several high-level visits from the Commission and Member States have consistently emphasised the need for impartial guidance of the country by the Caretaker Government in the pre-electoral period, a neutral Election Commission, and a credible voter list.
As you might be aware, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has taken the political decision to deploy an EU Election Observation mission for these elections.
Preparation for the deployment of EU observers, including internal procedures between the institutions for financing the mission, are currently under way.
In her letter to the President, or Chief Adviser, she underlines the above issues as the key concerns of the European Union.
The mission would be deployed around six weeks before election day, and it would remain in the country for some two to three weeks after that day, in order to follow the post-election period, particularly in the light of the unfortunate possibility of post-election violence, especially against minorities.
The Commission shares Parliament's concerns over the widespread violence against journalists.
The fact that the latest report by Reporters sans FrontiÃšres categorises Bangladesh as an extremely dangerous place for journalists unfortunately speaks for itself.
The Commission has consistently condemned the intimidation and high level of impunity that apply to violent acts against journalists in that country.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
3.
Iran
The next item is the debate on the six motions for resolutions on Iran.
Author. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one can now be in any doubt that neoconservative policies, including the doctrine of global intervention, have failed.
They have failed in Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan, and also in relation to Iran.
The US-led 'war on terror' has strengthened Iran's power and influence in the Middle East, and until there is stability in the region, Iran's influence will continue to grow, along with its efforts to stand up to pressure from the West.
Furthermore, the more the West threatens Iran, the more it boosts radical forces in Iran.
At the same time, it cannot be ignored that the only country in the region that has pursued a clear policy of pluralism and has undergone significant internal change is indeed Iran.
If there is one country in the world that should not require external help to rid itself of extremism it is Iran.
If there is a regime that should not be given any motivation by the West to obtain nuclear weapons it is Iran.
US and British policy in particular, however, is doing precisely that, rather than engaging in sensitive political negotiation.
Iran should of course emphasise its determination to meet its international obligations.
I wish to point out once again, however, that Parliament should support human rights and non-discrimination anywhere in the world.
I shall make one final remark: in the territory of the EU Member States, there are so many social problems building up with an unavoidable human rights dimension that debate on the issue should also refer to these states.
author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, it is terribly sad that we have to keep on adopting resolutions on the violations of human rights that go on in one country or another.
Over the past two years, as many as six resolutions, statements and reports from various institutions and organisations on the subject of Iran have been adopted.
To our sorrow, we cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the situation there has got worse rather than better.
There is no freedom of opinion or of the press; the Internet is censored and independent newspapers closed down.
There are apparently more jailed journalists in the Islamic Republic of Iran than anywhere else in the Middle East, and torture is a daily occurrence.
Those of us who were members of the inter-parliamentary delegation were constantly assured, in many conversations, that the above assertions bore no relation to the facts.
Unfortunately, those on the receiving end of such treatment tell another story.
There is no respect for women's rights; for example, women are prevented from observing International Women's Day publicly.
A demonstration on 12 June by women and men who had campaigned against the legal discrimination against women was broken up violently.
That there has been a first visit to this House by a delegation from the Majlis has been a step in the right direction in seeking dialogue with parliamentarians and the general public, and respect for human rights and human dignity was at the heart of this debate, in which we were told that all the accusations levelled against Iran were far removed from the truth.
We now call on the Iranians' representative body - the Majlis - and the Iranian Government to do all in their power to confirm this by backing these statements up with actions.
The human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran has also ground to a halt, and we should try to ensure its resumption.
Perhaps, Commissioner, you might give some thought to the possibility of a radio and television station that would make possible broadcasts to Iran containing information about Europe and European policies, which would be of use to the people who live there.
Mr President, to repeat over and over again that the human rights situation in Iran is worrying is a euphemism, so scornful of basic freedoms and rights is Tehran's theocratic regime.
How can one fail to establish a link between the election in June 2005 of the conservative and revisionist president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and the growing trend of repression and persecution, the victims of which are not only the Arab, Azeri and Kurdish minorities and the religious minorities - Christians, Jews, Baha'is and Sufis - but also homosexuals and women, who are not a minority, but who continue to fall victim to countless forms of discrimination?
If I had to mention just two points in our resolution, I would point out, firstly, that Iran holds the world record for the highest number of executions of young people, bread or bicycle thieves and homosexuals.
I would then point out that the government has declared that the Centre for the Defence of Human Rights, which was cofounded by the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mrs Shirin Ebadi, is unlawful.
European diplomacy must make itself heard on such concrete examples as these.
Given that the Iranian Government dares to state that the punishment of death by stoning no longer exists in the country, I call on the Commission to take up the case with Tehran of the 11 people who have been sentenced to death by stoning, and I have here the names of the nine women and two men sentenced.
Tehran must waste no time in bringing us proof and in backing up its words with action.
author. - (DE) Mr President, you may well be surprised to learn that I agree with much of what Mr StroÅŸ had to say in this speech, but such is indeed the case, for I do believe that we have to paint a very nuanced picture of Iran, and that is why we have drafted a very wide-ranging and exhaustive resolution, as evidence, on the one hand, of how very concerned we are about the situation there, and also of how seriously we take that country and how important we believe it to be.
It is one of the oldest cultures in the world, and has been a world power for millennia; we must endeavour, by means of astute policies and diplomacy, to re-integrate it, step by step, into the international community, among those countries that co-exist as neighbours.
If that is to happen, though, there must of course be some fundamental changes in Iran.
The issue of minorities has also been brought up, and it is, in Iran - which is actually a multi-ethnic state, and so one cannot actually speak in terms of minorities - the various nations and ethnic groups have done a good job of living together since ancient times.
It also showed greater religious tolerance than did many other states in the region, but the position today is such that the state's official Islamic ideology makes life very difficult for minorities such as the Azeri or adherents of other religions, not least for other strands of Islam such as the Sufis.
On the other hand, though, there is certainly evidence coming out of Iran indicating that more and more self-confident women are going into politics, that a new generation is going down completely new paths and that this implies a great deal of hope for the future.
We must therefore consider this multi-faceted structure as it is and without isolating it.
We have to seek out contacts with the various communities and ethnic groups, and with every generation of this people, while at the same time making it clear that we do not accept under any circumstances rule by the police, the suppression of opinions, or the persecution of people by reason of their religious or other convictions, and that we repudiate all the more so the anti-Israel utterances of President Ahmadinejad, under whose leadership - it has to be said with some regret - conditions in this great country have taken a turn for the worse.
Taking energetic action to address that state of affairs is our duty as Europeans; if we are to do that, we need to cooperate with the United States of America, and I hope that one consequence of the latest political developments will be that cooperation with them on this issue will improve.
author. - (PL) Mr President, during the last year, and despite numerous undertakings by the Iranian Government to promote universal values, the civil rights, political freedoms and human rights situation in this country has deteriorated.
We are receiving more and more information about the use of torture and the inhumane treatment of prisoners.
The increasing number of reports concerning arrests of and threats against journalists is a particular cause for concern.
Since the start of the year, at least 16 journalists have been arrested, which places Iran amongst the worst countries in the world in terms of restrictions imposed on the freedom of the press.
We are also concerned by the fact that Iran, in spite of the European Union's efforts, has not agreed to a second round of the dialogue on human rights which began in 2002.
The time has come for the European Union to get tough and decisive in its talks with Iran on the issue of human rights.
Iran will only become a legitimate partner of the European Union and of the whole world if it gives everyone access to civil rights and political freedoms.
(SV) Mr President, Iran is a nation with thousands of years of cultural history behind it, a country of great riches and with a lot to offer its people and the world.
Yet what does the current regime offer its people?
Oppression, imprisonment, unemployment and censorship!
President Ahmadinejad took office on 3 August 2005, since which time the situation has deteriorated.
The present government offers its people ferocious corporal punishment.
Six hundred children keep their mothers company in prison.
Prisoners may have only three square metres in which to move around, but they are the lucky ones compared to those subjected to the death penalty.
Iran even manages to execute more people than the USA.
One hundred and eleven people have been executed in the last 12 months.
The absolutely most flagrant breach of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Iran is indeed a signatory, however, is the death penalty for minors.
A regime that does not allow young people to do their penance and mend their ways has no future; it will fall.
Iran has great potential, but while the regime there engages in persecuting academics, journalists and political activists instead of exploiting their potential, then the country and its people will continue to suffer.
Many hands have been stretched out to Iran, and the European Parliament is stretching out another to it today.
Release the political prisoners, the journalists and the representatives of minorities mentioned in today's resolution.
These are not big demands, but if they are met, the way can be paved for an improved dialogue.
Why is the Iranian regime so scared of women?
Let them participate, be elected, work, live and play their roles on the same terms as men.
To do this is to double the potential for development in a society.
There is hope.
Already, UN delegations are being permitted to inspect various facilities, and a few political prisoners have been freed.
However, the new government must seize the opportunity of adopting a policy that no longer shuts out the outside world and that gives women democratic rights.
That is the future.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, three weeks ago I attended the granting of an honorary doctorate to former President Khatami of Iran at my former university in my home town of St Andrews - the oldest Scottish university and one of the oldest and most venerable European universities.
In his valedictory lecture, former President Khatami appealed for a dialogue of civilisations, a dialogue of religions.
That is, surely, the only way we will achieve that essential understanding between our respective positions.
It is in that spirit that I support this motion.
We appeal to the Iranian authorities and the Iranian people to understand how difficult it is for us to accept the numerous and repeated infringements of such clearly basic human rights as religious rights, women's rights, children's rights, minority rights, rights to justice, rights to freedom of speech and thought, and press freedom, as listed in this resolution.
We urge the Iranian authorities to respond positively to our appeals in order that we can proceed to a positive dialogue, which can only be to the benefit of Europe and Iran, and of peace and understanding between our peoples.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, during the new academic year, which began at the end of September this year, over a dozen students in Iran were denied access to higher education because of their political beliefs.
Others were informed that they could begin their studies if they signed a kind of statement of loyalty to the current regime.
According to Human Rights Watch, the Iranian authorities have denied at least seventeen students access to higher education: six in 2005-2006 and eleven in September this year.
Since July 2005, disciplinary committees have suspended at least 41 students for at least two semesters.
Human Rights Watch also has the surnames of 35 students who have been convicted since 2005 for their political activities in student unions.
The brightest young Iranians are seeing their right to higher education restricted because of their political convictions and world view.
This is not simply a sign of this regime's authoritarian stance, but is also particularly damaging to the development of Iranian society and goes against Iranian national interests.
The European Union should implement a grant fund which would allow young Iranians who have been barred from studying in Iran due to their convictions, to continue their studies in higher education institutions in the European Member States.
It is also particularly important for the European Union to set up a radio and television network broadcasting programmes in Farsi, which would provide information about the culture, politics and society of the European Union.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in the last year we have suddenly witnessed a deterioration in the situation regarding respect for civil rights and political freedoms in Iran.
This has been acknowledged by the Iranian authorities themselves in a move which in itself is a healthy sign.
A report prepared by the judiciary provides clear and detailed evidence of human rights violations, including torture and the maltreatment of prisoners.
In addition, there are numerous reported cases in Iran today of executions of juvenile offenders and persecution of liberal and secular academics and journalists.
Furthermore, freedom of religion, freedom of the press and the rights of women, as well as minority rights, are not properly respected.
The authorities in Tehran have to realise that there can be no excuse for violating the basic human rights of its proud people and that, if such violations continue, this will only harm Iran's attempts to achieve stability, progress and prosperity for its own citizens, and will no doubt further adversely affect its relations with the West.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, what we have here is a catalogue of the most despicable acts which we most frequently encounter when discussing various deplorable dictatorships.
Of course, these acts include religious persecution, namely the persecution of Christians.
A press report appeared fairly recently on the execution of a fourteen-year old boy, who said 'I am not dying because I am a sinner, but because I am a Christian.'
The death penalty is applied in an incredibly light-handed manner.
It is cruel and includes the stoning of minors and the persecution of national groups other than those whose representatives are in power.
These are all matters which we constantly debate without ever finding a solution.
We have to stop and think.
It has been suggested today that it is clear that we should cooperate with the United States, as the USA is a power which is prepared to intervene at moments when the European Union will not sanction a military intervention, at least until it has its own military capability.
We have to develop an approach.
Perhaps it would help to send out mass information to the people in these countries to show them that opportunities for development exist other than those exercised against them by their regimes.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, the Commission welcomes and supports the thrust of the draft resolutions concerning the Human Rights situation in Iran.
Our assessment is that serious violations of human rights have continued to occur in the country during 2006.
In fact, there has been no progress in the EU's main areas of concern, and in many respects the situation has worsened.
The list of examples is long and grim: an increased use of the death penalty and the occurrence of juvenile executions continue to be of grave concern; ethnic and religious minorities continue to suffer from discrimination; the status of women remains poor; freedom of expression has been further curtailed; and the closure of newspapers, intimidation and prosecution of journalists and the clampdown on bloggers have all continued.
The European Union has raised these concerns with the Iranian authorities during the past year, through both dÃ©marches and public statements.
Unfortunately, as has been said in this House, it seems that the Iranian authorities are less willing than they have been in the past to take our requests into serious consideration or to make any tangible efforts to improve the situation.
That said, some elements within the body politic, such as the Chief Judiciary, do appear somewhat committed to the cause of reform.
However, given the overall deteriorating situation, the EU has decided to co-sponsor the Canadian resolution on the human rights situation in Iran in the UN Third Committee later this month.
Since Tehran maintains that the bilateral human rights dialogue and UN-type resolutions are mutually exclusive, it has signalled that it would consider calling off the session of the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights, scheduled for December.
We, of course, firmly reject any such link.
We still aim to resume the dialogue shortly.
We remain convinced that constructive dialogue, accompanied by cooperative projects both bilaterally and through UN agencies is the most realistic means to engage in the field of human rights.
Mrs Prets has suggested that the Union should sponsor radio or television programmes.
I am not competent to give an affirmative response to that, but as regards people-to-people contacts it is worth noting that one million Iranians visited Turkey in 2005.
They went there in order to breathe some fresh air, watch 'The Bold and the Beautiful' and check out the benchmark of democracy in that troubled region.
The crux of the matter in our relations with Iran is that, irrespective of positive or negative developments on the nuclear issue, which is extremely important, without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with that country cannot develop properly, no matter how much potential our relationship might otherwise have in terms of economic and energy cooperation.
I wish to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Delegation for relations with Iran, chaired by Mrs Beer.
I welcome your efforts to develop contacts with your interlocutors from the Majlis, as well as with the widest possible spectrum of Iranian society.
The recent visit to this House by Mr Akbar Ganji - whose liberation we all worked tirelessly for - is an important case in point.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.

Debate on the future of Europe (debate)
The next item is the debate on the future of Europe, with the participation of the Irish Prime Minister, member of the European Council.
During this debate - for the first time and on an exceptional basis - we will have simultaneous interpreting from Irish into all of the official languages.
(Applause)
This first item on the agenda is scheduled to last until 4.30 p.m.
After that we will have the Council and Commission statements on the Russia-EU Summit.
Speaking times will have to conform to that timetable.
I would like to begin by welcoming the Prime Minister of Ireland on behalf of the European Parliament.
Taoiseach,
in a few weeks time, in the new year, our Parliament will adopt Irish as the twenty-first official language.
In this multilingual House we will do everything we can to respect the commitments made in the Treaties and the rights of all languages to be used here.
Our visitor today - the Irish Taoiseach - is someone who has been taking part in the European Council for a long time.
He is one of the doyens of the European Council, having been a member since 1997 (nearly ten years ago).
He began as head of the Irish Government a few days after the Amsterdam European Council, which was the first failed attempt at a serious reform of the European institutions.
He then lived through the Nice marathon, which led to a Treaty seen as unsatisfactory from an institutional point of view.
That Treaty of Nice was rejected by the Irish people in a referendum in 2001.
But the Irish Prime Minister took on the challenge of carrying out an intensive public information campaign and, as a result, in the second referendum held 18 months later, in 2002, Ireland approved the Treaty of Nice.
The European Parliament was delighted and congratulated him enthusiastically.
Then he held the Presidency of the European Council during the Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty, in June 2004.
Those of us who sat in the Convention remember his pilgrimage to different European capitals in search of a delicate compromise that he achieved in the end.
You, Prime Minister, have therefore been a privileged witness to our institutional quest.
It is therefore a privilege to have you here with us and to hear your views on how the European Union can move beyond the impasse it is currently in.
Furthermore, Ireland has developed an intense debate amongst its citizens.
It has had a permanent forum for five years and this, at least, is one of the things we have gained from the 'no' vote in the referendums in certain countries: we have gone back to debating Europe, we have promoted the debate in civil society, and Ireland is probably the country that has done so in the most structured and permanent manner.
You will remember that the Belgian Prime Minister was our guest in May and that this is the second guest to visit us in this innovative manner, since, as a rule, this House only receives Heads of State or Government who are holding the Presidency of the Council.
The way we are receiving you today is innovative.
You will have as much time as you need to explain your points of view to us and then there will be a first round of interventions with the Presidents of the political groups, to whom you may reply if you wish, and then we shall take speeches from other Members.
Thank you very much for being here, Taoiseach.
You have the floor.
(Applause)
Prime Minister of Ireland. President Borrell, it is a great honour to be here again.
I am very grateful for the invitation to exchange views on the future of Europe with all the Members of the European Parliament today.
As someone who has spent more than half of my lifetime as a member of parliament, I cherish this renewed opportunity to address the only directly elected, multinational legislative body in the world.
Since I last addressed you in 2004, the constructive influence of the European Parliament in advancing the concerns of Europe's citizens has continued to grow.
Your vision is needed as we face the difficult challenges ahead.
I wish you every success, Mr President, for the remainder of your term of office.
I also wish your successor well.
I wish you continued success and congratulate you on all that you have achieved.
We look forward in particular to your visit to Dublin in the days ahead as part of the Forum for Europe, into which we have put an enormous amount of effort.
I thank you for your kind remarks about the Forum for Europe.
It is not a government body: it represents all the organisations in the country and it is hugely successful.
You do us an enormous honour by coming to address it.
Explaining Europe to the public remains probably our greatest challenge, at both European and national level.
Therefore, Mr President, I particularly welcome and look forward to this discussion and to discussions with you in the days ahead.
You will be visiting a country that has benefited enormously from its membership of the European Union.
Some key facts stand out.
Since we joined Europe in 1973, our national wealth stood at just 60 per cent of the European average at that stage.
Even after accession, we were plagued by emigration, unemployment, high inflation and spiralling debt.
These dismal conditions have been completely reversed in recent years.
The role of the European Union was vital to all of that.
Europe provided invaluable assistance to us at a critical period in our national development.
The phrase 'the Future of Europe', like so many phrases, has become part of our jargon.
But let us recall for a moment the significance of what those words 'the Future of Europe' really mean, for ourselves and for the wider world.
For our own people in Europe, as we approach the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, it means consolidating and developing our extraordinary Union - a Union which has been so successful that many now take its success for granted.
In a world which knows so much uncertainty, oppression, deprivation and violence, the Union is a bedrock of prosperity, stability and deep-rooted democracy.
The very essence of the European Union - this powerful blend of pragmatism, of patience and vision - was captured by Robert Schuman when he observed that: 'Europe will not be made all at once, or according to one single plan: rather it will be formed by taking concrete measures which bring about real solidarity.'
Our Union is not, and must never become, an inward looking one.
From 1 January we will be a Union of 27 with the very welcome accession of Bulgaria and Romania.
We will remain open to further enlargement in line with our commitments, our responsibilities and our principles.
We also have growing responsibilities in relation to the wider international community.
It is indeed a paradox that, at a time when we appear to be unsure internally of the precise direction which the future development of our Union should take, our role externally has never been more important or more clear.
The wider world increasingly looks to Europe for leadership, for support and for the promotion of our values.
The founding fathers of Europe would be proud to see the Europe of today - what we are and what we bring to our world.
However, they would insist that our benchmark must be set not against where we have come from, but rather against what we must still achieve.
Today Europe faces as great an array of challenges as ever, including globalisation, technological change, migration, energy security and terrorism.
These challenges have not been dreamed up in Brussels or Strasbourg: they have risen up the Union's agenda because they are very real and directly relevant to all our citizens.
The challenge must not only be met but also addressed in a way which reassures our citizens and responds to their anxieties and aspirations.
The Union, in approaching these issues, is rightly pursuing two broad parallel tracks.
In respect of both tracks, the role of the European Parliament will be crucial.
On the one hand, we are continuing to reflect on the question of the constitutional treaty and we will return to it next June on the basis of a report by Chancellor Merkel.
On the other hand, we are seeking to address the concerns of our citizens in practical ways under the existing Treaties.
Both of these tracks are essential.
We cannot put practical progress on hold; neither can we wish away the need to provide the Union with a coherent, streamlined basis for addressing the challenges of a new century.
The constitutional treaty is designed to provide a much-needed basis for practical progress; and the practical progress we strive for will continue and contribute to a positive context for reaching agreement on the urgent institutional questions.
I would like to address these two twin issues in turn.
Nobody can predict with any certainty what the future holds for the constitutional treaty.
There is, of course, no easy answer.
I would, however, like to share with you briefly my own reflections and I look forward greatly to hearing your own perceptions in this afternoon's debate.
A good starting point for trying to evaluate what lies ahead is often to reflect briefly on why and how we got to be where we are today.
History is important because it can help us to make wise choices about the future.
Since the Irish Presidency had the privilege of bringing the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations to a conclusion, I have a particular awareness of the processes which made that agreement possible.
So let me start by recalling what seem to be three fundamental realities about the situation we have reached.
First, it is important to remember that the constitutional treaty was agreed because it was necessary.
The need for the substantive provisions has grown rather than diminished.
We need its more coherent external policy to meet our growing international responsibilities.
We need its subtle, balanced and effective provisions in the area of justice and home affairs to strengthen our fight against crime.
We need its more open, comprehensible, democratic and effective procedures, including its significantly enhanced role for the European Parliament.
We need its principles and its values.
Moreover, apart from the constitutional treaty's specific elements, we need it because the long term stability, prosperity and coherence of Europe are of fundamental importance for our people as well as for people beyond our borders.
Second, the process which led to the agreement of the constitutional treaty was long, complex and difficult.
The Convention was unprecedented in its openness and achievement.
The European Parliament was highly influential at the Convention, which also benefited greatly from the direct involvement of national parliaments.
The subsequent IGC involved intensive bilateral and collective negotiations in which the views of each Member State, as well as of the Commission and Parliament, were taken very carefully into account.
The process leading to agreement was a comprehensive and inclusive one.
I visited every capital, as the President kindly recalled, and everyone was listened to and helped to shape the outcome.
Third, participants were in the end able to accept the outcome of the negotiations because they saw it as a balanced overall package.
The institutional provisions in particular were closely interrelated and formed a single whole.
The difficulties of moving forward with the constitutional treaty are significant, but any analysis of what Europe needs, of how we got to where we are today and of the alternatives convince me that the right and realistic option is to return at the appropriate time to the substance and balance of the constitutional treaty.
I understand that this is also broadly the view of this Parliament.
In moving forward, we must ensure that the basis for progress must be an inclusive one in which the concerns and views of all are taken into account, including the legitimate concerns expressed by the citizens in many Member States.
Chancellor Merkel will be consulting closely with each Member State and with the institutions.
I have no doubt that her report to the June European Council will be soundly based and well judged.
However, let me at this stage offer four reflections.
First, we must continue to work to change the context in which we will return to consider the constitutional treaty.
This means continuing to address, as effectively as we can, the concerns of our citizens on issues from employment to mobile phone charges, from enlargement to the fight against crime.
That is what you, the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe, do so effectively week-in, week-out.
Second, the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome next March offers an important opportunity to highlight for our citizens the achievements and potential of the Union.
A succinct, consensual and eloquent declaration on that occasion, in the name of the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, could represent a very positive element in creating a new context for our wider institutional debate and perhaps also in addressing some of the specific concerns which have arisen in the national debates on the constitutional treaty.
Third, as was the case on previous occasions when European Treaties ran into difficulties at national level, additional elements could be introduced to address concerns that have arisen.
Such additions could enrich rather than undermine the substance and balance of the Treaty.
Fourth, the presentation, the length and, in some respects, the nature of the constitutional treaty could also be amended significantly without affecting its basic substance and balance.
To give some examples, it could be brought out more clearly that what is involved is a treaty and that, in many respects, it essentially amends rather than replaces the existing Treaties.
For the Irish Government's part, we remain resolutely and enthusiastically committed, as soon as the situation has been fully clarified, to holding a referendum on the substance of the constitutional treaty.
The treaty remains important for Europe, for our people and for those who look to our values.
As I said at the outset, it is essential that Europe also pursue the second track which we have set for ourselves, namely addressing, as best we can under the existing Treaties, the priorities of our citizens. I believe it is important to maintain broadly the distinctiveness of the two tracks.
We should be wary of the selective advance application of elements which form part of the balance in the constitutional treaty.
Let us not be unduly pessimistic about what we have achieved so far in terms of practical progress.
The European economy is gaining in strength.
More people are in work.
An enlargement of historic proportions, which not long ago seemed unimaginable, has taken root and has greatly enriched our Union.
But we are not here, at either European or national level, to congratulate ourselves.
The successful football club is not the one that focuses on the trophy room: it is the one that focuses on the matches ahead.
One only has to look at the agenda of any of your parliamentary sessions to appreciate the range and depth of the challenges we face.
Time requires me to address what seem to be the strategic underlying challenges.
Allow me to address briefly five of those challenges.
First, there is the competitiveness challenge. This has many important European dimensions: better regulation, a strong and appropriate competition policy, research and development, the removal of barriers in the internal market, and perhaps above all innovation, in relation to which the proposed European institute for technology can make an important contribution.
Our objective should be to make Europe attractive for investment.
I have repeatedly stressed to my colleagues in the European Council and to the Commission that Europe is increasingly in competition not within itself but with other parts of the world, notably Asia.
The reality of this competition must give urgency as well as direction to the development and implementation of policies at European level.
Our second strategic objective should be to ensure that achieving competitiveness does not threaten the European social model, and that competitiveness and social inclusion are partners, not rivals.
This is the key principle underpinning our own national system of social partnership.
Our experience of extensive and intensive social dialogue has delivered 18 consecutive years of economic growth, improved living standards and greater social inclusion.
In our approach at European level, including where appropriate through legislation, we should reflect the principle that economic and social policies can and should be mutually reinforcing.
We must, above all, ensure that solidarity and opportunity are at the heart of the Union and must drive Europe's future.
The test of Europe's credibility today is whether it can deliver policies which build up solidarity within the European Union and secure opportunities for all our people.
I also strongly believe that we need to give greater substance to the social dialogue at European level.
At both European and national level, we must engage the social partners, in particular the trade unions, in a real debate on the reform of the European social model and on the modernisation of labour markets.
Our third strategic challenge is to confront the downsides of globalisation, including cross-border crime, human trafficking, illegal migration, and the scourge of illicit drugs that ruin so many lives.
We know about the potential for pollution to trigger calamitous climate change.
Of course, the responsibility in many of these areas falls significantly on the Member States.
But as long as our climate and our criminals do not stop at the borders between our countries, we must work together to ensure all appropriate action at European level.
Fourth, Europe must play its full role across the range of its external competences.
I shall not dwell on this further because I have already highlighted in my introduction the increasingly important role which the Union plays and is expected to play in the international arena.
It is, of course, essential that Europe is adequately funded, including in the CFSP area, for addressing its growing responsibilities in the western Balkans, in our wider neighbourhood and further afield, especially towards the poorest who need our support and to whom Europe should continue to strive to be a special friend.
The fifth, and perhaps greatest strategic challenge is - I am sure you would agree - to connect Europe better with its citizens.
Of course, this challenge is not unrelated to the other challenges.
We can only communicate a positive message if we have a positive message to communicate.
But we have to demonstrate clearly that Europe is part of the solution to globalisation, not part of the problem.
We have to show that the European social model remains at the heart of increased competitiveness.
Our people must not only be secure but also feel secure.
We need to act, but we also need to explain what Europe is doing and can do to provide security for our citizens.
We have to bring home much more effectively to the public that, through our external policies, we are increasingly and effectively promoting their interests, their priorities and their values.
I fully accept that a large part of the responsibility of explaining Europe accurately and fairly falls at national level.
It is certainly a priority for my Government.
Respect for diversity can play a particularly important part in connecting the Union with its citizens.
I thank you, Mr President, for announcing that today is the first day that Irish will be used and that from 1 January 2007 it will become the 21st language of the European Union.
(GA) Nothing could illustrate better the respect which Europe has for the individual character of its Member States than the improved status which Irish will have from 1 January.
Ireland is very grateful to Parliament for your support in introducing the new provisions.
Allow me, in conclusion, to say that we should not lose sight of the fact that at the heart of our Europe, when it was founded half a century ago, was the determination to bring permanent peace 'among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts', as the first Treaty put it.
The Union has been resoundingly successful in that aim within our borders. The Union is also an increasingly important factor for stability beyond our borders.
I would like to pay particular tribute to the fact that the European Union has played a crucial role in relation to our peace process in Northern Ireland.
The Union has provided not just generous financial support, but also a context and an example.
I would like to convey to you today the deep-felt appreciation of the Irish people for Parliament's valued, consistent and continuing support for peace on the island of Ireland.
In the second half of the 21st century, another generation of Europeans will be living with the consequences of the decisions we take.
I hope that, when they cast an eye back to our generation of Europeans, they will be able to conclude that we had the imagination, courage and intelligence to consolidate our unique Union and to provide a solid, comprehensive and consensual basis for taking forward its achievements.
It is an honour to be here, Mr President, and I thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Taoiseach Ahern.
There will now be speeches on behalf of the groups.
Before giving them the floor, I would like to point out that two of them - Mr Schulz and Mr Watson - have today been re-elected Presidents of their political groups, and I would therefore like to congratulate them.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, It is wonderful, Mr President, how we complement one another.
I, too, was on the point of expressing congratulations, but I shall start with you first, and congratulate you on your election, by European Voice yesterday, as the 2006 MEP of the Year; well done!
I also want to congratulate Mr Schulz and Mr Watson on their re-elections; being a group chairman myself, I know, of course, just how much that means to them.
I have just heard that Mr Cohn-Bendit has also been re-elected, and I assume that Mrs Frassoni has been as well, so warm congratulations to them too.
(Applause)
It is always a pleasant experience for group chairmen to get their mandate renewed for another two and a half years; I cannot, at present, say what my fate is going to be, but I rejoice all the more in the re-election of my counterparts.
In what you have said, Prime Minister, we hear the good European voice of Ireland, and what you said, you said not only because Ireland has done so well from the European Union, but as a convinced European, and that has always been the good experience we have had with Ireland.
Whether it is your political family that is in power or our own - the last of your Prime Ministers from ours was John Bruton, who is now our ambassador in Washington - Ireland's profound commitment to European integration is manifest, and your speech today made that clear once more.
We rejoice and are glad that you are here today.
We now have to think about the future of Europe, and Prime Minister Ahern mentioned 25 March, which marks fifty years of the Treaties of Rome.
I see the Berlin statement - a joint statement by the European Council, the European Parliament and the Commission - as a good opportunity to tell the citizens of the European Union that we, the European institutions - even though our opinions may well differ on one thing or another - are united in our determination to lead the European Union into a bright future.
If we managed to achieve that in Berlin, we will have put down a significant political and psychological marker for the summit at the end of June, at which, firstly, a decision is to be taken on what is to be done next about the constitutional treaty, and, secondly, on what mandate we are to give the conference that is to consider that.
Speaking on behalf of our group, and in particular of the PPE element in it, I can say that we do of course insist on this House participating in any such conference - effectively, powerfully, and efficiently - and we ask, Prime Minister, for your support in this.
We hope that will go ahead at the end of June and that we will be able to decide, under Portuguese and Slovene Presidency, what is to become of the constitutional treaty.
I would like to make it quite clear, speaking on behalf of our group, and particularly of the European People's Party element in it, that we do not want to start again from the very beginning - it would be quite wrong to talk in terms of 'new negotiations' - but want as much as possible of the substance of the constitutional treaty to be retained, particularly as regards the reforms in Part 1 and the section dealing with values in the Charter.
One reason for that is that we are convinced that we need these values.
The European Union has no future unless it is founded upon values.
Another consideration is that we have to equip the European Union to face the challenges that are ahead, not only in its internal policies but also in its dealings with the outside world.
