In the Middle East, more than twenty years ago, there was the declaration from the Venice European Council, which called for an end to the Israeli occupation, which stressed that the settlements were illegal, which acknowledged the right to Palestinian self-rule and which insisted that the PLO must be involved in the negotiations.
That was more than twenty years ago!
Much more recently, in March 1999, the declaration of the Berlin Summit explicitly recognised the right of the Palestinians to a State.
But today, when the situation is worsening dramatically day by day, when the Oslo Accords are cast aside and forgotten, when the radical elements of the occupiers responds to the radical elements of a part of the occupied, how can we interpret the silence of the European Union Member States?
My group does not believe that this can go on, that the silence and the half-hearted measures can continue.
We need firm initiatives which can demonstrate to the world, and more importantly to the peoples of the region, a political, clear will, encouraging the supporters of peace to take action.
We need to kick-start this issue.
For the time being, I shall put forward a practical proposal.
The Thursday of our next sitting will be the eve of the 35th anniversary of the celebrated UN Security Council Resolution 242 which is one of the international community's major reference points in the conflict.
Well, I suggest we organise a formal occasion involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission in Strasbourg.
I suggest we also involve young supporters of peace, young Europeans, young Palestinians, young Israelis, those who gathered en masse last Saturday in Tel Aviv to commemorate the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
Each of our institutions will therefore be able to state clearly what, in its view, in accordance with international law and our common values, is unacceptable and, conversely, what type of plan for fair and lasting peace we want to draft.
Mr President, Mr Solana, I believe that we can establish a link, not only a philosophical link but also a political one between the problem in the Middle East, Iraq and Chechnya and the role of Europe.
I think that our role is to be clear-headed and to state the truth.
Mr Wurtz is right in saying that twenty years ago we condemned, twenty years ago we ?We say this to the Israelis.
That is right and it is true.
And to the Palestinians we must say: twenty years ago, we said you must acknowledge not only the State of Israel but also that there would be no mass return of Palestinians to that State of Israel.
Both these things are true.
If we want to give some hope to the Israeli population, we must eradicate the fear.
They fear the attacks, the fatal, suicide attacks, which above all mean that those who carry out these attacks do not recognise the State of Israel.
The Palestinians fear occupation by the Israeli army.
The two things are very closely related.
And then in Iraq, the truth is straightforward.
We say that Iraq must recognise the UN resolutions, in other words, all weapons, if they exist that is - and I know nothing about that, I had never been an inspector, nor have you, nor have any of us, no one here in fact - must be destroyed after they have been inspected.
The way in which Saddam Hussein conducts politics and has conducted politics in the past is a danger to other nations.
Therefore, we must also call for weapons inspectors and for non-governmental organisations to be allowed in to inspect the democratic situation and the relationship between the Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein.
The same applies to Russia and Chechnya.
It is quite incredible that Russian women and children were indeed taken hostage, and we condemn this. It is even more incredible that Mr Putin then took the hostages hostage, failing to say how they were, which gases were to be used, and failed to communicate the information at his disposal to the families.
It is equally incredible that the entire Chechen population can be taken hostage by a former KGB man who is acting as if the Bolsheviks and Communists were still in power, as a KGB agent, in other words.
Europe must condemn the attacks, Europe must take part in anti-terrorist actions and Europe must say no to all totalitarian impulses, even if a power such as Russia is involved.
The Duma voted in favour of restricting the right to information which is tantamount to restricting democracy.
If Europe remains silent in the face of Putin's actions, then Europe will not have had the insight or the strength to safeguard democracy.
Mr President, Mr Solana, I will be very brief for I believe we are going to have the opportunity to hold an in-depth debate on the issue of Russia and therefore on Chechnya too in Strasbourg.
It is clear that we are creating a new Afghanistan with the Taliban, but I would like to focus on a very specific point.
A few days ago, Mr Akhmed Zakayev, the deputy prime minister of the Chechen Government, was arrested in Copenhagen, where he is still being detained, and all attempts to make it possible for Ilias Akhmadov, the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs, to return to the European Union from the United States are being blocked.
Therefore, in addition to turning a blind eye to the events in Chechnya, we are preventing the few democratic interlocutors who are in a position to discuss and propose democratic solutions for the country from getting on with their job.
My question, Mr Solana, is the following: you took the initiative of drawing up black lists of those implicated in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. Could you not now take the initiative of drawing up a positive list of people whom we consider to be essential for dialogue, so that these people can obtain visas without hindrance and without injury to a small country which is then subjected, as is the case of Denmark and Belgium, to intolerable pressure from the Russian Federation?
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, as has already been said, the next couple of hours will see the Security Council coming to a decision on the Iraq resolution.
Let there be no doubt about the fact that Iraq must unconditionally comply with all the requirements made of it.
Such is the EU's position, and it is one with whose substance I agree wholeheartedly.
There is now justifiable concern about the way Iraq deploys weapons of mass destruction and makes them widely available.
Saddam Hussein has already, on several occasions, demonstrated his readiness to deploy such weapons of mass destruction against his own people.
The memories of all of us are still scarred by the Kurds of Halabja, who were killed by poison gas.
The brutal persecution of the Shiites in the south of the country is no secret either.
Weapons of mass destruction are in the hands of the most diverse regimes and countries, whether one thinks of India or Pakistan or, lastly, of North Korea, which has, indeed, admitted diverting fissile material for nuclear weapons, a breach of international undertakings that amounts to an offensive aimed at getting the pressure off Iraq!
In any case, weapons of mass destruction will only become an incalculable menace to the international community if the rulers with control of them are themselves unpredictable and menacing, as is without doubt true of Saddam Hussein.
That is why the Security Council resolution must spell out the necessity of the UN inspectors being able to perform their duties unhindered, of the monitoring teams' powers being extended and of there being no repeat of the cat and mouse game we have seen before.
If anyone is to make political visits to Iraq at this time, then it should be international weapons inspectors and nobody else - and I say this with reference to the visit to Iraq of the provincial governor of Carinthia, JÃ¶rg Haider, which is his third, and is superfluous and contrary to Austrian interests.
Iraq is far too hazardous a minefield and also deserves better than to be used to satisfy neurotic political egos.
Rather than solo acts, what is needed here is concerted action at EU level, which should be undertaken in partnership with the USA.
The risk should also be calculable.
We must avoid any escalation or any security vacuum affecting the whole of the Middle East.
Looking further ahead, there is a need to work at removing the causes of crises, whether they are in Chechnya or in the Middle East, and you have my full support in doing that.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists heartily supports Mr Solana and Mr Patten in their attempts to restrict the permanent state of war in the Middle East and to bring the parties concerned back to the negotiating table via the 'quartet approach'.
Mr Joshi Belin, one of the well-known brains behind the Oslo Conventions, assured me only the other day that, despite the fact that the conventions had been seriously undermined by the Sharon regime on the one hand and by Palestinian suicide bombers on the other, what the citizens of both sides need more than ever at this very moment are structural political proposals which offer the prospect of peace.
He emphasised once again that European action is essential to this process.
I would like to remind you that this Parliament once adopted a resolution which said that the trade clauses in the association treaty must be applied, if necessary, to ensure that settlement policy is brought to an end, which will otherwise continue to form a structural barrier to peace.
As far as Iraq is concerned, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to emphasise once again that neither the US, nor China, nor any other country has, therefore, the unilateral right to begin a large-scale war, wherever in the world.
Our approach is by way of the Security Council, a route which, fortunately, we have managed to make binding on a multilateral basis.
However, that also means that we may not have any pronouncements that might lead automatically to war.
I am really pleased with Mrs Morillon's statement, which has emphasised that once more on behalf of the PPE-DE.
What we need is not war as a reflex response but to bring massive pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein via weapons inspections.
The weapons inspections must be effective and, if anything is going on, action can be taken.
What we do not need, however, is to go down the road leading to unilateral war.
Our first task is to strengthen the coalition against terrorism.
This coalition must be our top priority, both from the US side and the European side.
Our joint effort must be tied up with this.
In my opinion, the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process is still too limited.
The United States calls the tune and we are merely supporting players.
Given our position, this is wrong.
We are, after all, Israel's largest trading partner.
Our contribution of EUR 14 billion also makes us the biggest provider of humanitarian aid. The European Union also makes by far the biggest contribution towards technical and financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority, estimated at EUR 10 million per month.
It is therefore high time that Europe stopped being just a payer and became a genuine player in the peace process.
We have a duty to Israel and Palestine to do so, but also to ourselves for reasons of a historic, cultural, geographic, economic and political nature.
From our European tradition, we must stress that violence is not a solution and that peace must not come directly from the top but rather must start at grass roots level.
Terrorists follow no political agenda.
We must therefore ensure that every example of senseless violence is condemned by public opinion, so that terrorist acts will no longer thwart peace negotiations.
Europe can and must play an executive role in this.
We must persevere with the democratisation and economic development of the region.
We must add a more political dimension to our extensive humanitarian aid by making the Palestinians and Israelis realise that they cannot be at enmity with each other for evermore.
A greater and more regular political presence in the region is therefore required more than ever.
Mr President, the situation in the Middle East remains a key concern and we must do everything, absolutely everything within our power to prevent the worst, namely war, from taking place.
The determination of the US President, spurred on by the Republican Party's results in the various US elections that were held recently, is as strong as ever.
He has not relinquished his concept of 'preventative war', a euphemism used to legitimise war anywhere and at any time on the pretext of combating terrorism.
Disregarding the debate which is currently going on in the Security Council, the preparations therefore continue with regard to Iraq.
The possibility of the United States' using its formidable military superiority to secure its economic interests in the region may take precedence over all other considerations.
This war will have terrible consequences if it goes ahead, but we must reiterate that the war against the Iraqi people never came to an end; they are a people held hostage by an embargo which kills, first and foremost, children and the weak but safeguards Saddam Hussein and his family.
The warlike approach that the US President is pursuing fuels the warlike approach being pursued by Ariel Sharon against the advice of the Palestinian people, but also against the security of his own people.
Palestinian society and the foundations of a State are destroyed; everyday life is becoming increasingly impossible.
A war will only serve to intensify the suffering of the region's people, will only further delay a political solution for a just and lasting peace.
The consequences of this war are as yet incalculable, but we know that the arrogant and aggressive attitude of American imperialism might well engender acts of terrorism, as a mirrored response, a barbaric riposte to excessive barbarism.
We have nothing to gain from this barbaric action.
In this situation, the peoples of Europe and of the United States must count on themselves, because, in spite of their declarations, if Bush pushes ahead with his deadly plan, our governments will provide aid and support as they have always done, because they do not dare do otherwise.
We must count on ourselves therefore, as in the United States and the United Kingdom, where hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating against this war which they do not want to be waged in their name.
The first European social summit begins tomorrow in Florence.
Thousands of people will take part in discussions to come up with a different world order.
This requires a radically new approach, that of responding to needs rather than to profits, because it is the only way to achieve real justice, the only guarantee of peace.
Mr President, the world must avoid war.
How can Europe contribute to this in the Middle East?
Not so much with words as with deeds.
We must take as our starting point the people's right of self-determination, something to which the Palestinian people are as much entitled as are the Israelis and the Chechens.
We must not forget that suicide bombers will never be stamped out by military force or military occupation.
People and nations who have nothing to lose but their lives will be ready to sacrifice those lives for a future with dignity, a life lived in freedom.
Let us also not forget this issue in international relations.
Saddam Hussein's dictatorship is a disaster for the inhabitants of Iraq, especially for those who oppose it, particularly the Kurds and the Shiites.
Let us hope he will be condemned at some point, but we must give him no excuse for war because of the oil issue, and Europe must make that very clear to the United States.
We welcome the UN resolutions, as long as they do not automatically lead to war.
Mr Solana, you told us that Iraq should declare its weapons of mass destruction.
There is a theory that you have not mentioned, however, and that is if Iraq no longer has any weapons of mass destruction, what happens then?
Well, I shall tell you: we will continue to say that Iraq is concealing weapons of mass destruction.
And in the Security Council resolution that you have outlined to us, something is blatantly missing, and that is what happens to the sanctions if, by chance, Iraq once again agrees, as it did for many years, to allow UN observers in?
The condition to lift sanctions - which is causing starvation amongst the Iraqi people - was not respected by the US and British Governments, and that is the reason, the only reason, why Iraq had enough of the observers, who, as a number of them acknowledged, behaved like spies.
In actual fact, Mr President, the war has started.
The air attacks are unrelenting.
On 10 October, Bassora airport was bombed three times.
A massive raid was mounted against military interventions.
The war has already begun.
Negotiations with Iraq's National Oil Council are the work of the US Government and we are, apparently, the only ones not to be aware of this.
Mr President, although the lack of political will to date by the Sharon government, which has recently resigned, and its use of the security argument as a pretext have prevented the reopening of the peace process, this process could now peter out entirely.
As Ha'aretz states in its editorial this morning, the government that has just resigned has been a terrible one.
Its policy of using force in the occupied territories has not ended terrorism and has inflicted the greatest human bloodshed on Israel since the war in Lebanon.
Its relations with Egypt and Jordan and even with Europe itself have never been worse, as we know.
There has not been so much fear and so little hope in Israel for a long time.
The economic situation, as we also know, is terrible.
Unemployment is increasing.
This is, of course, largely although not entirely due, in my opinion, to the war with the Palestinians, which is incompatible with prosperity.
The advocates of peace have to go to enormous lengths to convince the majority of their fellow citizens that any improvement in their economic and social situation depends precisely on re-establishing political negotiations with the Palestinians; that a new national agreement must be reached in order to reach a good agreement with them.
The Palestinians, for their part, must understand that an absence of terrorism in Israel will help these advocates of peace.
I believe that the Palestinians are moving in that direction.
It was announced on Israeli radio yesterday that Al Fatah and Hamas will meet next week in Cairo to negotiate an end to suicide attacks in Israel by Hamas.
I wonder if Israel will frustrate these efforts, as it has done on previous occasions, with a new deadly assault on Gaza or the West Bank.
The European Union must actively support these advocates of peace.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, we have all been horrified by the pictures of the hostage-taking in Moscow, and we have to unequivocally hold fast to the fact that nothing justifies the taking of hostages.
Nor is there any dispute as to the right of any state to refuse to be blackmailed by such terrorist acts and to take appropriate counter-measures.
These, though, must be aimed only at the terrorists and must not make an entire people culpable.
There is room for criticism of the Russian leadership's lack of candour in handling public relations after the hostages were released, with particular reference to the delay in getting medical aid for the freed hostages and the way their families were prevented from visiting them in hospital. There is also the question of why, unlike the hostages, the special forces that were sent in suffered no adverse health effects through the gas, even though they were operating without gas masks.
If eyewitness reports are accurate in stating that the hostages' captors were shot while still unconscious, then that represents a flagrant breach of every system of law and must therefore be condemned.
Violence can never be the solution to a problem; only peaceful means will do.
That is why the Russian Government must be told that, if they, in effect, label an entire people, and its elected representatives, as terrorists, then by so doing they are depriving themselves of the last partner with whom they can even attempt to resolve this problem in a peaceful way.
I believe it to be the European Union's task to support Russia and help it to get a process of negotiation going without delay.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I do not believe these reassuring words on the situation in Palestine because, on the one hand, the new appointments in the Palestinian Government do not appear to increase the influence of those working sincerely for peace and, on the other, there is a risk that it is imperative that Europe avoids.
I hear talk of very large sums of money that the European Union is about to appropriate in further aid.
There needs to be the greatest possible transparency in the distribution of this aid and its management, for the experience of previous situations teaches us that such aid is very often appropriated for specific objectives - and if they are humanitarian objectives I endorse them, we all endorse them - but then it goes off track.
The situation of these countries, particularly the ongoing situation in Palestine - a political and social situation in which there are opposing groups and feuds - is such as to suggest that such aid might be used for the activities of groups such as Hamas, for example, with the result that funds donated as humanitarian aid end up being aid to terrorism.
As regards Europe's policy on Iraq, however, I feel that we must not confine ourselves to purely diplomatic measures but, mindful of the commitments made after September 11, exploit all the possibilities offered by intelligence in order to get to the heart of the matter and tackle the roots of terrorism, which are in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States.
That is where we need to attack the ideological roots of Wahhabi fundamentalism.
Mr President, Mr Solana, ladies and gentlemen, I shall spare you further analysis, since it seems that the main points have already been expressed.
Be that as it may, the situation in the Middle East and in the Near East requires us to be more vigilant than ever.
Despite the fact that, in a few months' time, the people will be able to have a say in their future by taking part in two elections, I feel that we must turn our attention to this part of the world immediately.
With regard to the Palestinian elections, we must support the desire of the Palestinian people to have political leaders who are representative and who have greater democratic legitimacy - which we must now acknowledge - and we must do everything in our power to ensure that these elections are able to take place as they should.
In this respect, my question is what technical and practical assistance is the European Union planning to provide?
I would like to know what will be done in specific terms and within what timeframe?
As for the elections in Israel, I perceive them to be more of a cause for concern than a source of hope.
These elections are, admittedly, an opportunity for civil society in Israel to demonstrate its desire for peace in a region, no part of which has escaped this horror.
However, this delay might also be exploited by those who fuel this conflict and do not want to see the two peoples living side by side in peace.
Will the European Union, which is able to provide support in economic and humanitarian terms, at last take the decision to strengthen its presence on the ground, to stop being excessively cautious in the diplomatic arena and contribute to dialogue and to negotiations?
Only concerted, lawful, international action will finally break the vicious circle of violence.
Mr President, I shall try to be brief in order to comply with the time requirements that the Presidency has generously set for all speakers.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have been discussing three issues.
I should like to emphasise once again that, where the Middle East is concerned, when we meet in Parliament, we should try not always to start from the beginning and instead work on the assumption that all of us gathered here basically believe that an entire people is suffering, that an entire people has had a very hard time for many years, that this problem must be resolved and that we must attempt to provide solutions.
I believe that we are all agreed on the first principles, the general principles.
What is it that we want?
We want there to be, as soon as possible, two States that can live together, democratically, side by side with one another, in peace and prosperity.
And this is the task to which we in the European Union must contribute.
I can tell you that we have reason to be optimistic. Or pessimistic.
It is up to each individual to decide on what view to take. Personally, I should like at this point in time to be realistic and to try to work towards achieving specific and tangible results at this difficult juncture and I believe that this is what the European Union is doing.
We do not need to make grand declarations.
We have already done that.
We now need to attempt to resolve the problems that exist.
We have pointed out, for example, that in Palestine an open and rich debate is taking place, which could bring an end to terrorism.
Which could bring it to an end in intellectual terms and forever, if that is possible.
The European Union is also making a very significant and effective contribution to this debate, and this has been acknowledged by everyone, amongst the Palestinians and amongst the most intelligent strata of Israeli society, who also understand the importance of this role.
Let us therefore try to come up with not only declarations of principles, but concrete actions that will lead to a positive outcome.
Our Palestinian friends must undertake reforms, which they have not yet done to any sufficient degree and on this matter I must agree with my friend, Mr Morillon.
Their efforts must continue.
I would have liked to see a prime minister in the Palestinian Authority, but this has not been possible, perhaps because the actions of Mr Arafat, who has been holed up in the Mukata for all this time, and who has lost the energy that he had established to ensure that change could be initiated for a more open government, which would also have had a prime minister.
Where the Palestinians are concerned, then, we must ask them to continue to combat terrorism and also to continue to undertake reforms.
And where Israel is concerned, the most important thing that we can ask for at the moment is for it to lift its block of the territories and for people to be able to move around freely; for a journey between one town and another, which previously took half an hour, not to take Mr Solana eight hours.
This is what is happening at the moment - the territories are effectively closed off.
No economy, however much aid we give it, can survive unless its citizens enjoy freedom of movement.
This is, therefore, an absolutely crucial element.
Secondly, payments must be made.
The Israelis must hand over the taxes that they collect so that the Palestinian Authority has a budget with which to see its actions through.
Let us therefore use the time remaining until the end of year, until elections are held, to try to establish conditions for a debate on peace and for peace, which there can be during the electoral campaign, and let us do everything within our power to ensure that the Quartet, of which we are an integral and fundamental part, continues to work ceaselessly in the forthcoming months, which will be so crucial.
I would like to say a couple of things about Iraq: the European Union has attempted to achieve many of the things that the majority of Europe's citizens had in mind.
What did we want to see?
We wanted to see the weapons inspectors return to Iraq. We wanted this to be achieved under the auspices of the United Nations, and we also wanted there to be no automatic initiation of military action.
Three things.
These three things have been achieved.
This entire debate has taken place to ensure that the observers can return.
And they will be returning.
This has been achieved under the auspices of the United Nations and is being discussed this very afternoon. It has also been achieved without the Security Council Resolution automatically allowing recourse to war, because it is a Resolution in two phases.
We have therefore managed, in one way or another, and with the efforts of many countries, including many countries that are not Members of the European Union, to make progress along these lines.
We also acknowledge, however, that there is a risk posed by weapons of mass destruction, and that this is not the problem of just one country.
This is not a problem for the United States alone, but for every country in the world.
We too have to fight against weapons of mass destruction.
It is in our interest and is our obligation as civilised countries.
I have not spoken longer on the third issue - Chechnya - for two reasons: first, because the Presidency of the Council and the President of the Commission have already spoken on this matter at some length and I fully agree with everything that has been said.
On Monday, as you all know, a summit will take place here, in Brussels, at which all of these issues will doubtless be addressed with President Putin.
Therefore, Mr President, and I do not think that I am exceeding the time allotted to me, I should like once again to state my willingness to discuss these issues further, but to do so in order to attempt to find solutions to the extremely difficult problems that we face, to ensure that we are not always starting from first principles, with which we are already familiar and on which we are all agreed.
Thank you very much, Mr Solana.
As Mr Solana has reminded us, we are running late because it is impossible to limit Members' speaking time to the minute or minute and a half scheduled on the agenda, but I would ask everyone to make every effort to stick to the times because otherwise, we will end up having no time for our debate.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate
on the oral question (O-0071/02 - B5-0493/02) by Mr Daul, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy; and
on the Council Statement on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
Mr Daul has the floor.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am pleased to present to you today the motion for a resolution on a mid-term review adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 21 October.
Without wishing to give a complete history of the various stages of the common agricultural policy and subsequent reviews carried out by the European Union, allow me nevertheless to remind you that the European Council, at the Berlin Summit, set out the applicable guidelines for the period 1999-2006.
It also introduced amendments with regard to certain common organisations of the market, in particular the cereal, beef and milk COMs.
I would remind you that the European Council asked the Commission to present a report in 2002 on changes in agricultural spending, accompanied, where necessary, by the appropriate proposals.
It is within this context that the European Commission sent a proposal for a reform of the common agricultural policy to Parliament and the Council, which was presented by Commissioner Fischler on 10 July this year.
Discussions within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore took place within this context, resulting in the drafting of the resolution I have the honour of presenting to you today.
The debate was extremely comprehensive.
As we can see from the 388 amendments tabled by the members of the committee, the compromise we were able to achieve required a great deal of effort from all concerned, whatever their political leanings or the national interests they represent.
The vote, which was won by a substantial majority, shows, if this were necessary, its members' concern to go beyond political and national divisions in order to present comments capable of influencing the debates.
The objective of this resolution is threefold.
First and foremost, its aim is to reiterate the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy, in particular financial solidarity, the need for a fair income for producers and the maintenance of border protection in order to prevent distortions of competition.
Its second aim is to define the broad guidelines for its implementation by paying more attention to the concerns expressed by European citizens with regard to the environment, health protection, food quality, rural development and animal welfare, while responding to farmers' demands concerning remuneration for their work and the simplification of the agricultural policy's administration, to encourage young farmers to work in the sector.
Its third and final aim is to frame the CAP review in a long-term perspective in order to make market management mechanisms more comprehensible for farmers, and more generally for the agri-food sector, and enable them to make long-term investments.
That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feels that, without calling into question the powers of the other committees concerned, any adaptation of the CAP must take place within a long-term budgetary perspective which must, in any case, go beyond 2006, the year in which new guidelines will have to be negotiated.
The Council now also shares this concern.
The fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Council take the same view shows how important it is to maintain a strong common agricultural policy which is seen by all our citizens to be implemented equitably, and which we now need to endorse.
With regard to the resolution proposed, I shall first consider market management aid.
The European Commission's approach, designed to decouple direct aid to producers, simplifies the management of this aid, but will also lead to the eventual dismantling of any market management measures.
That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development suggests partial decoupling.
Furthermore, this step should not cause production prices to fall.
Lastly, the suggested proposals to lower intervention prices do not appear necessary in the current context.
Establishing partial decoupling in the work of the committee would allow producers to receive a fixed sum of basic aid per farm or per hectare, calculated on past figures but restricted to a maximum figure of EUR 10 000.
The second element of the resolution is the reinforcement of the second pillar, in order to support certain policies relating to rural development.
The resolution emphasises flexibility, which is crucial to implementing rural development policies, and which allows account to be taken of the concerns expressed at regional level.
The third guideline concerns the need for strict compliance by producers who receive Community aid, under both the first and the second pillar, with the principles laid down by European directives in the field of environmental protection and animal welfare.
Lastly, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wanted, by means of its resolution, to strengthen the position of the European Union in future negotiations, by taking account of the dynamics of enlargement, by emphasising in particular the need for coherence between proposals for a mid-term review and agricultural supply to the candidate countries, in order to allow for better integration of these countries, while highlighting the margins for manoeuvre provided by WTO negotiations.
The Commissioner reminded us of all this within the Committee on Agriculture at our meeting of 5 October and the European Commission should soon submit legislative measures which will have to comply with all of these restrictions.
Our role is to study them and listen to the Commission when it proposes them, and we shall assume our responsibilities in Parliament.
That is why I would ask the House to adopt the resolution tomorrow.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have the opportunity today to present to you my assessment of the decisions on agricultural policy taken at the Brussels Summit.
As long ago as July, the Commission, by opening the mid-term review, prompted a wide-ranging debate on the future of the agricultural policy.
Now, in addition, the European Council has answered a number of budget questions relating to the common agricultural policy.
The summit decisions are, in the first place, significant in that the way ahead is opened up for the Member States to conclude the enlargement negotiations, and in that the fifteen Heads of State and Government have accepted the Commission proposal for the phasing-in of direct payments in the agricultural sector for the new Member States.
If the candidate countries demonstrate the same realism, then it should be possible to conclude the enlargement negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit, but the Brussels decisions will also have substantial effects on the agricultural policy of the future.
The primary consideration here of course is that we should have, for the period from 2007 to 2013, a Budget framework predetermined by the EU Fifteen for the costs of market regulation and the direct payments.
This framework consists of the EU Fifteen's planned expenditure for 2006 on the one hand, and the ten new members' financial proposals for 2006 in nominal values on the other.
These will be increased only by 1% each year.
Initially, this will mean that, in 2007 and 2008, two thirds of the implementation of the Agenda 2000 reforms in the milk sector will have to be funded below the new upper limit, as must 70% of the phasing-in of the direct payments and all the reforms that the Council has already heralded, by which I mean such things as sugar or olive oil, tobacco, wine or cotton.
This, then, at last means that the old agricultural guideline - which had already ceased to have any effect - is no longer in existence.
What now matters is that this new financial framework should serve as a basis for giving the common agricultural policy for the next ten years a clear perspective for planning and development.
What does that mean for the mid-term review in the first instance?
The Presidency's Final Conclusions establish that the Brussels decisions should no more prejudice the mid-term review decided on at Berlin than the international commitments we made at Doha and elsewhere, any more than any other future decisions on the common agricultural policy.
These committed us to continue to take account of the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin and Gothenburg.
It is, in this context, noteworthy that the Brussels Summit set no limit to the funds for rural development.
Quite on the contrary, it reminded us of the importance of the less favoured regions and of the multifunctionality of agriculture, in effect, then, of the development of the second pillar, for which Parliament has called on many occasions already.
I am therefore working on the assumption that Parliament will be firm in stating its intentions when setting down the new Financial Perspective for the post-2006 period, on which, in contrast to the common agricultural policy, it has full power of codecision.
The fact that the Final Conclusions expressly refer to the European Union's undertakings resulting from the start of the Doha Development Round is taken by some to mean that the proposal to decouple the direct payments is dead and buried.
I warn against adopting any such interpretation, as, if the international negotiations produce any commitment to make blue-box reductions - something that the European Union, like all the WTO members represented at Doha, has declared itself prepared, in principle, to do and to which the Council re-committed itself at the sustainability summit in Johannesburg - then that would mean at least partial abandonment of direct payments, as the option of decoupling would then no longer be available.
This issue will be discussed in March at the latest, when arrangements for the agricultural sector are put on the WTO table.
What will be the effects of the mid-term review on the agricultural sector?
This question is often asked, and, in its communication entitled 'Auf dem Weg zu nachhaltiger Landwirtschaft - Eine ZwischenÃŒbersicht ÃŒber die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik' ('Towards sustainable agriculture - a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy'), the Commission has subjected it to an initial qualitative evaluation founded on internal analyses, which concentrate on the ways in which farmers, consumers, taxpayers, the public, the food industry and governmental authorities will benefit, and on the contribution the proposals would make to the enlargement process and to the EU's position on the international stage.
This analysis was also supplemented in the communication on the mid-term review by medium-term prognoses for agricultural markets and reports on the rice, nut and milk sectors, which were published by the Agriculture Directorate-General in June.
An internal investigation into EU enlargement's effects on agricultural markets and incomes in the candidate countries was published in March.
Work is currently in progress, under the aegis of the Agriculture Directorate-General, on comprehensive analyses of the potential effects of the actual policy proposals, the results of which will be presented at the end of the year along with the draft legislation.
In this, we will of course be taking full account of the Brussels decisions.
Let me add something on the subject of Parliament's draft resolution.
I share your view that our policy objectives require us to satisfy ourselves that our policy instruments are balanced and uniform.
I welcome your offer of cooperation with the aim of guaranteeing that, in an enlarged Europe, the European agricultural model will be not only further developed and enhanced, but also safeguarded.
You and I are at one in the belief that matters other than trade have to be better integrated into multilateral agreements, but, as negotiators for the European Union, we can achieve this only if we have enough bargaining counters to negotiate with.
We acknowledge, secondly, that greater quality, certifications, audits and so on will entail additional costs for our farmers, particularly the smaller ones.
These considerations make our proposals for decoupling and strengthening the second pillar crucially important in terms of the maintenance of the European agricultural model.
I am also very receptive to Parliament's proposals for giving women a greater role in agriculture.
I see clearly defined conditions for farm management, in the form of cross-compliance, as an essential factor in getting the common agricultural policy back in line with what the public wants, and I also absolutely share Parliament's desire to provide for straightforward and efficient procedures for these audits.
Simplification in general will remain a key objective, but quality must be capable of being demonstrated and attested if it is to remain credible.
As I said earlier, I expect Parliament to be emphatic in specifying how it wants the second pillar to be equipped.
Conversely, I support Parliament's concern that it should be accorded rights of codecision in agricultural policy as well, which would significantly enhance the common agricultural policy's standing in the public eye.
We must now seize the opportunity to build up a sustainable agricultural policy, to bring it into line with society's expectations, and to give farmers a long-term political perspective.
I am counting on your support in this!
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to give an account to the European Parliament of the Council's work on the mid-term review.
As agreed in Agenda 2000, on 10 July this year the Commission submitted the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
One of the main priorities for the Danish Presidency has been to ensure as much progress as possible in the discussions concerning the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy.
Commissioner Fischler presented his discussion paper on the future development of the common agricultural policy at a Council meeting on 15 July.
On this occasion, there was an open debate in the Council, in which the Member States had opportunity to make known their immediate opinions on the Commission's thoughts.
The Danish Presidency has had discussion of the mid-term review on the agenda of all the Council sessions in July, September and October, and the Council has thus had a thorough debate on the main topics in the Commission's discussion paper.
The paper has also been discussed within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in a number of relevant working groups.
The conclusions of the Brussels Summit emphasised, as the Commissioner mentioned in his contribution, that this was without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the funding of the EU after 2006, nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the conclusions of the Berlin agenda, that is, Agenda 2000, nor to the international commitments entered into by the EU, inter alia in the launching of the Doha Development Round.
In other words, the mid-term review continues directly as part of Agenda 2000.
I would like to emphasise that, like the European Parliament and other institutions, we knew from the start that our discussions on the discussion paper were to form a basis for the Commission's submission of legal proposals at a later point in time.
The Presidency has therefore organised general discussions at which ministers were given opportunity to express their various attitudes to all aspects of the Commission's communication.
Before I start my review I would like to thank the European Parliament for its discussion of the matter.
We look forward to Parliament's final decision tomorrow, and it is obvious that the decision will be extremely important and an important contribution to the debate.
There is no reason to hide the fact that the ministers' reactions to the mid-term review have been divergent from the start, with regard to both the timing and the framework, and of course also as regards the content.
In general, however, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries I have been able to establish that there is broad agreement on the fact that rural policy should be strengthened and that greater emphasis should be placed on food safety, on protection of the environment and on animal welfare.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now contribute some comments on the main elements of the Commission's communication in the light of the discussions that we have had in the Council.
The mid-term review contains two entirely fundamental horizontal aspects, namely the decoupling of direct subsidies and dynamic modulation.
The Commission's ideas in this area have been more wide-ranging than has been seen previously.
The Council held its first overall discussion of these aspects in July and has yet to hold more technical discussions regarding the individual elements.
As far as decoupling is concerned, I can say that the delegations have expressed a great need for further information from the Commission in the form of impact assessments of the financial, social and regional effects of the proposal before a final position can be taken.
On the other hand, some delegations support the fundamental principle of decoupling.
They believe that it will allow farmers to focus on products that give them the best return on sales without having to keep an eye on the size of the subsidies given to the various products.
At the same time, it is regarded as being an effective signal to send, both to consumers and to tax-payers.
Finally, the countries also point out the negotiating advantages in a WTO context of the transition to a decoupled system.
It could also be an important step towards obtaining understanding of the EU's other negotiating aims.
As far as dynamic modulation is concerned, a number of ministers have welcomed the proposal in principle.
They consider it to be a good way of securing the necessary funding to strengthen the priority objectives of food safety, quality, the environment and animal welfare and other important areas.
Other ministers have criticised dynamic modulation on the grounds that in reality it means a progressive reduction in subsidies in real terms and because the model - apart from franchising and capping - does not take sufficient account of existing regional differences.
Similarly, opinion varies between the delegations regarding the reduction of the first pillar subsidies and regarding how the modulated resources should then be distributed and the criteria according to which this should take place.
I would like to comment on the more specific market sectors.
We had a full debate on the main crops at the Council session in September and, although the Commission's overall direction was able to be supported to a certain extent, there were very clear specific proposals which met with substantial opposition.
Various groups of delegations thus expressed strong arguments against a reduction in the intervention price for grain, removal of the monthly grain supplement, abolition of the intervention scheme as far as rye is concerned, the proposed changes to the arrangements for durum wheat and the proposed environmentally-friendly agricultural set-aside, as well as the Commission's proposed adjustment of subsidies for energy crops.
The Commission's communication was also accompanied by detailed reports on rice, nuts and milk.
The Council again had a full debate on these areas at its October meeting.
With regard to rice and nuts, opinions were clearly divided along the obvious lines of whether or not one was a producer of the products discussed.
As far as rice is concerned, however, there was initially broad agreement on the need for change in the sector - the adoption of the 'Everything But Arms' initiative makes this inevitable.
However, a number of ministers from producer countries expressed dissatisfaction with the specific measures proposed by the Commission, while the non-producer countries regarded the Commission's proposal as a step in the right direction.
With regard to milk, the Commission presented four options for the dairy sector for the period 2008-2015.
The options were discussed with the result that it is unlikely that any of them - apart from option 3, i.e. that concerning a and c quotas - can be considered due to the uncertainty regarding compatibility with the WTO rules.
In view of this it was deemed appropriate to consider the situation further.
Where nuts are concerned, the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's initiative to strengthen rural policy is welcomed by the Member States.
As I have mentioned previously, however, there is no agreement on the choice of tools for achieving this objective and the debate in the Council revealed divergent attitudes on matters such as the choice of instruments and distribution of the resources.
Nonetheless, the debate was extremely positive in the sense that there is broad agreement that something must be done in this area, including the fact that there is a great need for simplification of the arrangements, and the delegations have a number of ideas for improvements and for new measures in the slightly longer term.
With regard to the farm audit, many delegations have generally expressed great interest in the Commission's ideas, again in principle.
The majority of the delegations however feel that in the first instance it should be a voluntary system that is attractive to farmers, so that we can get as many as possible to use the scheme.
We in the Council have thoroughly examined the Commission's communication on the mid-term review.
The delegations have been given opportunity to ask questions, make comments, contribute new ideas, support or criticise all aspects of the Commission's communication and the reports accompanying the communication.
In the light of this the Commission now has a solid basis for considering the Member States' wishes as regards future development of the common agricultural policy and also for drawing the necessary conclusions.
Thank you very much, President-in-Office of the Council.
I am sure you are all aware, ladies and gentlemen, that it is very nearly 8 p.m.
We must organise the debate differently if we also want to hear the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council.
This is what I propose. Let us give the floor to the spokespeople of the various political groups, who shall stick to the time allocated to them; this will take twenty minutes.
Let the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council then reply and we will then suspend the sitting and resume at 9 p.m.
We will all have to make an effort because the President-in-Office and the Commissioner will not be able to remain until all interventions have been made.
Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, in view of all the decisions being made during this key phase of the enlargement process, I would like to support you in your call for us to continue with the reform of the common agricultural policy.
However, and this is an important distinction, we are now talking about reforming the common agricultural policy as from 2007, which means that we will continue with the present policy up to 2006 and that Europe's agricultural sector will move forward on the basis of a reformed policy as from 2007.
Commissioner Fischler, I think you need to assume that neither the timing nor the content of your proposals will be viable if we have correctly interpreted the compromise on direct agricultural payments negotiated in Brussels by the Heads of State and Government.
In other words, it is now clear that the agreements reached at the Berlin Summit will remain in force until 2006, and that the most recent decisions provide a firm basis for planning by the EU's farmers up to 2013.
This means that the candidate countries can certainly rely on increases in direct payments as from 2004.
That, incidentally, formed part of the proposals presented by the Commission back in December 2001 on the financing of direct agricultural payments for the enlargement countries.
The only difference, and this was already clear to us back then, is that the 100% compensation payments for all EU Member States in 2013 will no longer be matched by 100% financing capacity as in 2006.
I think it must be clear to everyone that this will be lower by then.
Every farmer in the enlarged European Union must be aware of that.
In order to prevent mistakes, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are, in a motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups in the European Parliament, requesting, for this reason among others, that unlimited budget rights and full codecision should be transferred to this House for agricultural matters.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, like many of the Members here, I am delighted to note that the Brussels European Council was able to show that agricultural issues would not be a barrier to the entry of the ten countries to the European Union in 2004.
Similarly, I also think it would be useful to know what the budget level of the first pillar of the CAP will be until 2013.
Having said that, although the summit set the level of budgetary commitments, it did not adopt a position on how this would be achieved, in other words on the CAP's provision for the second part of Agenda 2000 and after 2006.
This major question therefore remains to be answered, since nobody can dispute the fact that food safety, sustainable development and land-use planning are still undeniably fundamental issues that need to be resolved without delay.
They alone justify a review, or at least significant changes to the current CAP as of 2004.
That is the purpose of the only amendment that we as the PSE Group are tabling with regard to the resolution tabled by Mr Daul on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on which Parliament will vote tomorrow.
On the one hand, therefore, we have society's expectations, to which the CAP must provide swift, positive responses; on the other, there is our strategic position in the WTO negotiations, which will be more successful if it is based on effectively strengthening the multifunctionality of European agriculture within the context of rural development, as well as partially decoupling public aid to production.
It would be better to adopt an offensive stance in negotiations so that we can rally the developing countries, in particular in questioning the US Farm Bill, rather than running the risk of being a target for all the special interest groups present within the WTO.
Beyond that, Commissioner, I would draw your attention to the need for qualified external protection and internal market regulation, to ensure that the efforts made by farmers to protect the environment, their work and product quality are appropriately compensated.
Mr Cunha has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I wish to table a point of order to ensure that note is taken of my indignation at the undemocratic method that the Presidency has pursued in this debate.
We have been waiting here since 5 p.m. to start this debate, but the time management of the various presidencies has been thoroughly incompetent.
And now you announce, Mr President, that the coordinators are to have the floor, followed by Commissioner Fischler and then the debate will be suspended, which means that the other Members who are scheduled to speak will have to do so after dinner.
This, Mr President, is highly undemocratic and unworthy of this House.
I wish my views to be recorded.
Of course.
Something that I shall also happily have included in the Minutes ?
is my surprise that the honourable Member should approach the Bureau and attempt to enter into a dialogue without using his microphone.
I must add, with the utmost transparency, that the way in which we have done things is extremely democratic in that you are able to hear both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council because, otherwise, you would not have the opportunity to hear them and we would be staying here beyond 8 p.m.
I shall add a personal note, which is that I shall have to miss the meeting of Parliament's Bureau in order to preside here from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., in other words, beyond the allotted time. Nothing has been fixed here.
All that has happened is that we have worked out the time when the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council should speak so that you, ladies and gentlemen, can hold a proper debate.
Now that I have said that, let us continue with our debate.
I needed, however, to clarify what is really happening.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, with the decision-making arrangements we have in the European Union, there is the chance occasionally to experience unexpected and exciting situations.
I want to begin by congratulating the European Council on having reached an agreement that is extraordinarily sound and extraordinarily important.
I nonetheless wish also to emphasise that this agreement entails significant changes, such as we had not really anticipated, to the whole debate on future agricultural policy.
A few words now on the mid-term review. There is an obvious need for reform of agricultural policy for reasons to do with the budget, justice and the environment, for other reasons - into which I shall not go into detail here - and for reasons linked to the results from Doha and concerned with helping world trade function better and making it easier for poor countries to develop their economies.
It is hugely important that these reforms should work.
It is therefore essential that it be possible to implement the Commission's proposals for decoupling and for better adapting agricultural policy to the market.
It is also essential to be able to implement modulation, that is to say a larger investment in the environment and countryside, and to gather in a little money from the direct contributions.
A few words now about Parliament's resolution. We have arrived at a compromise that, in the main, supports the Commission's proposal.
I think it extremely valuable that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development should have succeeded in this, in spite of our having had quite different views from the beginning.
There are nonetheless a few points that will have to be voted on separately.
I am, for example, able to state on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party that we cannot support changing the interinstitutional agreement with a view to using the budget ceiling of 1.27% of GDP.
That is completely impossible.
We must vote against these points we cannot support, and I hope that they do not go through, either.
In order to be able to continue the debate on a constructive change to agricultural policy in the long term, it is important, however, for the proposal put forward by the Commission in its mid-term review to be able to get off the ground.
I should like to ask both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council what they intend to do to keep the debate going now that it is significantly harder to discuss modulation, that we do not know where we are to obtain the money from and that it is considerably more difficult to justify a decoupling of direct payments.
What action are we to take in order to get all this to work and obtain a constructive debate on future agricultural policy?
Mr President, I would like to know whether I have understood you properly. The Group Chairmen will speak, then we will have the Commissioner's and the Minister's replies, and then the debate will be resumed at 9 p.m. without the Commissioner and without the Minister.
Is that right?
I must correct my previous statement in the light of information I have received.
The debate will resume at 9 p.m. and the President-in-Office of the Council will be present. She will be able to stay and will answer all speakers.
Mr President, despite the scope of the decisions adopted at the Brussels Council, I shall restrict myself to making a few comments on the Communication on the mid-term review of the CAP presented by the Commission.
This is the matter addressed in Parliament's resolution.
In our opinion, the decoupling of financial support would effectively end up taking the form of aid, with the consequent loss of legitimacy in the medium term.
This would run counter to the aims of cohesion, because it would limit the receipt of aid to the historical base - I am referring to the Commission's proposal as it stands - it would promote inactivity in areas that already have problems caused by nature and would concentrate aid in areas which have more intensive farming.
It would also create problems of depopulation and of reduction in economic activity.
It would be hard to compensate for these processes by means of a few instruments for rural development with the very limited financial resources they currently have.
The poorly named 'modulation' is designed more to save money than to ensure a distribution of aid that is fairer and which has greater legitimacy in the eyes of the public.
The ceiling of EUR 300 000 would affect only 1 900 of the four and a half million farms; according to our calculations, however, the annual 3% reduction would affect an entire range of farms, from the very small to the largest.
The result will be that 15% of savings would be made on farms receiving between EUR 5 000 and EUR 10 000 per year.
The proposal adopts, therefore, quite an antisocial approach.
The sole purpose of the sectoral reforms is to save money.
Only partial compensation is being proposed for the reduction in farmers' incomes as a result of the fall in market prices, of the further liberalisation of trade and of increased competition as a result of the US Farm Bill.
Yesterday, Commissioner, I read something that did make me happy; it seems that, following the Brussels Council, the Commission is exploring new forms of modulation.
At least this is how I understood it and this could be something positive.
It would be ideal if the review went beyond being a disguised step backwards and instead achieved a genuine modulation that is more redistributive, in accordance with a range of criteria, most crucially that of employment.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you have seen the extent to which the resolution tabled by Mr Daul represents the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in all its political hues.
I believe that should be of concern to you, President-in-Office of the Council, at a time when the Brussels Council is deciding on enlargement, but when, at the same time, it is freezing the agriculture budget until 2013.
We do not want to believe that what has been discussed, in particular with regard to the mid-term review, might be called into question and become obsolete, because the representatives of the Council have a variety of interests.
President-in-Office of the Council, your comments have indeed been extremely soothing, but they will not suffice to anaesthetise us.
When the Council speaks of rural development or sustainable development, this is clearly nothing more than rhetoric.
If we really want to carry out rural development, you will have to tell us sooner or later when it will be possible to move from 10% funding to the 20% funding proposed by Commissioner Fischler and approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as a whole.
If we continue to be so vague, what does that mean?
Will we in fact have the means to implement our policy if modulation is not restrictive?
How, then, will we effectively be able to continue to carry out ecoconditionality, land-use planning, and address social issues?
This will not be possible if you do not actually provide the means to implement this policy.
Will we really be able to hold a proper debate and carry weight in the WTO as of 2003 if we cannot prove, for example to the developing countries, that the model Europe is creating is truly a model of multifunctionality that respects both mankind and the environment, and not a form of trade in disguise?
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's proposal on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is worrying in a number of respects in terms of the preservation and future development of European farming.
We are concerned, in particular, at the proposal to make heavy cuts in direct payments, in that decoupling direct payments from production will not guarantee farmers protection from price fluctuations and will not boost their competitiveness on the international market. Not to mention the fact that the Commission is proposing to turn intervention systems into mere safety nets, without providing for sufficiently comprehensive external protection.
Quite apart from the fact that this is extremely dangerous, it means that the stability of a multifunctional European model of agriculture cannot be guaranteed.
Moreover, the compulsory modulation of direct payments, as proposed by the Commission, could, in the attempt to release funds for rural development, cause further damage to the COMs in the most vulnerable and weakest sectors.
We certainly support multifunctional agriculture and the development of the second pillar of the CAP, but we believe that this goal can be achieved more gradually.
Given that compulsory modulation cannot be the only means of funding of rural development in the long term, it will be necessary to release resources from other budget headings, but we feel that this must not be to the detriment of the COMs.
If enlargement and the new economic situation make cuts necessary, these cuts must not be to the detriment of the very sectors and small farmers at risk, who are already in great difficulties now, for otherwise, paradoxically, we may well find our countryside full of people fleeing the towns, certainly not young farmers.
This is not the kind of rural development we want.
We consider excessive the Commission's proposal to cut payments to producers in many sectors - particularly the rice, nuts and durum wheat sectors - and animal husbandry.
We are therefore opposed to the Commission proposal overall and we can only welcome the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government at the Brussels Summit of 24 and 25 October last to leave the Berlin Summit agreement and the budget headings unchanged until 2006.
We welcome the fact that the summit conclusions have temporarily reassured the producers and the markets of the Member States, making the possibility of a complete review and therefore distortion of the fundamental principles of the CAP less likely.
We also welcome the schedule decided upon by the summit to be followed until 2013, although it is quite clear that CAP-related budget and resource management decisions will be taken by the 25 countries together after 2006, that is with the participation of the new Member States.
In this respect, we hope for a positive outcome to a necessary consultation process, and we hope equally that the new Member States will exercise the same pragmatism as that displayed by the Heads of State and Government at Brussels and accept the recent proposal of the European Council.
More specifically, however, as regards the text of the resolution to be put to the vote tomorrow, I must stress that, although it does moderate or enhance some of the Commission's proposals in a number of respects, there are certain elements that we cannot endorse, particularly since it supports the principle of introducing a new model of support based on a system in which income support is decoupled from production, it is in favour of phasing-out direct payments, it supports the principle of compulsory modulation and since entire sectors - such as the rice, nuts, milk and animal husbandry sectors - are disregarded.
These are the main reasons for our opposition to the text.
Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, whereas the Berlin agreements laid down a mid-term review of the CAP, you, Commissioner, have proposed a fundamental reform, without assessing the impact this could have on agriculture and on farmers' incomes.
Even if you assure us that the financial framework will be respected, you are nonetheless proposing to change the very spirit of the CAP, particularly in proposing to decouple production aid.
We believe farmers should be able to make a living from their work.
The majority of their income should therefore come from production.
For agriculture to be sustainable and fulfil its role in the management of the environment and the upkeep of the countryside, any proposals concerning it must primarily involve economic and social prospects.
How, otherwise, can we ensure a future for current farmers and encourage young people to work in the sector?
We have chosen diversified agriculture and a production model that favours quality and environmental protection.
All these are constraints that increase our production costs without the markets being able to recoup them.
We should therefore provide for compensation.
You are proposing to strengthen the second pillar, yet at the same time, you are implying that you will strengthen this second pillar and extend its scope without actually defining it.
Commissioner, I also asked you this question in July and I am sorry to say that to this day I have still not received a response.
Small farmers cannot take responsibility for everything.
They cannot shoulder all the problems of the rural world: the environment, rural infrastructures, the maintenance of public services, land-use planning, nor all of society's demands, animal welfare and consumer health.
This will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
We must also defend these choices in a global context which is becoming increasingly globalised.
The Treaties provide us with the appropriate tool: Community preference.
It is regrettable that the Commission makes no reference to this and I would draw your attention to the fact that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reminds you of this in its resolution.
As we all know, these profound changes are dictated by enlargement.
We must, however, guard against acting hastily, against robbing Peter to pay Paul, which would ultimately satisfy no one.
Mr President, following the decisions taken at the Brussels Summit, only certain parts of our previous debate are still relevant today.
This is the case of the guiding principles on which the CAP should be based in the long term.
I believe there are four particularly important principles.
The first is price protection.
Farmers, like any businessmen, must live mainly from the sale of their products and not from aid provided by taxpayers, which is always precarious and could be revoked at any time.
They need remunerative prices which must also cover the cost of environmental, social, quality and safety requirements, which are the requirements of our fellow citizens.
This system of coupling has now become highly relevant once again, since the Brussels Summit set the ceiling for the direct aid budget at a level that does not even guarantee compensation for inflation.
Unless a considerable reduction in agricultural income is accepted, in particular as of 2007, it will not be possible to compensate for this other than by means of prices that, in accordance with Article 33 of the Treaty, ensure an acceptable lifestyle for the farming community.
This must be our starting point in negotiations with the WTO, not the other way round.
The second principle consists of a revised definition of Community preference, based on the disparity between requirements imposed on European producers and on those imposed in third countries.
This disparity justifies protecting our internal market against social or environmental dumping by the world market.
The third principle is stability.
We must stop radically overhauling the rules of the game every three years.
Farmers, particularly young farmers, like any businessmen, need to be given enough information to make strategic choices and to make investments that have a lifespan of at least fifteen years, and sometimes their whole career.
Lastly, the fourth principle is that of food safety.
We must not only talk about it; we must give ourselves the means to implement it.
An economic unit such as the European Union must not depend heavily on imports, as is the case today for the strategic sector of fodder proteins.
Returning to the disastrous Blair House agreements, which have allowed America to dominate the oilseed sector completely, this should be a fundamental concern of a Commission that truly wants to defend European interests.
For now, Mr President, this is far from the reality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to reiterate the following point: what the Brussels Summit achieved was clarification as regards financing.
In other words, if we talk about planning certainty, such a thing may now exist for those carrying out budget planning, but it certainly does not yet apply to farmers.
So it is now up to us to establish a policy up to 2013.
Only that way will farmers have the security they need to plan ahead.
That is what we have to do, and this is where the Commission will make its contribution.
By approximately the end of the year we will draw up appropriate proposals so that we can then move the debate on in a meaningful way.
I am sorry that I cannot stay for the end of the debate. I am certainly not leaving for reasons of pleasure.
My plane takes off from the airport in half an hour, and there are 13 ministers waiting for me in Prague.
So I hope you will forgive me if I can no longer be present for the debate after 9 p.m.
Before the sitting is suspended, Mr Fiori has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, this is in no way a criticism of you personally.
I would like to thank the Minister for his availability but I am going to withdraw my speech, for two reasons. Firstly, this Chamber has a certain dignity, and that dignity is manifested in the way we work.
Secondly, agriculture is going through an extremely delicate period. We are a political assembly and, with my farming background, I find it absolutely unacceptable that we should deal with agricultural issues in this way.
We will decide as a group how best to bring tonight's situation to the attention of President Cox.
Mr Fiori, I am extremely grateful for the thought that you have expressed because I fully agree with it and the dignity of debates in this Chamber must be considered.
I would remind you, however, that it was only once we had started that we discovered the Commissioner would have to leave to attend another engagement and there is nothing I can do about that.
I can do no more about it than you.
We shall take very good note of this occurrence so that it does not happen again.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor on a point of order.
Mr President, I am sure there is not much we can do about tight schedules and fixed commitments, but if you had explained to the House from the Chair that Commissioner Fischler would have to be on board a plane by a certain time and for certain reasons, I am sure we could have avoided this conflict, because everyone would have seen sense.
However, if you simply inform us that is how things are, you are bound to provoke some resistance from Members of this House, and quite rightly so, because it is an offence to our dignity!
We are not content for our views to be put to one side - we want to be involved in this decision, and we want to know what is going on.
If you can take that on board, then I think we can have a reasonable dialogue with each other.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, this is one of the problems with transparency.
I have explained to you and to all honourable Members present in the Chamber, quite transparently, that we had just been informed that Mr Fischler would be unable to stay until the end of the debate.
I did not, of course, know the reason for this.
I found this out at the same time you did and I will not be entering into further discussion on the matter.
We then informed you of what was happening and we gave you the opportunity to hear Mr Fischler.
Next, you will hear the President-in-Office of the Council, to whom we would be most grateful if she returned after 9 p.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.05 p.m.)
I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for cancelling her return flight this evening, given that circumstances have forced us to extend the debate beyond the scheduled finishing time. She will now return tomorrow thus ensuring that the Council is represented throughout today's debate.
On behalf of Parliament, I would like to say how much we appreciate her presence here today.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, whom I thank for her willingness to attend this sitting, I must say that I am one of those who believe that the Brussels Summit had the undeniable merit of unblocking enlargement's financial procedure and of setting the rules for agricultural funding for the next ten years.
It would be a mistake, however, to confuse this funding stability with the status quo of the CAP.
There are four reasons for this:
the first is that the CAP in its current form runs counter to the multifunctional approach to farming, which requires a substantial strengthening of its second pillar.
And, unless this is achieved by means of transferring funds from the first pillar, I fail to see where we will find the resources to pay for this in the context of enlargement to 25, 27 and later perhaps even to 28 States;
the second reason is that defending the status quo of the blue box in WTO negotiations will cost us very dear.
The price we might have to pay could be to make concessions on issues as important as access to the market, the protection of denominations of origin and even our own aid from the blue box;
the third reason is that we have, under the CAP, a system of aid that is truly schizophrenic. In other words, it provides aid for some farmers but denies it to others.
This is unsustainable in the long term and must be changed for a system of aid that does not discriminate between products and producers and which remedies this imbalance;
the fourth reason for taking action is that the current system of aid is too complicated to be applied in a Union of 25 or 27 members.
I believe that it would be preferable to undertake a balanced reform now, before 2004, which guarantees that the markets and their regulatory instruments will be managed, which guarantees Community preference and which guarantees aid for farmers, rather than to do so after enlargement, with the inherent risks of uncertainty about the negotiating and decision-making procedures in the first few years of the enlarged Union.
Mr President, the common agricultural policy is out of date.
It is urgently in need of reform if we are going to make a success of enlargement and of our commitment to open our markets to under-developed countries.
Given the recent attitudes of the Council, the European Parliament has a heavy responsibility to give strong support to the Commission's proposals for a mid-term review.
These, though not perfect, point in the right direction.
Further market reform, with the decoupling of direct payments from production and the reinforcement of rural development, is most welcome.
The proposals will put us in a stronger position in the World Trade Organisation negotiations.
However, our Agriculture Committee is dominated by farmers and farmers' interests and it is blinded by two obsessions.
The first is for protection against imported food and the second is for a guaranteed annual subsidy to be available to the farming industry as a whole.
The concept of a really competitive European agriculture in the world market without subsidy is far from the Committee's thinking.
The resolution pays lip service to reform but attaches so many conditions that I doubt whether the needs of enlargement, nor our obligations under the WTO, could be met.
The agricultural policies should be redirected so that they encourage farmers to be more enterprising.
Whatever financial assistance is given should not be seen as a right. It must be earned and in a manner that the public can accept.
I would have liked to have seen the Commission proposals go further.
We need to move towards world market prices by progressively reducing direct payments, we need to end quotas and make sure that the annual budget actually starts to reduce.
It is ridiculous that 50% of our Community budget should be spent on a declining contribution to our GDP.
Thank you, Mr President.
President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission's draft mid-term review of agricultural policy is a sound basis for embarking upon the discussions of a future reform of the EU's agricultural policy.
The decision on long-term funding, taken at the Brussels Summit, creates the background for enlargement.
That is good and is something on which the Presidency should be commended.
Any reform should be centred on farmers and consumers.
It should be dynamic, and it should be a continuation of the liberalisation begun at the Berlin Summit in 1999.
It should cover adjustments in response to the market economy and to world market prices and also, therefore, a curtailment of, and change to, the familiar policy of subsidy.
The period up until 2006 should therefore be used for preparing a reform of the EU's agricultural policy that makes European farmers competitive in the future world market.
Mr President, the reform process set in motion by the 1992 agricultural reform and continued by Agenda 2000 is to be carried forward and adjusted to reflect changing circumstances.
The Commission's proposals are a basis for discussions after 2007, as a whole raft of issues and problems correctly identified in the paper remain to be resolved.
Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy was successful, and those elements that made it successful still need to be defended.
I am quite convinced that there will be major debates on the decisions reached by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels as regards how to deal with future expenditure under EU agricultural policy within the predetermined financial framework and including the ten candidate countries.
Looked at in that light, the motion for a resolution is just a snapshot and not a reform paper.
Freezing the agriculture budget at its 2006 level as from 2007 means an annual cut in agricultural support for farmers in the existing Member States, which will be hard or even impossible to achieve in 2003, the year before the elections.
It will not be possible to reach a consensus to the effect that farmers should meet the cost of enlargement, yet it looks suspiciously as if that is what is intended.
In her speech, the President-in-Office mentioned that there are proposals on the table for the milk sector.
I would like to ask you, Madam President-in-Office, when you think these proposals will be implemented.
Before 2008 or not?
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our committee chairman, Mr Daul, on what he has presented to us.
However, this is not just Mr Daul's resolution, it has the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I hope that tomorrow it will have the support of the entire European Parliament.
Your personal achievement has been to bring together the various different tendencies in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to document the European Parliament's desire to have a voice in the reform process.
I would ask you, President-in-Office, to convey this to the Council, please.
The European Parliament wants codecision here.
It wants codecision as regards debates about content and form, and it wants codecision as regards financial resources.
We do not want to end up with the sort of strange decisions made at intergovernmental conference level, with us being informed how much money is to be devoted to the agricultural policy, without anyone ever seeking to establish a link between the substantive reforms needed and their financial impact.
We want codecision for both agricultural policy and finance.
You were wise enough not to cap pillar two, because we would not have found that acceptable, but we need to achieve a situation in which the European Parliament also has sovereignty over finances in pillar one, and can also decide what the basic features of the agricultural policy are.
I am pleased that we have support within the Commission and that in Commissioner Fischler we have someone who will advance the reforms in the direction this House has in mind.
Mr President, I too acknowledge the presence of the President-in-Office and I want to thank the Commissioner for his openness and willingness to engage in continuing debate on the future of European agriculture.
His proposals for reform were complemented by an equally thoughtful response from Parliament's Agriculture Committee and I join the previous speaker in complimenting the Chairman of our committee.
To some extent this debate has now been superseded by the decision of the Heads of State to adhere to the decisions taken in Berlin.
I have made the point on the number of occasions in this House that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by farmers is uncertainty - not being able to plan, even in the short term, for the development of their farms.
Berlin was interpreted by farmers as setting the agricultural agenda, without adjustment, to 2006, and for this reason I believe the recent decision by the Heads of State was correct and restores to some degree of normality what was becoming a contentious issue for farmers.
I welcome, in particular, the more long-term budgetary assurances to 2013 but feel that the 1% inflation provision should at least be index-linked.
I am satisfied that the EU is committed to safeguarding the interests of its farmers and in this regard I believe that Commissioner Fischler has shown credible leadership.
I would like to ask the Minister to clarify, in the light of recent decisions, the position with regard to decoupling and compulsory modulation.
Mr President, last summer, Commissioner Fischler's proposal for the decoupling of direct payments from production set the WTO negotiations off on the right foot.
But decoupling direct payments can also have its disadvantages.
If high land prices mean that young farmers are then unable to take over businesses, we have overshot the mark.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Fischler has been overtaken to the right by Mr SchrÃ¶der's and Mr Chirac's pre-arranged decisions at the Brussels Summit.
What remains of the Commissioner's plans to give rural policy more elbow room via a shift in funds?
If the CAP budget is frozen, this means an irrevocable drop in direct payments.
Yesterday, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Fischler noted that we cannot subject the farmers to a drop of more than 3% per annum in income allowances.
In this respect, the farmers have more to expect from the realism of this Commissioner than of many a minister who says that policy reforms are unnecessary but for all that freezes the budget within an enlarging Union.
Mr President, Minister, the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is certainly innovative, but the debate on the CAP needs to be much more radical.
The question is not and cannot be how to improve the subsidy system - it is the subsidies which are the problem.
The question we must ask is why - if there is still a reason - we should continue to operate an immense protectionist system which works against the interests of European consumers and penalises the farmers of poorer countries shamefully.
What sense is there in over 40% of the European budget being used to subsidise agriculture which is worth on average 2% of GDP and employs 5% of the European workforce in a system which fosters waste, fraud, inefficiency and pollution?
On the one hand, the European citizens pay over EUR 40 billion per year into the CAP budget, and, on the other, each citizen spends over EUR 300 buying farm produce, which is EUR 300 more than they would have to spend if we did not have the common agricultural policy.
Lastly, the protectionist European agricultural system is systematically destroying the chances of hundreds of millions of people of freeing themselves from poverty, in that they are excluded from both the European markets and the markets of other countries, which are dependent upon subsidised exports.
We must shout out loud and clear that the European and US agricultural protectionist policies are a scandal and that, while the wealthy countries are giving the developing countries EUR 50 billion in aid, these policies alone are costing these same countries EUR 100 billion.
This is what we must discuss in our debates, not just decoupling.
Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy has given rise to enormous debate in Europe's farms.
I welcome the fact that the Commission has presented this review on schedule, and I would specifically like to express my thanks for its forward-looking nature.
However, I would like to stress and reiterate what the Commissioner told us - we should view this paper as a basis for a debate, a debate which we are all called upon to participate in.
The Commission has proposed a broadly based approach to reform. There is still a substantial need for clarification and debate in many areas.
The Brussels Summit on 24 and 25 October set the financial framework up to 2013.
We now need to establish in good time what shape the agricultural policy of the enlarged Community should take.
Mr Daul's motion for a resolution was voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development after lengthy discussions between all the groups and many amendments.
I would like to thank Mr Daul for his outstanding work and for his willingness to compromise. That is why I ask my fellow Members to vote for this motion for a resolution.
We do not need to go into all that much detail today.
I hope we will have sufficient opportunities to do that at a later stage.
However, there are a few important points I would like to touch upon briefly.
The idea of decoupling aids and cutting red tape sounds appealing. However, I cannot imagine either working in practice.
We are talking about money for farming families and that means that there must be fair and measurable criteria for distribution.
It seems to me that basing the future of our agricultural policy on historical values, as the Commission is proposing, is not very forward-looking.
As regards rules, commitments and audits the Commission should be proposing a simple and efficient procedure for such audits.
The idea of burdening farms with new and unnecessary formalities and costs is not acceptable.
I hope that in December we will have an opportunity to discuss concrete proposals from the Commission on market organisations.
Mr President, the resolution presented this morning in plenary is indeed the result of agreement and consensus across all the political groups within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Consensus would never have been reached however, without the wonderful work of Mr Daul, the Chairman of the Committee.
I would like to thank him for all he has done.
Through the resolution all the political groups demonstrate their support for reform of the common agricultural policy, a reform which we all deem necessary.
We welcome and support its objectives.
It is vital that the second pillar of the CAP is strengthened as regards the budget, by transferring funds from the first to the second pillar.
Strengthening the second pillar, and extending its scope to food safety and quality, are certainly very positive moves.
In addition, the reform envisages the dynamic adjustment of funds in accordance with the criteria for social and territorial cohesion.
Nonetheless, some very worrying elements remain.
The compulsory adjustment proposed in the reform does not constitute true adjustment. Rather, it is an across-the-board reduction in aid which I cannot support.
We are very concerned about the principle of decoupling aid.
The notion of a reference period cannot be used to establish single payment and decoupling.
If that were to happen, it would amount to doing away with the use of this instrument to distribute the support provided by the CAP more fairly, given that the policy has created profound differences between farming areas and farmers across the European Union.
Following our debate on the Council's agreement, reform is all the more necessary.
It is not possible for all farmers to pay in equal measure for the reduction in the budget for agriculture.
The 5% of farmers who received 50% of direct aid in 2001 might cope with this reduction but the small and medium-sized farmers certainly cannot.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I too should like first of all to offer my heartfelt thanks to the Chairman of the Committee, as he was able, in very special circumstances, to create a unanimously agreed and comprehensive basis on which to work such as this.
My sincere thanks to you, then, Mr Daul.
The EU's agricultural policy is now in a very special and difficult situation, in turmoil, in fact, with the approach of enlargement and in the context of the current WTO negotiations.
For that reason, it is very important for us to be able to establish a very stable agricultural policy, one that trusts in and has faith in the future, especially as enlargement is also now a key issue.
In their future proposals for regulations, the Commission should present criteria that take account of impediments due to difficult natural conditions as well as what is needed for the implementation of environmental programmes.
The basis of environmental action, in particular, must be the reinforcement of existing programmes.
The programmes need flexibility, for example, in determining levels of financing, so that Member States can decide how much funding they need for different actions with reference to their own individual circumstances.
Mr President, farmers in the Member States of the European Union, especially the Mediterranean, are being called on to foot the bill for reform and enlargement, in that present hardships, miserly quotas and exorbitant levies will be compounded by dramatic cuts in what are already depressed prices for basic agricultural produce, with no compensation in return.
This will have a tragic impact on the already severely eroded income of small and medium-sized producers, who will be forced to abandon the sector, causing agricultural production to shrink and eroding standards.
The decision by the Brussels Summit to freeze EU agricultural expenditure at pre-2006 levels until 2013, enhanced by 1% per annum in inflation provision, translates directly into a reduction in appropriations.
This is because they will be divided between 25 countries and because the allowance for inflation has deliberately been pitched low.
Inflation is already twice that and is expected to rise once the 10 new countries join.
The way in which the CAP is being applied to the candidate countries is totally discriminatory, with direct subsidies being meted out at a rate of 25% in the first year, rising to 100% in 2013, in other words when subsidies will be worthless.
Finally, as a member of the GUE/NGL ...
(The president cut the speaker off)
Thank you for remaining in the House, President-in-Office of the Council.
I would first like to highlight the importance of this draft resolution, approved by the Committee on Agriculture. It is the result of the efforts made by all the political groups to reach a consensus on the common agricultural policy, in which so many different interests are involved.
It is only right therefore that we congratulate the members of the Committee on Agriculture, those who coordinated the work, and especially Mr Daul, the Chairman and author of this proposal.
I trust the Council and the Commission will also take these conclusions into account.
Many queries could be raised regarding the proposal for a progress report. However, given the time constraints, I will concentrate on the question that concerns me most as citizen of a southern European country, namely the so-called decoupling of aid.
In my country production is low and farmers have to contend with very difficult conditions. Firstly, the proposal does not envisage a genuine decoupling of aid, as it links aid to that received over the past few years, thus linking aid to past production.
The only change is that farmers are not required to produce.
Secondly, because farmers are not required to produce, there is the risk that they will give up farming in difficult areas where yields are low, leading to a real decline in rural areas where we are seeking to encourage development.
We must not forget that the driving force behind rural development is production. Aid is welcome, but it is simply aid.
Paragraph 7 has been included in the resolution to address this issue. It states that partially decoupled aid is essential.
Finally, I would like to explain that farmers have been working on the assumption that the goal posts would remain in place until 2006. This reform, termed the progress report, would have the effect of moving the goal posts before 2006.
I think this will create great insecurity within a sector that is already beset by a number of other threats.
Mr President, President-in-Office, I would first like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Joseph Daul.
Like many of the previous speakers, I fundamentally welcome the fact that the European agricultural model is to be extended to a multifunctional agricultural sector in the enlarged European Union.
This requires qualified external protection, and within the EU we still need markets to be regulated.
However, although I fundamentally view the Franco-German unity that has emerged in the run-up to enlargement as a good thing, it does raise some issues for me.
Although taxpayers and farmers already know how much money is to be spent up to 2013, they do not know on what.
Germany's position as a net contributor will worsen simply because Germany's Federal Chancellor has locked us into the agreed financial framework for the agricultural policy from 2006 to 2013, with 25 countries.
As we have heard again and again, and as the Commissioner has also told us, the reduction in compensation payments needed after 2006 will mean that less money will go to the agricultural sector than does now, and that applies particularly to Germany.
I simply want to make that criticism clear.
Incidentally, our Chancellor is not renowned for being the German farmers' friend!
The Commissioner for agriculture has put the net contribution to be made by the EU's farmers to financing enlargement at EUR 500 million in 2013.
This amounts to the difference between the additional costs resulting from direct payments for the new Member States and the increase in agricultural expenditure approved by the EU Summit.
This Commission calculation indicates to me that Europe's farmers will have to pay the lion's share of the burden of enlargement.
The Commissioner for agriculture has repeatedly presented it as something positive that the Brussels Summit did not cap resources for rural development - that is to say, for the second pillar - but he can also tell us ?
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I also would have liked to have thanked the Commissioner too, but his duties have prevented him from being in the House for this important debate.
I would like first to thank Mr Daul for the conciliatory work he has undertaken in the difficult task of moving this resolution forward. The resolution is the result of a great effort especially on his part and also on the part of all the political groups.
Parliament should not introduce any changes as this could threaten the consensus.
The Brussels Summit clarified many of the unknown quantities, especially as regards the ceiling on spending. However, doubts remain on the content of the CAP review.
These will not be resolved until the Commission presents its legislative proposals to us. Therefore, I think it is truly important that we, as members of all the political groups represented in this document, send out a strong message tomorrow.
It must be a strong, clear and direct message in support of farmers. We need to say to the farmers that although the common agricultural policy must be revised, we will ensure this is done in the best possible way, within the scope of the funds allocated up to 2013.
As regards the two central strands I have identified in the review, the one that really worries me is the decoupling of aid, as some Members have already mentioned.
If this is carried out as proposed, I think the CAP would be holed below its waterline.
We need to think long and hard about this.
I think that the partial decoupling as proposed by the consensus reached through Mr Daul is a step in the right direction, but we could still examine these issues further and in greater depth.
Without going into detail, I should make the general point that we must give women and young people living in rural areas a future or there will nobody to take over from the present generation.
Mr President, we genuinely greatly appreciate the work of the Commissioner and the Commission in general on enlargement and rural development policy. It is a courageous undertaking, and the transfer of some of the resources supporting the market precisely to the poorer rural areas is timely and positive.
As always, when one person benefits, many others suffer.
The previous speakers have already mentioned the reasons for regretting decoupling and other technical aspects, which I will not repeat.
I would, instead, like to focus on the positive side of these innovations, this courageous step, to address a point which is, I am sad to say, too often disregarded.
In actual fact, this openness bodes extremely well for all those who are advocates of development in the outermost regions, particularly mountain regions.
This section on rural development is extremely important but its importance is equally greatly overlooked.
The word 'mountain' does not appear in the Commissioner's mid-term review, even though, just a couple of weeks ago, he dedicated a two-day seminar to mountain issues.
As always, however, the debate was opened and closed without any progress being made.
The word 'mountain' does not appear in the document we are discussing either, but mountain issues can quite easily be identified in Mr Daul's document. I congratulate Mr Daul heartily.
For example, paragraph 1 of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's motion for resolution calls for the development of multifunctional farming.
Mountain farming is a diverse and multifunctional typical form of farming.
Paragraph 3, which calls for a more precise definition of the objectives of protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare, describes what have always been the parameters of mountain farming, what I would call endemic mountain farming. Above all, however, mountains are implicit in the section on rural development.
Paragraph 17 calls for a range of measures differing according to the different types of farming regions. Again, paragraph 18 states that it is essential to preserve traditional family farms and support young farmers in less-favoured areas and the outermost regions.
I regret to say that the remote location of mountain areas means that they are always outermost regions and certainly less favoured than the plains.
Lastly, paragraph 20 calls upon the Commission to give priority in the distribution pattern to the less-favoured regions, to the regions which are most vulnerable and in need - I would add - not just of development plans but of an investment of trust.
This is the situation of the European mountain regions, which make up 30% of Europe's territory and are home to 5% of its population.
The mountains do not want to be a problem. They want their great potential to be a major resource for the whole Union.
We must decide to call them by their name. We must have no hesitation in acknowledging their specific situation and, what is more, mention them by name in the new Treaty to give them an anchor and provide a legal basis on which to draw up an ad hoc directive.
We must start work on a document which provides specifically and exclusively for the needs of the mountain regions.
This could be the start of a radical reform which would improve the situation of the mountain regions and all the less-favoured regions, giving them the same opportunities for life and growth as the rest of the Community.
I would like to thank our chairman, Mr Daul, once again, not least for giving me the cue to make these observations on a very important matter.
Mr President, when Mr Fischler, the Commissioner for agriculture, tried to sell his reform proposals to professional associations and politicians in Luxembourg in September, he showed a great deal of understanding for the Grand Duchy's situation, which he classed as a special case, and stated, amongst other things, that if such special situations were to be reflected in the policy, which he wished to see, then it would be necessary to draw up tailor-made plans for Luxembourg, and his proposals made this perfectly feasible.
Commissioner Fischler also assured Luxembourg on that occasion that he considered we had implemented the concept of rural development in an exemplary fashion, and in this respect he even said that nowhere else had EU resources been better invested.
That is all very well and good.
Of course, once the legislative proposals reflecting these ideas for reform are on the table, we will find out just how much we can rely on those statements.
In Luxembourg, 70% of farms would be affected by the modulation proposed, that is to say by the progressive reduction in compensation payments by one-fifth, in addition to the expected drop in income because of cuts in producer prices and because of the mandatory 10% 'environmental set-aside'.
This is unacceptable and would lead to the socially and environmentally unacceptable demise of family farms.
Proposals that would achieve eastward enlargement by wiping out farmers belong in one place - the rubbish bin.
I am able to vote for the compromise resolution that Joseph Daul has invested so much time and understanding in, even if it is with a heavy heart, Joseph!
The summit on 25 October agreed, thank goodness, that the common agricultural policy agreed in 2000 in Berlin up to 2006 would not be undermined by any radical changes before then.
So we and the Commission have time to reflect.
In any case, less favoured regions should be exempt both from the modulation and also from mandatory environmental set-aside.
In conclusion, I would like to ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I should like to thank you very much for this opportunity to take part here today in the debate, which I have found both interesting and very constructive.
I want also again to thank the European Parliament for its reading of the Commission's communication, and I understand that a decision may be made at the meeting tomorrow.
I do not know if I might be permitted to concur in the praise accorded at the meeting here this evening to the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I of course appreciate from the debate that the European Parliament has just as many approaches to European agricultural policy as I encounter in the Council of Ministers, and I therefore fully appreciate the difficulties that Mr Daul has been so extremely good at negotiating, as is apparent from the proposal now due to be voted on.
Many people touched upon the issue of the prospects for reforming agricultural policy following the Brussels Summit.
How will the policy eventually look?
How long will the reforms take?
There are many outstanding issues but, with the conclusions adopted at the Brussels Summit, the European Council has clarified matters regarding the maximum expenditure on the market-related area and direct payments for the budget period up to 2013.
In this context, I should like to draw attention to section 12, generally, of the conclusions, which in actual fact says three different things.
First of all, it anticipates ceilings set for expenditure for market-related expenditure and direct payments, and not future decisions on the common agricultural policy.
Secondly, it does not anticipate possible results following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions.
Paragraph 22 of the conclusions is the background to the mid-term review of agricultural policy, which we discussed at the most recent meetings of the Council of Ministers.
Thirdly - and as a response, too, to some of the questions raised this evening - what is stated is without prejudice to the international commitments entered into by the European Union, for example in the launching of the next Doha Round, the ways and means of which are to be in place before the end of March of next year.
As I also said in my first contribution, the negotiations in each of the three areas mentioned are continuing and will not necessarily be influenced by the fact that the European Council has now set a ceiling for the expenditure up until 2013.
I shall not at this stage weary MEPs with a report on the Council's view of developments, but how far we get - and that is of course what is exciting and interesting: how far will we get in the individual areas? - completely depends upon the wishes of the individual Member States and upon what we can agree to in the Council of Ministers.
Exciting tasks still lie ahead, therefore, and we look forward to completing these.
I should like, however, again to say thank you for the sound cooperation we have had with the European Parliament. I hope that this will continue in the further discussions of the development of a European agricultural policy, to the satisfaction and benefit of both producers and consumers.
Thank you very much, President-in-Office of the Council.
Not only did you make an effort to remain in the House, but you also kept well within the speaking time allowed.
That is quite extraordinary for the Council.
You did not even use the full five minutes you were entitled to, which is greatly to your credit.
Pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution.
Small farmers, at least in France, have the highest rate of suicide.
This is due to the stress of their uncertain future.
The reform of the CAP, however, only increases this uncertainty.
After 2006, therefore, will twenty-five States be able to survive on an agricultural budget that was designed for just 15 and has not been changed?
After the WTO Summit in Cancun in September 2003, what will become of the internal and export aid criticised by the line adopted in Doha?
Granting the European Parliament competence for agricultural codecision and giving this House the final say on the agriculture budget, which stipulates that spending for our small farmers would no longer be mandatory, is placing European farmers in the hands of a majority of our fellow Members who, as we all know, are ultra-liberal, in favour of free trade and against small farmers.
We can no longer accept that the future of small farmers should be at the mercy of Anglo-Saxon liberal fundamentalists who are the equivalent of Al Qaida in the crazy religion of trade.
Moreover, I am not talking about the uncertainty that will result, in the draft of the new CAP, from decoupling production revenue, modulation or bureaucratic audits.
That is why, when so many questions remain unanswered, our small farmers cannot plan their investments and their future.
We must not allow our small farmers to be plunged into this abyss.
The next item is the Commission statement on the financing of the nuclear sector in the context of the programme for nuclear weapons.
The floor is yours, Commissioner.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were all alarmed and dismayed to learn, three weeks ago, that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was developing a secret programme to enrich uranium for military purposes. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea made this admission during a visit to Pyongyang by a delegation from the United States.
This programme is a flagrant violation of the commitments entered into by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under four different international agreements on nuclear energy. The so-called 1994 framework agreement was one of them.
The Presidency has already voiced the European Union's disquiet.
The Union expressed its deep concern in a statement on 18 October 2002. The Union also urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to honour its international commitments on non-proliferation, to freeze its nuclear weapons programme, and to invite verification.
The statement emphasised that North Korea's failure to honour its commitments put the KEDO programme in jeopardy.
In addition, the Union expressed the hope that the peace process in the Korean peninsula would not be adversely affected.
The statement ended by reiterating the European Union's commitment to cooperate with all the interested parties in the search for a peaceful solution.
I should point out that similar messages were conveyed to the Deputy Foreign Minister. The latter met with Commission officials the very day after the news broke.
It should be borne in mind that, through Euratom, the European Union has contributed a total of EUR 75 million over the first five years of the KEDO programme. The programme was set up and implemented between 1996 and 2000.
The Union is also committed to annual payments of EUR 20 million between 2001 and 2005.
To put these sums into perspective, I would like to remind you that the Republic of Korea's contribution amounts to over three thousand million United States dollars. Japan's contribution, however, is approximately one thousand.
As for the United States, to date it has provided financial support worth four hundred million dollars.
I would like to remind you too, that the framework agreement has been the subject of criticism in certain circles in the United States and by the North Koreans themselves.
Nonetheless, the aim of freezing the production of plutonium in Pyongyang had been achieved.
We must not forget that had that not been the case, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would quite simply have obtained enough plutonium to manufacture dozens of nuclear bombs.
A new threat to the security of the region has emerged as a result of these recent revelations on a uranium enrichment programme for military purposes. This is perceived as a threat to security even though uranium enrichment is in all probability a slower and more difficult method of obtaining material suitable for military purposes than resorting to plutonium that could be produced in Pyongyang.
Both parties agree that any new agreement must be reached through diplomatic channels.
With this in mind, the European Union is currently consulting its main partners, namely the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan. The consultations aim to establish the most effective course of action in pursuit of the overall aim which is quite simply to prevent nuclear proliferation and to ensure that North Korea does not come into possession of weapons of this nature.
As long as those other countries providing substantially greater financial support to the KEDO programme continue to weigh up their options, it seems to me quite clear that the European Union should not adopt a definitive position on the future of this programme.
We therefore believe we must take concerted action along with our friends and allies. Together, we should aim to persuade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to honour its undertakings regarding nuclear non-proliferation.
This is the approach we should adopt. At the same time, however, we must ensure that the International Atomic Energy Agency's inspectors in Pyongyang are able to continue their monitoring duties.
Ladies and gentlemen, I regret I am currently unable to provide further information.
Nonetheless, I should like to emphasise once again that we must give priority to achieving our common aim and maintaining a coordinated approach along with the other participants in the KEDO programme.
I think that first of all we must try to understand why North Korea decided to admit that it is producing nuclear weapons.
What lies behind this declaration?
Is it an act aiming at dialogue as some seem to think?
Or is it a provocative act, an attempt to blackmail in order to get money in exchange for a behaviour - renouncing nuclear power - that it should adopt in any case?
Moreover, yesterday, North Korea reinforced its blackmail through another threat: it will re-start missile testing if it feels the negotiations with Japan are unsatisfactory.
This is to say that, if North Korea does not obtain millions of dollars in exchange, it will not respect its promises, as it has already demonstrated on many occasions.
How should we behave towards North Korea now?
It seems to me that, above all, we should have sent a clear message - things have changed and nothing will be the same.
This is why I was against the decision to send a letter to North Korea to reconfirm the invitation for the Parliamentary delegation to come to Brussels this week.
Maybe we should not have sent it since the invitation was turned down.
The EU has little influence on North Korea.
As we heard from Mrs de Palacio, our monetary contribution to KEDO is minimal in comparison with that of other partners.
I think that the Commissioner was right to say that we must aim to develop cooperation between the actors in the area so as to oblige North Korea to respect international rules, although I doubt this will happen with the current regime still in power.
The resolution which we are presenting today is built on those premises and is a result of a compromise reached by the major political groups in Parliament.
I would have preferred it to be tougher on North Korea, but it still represents an acceptable compromise between the need to maintain an open dialogue and the necessity to press Pyongyang into giving up its nuclear and missile programmes.
I hope that everyone will agree that it would be useful after yesterday's developments to move an oral amendment strongly condemning the new threat of renewed missile testing.
Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes the statement from the Commission.
There is no final proof that they have weapons-grade plutonium available and, of course, I support the compromise resolution between a number of groups in this institution.
We fully and firmly agree with the trilateral statement made by President Bush, Prime Minister Koizumi and President Kim Dae-jung at the APEC Summit meeting at the weekend calling on North Korea to dismantle its admitted uranium enrichment programme in a prompt and verifiable manner and to come into full compliance with all international obligations in conformity with North Korea's recent commitment in the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration.
Nevertheless, we cannot be entirely blind to the fact that the 1994 framework agreement has not been fulfilled in its entirety by the US either.
The first reactor from KEDO scheduled to be online by the end of next year is currently running seven years late.
Deliveries of heavy fuel oil, the US contribution to KEDO, have, in the past at least, been sporadic.
Most importantly, the US commitment in 1994 to normalise relations, lift the embargo on North Korea - which has been in place for 50 years - and lift the nuclear threat have still not been fulfilled.
We welcome the North Korean offer to engage in dialogue on all outstanding issues, which may mean that this becomes an opportunity rather than a threat.
We need to look at the issue of missile sales and testing, and the linked inevitable missile exports.
We must look at the signing of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention by North Korea and outstanding problems around the issue of abductees from Japan.
Also, of course, we must look for a continuation of the human rights dialogue.
In the meantime, I hope that the EU, as the only entity with diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, Japan, the US and with the DPRK, will help to initiate such a dialogue, if possible in concert with the other key actor in the region - China.
We must maintain humanitarian aid and continue the training of North Korean technicians in Europe if only to take this opportunity.
Two small corrections: firstly, Mr Gawronski said the North Koreans refused our invitation.
This was not the case.
They only had four days notice and asked for it to be postponed until a later date.
Secondly, the meeting scheduled for 11 November 2002 will not now take place and I hope we can move an oral amendment to make the point more general in terms of wanting EU involvement at all levels in these discussions.
Mr President, North Korea's acknowledgement that it has a programme under way to develop nuclear weapons is not only an insult to the credibility of international agreements but also a total defeat for the KEDO project.
The EU believed it could use so-called peaceful civil nuclear power to bribe a totalitarian regime to refrain from developing nuclear weapons.
This naÃ¯ve confidence in nuclear solutions to serious problems has now given rise to a backlash and caused the EU to appear in an embarrassing and ridiculous light.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has maintained right from the beginning that the KEDO project has been badly thought out.
We have proved to have been horribly right.
Unfortunately, it appears as if neither the Commission nor the political groups in Parliament that support nuclear power are managing to look the truth in the face, draw the logical conclusions from the KEDO fiasco and abandon the project.
What is missing from the joint motion for a resolution is a clear acknowledgement of the fact that KEDO has been wrongly constructed, badly thought out, dangerous and counter-productive right from the start.
Support for North Korea's seriously afflicted people must be provided in quite different forms.
The EU must clearly and openly acknowledge its fatal mistake in joining KEDO and inform other KEDO members that it is withdrawing from the project.
The fact is that those responsible for KEDO should be ashamed of themselves.
Certainly, there is a need to proceed carefully so as not to damage the so-called Sunshine Policy, and certainly there is a need to talk with the Pyongyang leadership in order to drive the normalisation process forward.
There is no need, however, desperately to cling to so completely ill-conceived and discredited a project as KEDO.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, two years ago, almost to the day, Parliament's ad hoc delegation to North Korea, which I chair jointly with Mr Gawronski and Mr Ford, took part in discussions in Pyongyang.
The aim of this step was to support the Sunshine Policy pioneered by the South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung, who also had the backing of the international community.
We were preceded by the American Secretary of State, Madeleine Allbright.
All these steps shared the aim of normalising the situation in North Korea through constructive dialogue.
It should be pointed out that since then almost all our Member States as well as the European Union itself have established diplomatic relations with North Korea.
Today, of course, we are disappointed, not to say furious, about the revelations made by the North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister, the very man who was our main contact, regarding the secret development of the country's nuclear programme for military ends.
We must react strongly to this deceitful approach adopted by North Korea, which is in flagrant violation of the agreements concluded since 1994.
We would ask the Commission and the Council to reassess the KEDO project in light of these events.
To this end, we must coordinate our stance with that of the main partners in the KEDO Council, in other words, South Korea, Japan and the United States.
We must demand full compliance with the agreements concluded and ongoing inspection by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
What we want is for President Kim Dae-Jung's Sunshine Policy to be implemented, but for this to take place, dialogue must be pursued, but this dialogue must also be frank and fair.
In particular, North Korea must be aware that this dialogue can only take place if it declares itself ready to stop - once and for all - any development of nuclear weapons, proceeds to dismantle this programme swiftly and measurably, agrees to ongoing controls and inspections and accepts and complies with international agreements.
Mr President, North Korea is a brutal, secretive communist dictatorship.
It has a history of political assassination, blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years back. It has blown up a South Korean civilian airliner.
It has kidnapped innocent Japanese civilians, most of whom have died in mysterious circumstances.
Most recently, it has starved many of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies.
It remains a failing and rogue state which means that the West, including the European Union, must tread very carefully in its attempts to engage with North Korea and bring it out of the cold.
The DPRK agreed in 1994 to freeze and dismantle its nuclear programme, and by its recent admission of possession of nuclear weapons it has clearly breached the non-proliferation treaty and the agreed framework of KEDO.
I believe it is right to call this regime part of the axis of evil.
Unlike Iraq, which has yet to acquire nuclear weapons, it is now too late to do anything militarily to prevent its nuclear proliferation.
Every pressure must be brought to bear to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors back in.
Pakistan, our ally in the war on terrorism, should also be challenged on its role in this weapons programme, as it allegedly provided an exchange for North Korean missiles to weaponise its own nuclear bomb.
China's role needs scrutiny and that country must be reminded that it is officially opposed to the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
If the DPRK does not agree to reverse its policy and disarm in terms of its nuclear weapons then the whole KEDO contribution by the European Union should be terminated.
I support placing the budgetary line as a first step in the reserve to be released according to diplomatic progress.
Nevertheless, humanitarian aid must continue through the World Food Programme and ECHO.
The European Union is one of the few bodies to have formal relations with this country and must use its leverage and access to its government to resolve this situation satisfactorily.
Pursuant to Rule 37(2)
The next item is the debate on oral question (B5-0496/02) by Mr Dell'Alba et al, on the Community of Democracies.
Commissioner, as you and the House are aware, the assembly of the 'Community of Democracies' will be held in Seoul from 10 to 12 November next, with the participation of government delegations from over 100 countries. It follows on from the first assembly of this group in Warsaw two years ago.
This initiative seeks to promote political democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
The European Union, which dedicates a large section of its budget precisely to democratisation initiatives and initiatives seeking to promote human rights and the rule of law, has or is supposed to have a strategic line of upholding democracy as a guarantee of freedoms and of the best possible prospects of prosperity for entire peoples throughout the world.
As we know, the Seoul assembly is a meeting of governments. The Commission will participate as an observer.
Our question, Commissioner, is as follows: what contribution does the European Union - the Commission and the Member States - intend to make to the success of this assembly?
The Transnational Radical Party dedicated an entire congress to this issue last weekend, identifying two possible goals which I would like you to make your own. The first goal is to create a Secretariat for the Community of Democracies which will have the task of preserving and furthering the growth of this Community with a view to it becoming a genuine world democracy organisation.
The second goal is for a Community of Democracies group to be created within every UN body, alongside the regional or other formal and informal groups of countries. This group would work to safeguard and promote democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
For example, one subject for debate could be the progress of the Libyan Presidency in democratisation and respect for human rights. The next debate could be a similar debate on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes the news that the Second Ministerial Conference of the Community of Democracies is to be convened in Seoul. The Commission will be represented by its delegation in Seoul, and will be fully supported by its Brussels services.
Details of the level of representation of the various Member States of the Union have yet to be finalised.
At the Council working group on human rights it was decided that there will be no common European Union position at the Conference. This is exactly the same approach as that adopted during the inaugural meeting held in Warsaw.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will be aware that one of the issues arising in connection with the first Conference of the Community of Democracies, held two years ago, was a very basic one. It concerned the criterion on which participants were or were not to be invited.
The Commission therefore welcomes the fact that Portugal assumed the main responsibility for drafting new criteria for the Community of Democracies regarding participation and possible invitations to states. This document is due to be adopted in Seoul.
In our view, it should ensure that the Community of Democracies develops through objective and non-politicised criteria and procedures. Were the latter politicised they would have a negative impact on the potential quality or authority of the conclusions, reducing their impact.
The conclusions could become altogether meaningless.
With regard to the Union's contribution to this event, individual Member States have considered making funds available to allow NGOs to participate.
The Commission is aware that one Member State has taken a definitive decision in this regard.
Whatever the outcome, the Commission stands by its commitment to promote good governance, democracy and human rights across the planet.
The latest general call for proposals for the European initiative on democracy and human rights illustrates our commitment. EUR 42.6 million will be allocated to related projects in the 29 selected countries.
Mr President, the Community of Democracies is a forum which was created in 2000 and, I am pleased to say, relaunched at the last Transnational Radical Party congress.
It is a project in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists is greatly interested too, and we therefore want to emphasise the need for the Commission and the other Union organs to play an active role in the next conference, which, as you are aware, is due to take place in Seoul between 9 and 12 November 2002.
In a world in which the threat of terrorism is increasingly accompanied by the danger that combating terrorism will lead to new cases of imperial dominance, it would appear essential that the alliance which the USA is attempting to build to fight what has been described as the axis of evil be opposed, although not necessarily antagonistically, by the Community of Democracies, an international body promoting peace and respect for freedoms which condemns all authoritarian tendencies on any side.
The Community of Democracies is not another UN, for the UN has a different sphere of operation and different tasks. Nor is it an imitation of what is known as the coalition against terrorism, which, I am sad to say, includes some States which are not democratic.
We call for the European Union to be more explicitly involved and for this Community, which seeks to promote democracy and freedoms, to become not just a forum for debate but a genuine international institution based on a binding agreement laying down, inter alia, clear criteria for accession. These criteria must include the respect for human rights by the 'good' States involved in combating terrorism too and the practical recognition of fundamental freedoms, starting with the equality of citizens before the law and the freedom of the press, which are currently being violated extensively even in the different Member States of the Union - a prime example being Berlusconi's Italy - and they must, in any case, be in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights which the European Union approved at the Nice European Council.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
by Mr Poignant (A5-0339/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ships (COM(2002) 158 - C5-0144/2002 - 2002/0074(COD))
by Mr Ripoll y MartÃ­nez de Bedoya (A5-0348/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (COM(2002) 158 - C5-0145/2002 - 2002/0075(COD))
Mr President, I should first like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Ripoll and Mr Poignant.
They are old friends.
Indeed, those of us who regularly attend late-night sittings here in Brussels or in Strasbourg have all become old friends.
Both rapporteurs have an interest in issues relating to transport policy.
In particular, they are concerned with safety standards. In this case, they deal with safety standards as they apply to passenger transport ships, and also with stability requirements for ships used for the transport of passengers by sea.
These requirements also have an impact on safety.
The rapporteurs have done splendid work. In fact, all the rapporteurs for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism have consistently produced splendid work on the various initiatives I have been privileged to present over the years on behalf of the Commission.
Following past accidents involving ro-ro passenger ships, it emerged that if a collision takes place, the chances of survival depend largely on the stability of the ships.
Even in the worst scenario, the longer a ship remains afloat, the more successful evacuation by the rescue services can be.
The Commission's proposal therefore deals specifically with this critical aspect of the safety of ro-ro ferries.
The measures proposed by the Commission were developed by researchers in response to the tragic accidents involving ro-ro ferries over the past decade.
The new standards amount to a significant improvement on current international standards under the SOLAS Convention. These new standards are already being implemented in northern European waters within the framework of the Stockholm Agreement.
The directives we are debating today will make the specific stability requirements in the Stockholm Agreement compulsory for all ro-ro ferries operating to and from Community ports.
In other words, what already applies in the Baltic Sea area will in future apply in all European ports.
The standards will apply not only to ships providing international services but also to those operating the main domestic routes.
I should particularly like to highlight one other feature of the package, namely the introduction of the requirement concerning safety and accessibility for persons with reduced mobility.
The European Union needs to be in line with other developed countries in this regard.
Member States must ensure that the provision is applied effectively, so as to improve the safety and well-being of their citizens.
I would like to make it clear to both rapporteurs that the Commission accepts all the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. This is because the vast majority of the amendments help to improve and clarify our original text.
Two of the amendments deserve special mention. I am referring to Amendment No 13 by Mr Poignant and Amendment No 8 by Mr Ripoll.
The Commission would have preferred to retain the original text in these two cases. Nonetheless, in view of the work already under way in the Council and since the latter shares Parliament's view, the Commission has decided to accept both amendments in the interests of reaching a political compromise and to ensure that these standards are approved quickly.
As I conclude, I should like to highlight the excellent cooperation that has once again been much in evidence over this dossier on transport.
Thank you, Mr President, and my thanks too to both rapporteurs.
Mr President, I fully agree with the Commissioner's words, but I shall try not to repeat them.
The aim of this directive is to improve safety and, as is unfortunately traditional, is seeking to do so following a series of accidents.
It is very simple: when ships sustain damage, they must remain accessible to search-and-rescue teams for as long as possible so that the greatest possible number of human lives can be saved.
Studies and experience have shown that, to this end, the quantity of water on deck must be limited as much as possible.
The IMO, the International Maritime Organisation, naturally became involved very early on in these issues and concluded what is known as the 'SOLAS' agreement in 1990 for a certain height of water to be allowed - but I shall not go into the technical details - stipulating that all ships should comply with this agreement and its standards by 1 October 2010 at the latest.
As you may remember, however, In September 1994, the Estonia disaster occurred in the north of Europe, causing 800 deaths.
Following this disaster, eight Northern European countries, seven EU countries and Norway, worked together to adopt stricter standards than those in the 1990 agreement in order to prevent ships from capsizing.
The question, for the Commission and for us, was knowing what needed to be done once these new standards were introduced, whether they needed to be extended to the whole of the Union or whether a distinction could be made between the north and south of the Union.
Once the technical and financial studies had been carried out, the Commission rightly proposed extending these standards to the whole of the Union under the conditions the Commissioner has just explained.
That is therefore what will happen.
It is considered possible and reasonable and the cost to companies is deemed acceptable.
There will thus be no difference between passengers travelling by ship in the north and those travelling by ship in the south.
Obviously, a number of ships have only recently been subject to these 'SOLAS' standards, so requiring them to adopt such a directive means asking them to start again.
We must therefore consider the matter of the timing and date of the final deadline.
In a spirit of compromise that everybody will understand, the Commission, the Council and Parliament have reached an agreement to conclude all of this in the year 2015.
That is the essence of the fundamental amendment tabled.
A few other amendments have also been tabled, which allow for adoption at first reading.
I would therefore advise the House, and I believe Mr Ripoll will do likewise, to resolve this matter as soon as possible, as it does not pose any major political problems, and all ships and companies operating in waters governed by EU law should comply with the standards as soon as possible.
In this way, the risk of accidents and loss of human life will be kept to a minimum, even if there is no such thing as zero risk in our society.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to string sentences together at this late hour. It is also hard to find anything further to say on a report like this one.
The report was adopted unanimously in the parliamentary committee.
The Vice-President has accepted the amendments tabled on behalf of the Commission. There is clear determination in the Council to ensure that the package is approved at first reading.
In the light of such unanimity it is hard to find anything new to say on the report. Indeed, both the Vice-President and Mr Poignant have already given an overview of the current situation.
Nonetheless, I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the European Commission's officials and the Secretariat's officials for their cooperation. I would also like to thank the members of my team who helped me work through this task.
Commissioner, I am grateful to the Commission for accepting the amendments tabled by the parliamentary committee concerning Class C and D ships. I am also delighted that the amendments affecting persons with reduced mobility have been accepted.
I believe particular sensitivity has been shown in both cases.
The will to ensure that things work has been demonstrated too. In addition, there is an obvious desire to ensure that the standards are neither rigid nor strict, but that they are properly complied with and help to improve relations between human beings.
Madam Vice-President, I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to raise another issue with you.
I believe the two reports on maritime safety we are debating today and are due to approve tomorrow are important.
Nonetheless, as Mr Poignant rightly said, accidents will unfortunately continue to happen.
The Commission has given abundant proof of its readiness to provide swift and effective responses to all kinds of situations. Parliament has also demonstrated that it is capable of rising to challenges when immediate solutions and responses are called for.
The issue I have in mind is unrelated to these two reports, but it is currently giving rise to concern amongst many European citizens. I refer to the safety of pleasure craft at sea.
You will recall that the matter has been raised with you in the past.
I trust that in the wake of the success of the two reports debated today, you will in the near future present us with measures aimed at resolving this problem. It is a problem causing a great deal of damage and harm around the beaches of Europe.
Commissioner, I could not miss the opportunity offered by a day like today, when Parliament unanimously approved two reports, and you accepted all the amendments tabled. I realise this is not the most opportune moment to do so, but I hope you will allow me the liberty of throwing this particular gauntlet down before you.
Mr President, in light of the horrendous passenger ferry disasters which have taken place recently in the European Community, such as the Estonia and the United Kingdom cross-channel ferry tragedies, these reports are a very constructive and welcome step forward.
I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Ripoll y MartÃ­nez de Bedoya and Mr Poignant for all their hard work on these sister (or in this case brother) reports and in drawing up sensible conclusions for improved safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries servicing European ports and domestic voyages within Member States.
The time is clearly right to bring forward these directives, stability requirements and technical updates for these ships.
Key to these directives is that the requirements we are now laying down are stricter than those laid down by the SOLAS 90 Convention, thereby ensuring that accidents of the magnitude we have experienced in the European Community will be much less likely to happen again.
We must also endeavour to ensure full implementation of the directives.
Alongside the proposed technical improvements, I particularly welcome measures to improve the safety of persons with reduced mobility.
I support Mr Ripoll y MartÃ­nez de Bedoya's proposal for a narrower definition of the term 'reduced mobility'.
I also welcome the proposed improvement and accessibility of signs aboard ship and the provision of alarm systems which are not only accessible to all passengers but which can be seen and heard by all passengers.
Furthermore, I believe we must ensure that the crew manning these vessels are highly trained and able to brief passengers on safety procedures in more than one language so that unnecessary loss of life is prevented.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is opposed to any move which involves relaxing safety standards and rules for passenger ships. We are also opposed to making the specific stability requirements for ro-ro ships less stringent.
Instead, we would argue in favour of maintaining the standards in question as adopted under international agreements and conventions.
Furthermore, we would like to draw particular attention to our support for the Commission's proposal for an improved definition of the concept of persons with reduced mobility.
We must fight against social discrimination wherever and however it manifests itself.
In this connection, it is worth drawing attention to the obstacles many groups of people encounter, and the discrimination they suffer as a result. I have in mind people with sensory or intellectual impairments, wheelchair users, people with limb impairments, elderly people, pregnant women, small children, those accompanying them, and people transporting heavy luggage.
It is worth remembering that the success of the policy on so-called seamlessness, aimed at promoting the use of public transport, depends on transfer from one form of transport to another not turning into an obstacle race.
Furthermore, if the needs of persons with reduced mobility are taken into account when designing vessels, the vessels themselves will be safer and more user-friendly for all passengers.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0338/2002) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the Commission's report on 'The Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe - First Annual Report'.
. (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just begin by briefly outlining the most important points of my report again.
I would like to say straight away that these points are nothing new.
Many of these have already been discussed here before, but there are a number of issues that deserve additional emphasis.
In the first place, aid granted to the countries of the Western Balkans needs to be linked to support.
This is not the first time that this has been said, but I believe that it has to be stressed again.
Cooperation with the international war tribunal at The Hague is not something which all countries can simply agree to and subsequently act as if that agreement does not exist.
That is, and that ought to be, a genuine concrete condition which must be in place and continue to be for the granting of support.
The same applies to another subject - the return of refugees - to which everyone agrees, but where practice has shown in this respect too that many countries do not deliver what they have promised or do not do what they ought to be doing.
Finally, let us look at the fight against corruption and crime.
Many fine words have also been uttered in this context, but unfortunately in practice it is shown that corruption continues to occur as far up as at government level, for example the last government in Macedonia.
The European Union cannot continue to inject money into that region while that is going on.
Another point in my report is the need to gain an insight into what will be the future of Kosovo.
We cannot have the situation where Kosovo continues to exist whilst the Kosovans want something else, but we just hang onto the 1999 UN resolution.
I do not have the solution, I do not know whether I am for independence or self-reliance, but I think that it is up to the European Union to start the discussion.
Finally, two more points which Parliament is absolutely right to ask for, time and again, and which need attention.
The first is the necessity to prepare education at all levels for a non-ethnic future.
The school books are nothing to write home about. They are continuing to repeat the old patterns.
That is not acceptable; it is the breeding ground for fresh conflict.
Secondly, it is clear again, from all the elections, how important it is for the media to be independent.
In almost all of the countries, the media play a disappointing role in the establishment of democracy and that must be brought to an end.
I am going quickly through the points because I feel they are important issues - that have already been brought to the fore earlier by Parliament but not, unfortunately, looked at in sufficient depth.
I am aware of the dangers to some extent and I would be keen to have an open discussion about these points with other Members and also with the Commission. We all, including the Commission and Parliament, run the risk of being hidebound by a pattern, a way of thinking and working with the Balkans which arose in the nineties, based on the greatest dangers which existed then.
These were extreme nationalism and ethnic hatred. Although these problems have not yet disappeared, I believe that the situation has changed so much that the greatest problems now in our considerations and our way of thinking about the Balkans are not getting the attention they deserve.
In my opinion, the relevant problems are economic and social crises, stagnation and a growing disappointment with the effects of democracy.
At this very moment, there is the risk that our interest in the Western Balkans is waning.
I only have to point out that we are sitting here in a Chamber that is almost empty.
When we discuss enlargement, the room is full, when we discuss the Western Balkans, there is just a handful of people, the usual suspects, who are prepared to speak on this issue - and Europe simply carries on.
This cannot continue; the European Union can no longer afford this.
The budget for the Balkans is falling, from 900 million a few years ago to 500 million in 2005.
This is why I was so impressed with a report which I have just received, entitled Western Balkans 2004 from the European Stability Initiative.
This sets out in minute detail what the problems are now and what potential solutions the European Union should find to deal with them.
One crucial observation is that the period of reconstruction is over.
This has been reasonably successful and the EU has achieved a certain amount of success with it but now something else is needed.
Industry has been decimated or allowed to decay.
Many small businesses have grown in its place but have not been able to solve the problem of unemployment and there are absolutely no prospects for large sections of the population.
Pursuant to this report, which I broadly support, what should that mean for the European Union, the Commission and Parliament?
I think that we must learn from the successes of the structural and cohesion funds.
These have been successful in southern Europe and I think that the time has come to apply the methodology and the approach of the structural and cohesion funds also to the countries of the Western Balkans.
For example, this would mean that the agency for reconstruction that we have had up until now ought to be turned into an agency for development.
This will also have to mean that, after the current enlargement by ten countries, the remaining candidate member states and the countries of the Western Balkans will be brought together into one DG, because the problems of Bulgaria and Romania are not essentially any different to those of the Western Balkans.
It will also have to mean that part of the pre-accession monies, which is soon only available for Romania and Bulgaria, can also be spent on the Balkans.
More of the same is no longer enough.
There is no point in having more and more sessions with the same people discussing the same policies.
A genuine change of direction has to take place and this has to happen quickly.
I am strongly in favour of such action and I make an appeal to the Commission and to each of us, the Members of this Parliament, to sit with each other and see what is now necessary for the Balkans.
What we have done up till now has been successful but it is not sufficient for the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Lagendijk for his report on the Commission's first annual report on the stabilisation and association process in the Balkans.
The Commission and the Council need ParliamentÂŽs active support in order to achieve the long-term objectives of the process.
Recent elections in south-east Europe have shown that the region has made tremendous progress, although much still remains to be done.
The result of these elections unfortunately reflects how disillusioned a significant number of voters are with the political process, and how frustrated they are by the pace and impact of the reforms.
The stabilisation and association process must be a pragmatic policy.
It should have a long-term view. It has to be flexible and needs to focus on the objective of promoting stability, democracy and economic development in south-east Europe.
I have however noted what Mr Lagendijk said regarding conditions. I agree with him on strengthening of the rule of law.
This is a key and decisive element for the region. As he says, it is also important for the media in the region to be stable and independent.
Above all, it is essential to understand how to adopt a more structured approach to the distribution of direct and indirect aid to this sector financed under CARDS.
On the subject of Kosovo, ladies and gentlemen, I would nevertheless like to make some things very clear.
We are all concerned about the situation there, but United Nations Resolution 1244 should remain the legitimate point of reference for all our actions.
This is why the Commission fully supports the regulatory policy already approved by the United Nations.
Turning to pre-accession funds and other funds for this area, we must not confuse the different types of funds. Pre-accession funds are targeted specifically and are limited to, designed for and directed at supporting the countries we are negotiating with, and for whom a timetable exists.
Ten of these countries are likely to accede next year and 2007 has been suggested for the other two.
We cannot confuse the different types of funds. The allocation of fund to the Balkans is quite a separate issue.
Mr President, I too would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that this report emphasises, once again, that it is in the European Union's interests to proceed with all the policies which are useful and necessary to achieve integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European structures. I too believe that we must proceed with a policy which has yielded good fruit in recent years in terms of reconstruction and, in addition, consider the next step, which is the issue of democracy and legislation in those places.
These countries lie at the heart of Mediterranean Europe, and it is therefore in the common interest of all the Community institutions, as well as our duty to the peoples living in the area, to provide the aid, decisions and related measures necessary to help these countries address what we feel are the current fundamental problems: problems in the field of education and training, combating organised crime, and, in particular, the endeavours to achieve democracy.
The report highlights these problems clearly.
It underscores them and emphasises the role of the European Union. It also highlights the attempts - hesitant but clearly being made - to establish greater legal protection, particularly where women are concerned - which I welcome - but that is not enough.
This report displays the European Union's interest: it must be followed by more practical measures than those hitherto provided for.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, whenever we debate the crisis in the Balkans, which of course has now become a gentler, more correctly defined form of crisis, we are all the wiser for it.
In this sense, today's report by Mr Lagendijk is a good report and we are all the wiser for having debated it.
The situation in the region is indeed complicated, complicated from the political standpoint, from the social standpoint, and from the developmental standpoint.
Our intervention in the Balkans, therefore, is not technocratic intervention, it is political intervention, because new institutions need to be built.
Now that every institution has been destroyed, nations which have been in conflict need to be encouraged to communicate and the entire social, political and developmental environment needs to change.
So our efforts have to be unwavering, they have to take an unwavering approach which avoids controversy and they have to be in keeping with UN resolutions.
Any philosophy of change could give rise to renewed crisis.
