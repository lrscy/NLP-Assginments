I urge the Commission to submit a report to us on the use of antibiotic growth promoters by the end of 2007.
Mr President, I certainly have no intention of keeping you here until midnight.
Allow me to explain my position on the major points of this proposal and in particular the differences which in some cases still remain between our institutions.
Concerning the date for the phasing out of antibiotics, I am happy to note that the Commission's approach has your broad support.
But there are some slight differences concerning the date of withdrawal of authorisations.
The scientific advice on which this risk management measure is taken mentions the need for a transitional period to allow for animal rearing practices to adapt and also for the development of alternative antibiotics.
For these practical reasons, I cannot accept the amendment which envisages the phasing out of antibiotics from 1 January 2005, despite my recognition of Parliament's desire to get rid of antibiotics in animal nutrition as soon as possible.
I agree with that sentiment but would add that this should be in accordance with scientific opinion and should take account of possible effects on animal health and welfare.
Concerning the external dimension of the phasing out process, let me clarify my position.
This has been raised by a number of people, including Mr Parish and Mrs Doyle.
The prohibition of antibiotics will also apply to feed imports.
With respect to the imports of food of animal origin, the residues testing system currently in place will be used to check for the use of banned substances.
This testing system protects human health, since it is designed to reveal residues of medicines, additives and substances in food at levels that present an unacceptable risk to the consumer.
It is not sufficient to verify whether forbidden substances were used in the feeding of animals in third countries, as the residues of such substances may not be present at the time of importation.
I welcome any suggestion that may be made to increase the resources of the FVO and particularly welcome that observation from a member of the budgetary authority.
I believe that the control of imported products and the condition of equivalency between EU rules and third country rules on the rearing of animals should be considered under horizontal legislation.
The Commission will propose a regulation on feed and food controls that will impose rules on this issue.
That proposal will take account of your concerns.
The draft legislation we are discussing today aims only - and I stress only - to lay down rules for the authorisation of safe additives.
On the time limit of the authorisations, I repeat what I said in my introductory statement: I cannot accept anything other than time-limited authorisations for all feed additives.
As regards the status of coccidiostats, I am aware that some take the view that coccidiostats should only be authorised as veterinary medicinal drugs and not as feed additives.
I refer to the point made by Mr Kindermann in this regard.
My position is that the rules imposed by this proposal will ensure that coccidiostats are used in a safe manner, respecting human and animal health.
Precipitate action, not allowing enough time for the authorisation of the same kind of substances as veterinary drugs, or the setting of a cut-off date without prior assessment, would have disastrous consequences for animal production, animal health and animal welfare.
I am pleased that a number of you agreed with that proposal.
I am willing for a report to be drawn up on this matter, but I cannot agree to a cut-off date for the authorisations.
Concerning the introduction of flexibility in the authorisation procedure, some amendments improve the Commission's proposal as they take account of the needs of minor species and non-food producing animals.
The setting of specific conditions for data protection when applying for authorisations for minor species is another welcome amendment.
The Commission can accept these amendments.
However, it is necessary to recognise the impossibility of making special rules for all types of additives and for all animal categories.
In conclusion, I would like again to thank the rapporteur and Members of Parliament for broadly supporting the policy initiated by the Commission which protects public health while taking proper account of animal health, animal welfare and agricultural production needs.
Parliament's Secretariat is being provided with a full list of the Commission's position on each of the amendments.
I trust that this will be included in the record for this sitting
I invite the rapporteur to speak again briefly.
Mr President, the Commissioner must listen to me for a moment, otherwise there is no point in my speaking!
Then it might be simpler for you to address your comments to him directly, right now!
Commissioner, I have a further question.
I believe that your response to the problem of third-country imports was simply that you are introducing more stringent controls on imports of feedingstuffs.
However, Mrs Doyle and, indeed, Mr Parish were referring to the end product.
After all, throughout Europe, we have ready-made foods from these countries in our freezers.
This is why we are asking to what extent we have to impose controls, reject the products, or even tolerate distortions of competition with the European Community.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0365/2002) by Mr NisticÃ², on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Directive 2001/83/EC as regards traditional herbal medicinal products (COM(2002) 1 - C5-0026/2002 - 2002/0008(COD)).
Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ², as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for the work and effort they have put into this report.
Mr NisticÃ² is a well-known expert in the field, but it has been quite a challenge for me and my services.
Let me start with the objectives.
What are the main objectives of this proposal?
There are three.
First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European patients.
They will have access to the medicines of their choice, as long as all necessary safeguards are met.
Secondly, to promote the Single Market for herbal medicines.
Laying down harmonised rules and procedures will facilitate the cross-border trade in herbal medicines, which currently is very limited.
Thirdly, to create a clear and favourable environment for the mainly small and medium-sized companies working in this sector.
As far as specific proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three key issues.
First, the scope of the new simplified procedure.
The use of herbal medicines is a long-standing tradition in Europe.
Back in the Middle Ages they were already well known and widely used.
For new medicines, providing fresh scientific data is indispensable if patients are to be treated with safe medicines.
But if we already know enough about a medicine, new pre-clinical and clinical tests impose an unnecessary burden and unnecessary testing on humans and animals.
To protect the patient's health, the information on the product's traditional use must be reliable enough to enable us to conclude that the product is safe.
Such information exists for many traditional herbal medicines.
For that reason, the new procedure should initially be limited to herbal medicines.
Secondly, the minimum period of use.
To ensure that the information is soundly based, we consider that 30 years should enable us to decide whether the product can be considered safe and effective.
The assessment has to be for use in the EU.
I stress this because the effects of a medicine depend on the setting in which the product is used as well as on the product itself.
As a rule, therefore, the product should have been used for 30 years within the EU.
At the same time, we recognise that there are important medicinal traditions outside the EU.
For that reason, we propose that up to 15 years of the use can be outside the Community.
Finally, the new Scientific Committee.
Herbal medicines are different from other categories of pharmaceuticals in various respects.
For some years now, an informal working group has been working on herbal medicines at the European Medicines Evaluation Agency.
Our proposal offers an opportunity to establish an explicit legal basis for this working group and to give it a clear mandate for herbal medicinal products.
This will also allow us to rely on specific national expertise to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of herbal medicines on a European level.
At the same time it helps to improve the free circulation of these medicines.
I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and call on the European Parliament to support this initiative.
Mr President, Mr Liikanen, we are delighted that, at last, after so many years, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted the proposal for a Commission directive on traditional herbal medicinal products, which I am pleased to see takes a responsible, scientific approach.
First of all, I must thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the groups, particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her competent amendments, as well as my other colleagues, Mr Bowis, Mrs Doyle, Mr Schnellhardt, Mrs MÃŒller, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Whitehead, for their constructive help in improving the directive.
Thanks to the directive we are examining, it will, at last, be possible to register traditional medicinal herbs in the individual European Union Member States through a simplified procedure, provided that - as the Commissioner stated - they meet certain effectiveness and safety requirements.
The directive both recognises the full worth of medicinal products of plant origin and, at last, puts some order into a highly confused and controversial field.
For instance, the scope of the directive is specified and the use of traditional herbs in other areas, such as foods, food supplements and cosmetics is excluded.
In addition, for the sake of safeguarding consumer health, certain features of quality and good manufacturing practice are specified that must be complied with by both medicinal herbs produced in European Union Member States and those imported from third countries.
Parliament has decided to recognise that medicinal herbs are still an inexhaustible source of active ingredients for therapeutic use.
Nonetheless, while the therapeutic value of drugs of plant origin must be recognised, it must not be forgotten that improper use can give rise to a whole range of undesirable and seriously toxic side effects, which, I am afraid, may even be lethal.
In this respect, Commissioner, the US Food and Drug Administration has so far recorded about 2 900 cases of toxic effects, including 104 deaths, principally due to the misuse of ephedrine, a drug that releases catecholamines, causes tachyarrhythmias and can lead to heart failure.
The Food and Drug Administration has also stressed the lack of quality control for such herbs that come onto the market from distant countries like China and India: most of them are, I regret to say, adulterated with a number of contaminants.
This is why Parliament and the Commission have attempted to ensure that the directive will be directed mainly at consumer health protection, both by requiring high quality and safety standards and by making it compulsory for labels and information leaflets to provide citizens with simple, clear information on the product's potential toxicity and possible interactions with other drugs and foodstuffs.
We draw the Commissioner's attention to the fact that, by traditional medicinal herbs we mean those that have been used for at least 30 years, at least ten years of which within the Community and 20 outside, as suggested by Parliament.
As a specialist in the area - I am a pharmacologist - I believe that ten years' use in Community Member States added to 20 years' use outside the Community is sufficient to assess any potential toxic effects.
I am therefore in favour of reducing the 15 years laid down in the initial Commission proposal, but I do not agree with Chris Davies's amendment, which does not provide for at least ten years' use in the European Union, not least in that, given the genetic make-up of different populations, without extensive use in the Member States severe toxic effects might still emerge.
Another positive aspect is the creation of a Committee for Herbal Medicinal Products at last.
As you will have noticed, Commissioner, Parliament is concerned that this committee should be independent and given the same powers as the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products.
I hope Parliament's request will be accepted so that the EMEA can, as always, carry out its work calmly and efficiently.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you are quite right.
We have very considerable experience of the use of traditional herbal medicinal products. In the European Union, consumers attach ever greater importance to the use of them.
This is why, in my view, it is time to establish a harmonised legal framework for traditional herbal medicinal products.
For far too long, trade in these traditional products within the Community has been hampered by differences in the national provisions.
I think that in its current form, the directive will correct this imbalance, thanks not least to the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr NisticÃ².
Let me touch upon two points which are, in my view, especially important.
Firstly, the establishment of a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products: I believe this is a necessary step, and I welcome the fact that the Commission has opted in favour of this approach.
One of the committee's most important tasks will be to set up a list of herbal substances.
However, I also think that the classification into various groups, as called for by the committee, is especially important.
I very much hope that we can achieve this further classification.
The phytopharmaceuticals with what is termed 'well-established medicinal use' should be included in the group of rational phytopharmaceuticals.
Let me briefly explain the significance of this distinction: in the case of phytopharmaceuticals with well-established use, monographs containing generally available data can be presented as evidence for an application.
No extract-specific data are required in this type of evidence.
A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals.
In this case, evidence is provided through the presentation of specific extract-related data which describe the precise effect of the individual extract.
In order to avoid distortions of competition - and I think this is especially important - the manufacturer, who has invested substantial sums in researching the effects of rational phytopharmaceuticals, should be permitted to draw attention to his special efforts as part of the registration process, thus benefiting consumers through the provision of better product information.
Mr President, I welcome this directive and Mr NisticÃ²'s elegant improvement of its direction.
We have had our arguments - indeed, we have had some today - but not about this.
Herbal remedies are bought and trusted by millions and by many of us here.
Their use goes back over millennia.
This directive allows the basic registration of traditional remedies.
It should be generous in its interpretation of how and where this traditional use established the safety requirements that are necessary.
Equally, the use of these products in combination with others, including drugs, requires scrupulous attention to the possible side-effects where they may occur.
This basic safety requirement is a modest proposal indeed.
Professional herbal practice associations and consumer groups support it across Europe.
All it requires is that we know about quality and content.
The better the product, the more the maker should welcome this directive.
What is in it?
What will it do for me?
These are questions asked by consumers, which you would indeed ask of anything you took - even a wine gum.
The fact is that we are here now facing a very simple process and yet there are petitions, paranoid talk of plots and industrial lobbies mimicking consumer concerns.
What do they fear?
The European Medical Control Agency has estimated that in the UK, for example, out of 207 notified substances, all but 2 or 3 would sail through the process of registration without the expensive proof required for chemicals.
I would ask this industrial lobby, which has embarrassed many herbalists, are your own products so safe and legal?
Or could they too be adulterated, irradiated or substituted?
How many tests have been conducted on side-effects? How many off-the-shelf shops offer expert advice?
When the Consumers' Association in Britain tested this out on a random sample of 30, only 5 were able to offer knowledge in terms of the recommendations they made.
This is an opportunity to blend tradition and the modern rediscovery of ancient skills.
It gives the consumer a wider choice and offers expansion for the quality producer.
Let us welcome it.
Mr President, any medicine can be dangerous.
If we need any reminder of that, we need only look at the thousands who die each year from taking authorised prescription medicines.
By comparison, the risks posed by traditional herbal remedies are minimal.
So let us keep a sense of proportion and make sure we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.
Nobody should object to rules intended to safeguard health and to ensure that the consumer can make informed decisions.
However, excessively restrictive application of regulations may threaten the future of some producers and specialist suppliers such as health food shops, possibly encouraging consumers to buy from unregulated internet suppliers.
I therefore ask the Commission to be careful in its application of these regulations and to take account of these genuine concerns.
In particular, I ask the House that if a herbal medicine has been used anywhere in the world for more than 30 years and there was clear evidence that its normal use is safe, then we should not deny it to the people we represent.
We must not be so arrogant as to imply that Europe has nothing to learn from others.
Mr President, I agree with my fellow Members that this is a positive proposal overall. I share their view that we should support the Commission's objectives and that, taken as a whole, the rapporteur's proposal is good.
My group will therefore support it.
Take the example of the proposal to establish a committee on herbal medicinal products. This committee would be independent, have the same power as the committee on conventional medicines and would come under the European Agency.
Clearly, this is most certainly a good idea. It is in fact an excellent idea, which will, I believe, allow us to use high-quality herbal medicinal products in complete safety.
Another significant and additional benefit is that we will have real experts in herbal medicine on this committee, which is clearly essential.
The second positive element of the proposal is the amendment distinguishing between food supplements and medicines.
We must ensure that we do not establish too strict a recognition system, as this could lead to some food supplements being classified as medicinal products when they have no medicinal effects.
Finally, I would like to comment on the amendment proposed by Mr Davies. I believe that his amendment is sensible.
I agree with him that we need to set a single period of traditional use for herbal products, regardless of their origin. I think it is somewhat arrogant to assume that third countries could not supply correct, high-quality information, enabling us to use these medicinal products without any risk.
Mr President, since the beginning of time people have relied on natural vegetable and mineral substances to cure diseases and to relieve pain.
Even in present-day medicine, despite the advent of modern pharmacology, herbal remedies still play an important role.
It is therefore logical for European quality standards to be laid down for herbal remedies just as they are for synthetic medicines and for steps to be taken to ensure that citizens are informed in a comprehensible manner about the effect and possible side-effects of these remedies.
We are therefore satisfied with the proposal to set up a separate committee for herbal remedies within the EMEA and to make the provisions relating to the monitoring of medicines applicable to herbal remedies as well.
For many herbal remedies that have long been in use new tests are unnecessary however.
The associated high costs are difficult to justify, especially if many years' use has never given rise to any problems.
I consider it right, though, that consumers are given honest information.
Where the effectiveness of a remedy has not been proven, it is useful to mention this in the instructions.
This encourages the consumer to make a well-informed choice of the kind which the European Parliament also wants other legislation to promote.
Finally, Mr President, I want to stress that scope must be allowed for the different needs of different Member States.
For this reason I would like to propose voting for the proposal in order that if a Member State takes a decision about an application for registration of a herbal remedy it recognises the registrations or licences granted by other Member States.
With this provision it will be easier for small businesses in particular to market regional products throughout Europe, so that all European citizens can benefit from regional products that have been proven to have therapeutic value.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, herbal medicinal products have been used throughout the world for many centuries.
In Europe, too, consumers' interest has extended far beyond the household remedies which are customarily used in individual regions.
Many people swear by these natural products, whether they are Chinese ginseng root or Indian tea tree oil.
In the European Union, however, herbal medicinal products are not yet regulated on a uniform basis.
In some Member States, they have to be authorised, whereas in others, facilitated evidence of efficacy is sufficient.
Mr NisticÃ² has presented a very good report which creates broadly uniform provisions governing the manufacture, marketing and labelling of herbal medicinal products and sets high quality and safety standards.
In this context, the following points are especially important.
First of all, there is the issue of quality and safety.
The manufacturers of herbal medicinal products must provide evidence of their safety in the same way as is required for chemical medicinal products.
In the simplified authorisation procedure, the efficacy and harmlessness of a product are proven through its long, that is, traditional, use.
We also need a new committee on herbal medicinal products within the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.
This committee should take over responsibility for the full range of tasks relating to herbal medicinal products.
It will establish herbal monographs relevant for the precise but speedy evaluation of the applications for authorisation.
The proposal before us not only enables us to achieve broadly uniform authorisation criteria in Europe; it also allows us to facilitate the marketing of herbal medicinal products in all Member States while maintaining subsidiarity.
European consumers can continue to choose from a broad range of products which have been submitted by the manufacturer in accordance with the legal provisions and have been carefully scrutinised and authorised by the authorities.
This guarantees product quality and protects human health to the greatest possible extent.
Mr President, the more we look into the subject of traditional herbal medicines the more I am convinced that there is urgent need for action.
Like millions of other EU citizens, I am a user of herbal medicinal products.
I want a guarantee that when I go into my local health food shop the echinacea or ginseng I buy is of a high quality and standard.
Sadly, in the UK at the moment you cannot guarantee that this will be the case.
In front of me I have four certificates of analysis and four different types of echinacea products.
The first has on its label echinacea root.
However, the others simply are not good enough.
One failed to comply because of excessive amounts of acid insoluble ash in the product.
Another was apparently free of echinacea root altogether, and the last had not been solely manufactured from echinacea root powder as claimed on the label.
This means that the next time I go and buy my echinacea, I have a 25% chance of actually purchasing what I want.
This lottery has to end.
These inferior products on the market are cheating consumers and bringing herbal medicines into disrepute.
However, we also require a flexible approach, especially on herbal nutrient combinations, traditional herbal medicines from outside the EU and non-herbal traditional medicines.
Herbal nutrient combinations for products are not classified as medicines.
Currently they may normally be legally sold as foods and that position would not change.
Where these combination products are classified as medicines, currently they are not covered by the present UK regime for unlicensed herbal medicines and therefore require a marketing authorisation.
The EU proposal would offer greater flexibility than what is offered at the moment in the UK because the directive would permit the inclusion of nutrients which were non-active.
Traditional medicines from outside the EU, such as Chinese medicines, will be able to satisfy the 50 year requirement.
However, I agree with those in the herbal sector who would like greater flexibility in taking account of evidence from outside the EU.
The key point is that the quality and relevance of evidence of traditional use is more important than geographical origin.
This directive deserves to be considered in the light of all the facts, in the interest of public health, consumer confidence and expanded choice on the market.
Mr President, it seems that a guiding ethos of this establishment is the precautionary principle, which aims to keep risks as low as reasonably practical.
However, British courts suggest that this requires weighing costs against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk.
If we are to believe the rapporteur, the risks from uncontrolled use of herbal medicines are considerable.
But I have looked at just one of his claims: that is that in the US products based on ephedrine have accounted for more than 1 200 cases of toxic effects, including 70 deaths.
However, the dietary supplement industry estimates that as many as two billion doses of this product are consumed each year in the United States.
As to Mr NisticÃ²'s claims, the US General Accounting Office has examined the FDA data which he uses.
To reach its conclusions the FDA used a combination of scientific evidence on the effects of ephedrine and a set of adverse event reports (AERs).
According to the GAO the FDA relied upon 'poorly-documented AERs and weak information'.
Furthermore, it did not perform a causal analysis to determine whether ephedrine products caused or contributed to the adverse effects.
It did not document which AERs were serious and did not establish criteria to determine which events were serious.
It did not perform any reliable assessment of its analysis.
These are just brief extracts from an 83-page report.
I have similar reports on other risks that Mr NisticÃ² cites.
The risks have been seriously overstated on the basis of scandalously poor evidence.
There is hardly a measurable risk from the use of herbal medicines and it is, in any event, far less than that arising from conventional medicines.
Given the minimal risk, the cost of this measure clearly outweighs the benefit.
There is no justification for it.
I declare an interest.
I use herbal medicines every day of the year.
Mr President, although modern pharmacology and synthetic medicines enjoy uncontested status, herbal medicines are still important for human health and welfare.
On the other hand, it must not be imagined that natural substances cannot be a great danger to health when they are abused or prepared without care.
Finding just the right sort of balance is a challenge for us, and I am convinced that my colleague Mr NisticÃ², to his credit, has done so in his report.
Stringent quality and safety standards should be set for herbal medicinal products and clear labelling and instructions are required.
The instructions must contain information on the potential toxicity of the substances and their interaction with food, drink or other medicinal products.
In addition, for herbal medicines to be authorised for sale on the market the same practices have to apply, where possible, as with synthetic medicines.
This is not meant as an attack on traditional medical remedies: on the contrary, the goal is to ensure there is a safe framework within which the herbal medicine industry can thrive in the Europe-wide market.
Entrepreneurs in the sector will profit as the market grows and reputations are protected, and consumers will gain in terms of safety and price.
The rapporteur raises some problems that have been encountered with irresponsible manufacturers, especially in third countries.
Toxic vegetable substances or poisons such as arsenic and mercury, or other medicinal substances such as hormones, have been found in medicinal products.
When there is such indifference combined with good faith on the part of the consumer, human lives are in danger.
People associate herbal medicines with something natural, good and safe, and they do not imagine that if the dose is wrong or if there is any other form of abuse this can cause serious harm and even death, or that there may be serious problems of quality with the product.
The European Parliament is now promoting a worthy human tradition: herbal remedies.
Mr NisticÃ²'s report lays down for this safe and clear limits within which the industry can flourish and succeed.
Mr President, allow me to comment briefly on some of the speeches and amendments.
A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is provided in writing to Parliament.
Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the simplified procedure.
Let me underline that I am grateful for your support to limit, in principle, the new simplified procedure to traditional herbal medicines.
It is crucial that we gain sound experience with this new procedure before we can plan any possible extension.
At the same time, I understand the request from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to slightly extend the scope of the procedure to those herbal medicines, which contain additional non-herbal ingredients.
In principle, the Commission could support such additives as vitamins and minerals.
However, we have to be prudent and exclude certain substances such as biological ingredients, which involve particular risks.
For such substances we must insist on getting the standard scientific data.
Many speakers have mentioned the minimum time of use.
As a general rule, 30 years of traditional use in total and 15 years within the Community are the minimum to ensure safety and efficacy of the products.
However, there will be exceptions.
It may be that a product has been used outside the EU for thousands of years, but has been available within the Community for only 10 years or less.
The Committee on the Environment proposed to shorten the minimum usage time within the Community from 15 to 10 years.
The Commission is ready to lay down specific rules for such exceptions.
From a European perspective, however, it is preferable to provide a European solution.
Where a product does not fulfil the general criteria of 30 and 15 years, we could empower the new committee to look into this product and to assess if the available information is sufficient.
This way of establishing flexibility would have the advantage of meeting the double objectives to ensure the protection of public health while at the same time facilitating the free movement of these medicines within the EU.
The Commission's proposal already gives the new committee considerable powers.
The Committee on the Environment wants to go even further and replace the committee which generally deals with medicines for human use (CPMP) with the new 'herbal committee'.
In principle, the Commission could support part of the proposed extension.
We agree that the 'herbal committee' should deal with deciding mutually recognised procedures where divergent national decisions on herbal medicines are involved.
Thank you, Commissioner Liikanen.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0356/2002) by Mrs van den Burg, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on working conditions for temporary workers (COM(2002) 149 - C5-0140/2002 - 2002/0072(COD)).
Mr President, I should like to thank and make a point of congratulating Mrs van den Burg on her excellent report and on her positive input to the Commission proposal on working conditions for temporary agency workers.
We all know that this was not an easy procedure; there were serious political and technical difficulties and I really must thank her, because I think that, with the work that has been done, Parliament will help push through this important directive.
Since the beginning of the 1980s, temporary agency work has become an important cog in the wheel of the European job market as companies strive for more and more flexible employment management.
Over recent years, this type of work has increased in leaps and bounds.
Truly massive employment agencies have developed in numerous countries, sometimes with hundreds or thousands of workers, and we see this sort of intervention on the job market as a positive development; it often creates jobs and it is always an extremely important tool for people looking for their first job.
The growth in temporary agency work is firmly on the agenda of social and economic reform which was strengthened at the Barcelona Summit.
In many countries, however, temporary employment is looked down on, mainly when flexibility and quality of work are not pulling in the same direction.
This is the shortcoming on certain job markets which this directive is designed to rectify or prevent in future.
The aim is to create a broad, flexible framework based on fundamental workers' rights; these rights must be protected in all cases so that we can protect the quality of work.
The Commission tabled this proposal when talks between the social partners broke down in May 2001.
I think it is extremely important that the Council and Parliament manage to approve this directive, which sends out a very important political message that the European institutions are prepared to shoulder their responsibilities and take action even where the social partners are unable to agree.
Mr President, I did indeed intend starting with the difficult legacy of this dossier, which goes back to the early nineties when a number of proposals for directives on atypical work were submitted.
You have already referred to the agreements of social partners and also to the failure of their negotiations in this regard.
Considerable effort has been expended on tabling this proposal in the Commission.
It has taken nearly a year.
Indeed, that whole legacy shows that it was extremely difficult to draft the directive and that it was also highly controversial.
People have therefore often asked me what on earth possessed me to think that I would get it through just like that.
Why have I sunk my teeth into this as I have?
In the first place, because I have 25 years of experience of atypical working relationships of this kind and of providing protection for people in the weakest positions.
Secondly, because I am utterly convinced of the usefulness and the need for flexibilisation of the European labour market and I see temporary work as a worthwhile tool, provided that the protection of temporary workers is also regulated in a sensible way.
Thirdly, because I believe in the opportunities that temporary work offers workers with specific wishes or problems.
People who need a leg-up into the labour market or people who are seeking tailor-made work patterns that are not provided by the ordinary employers in the ordinary work patterns.
Fourthly, because I believe in the entrepreneurship of the temporary sector and the art of combining the wishes of workers and employers with regard to flexibility in a positive way.
However, I would also say, the art of entrepreneurship is also for example not transferring the risk of underutilisation to the workers, but guaranteeing to workers that as an employer you will ensure that they have work and that they can be deployed at the times that they themselves would want.
Fifthly, because I believe in the regulating and salutary effect of collective employment conditions, which have an important part to play in this proposal too.
It is a question not only of collective bargaining agreements in the sectors in which that work is used, but also collective bargaining agreements in the temporary employment industry, the temporary sector itself.
Finally, because I totally disagree with the trend to declare European regulation in the social sphere out of order.
I actually think that it is very important, especially in view of enlargement and the developments that are under way, to lay this basis in European legislation and to ensure that from here we also go further in Europe.
All this I can see in the proposed directive.
It includes flexibility and security, promotion and patronage, acceptance and protection, liberalisation and regulation.
I think that there is a good balance in the Commission's proposal, but that this balance has been enhanced by what we in this Parliament have done.
I therefore strongly oppose the attempts of some in this Parliament to remove precisely this balance of flexibility and security.
Their assault focuses in particular on three things.
Firstly, they are trying to remove the equal treatment principle by not linking it to the conditions of employment in the user company, but taking other temporary workers as a reference point.
Then you have something like the equal treatment of women by comparing them only with other women and not with men.
Secondly, they are contesting the fact that the directive should have anything at all to do with pay.
We now have the legal opinions of all three institutions that this is very much possible, because it is a question of a comparison and not of fixing the level of pay.
With this attempt, however, they are also trying to take the sting out of it, because pay is of course the most important condition of employment.
Thirdly, they are trying to exclude the exception that was in paragraph 5.4 of the Commission's proposal, concerning short temporary assignments, and to make it general and even to raise it to 12 months.
That will mean that the directive no longer has any point, because then the majority, if not all, temporary work will fall outside of its scope.
I know that this is also a major problem in the United Kingdom.
I have also tried to make a proposal to make this possible for a transitional period, that is for the first six weeks.
That has not been supported in this Parliament so far, but I hope that further discussion on this subject will prove possible.
There is one final comment I should like to make.
Last week, parliament in Germany agreed on a system that is very much in line with the directive.
I therefore hope - and I would like to conclude on this point - that the Social Affairs Council on 3 December will try to reach a common position, because in any event the way is now open for Germany too to do this in the line of the directive, and because it would be very good and, in fact, be proof that social legislation is indeed still possible if we could have a decision quickly and then proceed under the Greek Presidency.
Mr President, I find myself with the unexpected privilege this evening of speaking second in this debate.
I speak on behalf of Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in whose name our opinion stands.
That is due to the chivalry of my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, who is here tonight and who is the original draftsman of the opinion.
He tried in vain to persuade our committee to support the thrust of the Commission proposals.
By a convincing majority the Committee on Legal Affairs voted in a series of sensible modifications that would have blunted some of the harm that this directive, if it is not changed, is going to do to the economy and employment throughout the European Union.
I thank Mr Koukiadis for doing the decent thing and laying down his report.
As the second speaker, I want to pay tribute to Mrs van den Burg.
I have not had the pleasure of working with her before.
She has worked in a very open-handed and friendly way.
As she said, she has taken advice from a lot of people.
Unfortunately, she has not listened to that advice.
I am pleased that a number of other groups have supported the thrust of our amendments and I thank members of my own political family for going along with some of our ideas.
The problem is that, as amended, the proposal from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs does not achieve the sort of flexibility that its advocates, the Commission and the rapporteur, were claiming.
It has become more intrusive - there is more regulation.
My concern about this report is that it fails to accept that high-quality temporary work, delivered by a caring and well-run agency, is not just a second best for employment.
I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Employment for accepting one of my amendments which states: 'Member States shall transpose these provisions in a manner consistent with promoting job creation and making temporary agency work more attractive, recognising the different circumstances pertaining to their own territory'.
If you had achieved that, I would have been delighted to support the directive.
Mr President, in order to combat mass unemployment, more flexible models of work need to be found.
Temporary agency work is making an increasing contribution to this process.
Successful placement on a temporary basis increases the chances of permanent employment. This applies to the low-skilled and the long-term unemployed, but also to specialists.
In the opinion which I have drafted on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we refer to the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
We have incorporated the right to paid maternity leave and parental leave into the draft directive.
We are against every form of discrimination, whether it relates to payment for equal work or work of equal value, is based on sex, or discriminates against temporary workers compared with permanent staff.
For us, it was important to ensure that temporary workers should not be used to break strikes or as a means of imposing radical cuts in full-time jobs or permanent staff.
Men still account for more than three-quarters of temporary workers.
It is the difficulty in achieving a balance between work and family life that explains why there are far fewer women in this category .
Yet temporary work in particular allows adaptation to individual needs, and offers women good opportunities to enter the workforce or return to work.
There are problems in practice, however.
In Germany, temporary work agencies, known as Personnel Service Agencies, are now being established in the Employment Offices; as part of the public sector, they are subsidised from taxation and bear no commercial risks.
This puts the private temporary work agencies at a severe disadvantage.
I can tell the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, that the Federal Government is not implementing its supposedly groundbreaking concepts on a one-to-one basis, as it had pledged, but is watering them down.
Temporary agency staff are to be paid as much as the permanent staff in the user company from day one.
Yet equal pay from the start and the exclusive application of collective agreements are an impediment to temporary work.
It was unfortunate that my proposal to introduce a six-month qualifying period at European level failed to secure a majority.
In the Group of the European People's Party, we are therefore developing a compromise which takes appropriate account of the different rules in the Member States and respects the subsidiarity principle.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after months of intensive work, we can now vote for the first time in plenary on the draft directive on working conditions for temporary workers.
Everyone involved has made great efforts to achieve the best possible solution for temporary workers, temporary work agencies and dynamic economic development in our EU Member States.
Reaching this outcome was a difficult task.
I would like to thank everyone who helped to ensure that we could present a fairly good compromise today.
With around 10 million jobless and a shaky economy in the European Union, we must be sure that our well-meaning intention - to guarantee a basic level of social provision for temporary workers - does not paralyse an entire sector.
It would be quite inappropriate to term 'temporary work' an atypical or even an unworthy form of working.
Temporary work can help new recruits find a direction for the future, and it can help prevent employees who are particularly difficult to place from leaving the workforce, or assist them to return to work.
My group attaches particular importance to flexibility in this sector.
We must not create new bureaucratic hurdles, and temporary work must continue to be affordable for small companies too.
Otherwise, the days of temporary agency work are numbered, leaving even more millions jobless in the European Union.
If, when we vote tomorrow, we are guided by the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of pro-active economic development as a basis for more jobs, we will create more scope for the EU Member States to pursue their own courses towards flexible labour market development which does not conflict with appropriate protection for workers.
The measures adopted in Germany with regard to temporary work lead to a dead-end.
I hope we can create a more effective framework here.
Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur, Mrs van den Burg, and members of other groups who have helped steer us towards what hopefully will be a successful vote tomorrow.
We have heard that provision varies from Member State to Member State in terms of the protection afforded to temporary agency workers.
That is indeed the case and that justifies the laying down of a basic framework of protection for temporary workers throughout the European Union, but I would also underline that it will include the accession countries.
The numbers of such workers are increasing in those countries, but as far as I am aware they have no existing protection for temporary agency workers.
My second point is that tonight we are pursuing a strategy which has been under way since 1997, when we adopted the employment strategy at European Union level.
In the adaptability pillar of that strategy, to which all Member States have signed up, we agreed to strike a balance between flexibility for companies, of all shapes and sizes, and a degree of security for the workers working within, and moving between, those enterprises.
We have already dealt with that in relation to the earlier proposals on part-time work and on fixed-term contract working.
We were warned at the time of the part-working directive that it would cost hundreds of thousands of part-time jobs, particularly for women workers within the European Union.
We now have the evidence and the opposite is the case, because part-time work has come to be seen as a positive option.
What we are working on now will mean that temporary agency work will also become a positive option in the future.
We are often told that it is already a positive option, and that many people want to be temporary agency workers.
Only 10% of the 61,000 temporary agency workers in my own region say that they are temporary agency workers by choice.
We can increase that percentage quite significantly if we get it right and bring this proposal to a successful conclusion.
We should pursue that balance between flexibility and security.
Mr Harbour says we have not done it yet but I would say to him that this is the first stage.
This is the opening gambit and not the end game.
This is a codecision dossier.
We have a long way to go, through common position, through second reading and no doubt into conciliation.
We can continue to pursue that balance between flexibility and security.
In my own group, two issues have been of great importance at this first reading stage.
One is 'day one comparability'.
I therefore hope that Amendment No 42 will be carried tomorrow.
The second is the comparator.
To whom is the temporary agency worker compared in terms of pay and basic employment conditions?
None of the potential solutions we currently have on paper are that elegant, but they get us through first reading and I am sure we will be getting back to that at the common position and second reading stages.
Mr President, I do not believe the Commission has done enough to address the problems in different Member States.
It is not just a problem for the UK, it is a problem for Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands and various other Member States.
What we have to do is carry out a proper comprehensive impact assessment.
We wish to return the directive to the Commission for them to do that assessment.
I am in favour of temporary workers receiving protection but believe that it is probably best left to Member States, rather than having the 'fit-all' directive which we have in front of us today.
The proposal in its current form will reduce flexibility, reduce opportunities for temporary workers and lead to more bureaucracy.
We have, however, suggested various amendments in case the proposal is not rejected outright.
To make it more workable for Member States we would firstly like to exclude pay and other financial benefits from the directive's scope altogether.
I do not believe it should be an EU competence in any case.
The second major amendment is to give an exemption for 12 months for temporary workers placed in user companies.
That is only for pay and financial benefits, not for health and safety.
Most temporary workers in the UK and some other Member States are covered on health and safety grounds.
Another key amendment is to make sure the user company or the agency can be comparative, to give Member States that choice.
Another area of concern is the temporary-to-permanent contract fee.
Agencies should get some sort of recompense if the temporary worker is taken on by the user company.
In my view, these amendments will make the directive far more workable and more acceptable to temporary workers, agencies and user companies.
Mr President, it is well known that this proposal for a directive has arisen as a consequence of the block that European employers have imposed on the negotiating process on which the social partners had embarked.
Nevertheless, although the proposal is intended to improve the working conditions of temporary workers, guaranteeing them equal rights and equal treatment, it only guarantees these through minimum standards of protection, based on the principle of non-discrimination, with countless derogations and with the dangerous prospect of an upsurge in temporary work agencies, which will contribute to greater job instability.
Consequently, in the debate in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we agreed with all of the rapporteur's attempts to improve the proposal for a directive and to guarantee workers' rights, having tabled various proposals for amendments, specifically the removal of various derogations that could undermine the principle of non-discrimination, the guarantee not to use temporary workers to break strikes and the principle that the work undertaken by temporary agencies must not contribute to increasing job instability.
We regret that most of these proposals have not been accepted, although we welcome the fact that some important ideas have been adopted, specifically on the restriction of derogations, enshrining the application of the principle of non-discrimination from day one with the removal of the six-week derogation, thereby guaranteeing some rights in the field of the information and participation of temporary workers and their not being used to break a strike.
Other articles, however, are worded in a way that is unfortunate, incorrect and in some cases dangerous to workers, in addition to opening the way to further derogations, to be granted by the social partners. These articles are also intended to ensure an active role for temporary work agencies, contributing to greater labour flexibility.
Hence the proposals we tabled for the vote in plenary.
We are attempting to ensure that the European Parliament proposal achieves a significant improvement in the rights of temporary workers and does not pave the way for greater job instability.
Our commitment is to ensuring that the greatest value is attached to work, by creating more high-quality jobs with rights and not to instability and the devaluing of workers.
We therefore hope that you will support our proposals and reject all those that will, in practice, create greater instability and damage the rights of temporary workers who, in most cases, only resort to taking this type of work when they cannot find permanent employment.
Let us not, then, contribute to a dual form of discrimination.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her hard work and willingness to reach an agreement, difficult though that path has been and will be.
My group will not be supporting the amendments which oppose this directive, but will generally support the rapporteur.
It is quite true that there are many reputable agencies which pay well, which engage in training their staff and which provide very good terms and conditions.
These agencies are generally already used to working within a regulated framework.
This directive possibly changes part of the regulation.
We have been told by certain major agencies, some of the largest operating in the European Union, that they do not oppose a regulation, which is not what the Confederation of British Industry and others would have us believe.
But some of the difficulties raised we found difficult to credit.
Some of the agencies have told us that they cannot compare the work done by their staff with that of the end-user company's staff as their agency staff do unique work which is highly skilled and is on a project basis.
So, I found myself wondering on what basis, then, is the pay rate set at which the agency charges the end-user company?
What percentage of that income is then paid to the worker?
They cannot be working in a vacuum.
Internal pay rates, some have told us, are confidential.
Well, how then do reputable companies perform transparent audits on equal pay for equal work?
I believe that good agencies have nothing to fear from this directive.
We would like to think that those who should be worrying are the disreputable ones who exploit the poorly-skilled, or people in areas of high unemployment who have little choice as to who they work for and under which conditions.
These include cleaning agencies who employ shifts of temporary night workers and then pay them at training rates for longer than necessary, and companies who effectively employ long-term agency workers at lower rates of pay than permanent staff, and who replace paid staff who leave with agency workers because they can lay them off much more easily and with poorer conditions.
For some strange reason, those agencies have not lobbied us.
We need to ensure that we protect the rights of workers who do not have choices and whose agents know that they can exploit that weakness.
Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on attempting to find a compromise between the different points of view on this issue.
However, as was said on a number of occasions in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we are starting with a flawed proposal.
It is flawed because we have moved away from the social dialogue and social partnership model where there was agreement between both sides of industry before a proposal came before this Parliament.
This has put us all in a very difficult position, because we who are supporters of social dialogue, of protecting the rights of workers and of increasing the opportunities for employment of all the peoples in Europe want to ensure the best possible conditions for those most in need.
Whilst I have no difficulty with the general tenor or the general intent of this directive, a number of facts have to be recognised before we give greater protection to those who are in temporary work contracts under the aegis of agencies.
Firstly, there are various pieces of national legislation which already protect workers and this is merely duplicating or replicating what is already in place.
Secondly, we have different types of employment systems in each Member State and a 'one size fits all' approach will not necessarily work.
Thirdly, temporary workers work temporarily by choice and sometimes they can earn more money as temporary workers in an agency capacity.
Fourthly, there is no provision in the Treaties and no place in this Parliament, the Council or the Commission for laying down conditions relating to workers' pay - that is still exclusively a matter for the Member States.
My last point is on the question of the six-week period.
There are amendments tabled for this to be extended to a one-year period.
This is far more sensible and practical from the point of view of protecting all workers' rights.
Mr President, I must first say that I find the proposal for a Commission directive highly positive.
I think it could be improved, and I think it was partly improved and clarified by Parliament when it was voted on in committee; I hope it can be further improved tomorrow when the House votes on it.
I do not wish to add much, or even anything, to the opinion already expressed in the debate by the Commissioner and so many other Members on the question of temporary work. Such work has made it possible to try out necessary and opportune kinds of flexible working, in some cases it has allowed workers to achieve their own plans in life, and it has provided greater opportunities to enter the labour market, which is essentially the main issue here.
At this juncture, on the basis of the experience gained so far, we needed to raise the thresholds for certain minimum levels of compulsory protection and to uphold the principle of non-discrimination.
I reject the argument put forward by some regarding the desire to impose a straitjacket on pay issues from above: no one can specify a Europe-wide level of pay that will be valid in all Member States.
The principle to be upheld was that of non-discrimination, and that has been done, but even more can be done if, as I hope, certain proposed amendments are adopted by this House, without imposing a single model or, much less, denying the direct role of agencies in the three-way relationship that characterises this type of work.
We do not want a one-dimensional Europe but rather a Europe that can retain features that give meaning to a Community model and a Community commitment, which, when necessary, stop us from throwing out the baby with the bath water or, worse still, from running the risk of throwing out the baby and keeping the bath water.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, most Member States already have laws on temporary work or collective agreements, but they vary substantially in quality.
The German legislation formerly in force was certainly not as simple as has been claimed here, and the public, whether they were employers or employed, did not accept it.
Let me list just some of the peculiarities in the German restrictions: the ban on 'synchronisation', limitation to twelve months, a ban on fixed-term employment, and a ban in the construction industry.
This is why I think that the German Government and parliament have taken a very courageous and significant step by already incorporating the European directive currently being debated into the qualitative improvements for Germany.
It was unacceptable for workers in Germany to be earning up to 40% less than the permanent staff.
No wonder the industry as a whole has such an appalling image.
This is precisely what we are trying to change.
What is interesting, however, is that temporary work is most readily accepted by society, and is also increasing to the greatest extent in those Member States where the principle of equality applies, namely in France and the Netherlands.
Of course, the employers want social acceptance as well.
The main reason for using temporary agency workers - as our Foundation in Dublin found out - is not the cost savings incurred, but the option of flexible deployment during seasonal bottlenecks, as a response to personnel fluctuations, and in some cases in the extension of probationary periods.
This is exactly what the European directive facilitates, with Mrs van den Burg's amendments.
The necessary flexibility is further safeguarded through wage negotiations.
Let us adopt this directive tomorrow and send out a clear signal that there really is such a thing as a social Europe!
Mr President, unlike some colleagues, I do not believe that this House should seek a delay in fulfilling its responsibilities in relation to temporary agency workers.
If we are to promote flexible labour markets then we must ensure that those working within them are not put at a disadvantage.
We cannot risk temporary work being used as a way of bypassing normal employment laws rather than, as it should be, a properly regulated means of satisfying employers' short-term needs.
It is for this reason that we should not emasculate the proposal by removing pay from the scope of the directive or applying it only to workers in assignments of more than 12 months.
That said, I am not convinced that we have yet struck quite the right balance between flexibility and protection.
There are real difficulties in implementing a fixed-term worker comparative for pay in the case of assignments of a short duration.
Accordingly, I urge colleagues to support Amendments Nos 72 and 74 which should overcome this problem.
Similarly, I hope for a positive vote on Amendments Nos 71 and 73 which guard against any adverse effects the directives might have in both the shorter and longer terms.
Finally, my special thanks go to the rapporteur for the inclusive manner in which she has handled a very difficult dossier and my personal good wishes to her for the outcome of the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, although we must have a European viewpoint, we are inevitably influenced by the situation in each of our countries.
Specifically, in my own country, temporary work agencies - or at least some of these companies - are factories for insecure work.
At the moment, in Spain, 33% of this work is insecure, more than double the European average, which stands at 13%.
We therefore have difficulties with some of the amendments which my colleague, Ilda Figueiredo, has already mentioned in that they may possibly lead to discrimination.
The rapporteur herself, in the explanatory statement, says that she is not very happy with those amendments that jeopardise the principle of non-discrimination.
In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, although it points out that these companies have contributed to improving the labour market, it is also stated that these companies, in certain countries of the European Union, employ illegal workers, and that they regularly violate the rights of workers.
Therefore, as my colleague has already pointed out, if certain amendments mentioned are approved, it will be difficult for us to vote in favour of the report.
At the Lisbon Council, there was discussion of the quality of work and employment rights.
We are therefore tabling certain amendments - I am not sure if they are having much luck - inspired by a principle laid out in one of them: we advocate that this directive should be aimed at improving the quality of temporary work, guaranteeing respect for the principle of non-discrimination.
That is what we are advocating, pure and simple.
And we will support the rapporteur provided that certain amendments by the honourable Members seated opposite are not approved.
Mr President, this is an extraordinarily involved directive with an involved previous history, as has already been said.
We have had great difficulty bringing this directive to a successful conclusion.
I think that the main point is that the legislation this directive is about is very different in what are very different countries, that temporary work is regulated in a very different way in the different European countries and I would like everyone to recognise that.
We must nonetheless seek a solution because of the previous history and also because of the fact that we would otherwise be unable to regulate cross-border traffic.
To move in the direction of the Lisbon process we must develop further the important role that temporary work can play.
We have considerable experience of it in the country where I come from.
It is currently still the country with the highest percentage of temporary workers and experience shows that you can deregulate, but that you must then take certain statutory measures.
That is a fact.
As each country needs its own balance, the directive must be relatively flexible.
Thanks to the work of the rapporteur, but also thanks to the work of the two shadow rapporteurs from the PPE-DE, this has been achieved to a very large extent and I would therefore like to thank all three of them very much.
The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has also, I think, made a significant contribution, as has the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to the achievement of a result.
It is very important that there is a result, as I have already said, but there are occasionally some interfering noises.
These interfering noises often come from people who are thinking only of their own situation, of their own country.
This we must prevent. This we cannot accept.
Finally, Mr President, I would ask the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party to take another look at their own amendments.
Amendments have been submitted in duplicate or triplicate, and contradictory amendments have also been tabled to the same Paragraph.
This is no way to negotiate.
We cannot deal with codecision this way.
I would like to ask whether they would like to go through their own amendment list one more time.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her patient work on a difficult issue.
Parliament can debate today, and tomorrow, I hope, it will be able to adopt a report that improves the Commission proposal.
It is, as has already been said, a very problematic dossier, because the different countries have very different systems to deal with this matter - they range from situations of all-embracing guarantees to a lack of any kind of protection. I too applaud the Commission's initiative, which is not a straitjacket restricting autonomy and subsidiarity but comes after 20 years of attempts by employers and workers to reach an agreement.
I believe there are three basic objectives of equality of treatment contained in the proposal: equality of treatment for temporary workers compared with other workers in terms of job security and status; respect for established social standards within the user enterprises, through equal treatment in terms of pay and working conditions of temporary workers and other, comparable workers in the user enterprises; and recognition of the work of agencies supplying temporary workers as a legitimate professional activity, removing unnecessary restrictions, authorisations and prohibitions.
The purpose of the directive is thus to guarantee and harmonise a common minimum level of protection for temporary workers, without any discrimination.
It is a directive that places temporary work within its own part of the labour market, recognising its importance and value without, however, pushing it until it becomes almost the only system for hiring people.
I also believe, since Lisbon has been mentioned, that this directive regulates temporary work in a way that brings it qualitatively into line with the Lisbon objectives.
Mr President, this report will introduce some improvements in working conditions for temporary workers in Europe. Its main aim however is to legitimise the flexibility and fluidity of the labour market.
This is in the interest of employers and, in addition, of capitalists who invest in temporary work agencies. This is why the report presents temporary employment as a normal form of working, even though it accentuates exploitation, flexibility and insecurity.
Even in a period of high unemployment, temporary employment is never a real choice for workers.
A number of amendments even ratify the employers' point of view on the flexibility offered by this form of insecure employment. Clearly, temporary employment makes it possible to dismiss workers overnight, without even being obliged to implement a social plan or pay compensation.
In many countries, temporary employment is becoming a normal way of running a business. There are firms where 30, or even 40% of employees are in temporary, insecure jobs on a permanent basis.
This has been recognised by the relevant British employers organisation. It reports that there are 1 300 000 temporary workers in Great Britain, and that 10% of these have been in their temporary post for a year or more.
Temporary workers everywhere should at least benefit, from the first day of their contract, from the same working conditions, pay and holiday entitlements as the staff employed by the company using the temporary workers.
However, certain amendments mean that temporary workers would not benefit from these same conditions until they had worked in the company for six weeks, six months or even 12 months.
This is intolerable!
We shall oppose all European directives and regulations endorsing the unacceptable policy of the employers aimed at worsening employment conditions as a whole and making jobs more insecure.
Mr President, all of us want to see less poverty and more social justice.
More jobs can provide both.
More employment laws like the atypical workers' directive will secure neither.
The Commission is trying to impose a straitjacket on something that cannot and does not need to be standardised.
My colleague, Mr Pronk, said a moment ago that he would like everyone to recognise that Member States organise temporary work in different ways.
That is absolutely right.
I too would like everyone to recognise that, and we want Member States to be able to continue to organise in different ways.
The very adjective 'atypical' in the name of this directive says it all.
Earlier in this debate Ms Attwooll said that Amendment No 71, for example, would guard against any adverse effects.
That is wishful thinking.
This amendment offers some help, but the improvements are marginal and all our temporary workers, recruitment agencies and client companies will be saying the same thing - that we are still left with a directive that could cost the UK alone 160 000 jobs.
I will address my final remarks to the Commissioner, even though she will probably never speak to me again.
Last week the press reported her as saying that the EU had created a net 12 million jobs over the last six years and that the EU' s rigid labour market was not the main problem facing Europe's economy.
It is very easy to say that there is no problem or that, if there is, then it is someone else's problem.
It is a problem for all of us, but you are, with respect, making it worse.
You are proposing the atypical workers' directive which, instead of promoting job flexibility, will help to kill it off.
This directive has little to do with protecting the rights of temporary workers, certainly in the UK where happily they already enjoy such protection.
It is notionally about protecting the jobs of permanent workers by making it more difficult for companies to employ temporary staff.
The Financial Times yesterday reported on the labour market problems in Germany, describing how reform is being resisted and vested interests are being protected, all under the guise of promoting social justice.
The Commission should have the guts to strip away this pretence and withdraw this directive.
To encourage it to do so, the UK Conservative delegation will vote against this report.
Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs van den Burg for an enormously well done job and the Commissioner for introducing this directive.
The kind of detailed work that is involved in this kind of directive is never adequately appreciated outside of this House.
Anyone who has watched the way in which Mrs van den Burg has worked on this directive will appreciate the enormous amount of commitment and expertise that had to be brought to it.
We are trying to balance flexibility with security for workers who, in many countries, still do not have any security at all.
We have been told here that national legislation already exists in Ireland to protect these workers.
That is not so.
We are told that it is best left to the Member States to deal with these matters.
The Irish experience will demonstrate that is not so.
There are close to 100 000 agency workers in Ireland.
The European Foundation for Living and Working Conditions, based in Dublin, published a study in May showing that there is no guarantee of equal treatment for agency workers in Ireland and that there is virtually no legal protection for agency workers at all in Ireland.
That is a study carried out by a foundation funded by the European Union.
It also points out that Ireland has failed to implement the 1991 Health and Safety Directive covering agency workers.
Incidentally, Ireland has also failed to implement the Part-time Workers Directive and is now seriously out of line with the rest of Europe on these issues.
So it is not a good idea to leave these matters in the hands of Member States - and certainly not a good idea to leave it in the hands of the current Irish Government, the ruling party of which Mr Crowley is a member.
I would challenge him to back up his statement in this House tonight that there is already adequate protection for Irish workers in this area.
There is not adequate protection.
There is none.
Mr President, the directive on temporary agency work marks an even more organised and methodological attack on the right to full, stable employment and social insurance.
It shows that the policy of flexible forms of work is alive and kicking, it exacerbates the exploitation of the workers and it confuses the fight of the workers' movement.
The fact that all this is happening with the assent of the compromised leaders of the trade union movement and the International Labour Organisation merely demonstrates their destructive role.
The claim that the directive safeguards and enhances the professional status of working victims, that it improves health and safety and that it increases employment is pure fraud.
The truth is that this is a well-organised attempt to step up exploitation and share out unemployment by creating modern slave-trade organisations.
Protecting full, stable employment with rights for everyone is always a vital objective but it will only be achieved by stepping up the fight against the monopolies and the anti-labour policy of the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the presentation of this document, as well as Mrs van den Burg on the efforts she has made to find a balance, and I am going to comment very briefly on three specific points.
Firstly, the purpose of temporary work agencies, as an instrument for flexibility in the labour market, which reconcile the aspirations of workers with the needs of companies.
I believe they are going to provide greater possibilities and opportunities for employment, for accessing the labour market.
Secondly, I would like to comment on the restrictions and prohibitions relating to the use of the temporary provision of workers and, from a doctrinal or theoretical point of view, I would like to say that, where there is permission for contracting workers on a temporary basis, there is no reason to prohibit the contracting of workers provided by agencies.
It must only be objective and duly justified - and therefore restrictive - criteria that regulate prohibitions.
Thirdly, I would like to stress the need for particularly intense action on the health and safety protection of workers during work and on the health and safety of workers provided by temporary employment agencies. There are various reasons for this: firstly, the temporary nature of the employment itself, which seems to increase risk; secondly, the diversity of the work to be carried out in the different contracting companies; and, perhaps, thirdly, the differing methods and procedures, even for a task or post of an identical nature in different companies.
I believe we should seek different arguments - for example, the voluntary requirement for non-discrimination - which could make a reference to health at work possible, as well as conditions in general and pay, in particular, without regulating them, but making this reference on the basis of support for the principle of non-discrimination.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am especially pleased to add to the words of thanks that have already been expressed to Mrs van den Burg and I would once again like to underline how important it is that we have this directive.
Some fellow MEPs have already said that the temporary sector is a very fast growing sector.
If we want to ensure that this sector delivers flexibility in the labour market, at the same time delivers quality jobs for the people who work in it and also does not put permanent recruitment under any pressure, then we need sound protection rules, at European level too.
Mr Pronk is right in saying that the systems and the regulations in the different Member States differ.
Moreover, some Member States offer considerable protection and this we may certainly not undo.
That is why the non-regression clause in the directive is so important.
There are, however, also very many Member States that do not offer good protection, Mrs De Rossa made full reference to this.
Nor is this a one-size-fits-all directive.
There is scope here for various national choices.
I would very briefly like to make three comments.
First of all, in connection with what Mr Hughes has just said, for us, it is crucial that temporary workers are protected from day one.
That was, Commissioner, a point that I found weak in the Commission's proposal.
You will therefore understand that it is absolutely unacceptable for us to agree to the Liberal amendment that excludes temporary work up to one year.
That would make the directive an empty shell.
Secondly, it is important that temporary workers enjoy good employment conditions.
I still think that equal treatment is best served by the principle by which, as far as essential employment conditions are concerned, a temporary worker is compared with workers of a user company.
However, then of course, we must also ensure that our definition of essential employment conditions is sound.
Such a definition without the concept of remuneration?
That takes the biscuit.
That would completely nullify the principle of equal treatment.
Thirdly, an exception to the principle of equal treatment is acceptable, but only where the systems concerned provide good guarantees internally in the temporary sector itself, also for the period between two contracts.
The countries where this is properly regulated usually guarantee contracts for an indefinite period of time or long contracts.
I should like to warn our fellow MEPs from the PPE-DE against stepping onto a slippery slope by reducing these guarantees too much.
Commissioner, just like you, I hope that we as legislators will be able to do what the social partners have been unable to do, that is to guarantee all temporary workers throughout the European Union solid social protection.
That will then definitely be to the credit of Mrs van den Burg too.
Mr President, in the last ten years, there has been a steady growth in temporary work in the European Union.
This rapid growth is justified because temporary work enables companies to respond better to the need to be flexible and to adapt to the economic climate.
The aims of the proposal we are discussing are:
to ensure that temporary work is a factor in creating jobs that encourage more stable and longer employment relationships;
to guarantee the rights and safety of temporary workers;
and to increase flexibility in the labour market.
The basic premise is to extend, at Community level, the principle of non-discrimination between temporary and other workers.
The guarantee of minimum rights will make this sector more attractive and give it a better reputation, bringing to an end the prejudice against it that still exists.
This report is balanced and represents a step forwards from the proposal for a directive presented by the Commission and I therefore thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from my own group for their contributions to it.
This balance is reflected particularly in the definition of minimum Community requirements, leaving it to the Member States and the social partners to adapt these to the specific situation in their respective countries.
Other issues have been taken into account and rightly so, such as the guarantee of basic protection, the opportunity for women to reconcile family life with professional life and the integration into the market of young people and individuals with fewer qualifications.
I should like to point out that, in Portugal, Article 4 is the provision that could cause the most problems: in fact, current national legislation contains a restrictive set of arrangements on this type of work in order to ensure that it is used only to serve employers' occasional needs.
Mr President, I would also like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work.
I would like to have seen the social partners at European level solving this issue, so that we would have been able to achieve a directive this way.
The employers did not want this, however.
That was the reason, Mr Crowley.
I therefore thank the Commission for the fact that a good proposal has been tabled.
This sector is becoming increasingly large, as many people have already pointed out. It is also a transboundary issue.
In addition, the issue concerns an atypical form of work, which is why it is appropriate for us to adopt a directive establishing minimum requirements, especially bearing in mind enlargement.
We must not create a Union only for capital - the Union must also be for its citizens.
That is actually what it is all about.
I heard Mrs Lynne say that this is also a problem for Sweden.
As a Swedish Social Democrat, I disagree.
This information must come from incorrect sources.
We have agreements in Sweden in this area, which will continue to be applicable in the future.
This is clear from Mrs van den Burg's proposal.
Naturally, the most important term of employment, pay, must be addressed.
This is a case of discrimination regarding pay.
This issue has already arisen in conjunction with the Part-time work Directive.
I also dislike the idea of a six-week period, for this would allow shorter assignments, which only encourages cheating.
The provisions should therefore apply from the first day.
I also do not in fact like the idea of transition periods, but I accept them as a political necessity in order to get this through.
Finally, I would like to say something about the members of the Swedish Moderate Party who will soon be speaking here.
They are increasingly allying themselves with the Eurosceptic Tory Party.
They talk all the time solely about the rights of companies and never about the rights of employees.
Company rights at European level and employee rights at national level - that paves the way for social dumping.
It is then no longer a matter of social cohesion. Instead, a society and a Europe of conflicts is created.
Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now suspend the sitting for two minutes, and then we will continue.
(The sitting was suspended at 11.06 p.m. and resumed at 11.08 p.m.)
Mr President, I regret that the concept of social dialogue has been jettisoned by the Commission with this directive.
With talks having broken down, it has run with the views of one side, namely the EU trade union, ETUC, and has largely ignored the EU employers' body, UNICE.
If social dialogue is to work, then there needs to be a more balanced approach to social measures, particularly in line with commitments on labour market flexibility in the context of the Lisbon competitive process.
The definition in Article 3 of a comparable worker will cause major difficulties, and by adopting a user comparison agency workers will find their conditions of employment varying depending on where they are assigned.
In Article 4 the inclusion of a limitation on the use of temporary work runs counter to employment policy at EU level and there is no economic or social justification for it.
It could even constitute gender discrimination.
In relation to Article 5, the reference to 'essential' employment conditions is unclear and has no precedent in EU law.
The Commission has departed from normal practice and the wording used in previous social dialogue agreements should be the template, rather than the views of only one social partner.
The same applies to Article 6 and the matters governed by points 6.2 and 6.3.
These should be left to the discretion of Member States.
Point 6.4 in Article 7 reflects a poor understanding of employment and commercial relationships.
The reference to 'sanctions' in Article 12 again departs from previous approaches and social dialogue agreements, and should be dealt with at Member State level, in line with national industrial relations practices.
It is inappropriate to include reference to pay as an aspect of basic working conditions, given the limitation imposed by Article 137(6) of the Treaty.
Six weeks is far too short a period to decide whether a temporary agency worker should be made permanent or not.
All workers have a probationary period.
Ireland is behind in transposing EU law in this area but we have true social dialogue and a comprehensive body of national law where there is a general qualifying period of 12 months' continuous service for entitlement to rights.
In conclusion, the approach of this directive is an example of where an idea in theory has not been thought through in practical terms, both from a temporary employee's perspective and that of an employer.
My congratulations to our rapporteur, to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities for their amendments.
We need them, without them this would be inoperable.
Mr President, this initiative by the Commission - and the Commissioner in particular - on a proposal for a directive to supplement the other two directives on atypical employment deserves our support, and Mrs van den Burg, who has tried to retain the spirit of the directive in the face of huge reaction, of course deserves our congratulations.
Mr Harbour has reminded me of our confrontation but I can assure him that our confrontations are always exciting.
Amendment No 87, part two, and more importantly Amendment No 86, should not be adopted because they abolish every safety valve accepted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
If they are accepted as they stand, workers will not in most cases receive the same wages as workers in the user company.
I do not know whether or not this was an oversight, but may I point out that our committee's Amendment No 40, which relates to Article 5, paragraph 2, stating that Member States shall take appropriate measures with a view to preventing misuse, is deleted under Amendment No 86.
Amendment No 87 gives Member States the right, wherever derogations are allowed, to pass laws allowing new derogations and, more to the point, the same working conditions as those which would apply to a comparable temporary agency worker.
Where is the balance between flexibility and balance and where is the protection for economic competition on the internal market?
Mr President, temporary work agencies are a necessary part of the flexible labour market of the future.
The recruitment difficulties of companies are solved to an increasing extent by taking on staff from temporary work agencies.
Immigrants often gain excellent opportunities to get a foothold in the labour market through these companies.
It is therefore important to encourage and facilitate the activities of temporary work agencies.
We have heard here that legislation regulating temporary work agencies varies greatly from Member State to Member State.
It is therefore difficult to create even framework legislation which takes into account all the differences.
The political starting points for the proposal for a directive are to view work done for temporary work agencies as a variation on temporary employment, and to prevent what has come to be known as social dumping.
The problems with framework legislation at European level are clear when one looks at Sweden.
Here, the political starting points are not reflected in the actual conditions.
In Sweden, permanent employment is the rule.
Around 70%of those employed through temporary work agencies are on permanent contracts.
Terms and conditions of employment are regulated by collective agreements for both permanent and temporary employees.
The salary of white-collar workers is set individually and separately, which means that no pay comparisons can be made.
Blue-collar workers have collective agreements guaranteeing that pay will not fall below the pay in the user undertaking and that the working hours of the user undertaking will apply.
This is not regulated in law, however, but through negotiations between the social partners, as should continue to happen in the future.
This is why we do not believe that pay should be included in the directive's definition of terms and conditions of employment.
Nor should comparisons of pay and terms and conditions of employment be regulated in the directive.
The temporary work agency sector functions well in Sweden and could be a model for Europe.
There you are, Mr Andersson.
However, the proposal before us does not facilitate development of this sector in Europe.
Europe needs more forms of employment, not fewer.
Mr President, Ms Attwooll said that the rapporteur had been inclusive in carrying out this report.
I would like to go further and say that strenuous efforts were made to understand the situation in some of the highest concentrations of agency workers anywhere in the European Union. For example, in my own region of London we have cleaners, nurses, IT specialists and now, crucially, manufacturing workers, many of whom Mr Harbour would have been referring to earlier.
The situation now is a classic contrast between flexibility and protection.
There is a need to understand the situation in countries where there is a less-developed temporary agency worker regulation.
That is why I welcome amendments like Amendment No 71, through the efforts of the rapporteurs and others to understand that situation.
We are not at extremes in this area.
We are in a situation where there is evidence that those vulnerable workers looking to us for protection require that protection and good agency employers require growth and flexibility.
It is a balance which should be struck.
We want to find that balance.
As Mr Hughes said, we are at the beginning of that process.
Let us shape a directive that strikes that vital balance.
Mr President, my sincere thanks go to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has done.
For many years now Europe has clearly not managed to fulfil its aim to become the world's most competitive economic area.
Unfortunately, this proposal for a directive on temporary agency work will take us even further away from our objective.
The Lisbon targets bind us to a more flexible labour market than before.
Increased bureaucracy and interference in contracts between companies will constrain the labour market.
Do we not want supply to meet demand?
Since the Treaty of Rome the EU has aspired to the creation of a dynamic Internal Market.
The Member States take care of the social consequences of that by taking account of the interests of employees in the way they themselves consider best.
This lies at the heart of the principle of subsidiarity.
It is not the EU's job to regulate sectors that do not require intervention at EU level.
For historical reasons there are big differences between the labour market systems in Member States.
One rigid solution in this sector will not suit everyone.
If things have not been dealt with properly in Ireland, it does not mean that this directive should be employed to complicate things in Finland, where they have.
This directive's implementation will clearly worsen the general situation regarding temporary agency work in Finland.
It would appear that, once again, no thorough cost-benefit analyses have been carried out.
The results will ultimately be reflected in growing unemployment and weakening competitiveness.
The committee's decision to allow employment agencies to receive reasonable costs, however, is an improvement on the poor proposal put forward by the Commission.
Refusing to pay such costs would lead to the work of the agencies discontinuing.
Temporary employment agencies offer a flexible solution in the way they fill vacancies promptly and speedily in sectors suffering from a shortage of manpower.
Under no circumstances should we make conditions worse for them.
Mr Crowley has a comment on procedure.
Mr President, Mr De Rossa mentioned me in particular and challenged me to an argument.
Rather than take up Parliament's time explaining how successful my party has been in government in creating employment and protecting workers' rights, I would like to invite him to discuss its merits and demerits over a drink.
That is a good suggestion!
Mr President, I should like to start with three general comments.
First, several honourable Members raised the question of subsidiarity.
There is a whole body of evidence on subsidiarity; I should just like to make one very important point.
At a time when national markets are fast turning into European markets and we are on the threshold of enlargement, highly diverse labour legislation and differing rights from one country to another are obviously creating distortions on the internal market.
So there is clearly a need, just as in all other sectors of labour legislation, for a common, flexible framework.
My second comment concerns whether we evaluated the repercussions of this directive.
May I remind you that this directive will apply to 1.5%-2% of workers in Europe.
But what is important politically is that this sector is mushrooming and workers' rights are being distorted left, right and centre, which is why we need to be pro-active and regulate it as quickly as possible within - I repeat - a general framework.
We have taken account and I would ask you to examine the study - available to any Member who is interested - which was carried out by the CIETT, the ConfÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale des Entreprises de Travail Temporaire.
The companies themselves clearly conclude in this study that employment legislation is needed in order to resolve the problems which generally arise on the questions of pay and working conditions and underpin the development of this sector, which has a very bad press in numerous countries.
There is a clear reference to the Netherlands and the Dutch model, a model which has managed to combine flexibility with social insurance and protection for workers in a country in which some of the biggest and most successful temporary employment agencies are to be found.
Serious concerns were expressed about the model getting tied up in red tape.
I would say they are completely unfounded.
The legislation does not introduce any new procedures for recruiting or transferring workers and each country keeps its present system.
Flexibility, at least as we interpret it in Europe, means a set of policies and practices to help the company, the worker, the public sector and the law to adapt to new production requirements.
Flexibility must not be interpreted as meaning fewer or no rights as a prerequisite to job creation.
Specific references were made to Great Britain, to the effect that jobs will be cut etc. All that will happen in that particular country is that there may be a small increase in labour costs due to the minimum social rights granted to workers on the British job market.
I should like if I may, Mr President, to comment on specific amendments in order to give the Commission's position.
There are two types of amendment.
The first type clarifies the proposal and adds a number of definitions.
The second type amends the proposal materially by adding or deleting certain important provisions.
As far as the first type is concerned, I welcome the proposed new title.
I think it conveys the objective of the directive much better.
I agree with the amendment designed to convey more fully the triangular relationship between worker, agency and user undertaking innate in temporary employment.
We support the amendments that redefine temporary agency work, the user company and the temporary work agency.
We also accept the amendments that clarify the text.
The definition proposed for the term 'assignment ' is far more accurate.
The new wording for the group of workers that Member States cannot exclude from the scope of the directive is a vast improvement.
I agree with the addendum specifying the means to be used to inform employees about any vacant posts in the user undertaking.
I also think it is helpful to state that agencies may receive a reasonable level of recompense for services provided to user undertakings but that agencies must not charge workers a fee if they enter into a permanent contract of employment with the user company at the end of their assignment.
I accept the amendment rewording the reference to social services more clearly.
I also welcome the reference to collective agreements and worker representation because worker representation can indeed be set out in collective agreements.
I agree with the amendment requiring the Member States to ensure that both workers and their representatives are equipped to press the provisions of the directive.
That brings me to material amendments to the directive, which add or delete certain important provisions.
I shall deal first with the amendments that are acceptable and then with the amendments that are not.
I agree with the amendment extending the scope for lifting restrictions and prohibitions on temporary agency work.
This scope was very restricted in the proposal for a directive, because it only applied to restrictions or prohibitions on certain groups of workers or certain sectors.
And of course, I accept the spirit of the amendment designed to ensure that temporary agency workers are not used to replace workers taking part in collective action such as strikes and so on.
I also think the principle of non-discrimination has been cleverly reworded; I think it is clearer and easier to focus on the working conditions which temporary workers would enjoy were they employed directly by the user company.
I can allow the exemption for permanent contracts to be restricted solely to pay but I cannot allow this derogation to be extended to fixed-term contracts.
Nor can I allow the 6-week period which allows temporary agency workers to be used in certain countries for a very short space of time for work of minor importance to be deleted.
This is a factor which will help significantly in the overall negotiations.
To summarise, I accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 22, 28, 33, 43, 46, 47, 48, 51, 52, 85 and 92 in full.
I accept Amendments Nos 6, 15, 16, 20, 23, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 40, 44 and 49 in part or in spirit, if they are reworded.
The remaining amendments are rejected.
I should like to thank you all for helping to bring about a new text which will facilitate the final acceptance of the directive, what is without doubt a politically and technically complicated directive.
May I again congratulate Mrs van den Burg and urge the Danish presidency to take whatever action is needed in order to reach agreement at the Council on 3 December.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0359/2002) by Mrs DamiÃ£o, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication on Life sciences and biotechnology - A Strategy for Europe (COM(2002) 27 - C5-0260/2002 - 2002/2123(COS)).
rapporteur. (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have been given the delicate task of presenting the report by Elisa DamiÃ£o, who is ill and therefore cannot be here today, although she has been lucid and clear-minded enough to follow every step of this report which quite rightly, therefore, bears her name.
I feel very moved to be presenting this report, I send my greetings to Mrs DamiÃ£o and hope that she is able to return to Parliament as soon as possible, because she is a person of enormous political and parliamentary ability, as well as being a great citizen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amazing progress that has been made in biology and in molecular genetics is fascinating and disturbing at the same time.
Scientific knowledge has moved ahead at such a pace that we are now in a position radically to change not only the vegetal and animal world, but also, eventually perhaps, our own species.
This represents a genuine sea change.
The abilities of science and technology have now largely gone beyond the fictions contained in literary masterpieces such as Huxley's 'Brave New World' or George Orwell's 'Nineteen Eighty-Four'.
Nevertheless, if the truth be told, the visions contained in those works, of societies and human beings oppressed and dehumanised by the manipulation of science and technology, have fortunately not been fulfilled.
The concern expressed by the broader public, however, with regard, for example, to genetically modified organisms and to cloning is a very clear sign, which the political, scientific and industrial world must heed.
An initial response was drawn up by UNESCO when, in November 1997, by consensus it adopted the universal declaration on the human genome and human rights.
However, of all the revolutions that have taken place in the realm of knowledge, that of molecular biology will, perhaps, be the greatest of all and it is genetics that will have the greatest implications in the economic, cultural and ethical spheres.
Biotechnologies are part of the technologies of the future.
The potential development of these gives us a glimpse of major changes in the coming years in the medicinal products, food, agriculture and environmental markets.
Nevertheless, these technologies, in their practical applications, raise ethical and philosophical questions that are now part of today's culture.
Given their implications, there will always be pessimistic souls, as has always happened throughout history and throughout the history of science and technology, who see apocalyptic threats to humanity, awakening age-old fears and trepidation.
We must combat those who exploit fears, ghosts and superstitions with a cautious but optimistic attitude towards science and realise that it must be inspired by high ethical standards and legal frameworks that, whilst encouraging intellectual freedom and scientific creativity, prevent excesses.
The classical humanism expressed in the famous phrase of the philosopher Seneca stated that 'man is sacred to mankind'.
This classical humanism must inspire contemporary science and all citizens.
The European Union has availed itself in recent years of a panoply of directives and regulations in the field of biotechnologies and science.
Nevertheless, the many legislative acts that have been adopted constitute a genuine rag-bag, lacking a coherent, global and systemic vision of this vast sector.
Some legislation that has been adopted has not been implemented and other legislation has been subject to derogations, moratoria and, even worse, numerous voids and grey areas.
The global battle in the field of biotechnologies is, nevertheless, crucial.
The United States clearly lead the field in this area.
Nevertheless, the Lisbon Summit outlined an ambitious target for the EU for the forthcoming decade: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world.
How will this aim be achieved without a strong European commitment to biotechnologies?
Europe is lagging behind the United States.
Although the European Union has 1570 undertakings operating in this field and the United States has 1263, the fact is that these undertakings in the European Union employ 61 000 workers who produce a volume of business of EUR 42 billion, whereas in this same sector in the United States 162 000 workers are employed, producing the equivalent of EUR 365 billion.
This is a summary, Mr President, of the cultural, political, legal and economic context into which the Commission communication fits. This is broadly supported by Mrs DamiÃ£o's report.
In fact, the action plan and the strategy presented by the Commission resolve, with one wave of a magic wand, the diffuse nature, the incoherence and the shortcomings of the legal framework and of European policies in the field of biotechnologies.
We will clearly not be able to achieve this with one wave of the wand, but they do point us in the right direction.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs DamiÃ£o, in her absence, and I agree with what Mr Lage has just said about a report that voices strong and clear support for the responsible development of life sciences and biotechnology in Europe.
I also warmly welcome the fact that the report has been produced on the basis of broad political agreement.
This report marks a very important step: biotechnology is the next wave of the knowledge-based economy and biotechnology research is crucial for strengthening European competitiveness in this field.
There is a growing realisation among Europeans that this technology is important for our future competitiveness and welfare.
A consensus is emerging on how we might strengthen its development in a manner consistent with our European values and ethical standards.
We are faced with a policy choice: either stand aside and see these technologies developed elsewhere, or exploit them ourselves in a responsible manner and to the benefit of European citizens.
As was made clear in the report that Mr Purvis submitted to Parliament last spring, biotechnology is an enabling technology.
It affects, or can even transform, broad areas such as healthcare, environmental protection, agriculture and food and industrial production processes.
It can be a source of innovation for new and established companies alike, and it offers unique approaches to finally solving problems, for example in the fields of healthcare and novel pharmaceuticals.
Europe cannot afford to miss out on the benefits biotechnology will bring.
Members of the European Commission under the leadership of President Prodi have worked together to provide a strategy that encompasses all the various applications of biotechnology, but also tries to enable us to come up with coherent answers to the more difficult questions and choices we are faced with.
The Commission's Communication on 'Life Sciences and Biotechnology: a strategy for Europe' builds upon the common knowledge base in life sciences and will lead to skills-based jobs that sustain the economies of the future.
We propose a number of actions for the promotion of biotechnology development in Europe, and at the same time, further measures for responsible governance, to ensure that this development takes place in accordance with our societal values and needs.
The Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, under the leadership of Commissioner Busquin, will provide substantial support for the supply of skilled resources and for overcoming the fragmentation of research and lack of critical mass.
We need to ensure that research results can be protected by means of harmonised intellectual property protection, and translated into commercial products and processes through effective innovation and technology transfer.
The strategy also stresses the need to overcome the previous fragmentation in the commercial development of biotechnology in Europe and several actions will contribute to linking up researchers, emerging companies, service providers and financial institutions.
The present downturn in the capital markets and the lack of risk capital needs particular and urgent attention.
The success of the biotechnology strategy will only be assured if the technology is built on a basis of societal trust.
It is vital for developments, and in particular public policy-making, to take place with a maximum of transparency.
We need to encourage public dialogue throughout Europe to ensure that societal goals are met and public concerns are addressed.
The strategy pursues the overarching goal of enhancing coherence between policies at the different levels. In this way, we can give proper, broad consideration to policy decisions that have an impact on our competitiveness and the future prosperity of our societies.
The Commission has started implementing measures in its own areas of responsibility.
We will shortly publish the first regular report on the stage reached in this implementation work.
However, this strategy will only work well if we all - European institutions, Member States, regions, industry, academia and civil society alike - now make commitments according to our respective responsibilities and resources.
The adoption of Parliament's report and the forthcoming Council conclusions will provide the essential political backing for the effective implementation of the strategy at European level.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I greatly welcome the Commission's objective of again giving the EU a leading role in the field of life sciences and biotechnology.
However, the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations.
I would therefore like to thank Mrs DamiÃ£o very much for her comprehensive report which clarifies the Commission's strategy document in many respects.
Europe must take on a pro-active role once again if it is not to lose ground in this sophisticated area of technology.
This applies especially to 'green' genetic engineering - in other words, to agriculture.
A prerequisite is the establishment of an effective, predictable and stable legal framework, both for agriculture and for the biotech industry in Europe.
This framework must comply, in particular, with WTO rules and safeguard the coexistence of all forms of agricultural production.
The removal of the de facto moratorium for product approvals is the precondition for more planning security for companies and the agricultural sector.
The moratorium is especially harmful to innovative SMEs in Europe and conflicts with the Lisbon objectives.
Within the Commission, and within the European institutions, a targeted European policy to promote a 'B-Europe' policy must be promoted.
Based on the successful concept of eEurope, these same priorities could be pursued on an overarching basis by several of the Commission's Directorates-General.
Further key points include: support for the development of bioclusters and other models for technological transfer, easier access to risk capital, especially for start-ups and SMEs in biotech research, the introduction of a European patent, and a transparent and scientifically based information policy on the part of the authorities, companies and the scientific establishment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to send Mrs DamiÃ£o my best wishes for her continued recovery.
I would like to express my thanks to her and her colleagues, but also to Mr Lage, for their excellent cooperation.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports the DamiÃ£o report, not least because the whole thing - the action plan and the report - is based on a report by our fellow Member, John Purvis.
The DamiÃ£o report sends out a positive signal for biotechnology, but it also makes clear where we need better rules than currently exist.
The report deliberately does not paint a 'black and white' picture.
There is, after all, a view that genetic technology may be very positive in healthcare, but must be rejected at all costs in agriculture.
The report rejects this position.
We state quite clearly that there are opportunities in both sectors; in other words, there are opportunities in agriculture as well.
Indeed, the report says that genetic technology can contribute towards finding genuine solutions to sustainable development, and I would like to emphasise this point.
This is why we are opposed to the de facto moratorium.
The Directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment was adopted a long time ago. The Member States should have implemented it in national law by October.
I sat on the Conciliation Committee with David Bowe at the time, and I never dreamed that so many years later, this de facto moratorium would still be in place.
The report says that it must end by 2003.
I believe that it should actually end now, because the deadline for the implementation of Directive 220/90 has already passed.
Otherwise, SMEs in particular will suffer considerably, as Mrs MÃŒller has already said.
Just as there are not only risks but also major benefits in the agricultural sector, there are not only benefits, but also major risks, in the medical field.
We see a danger, for example, in the uncontrolled use of DNA testing.
DNA tests are not services like any other.
They may only be carried out after competent, expert, independent and individual counselling, and this counselling must cover medical, ethical, social, psychological and legal aspects.
A year ago, our group commissioned an expert report on this issue.
This report says that the European Union has competence in this area.
Offering DNA testing is either a cross-border service, or DNA tests are products traded in the internal market.
This is why we need standards in this area, quality standards and standards relating, for example, to counselling.
The Commission has a task here, and I ask the Commission to do what the report says, namely to initiate legislation.
Mr President, I fully endorse the previous speakers' comments, and I assume that there will be a majority in favour of the DamiÃ£o report tomorrow.
There are many reasons for this.
The Commissioner is absolutely right to describe biotechnology as the undoubted key to the future. Some have grasped this already; others will take longer to do so, but it is undoubtedly the case.
Mr Liese is absolutely right: biotechnology will also help us find solutions for sustainable development.
I would like to add an explanation here, for biotechnology does not work with 'classical' thermodynamics, but with irreversible thermodynamics; in other words, it works with very small potential differences to produce a very substantial impact.
Otherwise, we would not grow old, but would leave this mortal coil at the age of 15.
In other words, biotechnology has many benefits, and this is widely recognised.
Indeed, 'red' biotechnology is already recognised by large sections of the Green Party today.
The problem is this: how do we deal with green biotechnology?
This may also have to do with the fact that many people in Europe say that they do not need it; they say they have enough to eat, and the problem is distribution, not new products.
There is a very different view in the developing countries, however.
For example, if I have a product which can be produced using a minimum amount of water, or have a species of rice which contains specific vitamins, this is a matter of survival for many people in the developing countries.
It does not matter to us, because we can buy other products with our large amounts of money.
What does this mean in practice? It means that the development of biotechnology, including green biotechnology, in Europe could help many other people.
Let me clear up one misunderstanding at this point, which has also played a role in our own group.
It has been claimed that we aim to combat hunger in the world with biotechnology.
This is not what is said here.
What we say is that biotechnology alone cannot defeat hunger in the world, and that other measures, such as better distribution of the food available, are far more important.
That is what it says here.
Let me clear up this misunderstanding from the outset.
However, biotechnology can make its contribution to reducing hunger in the world.
Let me conclude with one further comment: our conflict here in this House is not that we will reject the DamiÃ£o report tomorrow, but that we will vote differently during the legislative process.
This is why I call on everyone to conduct a much more far-reaching dialogue here in this House, and with the Commission, on these issues.
Otherwise we will continue to live with this dichotomy, which we are finding so difficult to cope with.
Indeed, Mrs DamiÃ£o's report is warmly supported by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.
There are two points I should like to make.
The climate in the European Union, the business climate, and also ethics and environment.
Despite being a key technology, biotechnology is still a poor relation in Europe and also in my own country the Netherlands.
I therefore welcome the strategy of the Committee for biotechnology and life sciences, which is contributing to research and development in Europe.
Not only for industry, but also with regard to health care and food safety.
This does not, however, alter the fact that the committee has been overtaken by events.
After all, did we not, in March 2000, adopt the Purvis report whose intention was to improve the business climate in Europe?
Did we not also criticise the Member States over the moratorium on the import of genetically modified products?
There is still much to be done in Europe in terms of access to launch capital and to patent rights to create a favourable climate.
The patent directive for biotechnological inventions is a demonstrable improvement.
This directive from 1998, however, has simply been ignored by the majority of Member States.
It has only been implemented by four of the 15 Member States.
What does the Commissioner intend to do about it?
Another major obstacle to progress and application are the ethical and environmental concerns.
It is of course entirely proper that we as legislators do not ignore these concerns of the consumer.
The Commission's action plan, however, already provides for the initiation of a social debate.
It does not therefore seem necessary to me to strengthen this report with paragraphs that regulate communication with society in detail.
We do not, after all, have to hold the consumer's hand.
The consumer is perfectly capable of making up his own mind if we provide the right information.
Mr President, I should like to send my greetings to Mrs DamiÃ£o in her absence and to wish her a speedy recovery.
I disagree, however, with her report, which her colleague Carlos Lage, has presented to us: it should be noted that this report transcribes in their entirety the positions and interests of the huge biotechnology, agro-chemical and agro-industrial multinationals, as can be seen if we compare the report with the position of UNICE.
We call for the de facto moratorium that has been in place since 1998 for the approval of new genetically modified organisms in the food chain to be maintained and we totally reject the report's support for lifting the moratorium, which we feel would be a real environmental crime.
Apart from the profound ethical and human rights questions about the commercialisation and patenting of life and natural heritage, we must understand that releasing GMOs into the environment is an irreversible and uncontrollable factor which has direct consequences on the pollution of both conventional and organic farming, and for the destruction of biodiversity. It also has incalculable effects on ecosystems.
What this means is that organic farmers and consumers will not actually see this much vaunted but fictional freedom of choice.
Furthermore, it reinforces the dependency of farmers and of Member States' food policies on the multinationals.
The degree of interference and pressure exerted on developing countries to introduce GMOs into their food chain is shocking.
It is truly mystifying and unacceptable that, once again, the idea is being aired that food shortages and world hunger can have a technological solution when the issue - as has been stressed in many international fora and organisations - is a political one and is a matter of policy.
We only need think back to the much-feted 'green revolution' of a few decades ago.
We are committed to promoting the scientific and technological progress of mankind, but we must always respect the precautionary principle.
Mr President, we increasingly see that when biotechnology is referred to, genetic technology is actually what is meant, but this is not stated clearly.
For more than 20 years, promises have been made which have then been broken in practice.
Genetically modified foods and agricultural products are a flop.
The consumers do not want them.
In the field of medicine, it is imitation products, above all, which are manufactured in a slightly modified production process so that patents can be obtained and phenomenal prices achieved, with the health insurance funds being ripped off as a result.
I often wonder why we have been discussing these key technologies here for so many years and why these supposedly key technologies do not succeed in the marketplace.
Where is the market, in reality?
Biotech companies are complete flops on the stock exchange.
We have no products which are successful and are accepted in the market.
We have simply been 'talking up' this genetic technology for years.
Let me come to my real point.
For us, it is completely unacceptable to remove the de facto moratorium, as very few of the Member States have actually implemented the directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment.
I also find what is happening here quite unacceptable.
We have the Scheele report, and we have held a debate on the de facto moratorium.
We also discussed the Fiori report in very wide and detailed terms, and it was made very clear that we do not want any patenting of human genes.
The current report demands the very opposite.
There is an obvious reluctance to accept the implementation of what has been called for, for a long time, in the other committees.
I think this is farcical and quite unacceptable.
I think we must recognise that we need absolute transparency for consumers, as well as safe foods.
Then no one can claim that we are prepared to put the interests of industry ahead of consumer protection simply to push these products on to the market.
With this in mind, I would like to state quite clearly, once again, that much of what is written here does not have our support.
Nonetheless, I think it is quite good, and ask you to support our Amendments Nos 26 and 27, which make it clear that coexistence is very important in agriculture, and that the sustainable co-existence of conventional and organic farming should be ensured.
The Commission calls for this as well.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although Mrs DamiÃ£o's report needs some modification, it is an excellent report.
While highlighting the constraints on the development of biotechnology and life sciences, it demonstrates their role and importance to our society in a pertinent manner.
It is fully in line with the approaches and strategies defined at the Lisbon European Council.
Biotechnology and life sciences are undoubtedly key in building a more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy.
This report also throws all its weight behind the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development, a programme I strongly support.
Biotechnology will bring a new and broader dimension to the economy in future. It has implications for farming, nutrition, the environment, and, of course, medicine and the treatment of illness.
Biotechnology also has implications for our competitiveness and the development of employment, increasing both the quantity and quality of jobs. However, this does not mean that a free rein should be given to research in this area.
Biotechnology cannot be allowed to dominate over everything else.
We are faced with an extraordinarily rich scientific field, many areas of which are still unknown and have yet to be exploited.
There are two aspects to this area of science, but one of them does not always present what is best for mankind and the well-being of our societies.
We must be wary of the sorcerer's apprentice.
Life sciences should be supported and encouraged, but they must be regulated.
Life sciences must only be allowed to grow and expand within the bounds of strict regulations, all of which should prioritise the principles of public health, prevention, precaution and the respect for human life and dignity.
I am sure you understand that I have in mind the problems posed by GMOs and research on human embryos.
I am therefore pleased to see that the report reflects these concerns and I also commend the work of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy to establish better regulations on research and to improve information given to the consumer.
In this spirit, we must do everything possible to improve the financing of companies in this sector and to allow them access to risk capital.
These companies are generally very young, often small, and therefore vulnerable.
We must also encourage the development of researchers in our universities and facilitate their laboratory work within the spirit of the European Charter for Small Enterprises.
Research forms the basis of our future competitiveness.
We must also remember, however, we cannot have science without awareness.
All sciences worthy of the name must be aware of their role in society.
Biotechnology is certainly the key to a new society, which, if we manage it well, will be more just and more equitable.
Finally, I would like to comment on how this affects developing countries.
Although we act to combat hunger, poverty and disease, which are all holding back development in these countries, we do not have the right to impose a scientific model or a way of thinking on any country.
We need to uphold the principle of respect for others.
Therefore we cannot consider imposing science and technology as a means of development.
It is up to each individual to choose how they want to feed themselves and what standards they want to live by.
Ladies and gentlemen, biotechnology is the third technological revolution for our society, following the industrial revolution and the information revolution.
I fervently hope that will rise to this splendid challenge, and that, in the interests of Europe's reputation and of our children's future, we act with respect for basic ethical standards and human dignity at all times.
Mr President, firstly I too would like to wish Mrs DamiÃ£o a speedy recovery and sincerely congratulate her for an excellent report. It will add to the encouragement which the biotechnology sector needs in order to realise its potential in my Scottish constituency and throughout Europe.
The thrust of this report is fully in line with the Lisbon Summit objectives and continues the forward-looking attitude consistently demonstrated by Parliament.
It should also serve to bolster the Commission's new-found courage as regards biotechnology and the life sciences.
But how dreadful the contrast with the Council of Ministers who yet again this week demonstrated their abject failure to follow through on the goals they set at Lisbon.
The grossly mistitled 'Competitiveness Council' could not reach consensus about the proper jurisdiction for Community patent disputes.
What hope is there of achieving Europe's potential in this area when the Council is at least one year behind the deadline it set itself for agreement on this vital matter?
Without a cost-efficient means of patenting intellectual property rights, what incentive is there for our scientists?
This is only one example of the chronic foot-dragging we see endlessly in the Council and by individual Member States.
Moratoria, legal uncertainty, backtracking and dithering over ethical guidelines, transposition delays, lack of support for those going about their legal business with field trials, elaborate red tape for labelling and traceability.
Mrs DamiÃ£o, thank you for giving us hope that there is real hope in Europe for biotechnology and the life sciences.
Mr President, the future presents both threats and opportunities.
Biotechnology and life sciences are areas which arouse both fear and enthusiasm.
There is good reason not to rush into believing that these offer solutions to all the problems we see before us.
At the same time, we should not be frightened simply because we do not have the answers to all the questions.
The Union has highlighted life sciences as an area which will help to make Europe the most knowledge-based and competitive economy.
Used correctly, biotechnology can offer solutions to many of the problems we will all face.
In order to counter the threats to the environment, we need not only restrictions in our lives but also new discoveries which can help us tackle the threats to the environment technically, mechanically and biologically.
In this context, biotechnology offers many opportunities.
The fight against poverty and famine in the developing countries requires various initiatives in order to succeed.
We should not overestimate biotechnology, but nor should we underestimate it.
Crops which tolerate different temperatures and levels of drought and rainfall may help to ensure that there is food in areas which currently experience famine.
A society which seeks to develop prosperity and justice, and which wants more and more people to be able to live in acceptable environments must ensure economic growth.
Many mature industries are failing today, which means we need new ones.
Biotechnology is one such and one of the most promising.
Let us within the Community invest common resources in order to continue developing together and moving forward.
It is not enough to state that we have to be successful, we must also act.
This involves adopting Mrs DamiÃ£o's report - positive action which bodes well for the future.
Mr President, you do not have to be an implacable opponent of GMOs - and I am not - to challenge the undiluted advocacy of them in this report.
Many Liberal Democrats will be challenging the report in the vote tomorrow.
We want to see a reduction in the use of pesticides and herbicides.
We want to see insects and wild plants flourish in our countryside.
We want sustainable agriculture in developing nations.
But we need to know that the proposed solution is not the cause of even greater problems.
We hear claims from the manufacturers, intent as they are with stuffing their pockets with gold and making sure that farmers across the globe are locked into their supply chain.
But where is the scientific evidence about the medium- and long-term effects of GM crops upon biodiversity?
Who is going to compensate organic producers whose crops become contaminated and lose their value?
We need answers to these questions before we open the floodgates.
The jury is still out regarding GM crops and, given the irreversible nature of these decisions, there is no sound basis for making claims that biotechnology will be the answer to all our problems.
The debate is closed.
. (FR) I am hoping and praying for a united, peaceful Europe.
I am therefore in favour of enlarging the Union to include all the current candidate countries, including Turkey.
I abstained, however, from voting on the Brok report, because I believe that enlargement as envisaged by the report is taking place under very poor conditions.
Neither the current Union nor the candidate countries are really ready.
We all agree that the Treaty of Nice has not provided the Union with the necessary structures to operate properly with 25, 27 or 28 Member States.
The Convention, which should be perfecting these structures, is giving packaging priority over content.
