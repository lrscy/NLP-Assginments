The Bali Action Plan, the Bali Roadmap and the Adaptation Fund are challenges where the European Union must take the lead.
After all, we need to admit that we have a certain degree of responsibility for the current state of climate change.
It is logical that the developed and developing countries' targets will differ.
China and India should receive a specifically set compensation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
I am afraid, however, that unless the US starts taking this issue seriously our efforts will be in vain.
The Bali Conference is not a successor to the Kyoto Protocol.
Let us hope, however, that it will act as a stimulus for solving this issue.
In particular, Mr Barroso, I welcome the second principle: fairness and recognising Member States' different starting points and different capacities to invest.
Thank you again.
(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, you will be aware that I am very attached to the economy, the environment and our common policy.
You went a little further today in developing the vision outlined by Angela Merkel and the Heads of State or Government.
The vision they set out last spring was perfectly apt.
It came at the right time.
Now, however, it has to be fleshed out, and in that respect you have not let the whole cat out of the bag.
I have not heard too many figures today.
I should like to hear some of those, because we want to solve this problem together with the interested parties, not in spite of them.
The programmes you have presented over the past fortnight, along with today's programme, will drastically alter Europe's economic and industrial policies.
It is for that very reason that I believe we need far more shoulders and must not rely solely on the main pillars.
I must confess to a degree of disappointment, Mr Dimas, that waste-management policy, and particularly waste-disposal policy, does not play much of a part in this programme.
In Europe we could reduce CO2 emissions by millions of tons for the benefit of our major export industries if only we were courageous enough.
Have we not all learned in the last two years that we are facing far more than a climate problem?
In future we shall have a resource problem.
Our children will ask us awkward questions, Commissioner, Mr President, if we do not adopt a bolder approach.
We must, of course, play fair by companies and environmental organisations, and I strongly endorse the five priorities you have set.
We cannot put our exporting companies into a straitjacket yet expect them to outperform their competitors.
That is not possible.
We have to get on with what needs to be done - to get butter on the fish, as we say in my dialect.
As far as the emissions-trading system is concerned, it is, when all is said and done, the best-known and the time-tested system.
We must learn from our mistakes, but we must keep it tight.
We shall be doing no one any favours if we concede too much.
It must be tight, and it must be fair.
Then I shall be right behind you.
The European Union should not be so terribly afraid of the subject of climate change.
We should take it as an opportunity, an opportunity for our environment, for our industry and, in particular, for future generations.
(Applause)
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would emphasise the significance of the fact that you, Mr President, decided to come and inform us in real time about the adoption of the package that has been so painstakingly put together; one might even say made to measure.
Let us not forget that this package goes hand-in-hand with another decision that you adopted in December: I mean the proposal for a regulation on vehicles, which in a sense forms part of this package.
I shall not comment on the content of the package itself, since I have the bad habit of judging texts once I am familiar with them and have examined and assessed all their details.
We shall attempt to find out whether you have struck the right balance, or whether there is a need for any further fine-tuning or improvement.
On the whole, it seems to me that the set of proposals corresponds to the principles and objectives suggested by both Parliament and the Council in recent months.
I would however raise one political point - already alluded to by Mr Musacchio - which affects all of us.
I agree with his verdict on Bali.
The glass is neither half full nor half empty, but it was a major political success.
Just three months earlier, no one would have bet even a cent on it.
The EU confirmed its world leadership role on that occasion, yet its responsibilities have thereby been heightened.
Our responsibilities have increased: we cannot go to Poznan and then Copenhagen with empty hands.
We must go with facts.
You have played your part by drawing up this package, but now it is up to the legislators - Parliament and the Council - to adopt it and translate it into binding standards.
That will be no easy matter in the short time available to us.
This legislative period has entered its final phase, rather as CO2 emissions should do in 2015, when they ought to peak before starting to fall, that is.
We have already reached that ceiling.
As a result, there needs to be some kind of informal agreement, a special working procedure, to ensure that most of this package is wrapped up before the end of the parliamentary term; otherwise we will be empty-handed when it comes to negotiating the Bali follow-up phases.
This therefore affects Parliament, which must play its part by avoiding wherever possible conflicts of competence which waste months.
It also affects the Council, which - as has happened in other cases - could embark on informal cooperation with us at a very early stage.
However, it also affects you: you came along a little late today because you evidently had matters to discuss.
If other dossiers that I have been involved in are anything to go by, it would be a good thing if the Commission could present a united front towards the outside world.
Madam President, finally, we move from targets to tools!
I agree that this can be wisely managed - a win-win situation, where we can create a better environment, better opportunities for our children and more jobs in Europe.
But it needs coherence in our management of different political areas - research policy, development aid, the common agricultural policy, energy policy and so on - and the first test of this will be at the spring summit with the Lisbon Agenda.
Will the Lisbon Agenda at the Council in March reflect the energy and climate package?
That will be the first great test.
There is also another test.
We have only 13 months to bring along the decisions on this very important - maybe the most important - proposal: this mandate for the European Parliament, and the Commission, and the Council.
Thirteen months to be able to deliver a European standpoint before the European elections and before the extremely important meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009.
We all know that it is really important, we all know that it is imperative that we get there, and it is up to all of us individually to make it possible - and not impossible - to get a decision in April so that, unlike in the old Danish fairy tale, the Emperor does not stand naked when he goes to Copenhagen!
We also have to address energy poverty - it is not there enough - technology neutrality and the forestry issues, which have to be improved.
This will be delivered, I think, in the parliamentary procedure in a very transparent and open way, as it is in Parliament.
Finally, from tools to targets: it is our responsibility, and the ALDE Group will stand by you when it comes to a decision and deliver value for voters - finally!
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has changed tack on two counts as concerns the energy and climate package, which unfortunately we know little about: keeping to the Kyoto pledges, and improving Europe's energy mix and supply.
We particularly welcome the commitments to promoting the spread of renewable energies, greater flexibility in the authorisation of State aid for environmental actions, and the development of clean sources and technologies to curb emissions.
However, the package contains some sensitive issues relating to the competitiveness of our firms.
Mr Barroso himself has estimated the cost at some â¬60 billion.
We will have to look at the impact of this burden.
The plan for a system of auctioning quotas, estimated to cost around â¬39 per tonne of CO2, and for its extension to the transport and building sectors, is causing industry quite some concern and will probably affect final consumers.
Given these gloomy forecasts, the Commission and especially the Member States will have to do their utmost to reduce the economic and social impact of the measures.
I would stress that Europe's role as world leader in the struggle against climate change is unquestioned and unquestionable.
We must bear in mind, however, that our international competitors in many cutting-edge sectors of the economy take the opposite view.
To conclude, I agree with what President Barroso has said.
We certainly must work hard to determine commitments and outcomes and give greater weight to the package presented to us.
The package must not remain virtual but must be fair.
Madam President, this Parliament has a vision of 21 different renewable energy technologies for the 21st century.
With what the Commission is proposing today, we are taking a first step - 20% in 2020 - towards a Europe which will be run almost entirely and exclusively by renewables at the end of this century.
This is millions of jobs for Europe; this is technology leadership; this is CO2 reduction, less dependency on gas and oil imports, more competition in an energy market which is dominated by the happy few and, therefore, I thank Mr Piebalgs for not having given in to the electricity lobby by killing the guaranteed price systems, because it is only guaranteed price systems that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in this market.
Biofuels at 10% is a target which was imposed on policy by car makers and the sugar industry.
You did not have the courage to drop it.
We will have the courage.
Lastly, I have a precise question for the Commission.
We, as Greens, are in favour of protecting European industry against environmental dumping, but, Mr Barroso, there is a contradiction in what you have announced.
If the European energy-intensive industry gets the allowances completely for free, how can you justify the fact that the Chinese steel company will have to pay for imports?
If our industry is completely off the hook, the WTO will never accept a scheme whereby those who import to our markets have to pay, so there is a fundamental contradiction in what you have announced, or at least you have to clarify this because, otherwise, you are cheating people.
(FI) Madam President, Commissioners, I agree with those speakers who have thanked the Commission for their good intentions.
Nevertheless, we will come to learn that the devil is in the detail.
With emissions trading, the price of emission rights in the EU's wholesale electricity markets will shift towards the price of nuclear and hydroelectric power, the production of which does not require emission rights.
The auctioning of emission rights will not bite into these windfall profits, and in fact in the longer term it will increase the additional, excessively large profits of these electricity companies.
Emissions trading favours the extension of nuclear power.
Hopefully, the Commission has stuck to the view presented by Mr Piebalgs, that nuclear power is not a renewable form of energy.
For the time being, it is impossible to say whether the package that has been presented is well-balanced among the Member States.
The requirement to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the EU to an average of 20% may put the small countries, in which this percentage is already exceeded, and large countries, where it is currently 2-6%, in unequal positions.
Madam President, nowadays, when the subject of climate change crops up, it is usually described as 'global warming'.
Is this deliberate?
The only solution being put forward is to cut greenhouse gas emissions - that is, carbon dioxide - dramatically, because it is claimed that a 30% reduction will reduce the average temperature of the earth by 2Â° by 2020.
Such an assertion is quite amazing when no reference to the effect the sun will have had over that period is taken into account, but, for the sake of this exercise, let us suppose that the so-called 'taxpayer-funded experts' are right.
Climate change is precisely that: climate changes all the time.
So, what if earth's climate decides to cool down instead of warm up?
Will it then be suggested that we must produce much more carbon dioxide to try and offset the cooling?
Of course not.
They are so committed to their present 'global warming' prediction, that that would not be an option, but, sadly, it looks as if that is what is happening.
For the last nine years since 1998, global temperature on earth has remained the same.
For the past decade the world has not warmed.
Global warming has stopped.
That is not a viewpoint or a sceptic's inaccuracy, it is an observational fact.
It is also a scientific fact that far more people die from being too cold than from being too warm.
So, to sum up, if global warming has been just a temporary blip, and we are now heading relentlessly for the next ice age, any reductions in CO2 emissions will have precisely the opposite asserted effect to that which is intended.
In the billions of years of earth's existence, a very brief pause to check the facts is surely not too much to ask.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned that the target to reduce the European production of CO2 emissions by one fifth in the next 12 years is an unattainable dream.
Since 1990 we have not even succeeded in cutting it down by the 5% quota agreed in Kyoto.
Let us take off the populist glasses and instead focus on the reality as described by scientists and experienced by citizens.
Biofuels do not resolve the energy situation.
On the contrary, biofuels cause food price increases, are responsible for water reserve problems and, due to deforestation, are themselves responsible for increasing concentration of the much detested CO2.
They are simply a step in the wrong direction.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that we should concentrate on nuclear energy and rid ourselves of the fear of chain reactors.
Reasonable governments such as the Finnish or British Governments have already begun to do so.
Scientific findings show that nuclear energy does not produce CO2 and minimises further climate change.
At the same time it is cheap, reliable, secure and it lowers countries' dependence on fossil fuels supplied by unstable territories.
If we want to act in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, we should invest precisely in the field of atomic research, development and education.
Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Commission and its President on the presentation and the proposal here and to welcome it.
I come from a country where we have proved those goals are achievable - although we do not have very much sun anyway - but it is possible to achieve those goals.
And now we are, as has been said today, making the overall goals into concrete actions and measures - that is good.
I have three points.
First, competitiveness needs sustainability - but sustainability needs competitiveness.
If we are to be a competitive economy in the future, we need to have competitive energy sources, and that also goes for the renewables.
We need to have competition between different renewables, not a regulated economy with subsidies for different renewables.
We need to have fair and open competition, because then we will see the second and third generation of renewables emerge, and we will have good use of them.
The second point is that high charges for some countries must not lead to less responsibility for other countries.
I must say on that point I feel a little bit uncomfortable because, maybe, some countries are getting away a little bit too easily.
We need to underline this because everyone needs to make those efforts.
Thirdly, this is about renewables, but I would still like to underline the importance of nuclear power, not because I look upon nuclear power as one of the renewables, but it is my belief that, if we are to take full advantage and make full use of renewables, we must not get into a situation where the phasing-out of nuclear power consumes the achievements we can make in the fight against carbon dioxide emissions.
We need both of them, and they will support each other.
Those are my three points today.
I welcome the proposal and presentation, and wish us all good luck.
(FI) Madam President, Mr Barroso, renewable energy sources are not only a cost but also a process that creates jobs, innovation and competitive ability.
This is a fact.
Nevertheless, the Commission has not taken sufficient account of employment, and this is a central problem.
What benefit is there if energy-intensive industry and the cleanest industry move to countries where there are no emission limits?
We must get more industrialised countries on board, and it is your duty to take care of this.
As with the telecommunications sector, so with emissions trading has it been the case that those who have achieved the target level are being punished, just as Mr HÃ¶kmark said.
At the same time, we are looking through our fingers at those who cannot be bothered to achieve the objectives in time or to make any joint decisions.
No continuous progress can be made in this way.
The Commission has not taken account of the starting level, the energy intensity and efficiency of the economy, the role of zero emissions, and so on.
These are important factors.
But, to close, I would say that cost-effectiveness is achieved through innovation, and it does not appear in the budgets of the Member States or of the Commission.
It really ought to appear as a means of getting out of this situation.
Madam President, no one ever said that meeting the challenge of global warming would be easy, but I am glad that the European Union here is taking the lead in trying to turn aspirations into practical policies.
Numbers have been thrown about in an almost casual fashion - a lot of 20s by 2020 - and conjuring up these figures is easy, but the hard part is reaching the targets which are now being set.
In my country, the United Kingdom, for instance, I am very conscious that it is going to take quite a dramatic change of direction and a very rough gear change to meet these targets.
I think this new policy direction is long overdue, but I am conscious of the difficulties and the realities before us.
I have two principal fears.
The first is that governments will sign the pledge but fail to deliver, so I want to know how we are going to build in some sort of interim targets, some penalty structure, to ensure that the promises are delivered at the end of the day.
My second fear is that, in trying to do good, we will do some harm.
My biggest concern here is over biofuels.
I hear the comments of the Energy Commissioner, but the idea that we could risk tropical forest destruction and force up world food prices in order to featherbed our car manufacturers is, frankly, sickening, and we must be very cautious indeed about the sustainability criteria.
I do have concerns about the direction of our own budget.
We promote schemes that stimulate CO2 emissions and it seems to me that we have to run faster just to catch up with ourselves.
There are fine judgments to be made on many of these issues, but I know we are all working together towards a common purpose.
This package of measures will promote innovation, stimulate investment and create millions of jobs.
It must be seen not as a threat but as an opportunity for us all.
(LV) Thank you, Madam President.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for having initiated a debate on this important issue.
Even though including emissions reductions and increased renewable resources in one document is logical in formal terms, I believe that it artificially increases political pressure on each task and robs the debates of clarity.
I will therefore speak only about the issue of renewable resources.
In the European Union there is currently a significant number of countries with positive results in this field.
The relevant national governments must decide between the challenges of security of supply, economic competitiveness and climate protection.
At the moment security of energy supply has taken on a particular importance, since oil and gas prices and security of oil and gas supplies are making the latter particularly fragile.
There is no reason to believe that the EU Member States are unaware of this.
While the establishment of common EU targets for an increased proportion of renewable resources is welcome, I do not believe that setting these at Member State level is something that we should embark on at present.
It should be done following an evaluation of the specific circumstances of the Member States and local governments, taking into account not only economic factors but also social and cultural factors.
It is particularly ironic that states who have already achieved a great deal in this area are being given additional ambitious tasks.
I do not wish to underestimate the role of the European institutions, as they can add considerable value, such as in the area of liberalising gas and electricity, but renewable energy production should remain a national issue, since it is in the Member States that the majority of these issues have for a long time now been understood.
(DE) Madam President, as long as energy-hungry emerging economies and energy-wasting industrialised nations do not turn more of their attention to the environment, all the efforts of the EU will not even suffice to make good the damage those countries have done.
I also question the success of certificate trading with its covert development aid, which certainly will not reduce the total volume of emissions but might redistribute it at best.
Austria has been the only certificate purchaser to date, spending EUR 280 million on certificates, compared with the mere EUR 20 million it invests annually in renewables.
I therefore believe that, instead of using energy concerns as a pretext for accelerating Turkey's accession to the EU, it would make more sense to rethink the Union's relations with Russia in the light of the energy situation.
The EU has numerous tasks on its energy agenda, not least the long-overdue application of fully developed forms of environment-friendly propulsion and energy technology, the elimination of water wastage, the abolition of support for transcontinental transport operations and increased pressure on the main agents of climate change.
Madam President, I welcome this package in principle, but we must recognise that renewables and efficiency gains are a domestic EU asset, which yields benefits for us, both as a sustainable low-carbon economy and for security of supply.
We must also recognise that renewables are not the free lunch that some people think: they do have costs attached, which include financial, environmental and inflexibility factors.
I share President Barroso's determination that we achieve our targets without loss of global competitiveness and without exporting jobs and businesses.
Whilst we are on the subject of targets, we must break with the past performance, where the EU has a dismal record in failing to meet targets.
We can only agree to binding targets if they are achievable.
I welcome the approach of market mechanisms, like the Emissions Trading System, but I hope we can improve the methodology and make it work better to achieve our aims.
Finally, let me make the suggestion that we should resist the temptation to be technology-specific, we should resist being obsessive about renewables as the solution, when it is the objective of drastic emissions reduction that matters most and, therefore, we must use the full range of means available and not rule out any option.
(DA) Madam President, Commission President, I am extremely pleased that we now have a legislation package in front of us, as this is of course the basis that will enable us to work towards achieving our targets and to demonstrate that the EU can do more than just talk about this.
In fact we can actually deliver!
As rapporteur for the package in Parliament, I have placed an emphasis on the central role of national action plans.
These action plans should be accompanied by interim targets, and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now included this in its proposal.
This is central to ensuring that we get started now and do not suddenly find ourselves with unfulfilled targets in 2020.
Parliament has also stressed the necessity of having an initiative in all three sectors - electricity, heating and transport - and I am also pleased to see that the Commission will require the Member States to set sectoral targets.
However, I would rather have seen the social dimension given a more prominent role in relation to energy prices, food prices and local involvement, but these are just some of the areas that we will be working on further in Parliament.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on the good result achieved today.
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the presentation of this energy and climate change package.
I fully agree with its priorities.
In the Directive on the promotion of renewable energy sources, however, I think there is insufficient emphasis on the urgent need to promote technologies for converting biomass directly into gas.
Such technologies have many applications, particularly owing to their overall efficiency as compared with conventional combustion.
Another point I feel I must make concerns the directive on carbon dioxide storage.
Financial aid seems to be directed first and foremost towards the coal and oil sectors.
I cannot agree with this decision, given that there are other options for carbon dioxide capture in energy production processes, for example the use of microalgae in water.
One last remark: if we really must use coal, then let us at least promote the technology for cleaner and more efficient conversion of coal into gas.
Naturally I reserve the right to examine the final documents.
(PL) Madam President, my remarks are addressed directly to Commissioner Dimas, whom I wish to accuse, at the very least, of incompetence.
I am in possession of an open letter sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and signed by 100 distinguished scientists from across the world.
I would like the Commissioner to study the final paragraph of this letter carefully, and will now quote from it: 'Attempts to prevent global climate change from occurring are ultimately futile, and constitute a tragic misallocation of resources that would better be spent on humanity's real and pressing problems'.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are no scientific grounds for us to believe we are in a position to affect the cycle of climate change that is governed by changes in the sun's activity.
On the basis of a study of ice samples, scientists have established that this cycle has continued over tens of thousands of years.
Allocating hundreds of billions of euro to combating climate change amounts to an attack on human civilisation and common sense.
I hereby accuse you of incompetence and...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(HU) Madam President, Members of the Commission, thank you.
I welcome the Commission's efforts as regards both international cooperation and internal legislation.
The Commission can always count on the support of Parliament in this regard.
It is a good feeling to see that Europe is taking a leading role in the third industrial revolution.
I am convinced that the resulting technological innovation will help to enable developing countries to realise their legitimate demands and mitigate the pollution load caused by our own growth.
The greatest danger within the European Union, however, is the lukewarm and reluctant attitude of some Member States, which is jeopardising implementation of these ambitious plans.
However, the Commission is also guilty of this, as it routinely turns a blind eye to lack of compliance on the part of Member States.
Let me give you a personal example: while Hungary was a candidate for accession to the EU, the Commission obliged us to comply with every last provision of the legislation, but now that we are a Member State, anything goes.
This is not fairness; this is opportunism.
You spoke of energy-efficient homes: two years have elapsed and Hungary has not introduced the Directive on the energy certification of buildings.
The Commission, it seems, does not require this.
Hungary spends a mere fraction of the money it receives from the EU on energy efficiency and energy-saving measures.
The Commission does not oblige it to do so.
I ask you, how will it be possible to achieve the goals set by the Commission if the Commission itself [...]
(IT) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the thrust of what Mr Barroso has told us today about the Commission's proposal.
This is a major challenge for Europe that can be postponed no longer.
The proposed targets, and in particular the 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, are achievable in spite of the many difficulties to be overcome.
However, a joint commitment by all countries will be required for an energy policy capable of tackling the emergency that is climate change and freeing Europe at long last from its dependency on imports and, consequently, from continuous rises in energy prices.
Issues relating to security of supply and renewable energy sources should also be highlighted.
All of this necessitates a programme on the diversification of energy resources.
Greenhouse gas emissions can be cut through the use of nuclear energy, clean coal and low carbon-emitting renewable energies.
Efforts should in particular be focused on research into nuclear ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Madam President, I join with the majority of speakers in acknowledging the importance of this energy and environment package.
I also believe that it will be a new major step in increasing the role of Europe in the fight against climate change.
I would like to mention two of the five principles mentioned by the President of the Commission: fairness and competitiveness.
I should like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has taken into account the position of countries like mine, Bulgaria, especially as far as trade outside the Emissions Trading Scheme is concerned and with regard to specifying targets for renewables.
As far as competitiveness is concerned, however, a lot has to be done in order to make the Commission's proposals more precise and, in the absence of a possible future agreement, we should be very careful regarding countries like Bulgaria and the energy mix, so that the possibilities for further developing energy and industry are preserved on the basis of achievable targets and at an achievable price.
(DE) Madam President, may I express my thanks to the President of the Commission for making it crystal-clear in his introductory words that the cost of inactivity or insufficient activity on the part of the EU and its Member States would be at least five times that of the package presented here today.
I should like to associate myself with the speakers who have emphasised the importance of renewable energy sources, and I am pleased to see that the Commission does not regard nuclear generation as a renewable - not that there was ever any question of that.
Let me also underline the importance of energy efficiency and of the measures that remain to be taken in pursuit of that goal, because all studies have shown that energy efficiency is the most economical way to fight CO2 emissions.
I must stress that I am extremely sceptical about CO2 storage and that I am opposed to a binding 10% quota for biofuels.
As one who works in the field of development policy, I should also like to say that I keenly await the Commission's proposals as to how more projects in the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism can be taken to the poorest countries of our planet, for we all know that the poorest countries suffer most from the effects of climate change.
(FR) Madam President, President Barroso has set us an ambitious target for the production of renewable energy, with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering our prospects of growth.
However, this is where I have a difficulty with the Commission: it wants to use the GDP of each state for its calculations, and I do not believe that that is adequate.
I believe that the overall emission reduction effort of each Member State by 2020 should be determined on the basis of the starting level of emissions per inhabitant, without prejudice, of course to the solidarity mechanisms between states.
In other words, we need to take into account the overall proportion of non-carbon energy used by each state.
In short, we must not confuse the end with the means.
The guiding idea is naturally to reduce greenhouse gases and facilitate the 'decarbonisation' of the economy, as underlined in the Council conclusions of March 2007.
(NL) Madam President, today we are seeing the outcome of Europe's climate ambitions.
I feel that the proposals sit well together, but sadly the targets are too low.
In Bali it was decided that a reduction of 25-40% by 2020 is necessary to save the climate.
Suddenly the European Union's commitment looks a little on the weak side.
That is a poor signal to send to the rest of the world, and so Bulgaria and Romania, among others, still feel that they can raise their emissions quite considerably.
As far as I am concerned, this is not a good idea.
It gives China and India little reason to reduce their emissions.
It would be better if all the richer countries in the European Union helped countries like Bulgaria and Romania to lower their emissions.
That is a better way to achieve global credibility.
Sadly, the modification of the Emissions Trading Scheme has been somewhat watered down under pressure from the industrial lobby.
It is a pity that the Commission developed weak knees and reduced the rights of the energy-intensive industry to sell shares at auction.
Certain countries do indeed work this way at an international level, but it would be much better to put a fair system in place and establish border levies.
Madam President, I welcome the announcement of this most important package and look forward to the legislative debate that will follow.
I think it is timely to remind those, especially in my own country, who are rightly exercised about global warming, climate change and greenhouse gas emission increases and who have concerns, on the other hand, about ratifying the Lisbon Treaty - or the Reform Treaty, as we underline - that the environment and climate change are specifically included in the Lisbon Treaty as distinct from the past Constitutional Treaty: a most important point to underline.
Following Bali, it is clear that Europe, as a Union of 27 Member States, has the capacity and the ability to lead the world on this most critical of issues - climate change - with this package at its centre.
Bali produced a road map for global agreement by 2009, recognising the urgency for clear and transparent international agreements - I have borrowed President Barroso's words - to ensure at least a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
And while remaining competitive is ever pressing, we cannot solve our numbers and targets by exporting jobs through relocation to regions which have no legislation to reduce greenhouse gases ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(ES) Madam President, the programme the Commission is proposing to us, in terms of meeting the targets in order to ensure our credibility, calls on each of us to do what we can, to rise to this challenge and turn it into an opportunity to become more competitive, proposing it in such a way that ensure that by cooperating we might all achieve this on a global level without wasting any time.
It is, of course, a very encouraging programme full of fascinating challenges.
One of those mentioned - and which I support - is the challenge of proposing energy sources that offer an alternative to nuclear energy.
As far as the transport sector is concerned, I believe that it is a sector that presents a major challenge and I would therefore call on the Commission to make use of the instruments that are currently on the table, namely the Logistics Action Plan.
Logistics, which are now becoming a factor of competition, should be one of the instruments used to apply intelligence to mobility and to enable us to find appropriate solutions to help reduce emissions.
As regards the Galileo project, on which there has little progress since we did not see all of its potential, the applications in terms of achieving a reduction in emissions should present another challenge.
Finally, I believe that the urban transport plan is now a real possibility.
(DE) Madam President, I should like to refer once again to the role of transport as one of the main causes of climate problems and stress the need to make it the focal point of our action.
As far as reducing transport emissions is concerned, the European Union has not exactly covered itself in glory.
Now, however, we have a second chance.
For example, we have the opportunity to make the social cost of transport operations fully reckonable by charging heavy goods vehicles for infrastructure use under the Eurovignette scheme and thereby shifting a greater volume of freight from road to rail, where emission levels are far lower.
If we do not tackle the transport issue, we shall never have any prospect of achieving our climate targets.
This applies especially to the countries at the heart of Europe.
To make these Member States take action at long last to help reduce the volume of road traffic, we also need sanctions for those that cause further increases and are unwilling to reduce their traffic volumes.
President of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Members for the general line of strong support for our proposals.
I understood correctly that this House is very committed to this very important matter and sees it as one of the most important challenges, if not the most important, for our generation.
I would like to thank you for that.
We were asked to come here immediately after our meeting, so we cannot yet have an in-depth discussion, but let me tell you that the Commission would be happy to participate actively in such a debate - myself, Commissioner Dimas, Commissioner Piebalgs and the other relevant Commissioners.
We will be ready to discuss with you all details of this very important set of proposals.
Let me start by saying that some of your comments were based on earlier work and not on the proposals that we are putting forward today.
It is important to understand that the proposals are the ones adopted today by the College.
The work was done over months - it is a very complex issue.
You have had access, as has the press, to some staff work, very important work, but the decision was taken only half an hour precisely before coming to this House.
I believe it is a very balanced decision - ambitious, but, at the same time, balanced and fair, and we are very proud.
I think we have gained time.
I think the fact that we have one more month to build a strong consensus in the Commission helps us gain time for the adoption, hopefully in this Parliament, of the whole package.
I understood the point made by Mr Sacconi and by Ms Ek about the need to do it, but let us put it like that.
Let us not see the time until June 2009 as the home straight for this Parliament; Let us finish the work of this Parliament with a bang, with a climax, by adopting these very important proposals!
Let me say that, from my contacts with the governments of our Member States, namely with the current Slovene Presidency and the upcoming French Presidency, I thought that there was a strong determination to do it fast, to go ahead with it, to make it a real priority.
And, if we do it as well here in the Parliament, I really believe it will be possible to get this package approved - after the necessary negotiations, of course, and we are ready.
We do not pretend our proposal is perfect.
I think it is possible that this Parliament, during this term, will achieve a very strong consensus around a very ambitious set of proposals.
We have highlighted the difficult and political points.
Let me just make a final comment about this.
One is the question of balance between ecological commitment and the need to reduce our greenhouse gases and, at the same time, the need to address fears that exist in some parts of our industry regarding some effects on international competition.
Let us make it clear: we are not making an exception for any sector of our industry.
All of them are going to be involved in this.
What we are considering is just in case there is no global agreement, but the global agreement remains our goal and our priority.
Yes, there will be some measures to cushion the impact of this factor in some of our industries, because we want, of course, to protect the economy of Europe and we want to protect our jobs in Europe.
This is the important thing, and we believe we have reached a very balanced solution.
Regarding the point made about burden-sharing among Member States, we have decided to do it broadly as follows.
We are going to see the concrete proposals regarding renewables.
As you know, the target set was 20% of energy use through renewables.
We are, today, at 8.5%, so we have to go for 11.5% more.
We have decided, broadly speaking, to make half of that subject to a flat rate - everybody has to make the same effort. The other part of it, we have decided, will be according to GDP per capita.
It seems to us the fairest method, because it is a way of giving more possibilities to those that have more resources to invest than the poorest Member States.
I think it is fair.
We have adjusted this with the criteria of flexibility for those countries that have made an effort already, so as to give some kind of prize or bonus to the early starters.
All the methodology will be transparent.
We are going to present it.
We believe it is a good and fair proposal in terms of burden-sharing among Member States.
I am quite hopeful that it will be well received by most of our Member States.
Anyway, the scenarios will be transparent, the methodology will be presented, and if the Council and Parliament can find a better solution, please do.
We think, in the end, that this will be the solution, because it was technically sound and also very fair.
Regarding the problem of biofuels, we agree with most of what you said.
The question is that today there are no sustainability criteria for the biofuels that are already being produced in the world and are already circulating.
What we are doing now is establishing, for the first time ever, high-level criteria of sustainability for biofuels - domestic and imported biofuels - once again keeping in mind that what we want is a global agreement.
Today there is no global agreement: in Latin America they do it one way, in the United States they do it another way and in Africa another way.
Therefore, we need an international regime for the sustainability of biofuels, and this is what we are doing: promoting a new generation of biofuels.
Therefore, while accepting all the criticisms of those who said that there are some risks with biofuels - and we agree there are - let us compare the alternative.
We are proposing an alternative that is much better than the current situation.
Some of you were concerned about the need for more investment in technology.
I agree with that.
Let us keep this in mind when we discuss the next financial perspective.
I think we have to do more.
I agree, because for carbon capture and storage, which is a very important and promising technology, we need capital.
By the way, regarding the auction revenues of the Member States, we are proposing that the Member States assign a part of them to the fight against climate change.
Let us hope they will accept that.
Let me tell you from my contacts with the Member States during all these processes one thing that I have already made public.
Sometimes, when discussing climate change, I remember what John Stuart Mill said about his father.
He said that his father loved mankind in general, but hated every individual in particular.
Let us hope our Member States and some of our national politicians are not like that.
If they want to fight climate change, they cannot just love the agenda politically and afterwards not commit to precise targets and methods.
This is an important issue.
What the Commission has done today is to translate those goals and intentions into concrete measures and into instruments that are transparent.
Are they perfect?
Let us discuss it.
We believe they are reliable, fair and effective.
We believe it is important, as Mr HÃ¶kmark said, that we also rely on the market.
We will not enter into the energy mix of the Member States - that could be a discussion without end.
We are not claiming that this or that is the best option.
We are saying that now a goal has been unanimously agreed by the Member States of 20% use through renewables - for obvious reasons we have had to put the emphasis on renewables, because we have to give some clear incentives to the market - it is the market that will decide on the best technology and source of energy.
We are not giving more precise instructions, because that is not what we have to do.
But, please, think about the difficulty involved.
We are applying general rules and principles and instruments to 27 very different situations, in terms not only of economic development but also of energy mix, the history of those countries and the culture of awareness of some of these problems.
It is unavoidable that, in the end, there will be some differences.
The important thing is to have a coherent approach.
I believe that we have come here today with a coherent approach.
I am looking forward very much to the necessary discussions at legislative level and I really believe that, with the spirit of partnership we have seen on other important pieces of legislation, we, together with the European Parliament and the Council, will reach a very ambitious and, at the same time, realistic proposal.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The minutes of today's sitting will be submitted for Parliament's approval at the next part-session.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) I welcome the energy and climate package presented to us by the Commission.
It is important that the European Union should continue to play a leading role in combating climate change, and for this reason we must make a serious commitment to achieving the goal of '20/20/20 by 2020' (a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 20% energy savings and 20% of renewable energies).
I would, however, remind the Commission that, as things stand, the only technology at an advanced design stage that is capable of ensuring real energy efficiency and a sustained reduction in CO2 emissions is nuclear.
Some European states are well ahead in this field, others are gearing themselves up, while others still - and this is the case for Italy - are going nowhere.
Obviously, what has been lacking in the past is a common regulatory framework and, more generally, a comprehensive EU strategy on this topic.
Only now is the European Commission taking the initiative, without any ifs and buts, because the international scenario calls for decisions, bold ones where necessary.
The future of our economy is at stake here; so too, indirectly, is our opportunity to make our voice heard on respect for rights in every corner of the world, without fear of being held to ransom.
in writing. - (RO) While appreciating the Commission's environmental concerns, we are preoccupied with the limited relevance of the indicators used in the algorithm applied for computing the distribution of emission certificates.
New correction coefficients are needed to reflect the differences in the investment potential of countries with a similar GDP but with dissimilar social and economic prospects.
The level of investment required clearly differs significantly according to the development stage of a particular European area.
Thus, the national budgetary effort required to keep emissions within allotted limits will be charged to the budget for technological investment, so creating an obstacle to meeting European environmental standards in economically disadvantaged areas.
The principle of European solidarity can only be respected in spirit if those countries and regions which are below the European average in terms of development are treated with due consideration of their particular stage of development.
In line with the same principle, I hope that those of my German colleagues who have criticised Nokia's decision to relocate to Romania will eventually learn - and tell it plainly to the German workers in Bochum who were made redundant - that Romanian workers' wages are ten times lower than theirs, while the price of a litre of milk or petrol is the same as in Germany.
in writing. - Today's debate creates a new favourable environment to encourage a wider social debate on the role nuclear energy will play in Europe in the future.
Nuclear generation is a proven and efficient way of producing electrical energy free of greenhouse gas emissions.
I suspect that the average European citizen is probably totally unaware of this fact.
The public debate focuses almost exclusively on renewables and limiting the impact of burning fossil fuels.
We should be honest and admit that there is a limit to how much energy we can generate from renewable sources and still maintain competitive energy prices.
Renewables are important, but we cannot mislead citizens by saying that renewables alone will solve the problem.
While CCS schemes will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, the technologies are still to be implemented on an industrial scale.
Furthermore, they will have a substantial price tag.
A responsible approach to tackling the challenge of climate change requires a balance - a mix of economically viable renewable technologies, CCS systems and modern nuclear technologies.
It is our responsibility to ensure that all options are explored, none to the exclusion of others.
in writing. - Renewable energies can, in principle, offer a solution to global climate change and Europe's energy crisis.
However, biofuels and other forms of bioenergy are contradictory tools for combating climate change.
Up to a certain level they positively replace fossil energy, but on a larger scale they endanger the rainforests and the food supply of Third World countries.
There are already worrying signs of deforestation in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries.
Food prices have risen as well due to the growing consumption of biofuels.
The EU should limit its bioenergy consumption to the surplus agricultural capacity of the Union itself, discouraging deforestation.
in writing. - (RO) We fully support the Commission in its effort of proposing to the Member States and citizens a viable plan for achieving energy and environmental objectives.
However, we should take into consideration the financial and economic aspects entailed by these proposals.
There is a need to review the rules for approving the grant of state aid to environmental projects.
Given the current high degree of pollution of some industries and the fact that adjustment to green technologies is not cost-effective, State aid amounting to 60-100% can be a viable solution.
Mining is such an industry, and it is in dire need of CO2 capture and storage technologies.
Concerning the Commission's project of launching 12 new coal and gas power plants equipped with CO2 capture and storage technology, I would like to reiterate Romania's willingness to host such a power plant.
The Jiu Valley basin has the advantage of being both rich in mineral resources and close to working power plants.
in writing. - (PL) The problem of climate change and combating the degradation of the natural environment rose to the top of the European Union's agenda in 2007.
The European Commission's proposals are a concrete expression of the ambitious aims outlined in March of last year.
They reflect the leading role assumed by our Community of 27 nations as regards limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
I do not wish to query the aims or ambitions, but it must be recognised that the European Community is composed of two groups of countries that were until recently divided by the so-called Iron Curtain.
For many decades now, the Western democracies have been sensitive to the need to protect the natural environment.
This resulted in environmental standards worthy of imitation on other continents.
In contrast, the countries of the former Comecon underwent rapid industrialisation.
In particular, this involved developing the potential of the iron and steel industry, the heavy chemicals industry and other types of industry with detrimental effects on the environment.
The process of adjustment to the Union's standards was exceptionally costly and it is not surprising that so many transitional periods were negotiated by these countries in their Accession Treaties.
In a very short period of time the countries of Central and Eastern Europe underwent a dramatic transformation in this regard.
Pursuant to the European Commission's proposals, these countries are now facing new challenges that may be more than they can cope with and could affect their opportunities for development.
Finding the correct balance between environmental requirements, the right conditions for competitiveness and job protection is something that concerns the European Union as a whole.
It is, however, particularly important for the countries that are struggling to catch up.
in writing. - (EL) The presentation of the Council's measures to combat climate change by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, has the following aim and vision:
to strengthen European monopolies in the intensified endo-imperialist competition in the field of energy.
There is an attempt to exploit the essential goal of restricting emissions of pollutants in order to divide the markets and limit the growth of the emerging new powers (China and Brazil), which are claiming greater shares of the market.
It provides an outlet for the over-accumulation of capital through the commercialisation of environmental protection.
Following the liberalisation of strategically important sectors (energy, telecommunications), today's economy is one of the great new investment outlets for monopolistic capital.
For this reason Mr Barroso spoke about investment in innovative energy technologies, technological modernisation and the use of private groups to meet the requirements of the new environmental legislation.
In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created a new capitalist market in emissions trading.
The right to pollute is exchanged for a price on the carbon dioxide 'stock market'.
It nurtures a climate of class-based cooperation, attempting to exploit the worldwide raising of awareness, concealing the fact that dangerous changes in climate and global warming are the result of industrial development based on capitalist profit, the commercialisation of earth, air, energy, water, etc.
These measures are detrimental to people's needs and the development of the profitability of capital in the field of the environment.
in writing. - (RO) EU Member States are facing the challenges posed by climate change, increased dependence on energy imports, and the high price of energy.
Therefore, the European Union's commitment to decreasing greenhouse emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020, particularly through measures in the energy sector, is a major step in combating global warming.
Stepping up the transition to low-carbon energy by switching to biofuels and renewable energy sources will foster innovation and increase industrial competitiveness.
Member States with developing economies, in particular Romania and Bulgaria, will be allowed a 20% increase in emissions compared to 2005 for industries outside the ETS system, and this increase is to be computed on the basis of GDP.
This is proof of solidarity on the part of the European Union, ensuring that poorer countries will have the opportunity to catch up with the more developed economies.
in writing. - Last week President Putin and First Deputy Prime Minister Medvedev of the Russian Federation signed a treaty in Sofia on constructing a gas pipeline called 'South Stream' across the Black Sea.
Right now, when the Lisbon Treaty is about to be ratified, it seems rather odd that Bulgaria did not consult its European partners.
Union policy on energy aims, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, to ensure security of energy supply in the Union.
Experts have perceived a threat in South Stream to the Nabucco project, which is included in the EU Trans-European Energy Network.
In my opinion, Bulgaria has acted in a very disappointing way by signing a bilateral agreement on energy with the Russian Federation.
Although Nabucco was named after an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the current state of play resembles more an operetta or farce.
in writing. - (RO) We welcome the President's initiative of coming to the European Parliament to present proposals concerning energy and climate change.
We take this opportunity to ask the European Commission to pay particular attention to and to take all necessary measures for speeding up the NABUCCO project, which is of major importance in guaranteeing the security of gas supplies to the EU.
in writing. - (RO) I believe that the fight against climate change can be won only if we manage to ensure global solidarity.
The European Union should include the issue of climate change in all of its agreements, be they bilateral or multilateral.
It is also important for adjustment to climate change to take into account and allow for the sustainable economic development of the Union.
Biofuel crops should not be promoted to the detriment of crops for human consumption.
The sustainable development of transport can help to abate climate change.
Member States should opt for the energy mix that causes the least pollution possible.
I call on the Commission to review the 2007-2013 financial perspective and the 2008 budget, Community programs and policies, as well as the main laws, so as to take climate change into account.
The Commission should recognize the importance of national, local and regional authorities in the development and enforcement of climate change adjustment measures, as well as the need to vest authority in them and provide them with the support they need.
I believe it is necessary to have a European framework programme aimed at reducing the risk of desertification and water shortage.

Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, following Hungary's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Slovenia and Malta ratified the Treaty yesterday.
(Applause)
The Slovenian Parliament voted by a large majority for ratification.
The Maltese Parliament, for its part, unanimously approved the Treaty.
This is an important political signal whereby Member States have shown clearly that they want the ratification process to proceed rapidly so that the Treaty can enter into force as planned on 1 January 2009.
I congratulate Slovenia and Malta on this landmark decision.
(Applause)
For domestic reasons, as you know, the Slovakian Parliament decided yesterday to postpone its vote until a later date.
I appeal to all political leaders in Slovakia to fulfil their great political responsibility.
Approval of the minutes
(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)
Mr President, the minutes of the last part-session mention your speech in which you talked about incidents that took place in Strasbourg in December.
Since that time, under Rule 147 of our revered Rules of Procedure, you have called before you 13 Members of this Parliament to face disciplinary action.
It seems to me that this has been done on a pretty arbitrary basis.
I doubt whether one of those that you have called - Ms Sinnott from our group - has ever shouted at anybody in her life.
Another of the Members that you called to appear in the headmaster's study - an Austrian Member - was actually in Frankfurt on the day, so he must have one hell of a voice, must he not?
Why only 13?
There were about 80 of us involved in these so-called disturbances.
In fact, at the Conference of Presidents' meeting, you yourself named me as being one of the causes of the trouble, so why am I not being punished?
I am Spartacus!
(Cries of 'I am Spartacus!' from members of the IND/DEM Group)
I had asked for comments concerning the Minutes.
I would have expected the chair of the IND/DEM Group to understand what the President was saying and to focus his remarks on the Minutes.
He patently failed to do that, and so we can now move on.

Order of business
The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 17 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
Brussels part-session:
At the request of the GUE/NGL Group and with the consent of all groups, I propose that statements on the situation in Gaza by Mr Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who is already with us and to whom I bid a very warm welcome, and by the Commission be added to today's agenda as item 2, following the statements on the situation in Iran.
(Parliament approved the request.)
There is also a request that we conclude the debate with the tabling of motions for resolutions and vote on these during the February part-session.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, my group has proposed a debate on this for the same reasons as we have proposed that there should be a resolution in February. It is in order to have an opportunity to listen to Mr Solana and for Parliament then to explain its own position, for three reasons.
The first is, of course, the issue of the Gaza blockade, which seems to us a collective punishment that is totally unacceptable from the humanitarian point of view, counter-productive politically and ineffective as far as the security of Israel is concerned.
The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaza have opened up the border.
Thirdly, and above all, the European response to the question of what we can do to ensure that this opening up continues in a controlled and stable way and to make this step forward part of the peace process as a whole.
I think it would be useful now to hear what Mr Solana has to say and to debate the issue and wind up the debate with a resolution in February.
(Parliament adopted the motion.)
(The amended order of business was adopted.)
Mr President, on a point of order, under Rules 173, 19(1), 161 and 171, the decision by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which you cited a moment ago represents, I am sorry to say, the moment at which this Parliament departs from any pretence of legality or the rule of law.
Last week, you asked for, and were granted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, discretionary powers arbitrarily to disapply the Rules of Procedure of this House according to your own view.
The Rules allow no such latitude.
You cited Rule 19(1).
Let me read what it says: 'The President shall direct all the activities of Parliament and its bodies under the conditions laid down in these rules.'
They do not allow you discretionary power to set them aside simply because you do not like the opinions of the people making amendments or requests that, in your letter, you accepted 'were formally based on and fulfilled the requirements of ... the Rules of Procedure'.
What has driven you to this, Mr President?
What action has driven you to this extremity of tearing up your own rule book rather than following the letter of the law?
Was it some filibuster that was preventing any business getting through?
Hardly!
Those of us who are asking for a referendum perhaps represent 40 or 50 out of 785.
We are a small minority.
The worst we could do was slightly to delay your lunch by making speeches of one minute, but even this is intolerable to you!
Could it be that the reason you have acted in this arbitrary fashion, tearing up the rule of law, is because you are taking out on us the surrogate contempt you feel for the national electorates who keep voting 'no' on the Lisbon Treaty whenever they are given the opportunity?
If I am wrong, prove me wrong by holding the referendums that you used to support when you thought you could win them.
Put the Treaty of Lisbon to the people.
Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!
Mr Hannan, when you quote provisions, it would enhance your credibility if you quoted them in full.
As a matter of fact, Rule 19 goes on to state that 'He' - meaning the President - 'shall enjoy all the powers necessary to preside over the proceedings of Parliament and to ensure that they are properly conducted'.
In order to ascertain the legal position and ensure that I did not take any unilateral uninformed decisions, I took the democratic route and consulted those who know best about matters concerning the Rules of Procedure, namely the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
The committee provided me, the President, and my deputies with the interpretation on which we are able to proceed.
I cannot begin to grasp how this can be termed undemocratic, for it is a fair and democratic parliamentary procedure that is being followed here.
(Applause)
Situation in Iran (debate)
The next item is the delivery of statements on the situation in Iran by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission.
I warmly welcome the High Representative, Javier Solana.
Mr Solana, the floor is yours.
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I do not want to interfere in the debate which is taking place, but I take the floor at your invitation.
Let me start by thanking you for the invitation today.
It is the first time that I have spoken before Parliament in the year 2008.
We are all sure that 2008 is going to be very exciting, to say the least.
I want to continue with a deeper cooperation with Parliament, with yourself and with the distinguished Members of this Chamber.
Today we have a very important debate - a debate on an issue that is one of the most important issues on the agenda of the international community.
I would like to make a short statement about it and spend the time necessary to see whether we can together understand - and not only understand but make some progress on the solution of - this very complicated issue that is at the top of the international agenda today.
Let me start by making a few remarks.
Iran is a key country in the Middle East.
It is important in strategic terms, and is also important as a regional actor.
We would like, therefore, to have a constructive relationship with Iran; but, as you know, there are many difficulties with this.
Iran is a very vibrant society, full of talented people.
It has an exceptionally high proportion of women graduates.
Persian is one of the major languages on the internet, especially for blogs, as young people seek a means of self-expression.
The political scene in Iran - as you well know - is of great interest these days.
There are elements of democracy there which are not present in other countries of the Middle East, though the election process still leaves much to be desired.
For the Majles elections in March, to give you an example, 30% of candidates were disqualified, with those having reformist tendencies suffering the most.
Some will have the opportunity to appeal but others will not.
Nevertheless, an imperfect democracy is better than none, and it is right that we should engage with Iranian parliamentarians.
I am very grateful to the European Parliament for sending a delegation there to meet with their colleagues in the Iranian Parliament.
Members of this Parliament are also right to be concerned about the rule of law and human rights in Iran.
Iran is almost at the bottom of the world press freedom index.
It has increased the number of executions.
There are, unfortunately, numerous reports of torture.
Such things are unacceptable and only damage Iran's image as a civilised country.
All those who campaign for human rights in Iran, for example in the one-million-signature campaign for women's rights, deserve our support and admiration.
This morning I had the happy opportunity to comment on that with Mrs Souhayr Belhassen, who is, as you know, one of the most important figures in the International Federation of Human Rights.
With greater freedom, greater accountability and more even-handed justice, Iran could be one of the most creative and most dynamic societies in the Middle East.
The European Union had, in the past, a human rights dialogue with Iran, but since 2004 the Iranians have been unwilling to participate.
However, we have many areas of common interest with Iran that are not yet fully exploited, the most obvious of these in the energy sector - but there is also more that we could do together on drug trafficking and against terrorism.
It would be good if we were able to work better with Iran in the region.
But for the moment, as you know, this is difficult because it is difficult to see Iran as a constructive partner.
In almost every area we seem to find ourselves pursuing different, sometimes contradictory, policies.
We want a two-state solution in Palestine.
We want the Annapolis Conference to succeed.
Iran is still the only country in the Middle East that does not accept the idea of a two-state solution.
It is a key supplier of arms to Hamas.
President Ahmadinejad's remarks concerning Israel and his support for Holocaust denial are entirely unacceptable for all of us.
Iran, as you know, is a destabilising factor in Lebanon.
It is the most important supplier of weapons to Hezbollah.
It has also worked with groups pursuing violence in Iraq.
All these activities make Iran, from our point of view, a troublesome and difficult actor in the Middle East.
But it remains one that we need to understand and engage with better.
There have been periods of cooperation with Iran, for example in Afghanistan, that have been fruitful, and I believe we should continue to seek such opportunities.
But, as you know, one of the most important subjects of concern is the Iranian nuclear programme.
Were Iran to develop a weapon, this could be a cause of radical instability and danger in the Middle East.
It would also be very damaging to the whole non-proliferation system.
Even the suspicion that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon can destabilise the Middle East.
Our objective is to remove those suspicions.
In the end this can be done only through a negotiated solution.
We welcome the fact that Iran is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to deal with some of the so-called 'Outstanding Issues'.
In the current phase with Dr ElBaradei, as you know, Iran has to answer questions about important issues like weaponisation, and especially other issues related to contamination, which are very important.
But even if these questions about the past are answered, this does not provide the transparency we are asking for concerning Iran's present activities or its future intentions.
Present transparency requires Iran to ratify and implement, as we have said many times, the Additional Protocol.
Confidence about Iran's future intentions is more difficult.
Supposing Iran had a weaponisation programme in the past, how can we be sure today that the present enrichment activity is exclusively civil?
It is especially difficult when we see no signs, at this moment, of Iran signing a contract to build a nuclear power plant apart from what they have done with the Russians in Bushehr, for which the Russians have supplied the fuel.
All we hear about is enrichment.
When I ask - and you asked the other day - representatives of the Iranian Government what they plan to do with enriched uranium, I never get an answer.
You had the proof of that a few days ago.
The fact is that Iran can develop a civil programme only with the assistance of the countries belonging to the group of six countries which are negotiating with them - or trying to negotiate with them - with the exception of Japan.
No other country in the world can supply a country that wants to deploy or to develop a civil nuclear programme without the cooperation of countries, or companies that belong to those countries, that are in the group of six countries plus Japan.
None of us have a problem with an Iranian civil programme; indeed, we are offering to help.
But none of us will do so unless we are certain that Iran's intentions are exclusively peaceful.
This is why we are trying continually to achieve a negotiated solution.
So far, unfortunately - as you know - we have not been successful.
Also, unfortunately, it is impossible to do nothing while Iran continues to ignore the Agency resolutions or Security Council resolutions.
Work is, therefore, going on in New York on a further resolution.
The objective of these resolutions is not to punish Iran but to persuade it to come to the negotiating table: as far as I am concerned, the sooner the better.
The European Union and the permanent members of the Security Council are fully united in this.
We had an important meeting last Thursday.
Perhaps I could add one further comment that goes beyond Iran itself on this matter.
In a world where there is an increasing interest in nuclear power, we need to find ways of assuring countries that they can obtain nuclear fuel without having to do their own enrichment - which is expensive for them and gives rise to proliferation concerns.
I myself strongly support the idea of the creation of international fuel supply assurances, perhaps in the form of a fuel bank.
This idea has been played around with by many of our partners and many important figures in the international community.
There are many good ideas in this area.
I believe the time has come to turn these ideas into action, into reality.
As I said at the beginning, Iran is a key country.
I have been engaged for years now in normalising relations between us.
We will all gain from this - Iranians and Europeans.
I believe in this, and I will continue relentlessly to work towards this objective, which I think will benefit the people of Iran and the European Union.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in the current climate I think it is inevitable that discussions about Iran focus on the nuclear programme.
The international community is united in the search for a satisfactory solution.
That means working through the appropriate channels with the IAEA and the United Nations Security Council.
It also means supporting the persistent efforts by High Representative Javier Solana on behalf of the three plus three, with the full backing of the European Union, because international unity remains central, and it was shown at the last meeting in Berlin.
When I received Dr Saeed Jalili, the Iranian chief negotiator, last week, I reminded him of our principled position.
Nobody has ever denied Iran's right to the use of peaceful nuclear energy, but there was a serious need to rebuild trust and show genuine political will to find a solution.
Unfortunately, whereas the European Union was making its best efforts, I could not see such political will yet on the Iranian side.
Until we see such political will, there will unfortunately be no possibility of our enhancing our relationship, including launching or relaunching the trade and cooperation agreement talks and talks on energy.
This is what I explicitly told Dr Jalili at our meeting.
I am confident that Parliament shares the same views and that it continues to firmly back High Representative Solana and the three plus three to achieve a sustainable solution - and a diplomatic solution which, whilst preserving Iran's inalienable right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, also provides objective guarantees on these activities being exclusively peaceful in nature.
Although the development of the EU's relationship with Iran is conditioned to a large degree by progress on that issue, in the Commission's view more than one track should be pursued with Iran.
In this respect, I wish to express my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Delegation for Relations with Iran under the dynamic chairwomanship of Ms Angelika Beer.
Ms Beer, I particularly wish to commend the mission which you led last month to Tehran.
EP contacts, for instance with the Iranian Majlis, are an important channel of communication between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Your meetings with high-level officials such as the Foreign Minister, Mr Mottaki, as well as with a wide spectrum of Iranian society, are and were very precious.
Meetings with women activists, families of imprisoned students, trade unionists and minority groups constitute an important testimony to the importance the European Union attaches to a fully free, democratic and pluralistic Iran in accordance with the international conventions to which the Islamic Republic of Iran has freely adhered.
People-to-people contacts constitute an excellent means to overcome prejudice and negative stereotypes and to foster mutual understanding.
It is, for instance, very important to support the further development of academic, cultural and artistic exchanges between Europe and Iran: two ancient beacons of civilisation which have a lot to offer each other.
This is why I am particularly glad to report the successful launch this academic year of an Erasmus Mundus external cooperation window, linking up Europeans with students and professors from Iraq, Yemen and Iran.
From Teheran to Shiraz, to Mashhad to Alzahra, the web of Iranian universities participating in this consortium looks particularly promising.
The first academic batch has already allowed over 50 Iranian students and professors to study in Europe.
I strongly hope that this set-up will work both ways and European students and professors will also go to Iran.
Beyond that, we are pursuing our cooperation with Iran in a series of sectors such as the support to Afghan refugees or the fight against narcotics.
In this respect I would like to draw your attention to a recently launched call for proposals for grants to non-state actors and local authorities in Iran.
The programme - by the way a first with Iran - aims at promoting and strengthening an inclusive and empowered society.
It includes educational activities and development activities with a focus on actions against poverty.
Finally, the programme supports cooperation between civil society and local authorities and activities to strengthen their capacity.
This call is now open and runs until 11 February.
On another note, I welcome the decision taken by Parliament in plenary on 13 December last year to allocate a EUR 3 million envelope for a television news service in Farsi.
Promoting the production and broadcasting of information with a strong European angle can play an important role in fostering better mutual understanding with the Iranian public.
I wish to conclude on an important note: the issue of democracy and human rights.
In front of this Parliament last week, Dr Jalili insisted on the importance of human dignity.
I, of course, can only concur with him, but unfortunately when I met him myself, I could only tell him about my deep concern about the deterioration of human rights and the human rights situation in Iran.
Last year Iran carried out at least 297 executions, according to an AFP account compiled from press reports.
The total was a sharp increase from 2006 when 177 executions were carried out, according to Amnesty International.
I do not speak of other very cruel methods of killing people.
So I had to express my hope that the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights could resume.
I also expressed the hope that there would be a wider spectrum of candidates than in the past for the forthcoming parliamentary elections.
The European Union remains strongly mobilised on this front.
The latest statement on the death sentences in Iran issued on 25 January is just another case in point.
We are fully in line with Parliament in saying that, without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with Iran cannot develop properly.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, our resolution deals with the human-rights situation in Iran and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme.
On the subject of human rights, this House has clearly expressed its views time and again over the years.
The High Representative spoke once more today of executions and torture.
In the light of recent events, I should like to mention the names of political activists belonging to the Ahwazi Arab community who have been condemned to death, and to call on the Iranian Government not to execute them.
Their names are Zamal Bawi, Faleh al-Mansouri, Said Saki and Rasoul Mazrea; the same applies to two Kurdish journalists, Abdolwahed 'Hiwa' Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour.
May this publicising of their plight in Europe afford them protection!
As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, Saeed Jalili, the chief Iranian negotiator, did not provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week with a clear indication of Iran's real intentions.
Questions from 24 committee members were dealt with en bloc in a cursory manner.
This is no way to dispel the deep distrust that prevails between the international community and Iran.
Solidarity on the part of the international community is the best response to such evasiveness, which is why, in our resolution, we welcome the agreement reached in Berlin on 22 January on the drafting of a new UN Security Council resolution.
This will bring Russia and China on board, which will send a strong signal to Iran.
The resolution provides for additional measures as part of a concerted approach on the part of the international community.
I believe it is right that we should seek dialogue wherever possible but that we should also spell out time and again where our interests lie, namely on the one hand in human rights but on the other also in cooperation, though only if and when Iran recovers its trust in this community of ours.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Dr Solana, Commissioner, there are three issues involved here: human rights, nuclear weapons, and free democratic elections in Iran.
What is not an issue here today is the question of whether Mujaheddin should be blacklisted or not; we shall deal with that separately.
In the realm of human rights, the numerous and often brutal executions in Iran are a running sore as far as we are concerned.
I agree with what Mr Gahler said on this point and hope that public opinion in our countries can have a significant impact.
The second issue is that of the nuclear programme.
We stand four-square behind the views expressed by the High Representative.
We do not want nuclear weapons in Iran; we want no nuclear weapons anywhere in the region.
It was scandalous enough that many countries - including, I am sorry to say, the United States of America - stood by and watched as the bomb was developed in Pakistan and as bomb-building technology was transferred from there to Iran, because Pakistan was seen from the sole perspective of the common struggle against the Soviet Union and hence against Afghanistan too.
What we need is supervision - and I would ask you, Mr Solana, to make particular efforts in this direction - to ensure that nuclear industries, and especially their enrichment and waste-disposal operations, are more fully incorporated into multilateral frameworks and are more strictly supervised.
We must do more in this respect, because this concerns not only Iran but other countries too.
Another thing we need - and for this the Americans must be prepared to make further concessions - is the recognition of legitimate security interests, not of any government but of the Iranian nation.
That security must be guaranteed, and then we could surely make progress in our dialogue with Iran.
I likewise endorse the UN resolution, because it is a significant advance.
With regard to the elections too, Mr Solana, I can only echo your sentiments.
Elections and democracy begin to serve a purpose when elections are truly free, and if President Ahmadinejad believes he has such broad support in Iran, I can only urge him to ensure that genuine free elections can take place without external intervention, and then we shall see whether he enjoys such widespread support.
Free elections in Iran are one of the keys to the democratisation of the entire region.
(Applause)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, it is still a paradox that, as Mr Solana said, a country with such a rich history, such a varied culture and such a dynamic population as Iran should commit the most terrible human rights offences.
The number of death sentences last year - which the Commissioner also referred to - is a tragic illustration of this.
I therefore feel - together with my Group - that Iran is actually betraying its own history when the current regime treats its people as it has unfortunately been doing for a number of years now.
I nevertheless think that the solution lies in continued dialogue, with the population and civil society, undoubtedly, but also with the political authorities, however difficult that may be.
In this respect last week's debate with Mr Jalili was not exactly much fun, but it was extremely important, because he will now realise that not one single person from any Group in this House would endorse or even contemplate Iran starting to use its nuclear research for military purposes again without any response from us.
On behalf of my Group I particularly welcome Mr Solana's suggestion to set about creating a sort of multilateral, multinational nuclear fuel bank, because this is probably a good way to link our concern about non-proliferation with allowing countries to continue developing their civilian nuclear activities.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, the most important and urgent matter in relations with Iran is to obtain a guarantee that it will not acquire nuclear weapons.
Notwithstanding information from various sources, including the National Intelligence Estimate report, we cannot today be certain that Iran will not develop such weapons.
It is naÃ¯ve to believe that, since 2003, uranium enrichment in Iran has been directed towards exclusively civil applications.
Since that time the reformist president Khatami has been replaced by the representative of a much harder political line.
We must also remember that every nuclear programme was hidden under the cloak of civil projects in the initial stages: such was the case in Russia, India, China and Israel.
It is highly likely that today's civil programme is merely a step on the road to the eventual enrichment of uranium for military purposes.
The European Union must therefore exert maximum pressure on Iran, not excluding a military solution.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by thanking both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for making such thorough preparations for the visit and for engaging in consultation and dialogue with us both beforehand and afterwards.
I would like to point out - and let there be no mistake about this - that this debate will be heard in Iran.
It is an enlightened and pluralist society that tries to obtain the information it needs, and we are supporting that quest by means of the Farsi television news service.
We know that the leaders of the Ahmadinejad regime will be following this debate, which is why it is right and proper to say clearly to President Ahmadinejad and his supporters that the host of candidates for the 296 parliamentary seats - there are more than 7 000, of whom 2 000 are apparently being excluded - is a sure sign to us that he has his back to the wall in domestic politics.
Our solidarity belongs to civil society, to women, to trade unions and to all those who are under threat and whose names were read out to us a few moments ago.
(Applause)
There is also a second reason why we wanted today's debate, for which I am truly grateful.
Iran is at an impasse.
It has run into a brick wall and no longer knows how to progress; it is in no position to make offers.
At the same time, however, I wonder whether we Europeans have really played all our cards yet.
The finding of our cross-party visit to Iran is that we must find our own way of negotiating, and that can only be done without prior conditions, without holding a knife to anyone's throat.
One thing I understood very clearly from all the people whom we were able to meet and who are in need of our support is that sanctions weaken civil society and strengthen President Ahmadinejad.
For this reason, carrying on as before is not a political option and will not resolve the deadlock.
Let me therefore conclude by saying that we do not want nuclear weapons in any country whatsoever.
For my part, I want no nuclear energy at all, but if it is President Sarkozy's policy to conclude nuclear-energy contracts right, left and centre without any safeguards such as non-proliferation agreements, Europe's foreign policy will become a proliferation factor instead of helping to stem the tide.
(Applause)

Thank you, Mrs Beer, and I wish you a speedy recovery from what looks very much like a broken arm.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, according to the US intelligence report, the situation has changed.
What is needed now is a moratorium on the nuclear issue.
The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran has a very vibrant civil society, in spite of all the repressive measures against groups such as the trade unions.
There are intolerable occurrences, such as the rejection of candidates for election to the Majlis, but I am strongly opposed to tighter sanctions.
They would be counterproductive, particularly for the democratic opposition.
We are still hearing threats of war against Iran, especially from the United States.
My group is very firmly against any threat of war and the preparation of any war plans.
Mr Solana, in the British Guardian newspaper, Robert Cooper, a member of your staff, is quoted as saying the following in connection with the recently mooted manifesto for a new NATO: 'Maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else, but I'd be wary of saying it out loud'.
Does this statement relate to the situation in Iran, Mr Solana, and when are you going to dissociate yourself from it?
Let me repeat: negotiation with Iran, not escalation and war.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is good news and bad news from the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The good news came last month, in the middle of December, from the Iranian opposition in Tehran, which took a very clear stand against President Ahmadinejad's denial of the holocaust by declaring that the holocaust was an historical event that could not be called into doubt.
Duly noted.
The bad news is the public threat which the Foreign Minister, Mr Mottaki, recently made to the United Nations Security Council, when he said that if it adopted a new resolution on sanctions against Iran before the next IAEA report on the country's nuclear programme in March, there would be an appropriate and serious response from Tehran.
Mr Solana, I would like to know what you make of this public threat.
And what do you think about the idea of strengthening the IAEA's position by setting up an independent committee of technical experts on the Iranian nuclear programme?
After all, there have been precedents for this in UNSCOM and UNMOVIC.
The committee's report would then serve as a guide for consideration by the Security Council.
(NL) Mr President, the regime in Iran continues to pose a threat to stability throughout the Middle East and far beyond.
Iran provides support for Islamist and terrorist groups in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places.
The European Union's strategy must be to isolate Iran as much as possible in the region.
It is also important to encourage Russia to wind down its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Iran's nuclear plans are a threat to world peace.
America's National Intelligence Estimate surprised the whole world a few months ago by claiming that Iran had ceased its attempts to produce nuclear weapons in 2003.
There are now calls in the USA for the NIE's findings to be investigated further.
However, it would be wrong to suddenly now assume that the Iranian regime's nuclear threat no longer exists.
Why, for instance, is Iran still making things so difficult for the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors?
We all know what the regime in Tehran is capable of.
There is its human rights record, and in the past there has been clear proof of Iran's involvement in international Islamist terrorism.
When President Ahmadinejad publicly states that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, we have to take this seriously.
In the present circumstances, therefore, it would be wrong to relax the pressure on President Ahmadinejad.
There has to be dialogue, but the European Union must be steadfast in its attempts and desire to do more to promote freedom and stability.
Welcome
I welcome to our official gallery a delegation from the European Affairs Committee of the Polish Parliament, headed by Mr Andrzej Grzyb, Chairman of the Committee.
The delegation is on a three-day fact-finding visit to the European Parliament, and I had the pleasure of meeting its members yesterday.
I bid you all a warm welcome.
(Applause)
Situation in Iran (continuation of debate)
We now return to the statements on the situation in Iran by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission.
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I have listened with great attention to the representatives from the political groups of the European Parliament.
I agree with most of what has been said today.
Therefore, I have not much to say about that.
However, let me make some comments on the three main issues that I think we have to discuss today in relation to Iran.
I should like to say once again that it is not a contradiction to say that Iran is a very important country that has a vibrant society - potentially - and that we have to seek relations with it.
The fact is that it is very difficult to do that at the moment.
We have to keep trying to improve relations with such an important country as Iran.
Again, we must insist that it is not doing enough to improve relations with us.
On the three main issues I have spoken about - human rights, regional issues and the nuclear issue - it is very difficult to make progress in the negotiations.
In one area it is impossible to make progress because in 2006 it dropped completely out of the negotiations.
The human rights dialogue was stopped - it was not stopped by us but by Iran.
Let me say a word on that.
I agree, as I said before, with most of the remarks that have been made today on the human rights issue, which is linked, as many Members have said, to the elections that will take place very soon in March.
It will be very important to see how the public - the citizens of Iran - behave in this election.
But it is very important that the candidates who have been put forward are allowed to stand in the election.
As you know, more than 30% of those candidates have not even been allowed to stand.
Many of them, I would say, are the 'modern forces', if I can use that term, in Iran.
The second big issue is regional.
There have not been many comments made here about that, but it is very important that Iran becomes a constructive player and not a 'nuisance' in the lives of the people of the Middle East and in the establishment of peace in the Middle East, as we understand the development of the peace process in the Middle East.
There are two main points on the agenda.
Firstly, the Middle East peace process, on which we fundamentally differ.
We believe in a two-state solution, and they do not.
We have to see how we can bring Iran to agree to that process, which has been agreed by all the Arab countries in the region, and, as has been proven not long ago, not by Iran.
The second point is Lebanon.
We do not have Lebanon on the agenda today, but Lebanon is always on the agenda - even if not formally.
The problems in Lebanon are in our minds and hearts.
We know that is a problem on which Iran should be much more constructive.
The third issue I should like to mention, and which we have discussed on other occasions, is the nuclear issue.
Firstly, I should like to thank Ms Beer, because I talked to her before the committee went to Iran and we had a very good exchange of views, which was very well coordinated.
Cooperation with the Agency is fundamental.
We have been pushing for that all along and we would very much like to see that cooperation producing fruit.
However, that is not enough.
We should be resolving the 'outstanding issues'.
These issues, as you know, belong to the past.
Why are they outstanding?
Because they have never been explained, and that is the difference with some of the other countries that have been mentioned.
Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty; it has obligations and it has not complied with those obligations.
At the moment there is a discussion with Dr El Baradei and the people in charge of the nuclear dossier to see whether these 'outstanding issues' can be resolved.
We are now in the year 2008, and some of those issues go back to 2003, 2004 and 2005.
That was the first thing I wanted to say, and the second thing, which is very important, is that we are continuing to support the dual-track approach.
We want negotiations and we also want to follow the route to New York - together, in parallel.
We would like to see how this can progress.
We do not want to punish the people of Iran.
We want them to come back to the negotiating table with a moral purpose.
To give you an example: as you know, last Tuesday we met in Berlin.
On Wednesday I was here in Brussels having dinner with Dr Jalili, the day after we had been talking about New York and how to move the process forward in New York, I did not want to give the impression that we were doing something that we would not communicate directly.
To prove that we would continue with the dialogue, I met him, had dinner with him and explained that to him.
Therefore, in that sense, rest assured that we are making every effort to keep the dialogue channel open and not only open but productively open.
I do not have to tell you that sometimes you do not get the answer to the question.
You hold debates here and you know that sometimes, perhaps because of a problem with translation, you do not get the answer to the question - you get answers to other things but not the question.
You know that - you have had that experience - but we have to keep on trying, keep on trying and keep on trying - and we will!
On the intelligence report that has been mentioned: that is not our responsibility but the responsibility of the United Nations.
But, in any case, if you read it - when it becomes public - the most important things are public, it states very clearly that in 2003 they stopped a part of the nuclear weaponisation.
Now weaponisation has three elements.
First, and most important, it is necessary to have enriched uranium - if you do not have enriched uranium you will never have the possibility of a military nuclear programme.
Second, you need a missile to launch, and, third, you need the actual detonator of the bomb.
The second stage is where they have stopped and that is what happened in 2003.
That is one part.
The second part is the missile and you know that the technology on missiles is moving rapidly.
We are concerned.
This is not one of the key issues but it is an issue.
Now we have a range of 1 300 km, which is no little matter.
The third thing is enriched material, which is in breach and is continuing to be produced.
That is the core of the problem: we have to see how we can get an agreement on this.
Let me repeat: a nuclear-powered plant to produce energy - you may like it or not, but that is not the issue being debated today - requires, as you know, at least seven or eight years from the moment the contract is signed to the moment the power plant is operational.
There is no contract whatsoever between Iran and anybody who can produce a nuclear-powered plant to produce energy - kilowatts - none except for the Russian one.
As you know the Russian contract has a clause that states, firstly, enriched uranium will be provided by Russia and, secondly, that the burned material - that means enriched plutonium or whatever is at the end of process - will be taken to Russia, so they will not need to have enriched uranium because it is provided.
Secondly, if they continue enriching, the question is why? - because they do not have anywhere to put it, no other power plant.
So this is a question that it is fair to ask and it is difficult to get an answer.
This is the only response to this question that I can give you, because it is something that is under your control and that of the leaders and citizens of the European Union.
I have tried to give you an honest account of our interpretation of the situation, the problems and the three main issues that we have to be concerned about as Europeans.
I say again that we have great respect for the country - we have a profound respect for Iran - and we would like very much to engage with it and also see them move in that direction.
(ES) Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament will adopt a resolution on Iran which will be supported by our political Group.
It is no coincidence that the first part of that resolution concerns the human rights situation.
Last week our Foreign Affairs Committee held an entirely unsatisfactory meeting with Mr Jalili, who failed to reply to any of the questions put to him on human rights, torture, public executions, the purchase of North Korean missiles and Soviet torpedoes capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads.
Mr Solana, we have heard very clearly that you are awaiting replies to the questions you put to Mr Jalili; Commissioner Ferrero has informed us of this, and we too are still waiting for replies to the questions we put to him.
Therefore it is not sufficient for us to express regret that they have not suspended their nuclear programme, disregarding the calls of the international community and three United Nations resolutions.
As Mr Solana has just said, the international community is convinced that they are enriching uranium for a programme whose purposes are not peaceful.
In view of this, it is simply not enough, Mr President, for us to say in the motion for a resolution that we are not going to go down the path of a cooperation or association agreement with Iran until such time as substantial progress has been made in human rights and there are objective safeguards such as to provide us with clear guarantees that no headway is being made in uranium-enrichment for peaceful purposes.
Therefore, Mr Solana, the question I would ask is whether you believe that the fourth resolution which the United Nations Security Council is going to make, on the basis of the Vienna meeting of the permanemt members of the Security Council plus Germany, will be sufficient for Iran to listen to the international community's calls?
What, Mr Solana, should the content of the United Nations Resolution be if it is to take up this challenge and mitigate the threat to peace and international security posed by Iran's unranium-enrichment programme?
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Ahmadinejad said today in Busher, in the south of the country, that Israel is a filthy Zionist entity that will fall sooner or later.
This is a statement that is of course unacceptable and obviously meant as propaganda.
Political elections will take place in Iran on 14 March, in which the promises he has failed to keep will count more than those he has made.
In addition, the election campaign in the USA is in full swing and, for this reason, we must consider the facts.
Today, Iran is emerging as the leading power in the Gulf and Washington is trying to negotiate an agreement with that country.
In December the American secret service decided that Iran does not represent an immediate threat.
On 12 January the director of the IAEA, Mr El Baradei, obtained assurances from the Iranians on all the outstanding questions.
Pressure on Iran will be maintained, but it would be helpful to reach an agreement that would be workable for everyone and for regional stability, and to avoid any radical and often ineffective measures.
We should remember Iraq and how ineffective sanctions were against that country.
Iran's role in the new balance of power must be recognised and Iran must be offered guarantees of security in a highly turbulent regional context.
The direct involvement of the USA is essential for the success of discussions that, at this point, should not rule anything out, which is, in fact, what the European Union is doing.
On the other hand it is absolutely clear that Iran should accept certain obligations: it should abandon its nuclear and military ambitions, with stringent controls, take on a constructive role in solving existing conflicts, show respect for human rights and for women's rights, and, looking to wider issues, for democracy as well.
Not long ago Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, sent me an e-mail in which she denounced the serious and ever more frequent violations of human rights.
She wrote that today, in Iran, this is far more serious than the nuclear issue.
We should listen to her.
Mr President, I thank Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for the immensely hard work on the issue of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is causing so many headaches and worries to so many people internationally and on the Security Council of the UN.
It was my pleasure to represent my group on the recent delegation to the Islamic Republic of Iran just before Christmas, when we had a very exceptionally good sequence of meetings, to which Mr Solana has already referred, as has Mrs Ferrero-Waldner.
Of course, our call for dialogue in the Islamic Republic of Iran does fall on very welcome ears, because, as you well know, the former President of Iran put forward to the United Nations in 2000 the idea of the intercultural year of dialogue, which you yourself have picked up this very year here in the European Union.
I believe there are huge possibilities for dialogue, but not just on human rights and not just on the all-important nuclear issue.
I believe we should be having dialogue on cultural issues - music, art, archaeology, painting, calligraphy - in which we share so much historical reference and so much potential for future gain.
I also believe that one critical item we should discuss is this so-called barrier between Islam and democracy.
Perhaps it has not been noticed that the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that she has cracked that particular difficulty, and that her form of democracy is fully comprehensible with the Islamic Republic of Iran's version of Islam, the all-important Shariah law and the Shiite Islamic tradition.
I think this, again, is something that we should welcome and should discuss this very year, perhaps with former President Khatami or with other members of the Iranian religious influence and tradition.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion, also in the light of what I have heard during this debate, is still that the only path to follow is definitely that of discussion and dialogue, even if it is difficult to understand on what basis this dialogue can develop.
How, indeed, is it possible to have a dialogue with a country that does not respect the rights of the child and extends the death penalty to minors?
With a country, or rather it would be better and more correct to say with a regime, that has public hangings, a regime that threatens to want to wipe out the state of Israel?
And, on the nuclear issue, should we just put it off and not even doubt that nuclear power is for peaceful use?
How far should we believe the military plans for national defence?
In addition, can we consider a regime that finances guerrilla warfare in neighbouring countries to be trustworthy?
With regard then to the CIA report, I would suggest that we should not have too many illusions about its reliability.
It would not be the first time for such a report later to be publicly repudiated.
It is certainly the case that we cannot refuse anyone the possibility of experimenting with nuclear power for civilian, and not military, purposes, but not only does President Ahmadinejad not provide guarantees, he does not give a single guarantee, in fact he makes us fear the worst.
In ruling out the option of military intervention - this I believe to be the view of all the representatives and Members of the European Parliament: avoiding military intervention is absolutely fundamental - I believe that the option of sanctions would be a disaster for everyone, it would penalise the economy and it would penalise a defenceless, uninformed and innocent people.
I would suggest again that diplomacy should be used, because, and I repeat, nothing good has ever come out of sanctions, they serve only to increase hatred of the West and of the United States of America in particular.
Mr President, deceit is a weapon of war approved of in the Koran under the doctrine of taqiyya.
Iran professes no plans to develop nuclear weapons.
Evidence to the contrary is overwhelming.
They had 3 000 uranium centrifuges already.
Not one can be used to generate nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Together they will produce one bomb's worth of weapons-grade uranium a year.
Now Iran plans to build 5 000 more centrifuges.
Meanwhile, illegal secret imports of raw uranium arrive from the Congo, a country the EU supports with humanitarian aid.
Britain still allows Iranian students to study nuclear physics at our universities.
In addition to this, Iran, Syria and North Korea are working together to assemble missiles and chemical warheads.
Last year, technicians from all three countries were killed when something went wrong in Syria.
Traces of Sarin gas were later detected in the atmosphere.
Whether or not these countries successfully develop nuclear warheads, chemical warheads would certainly be deployable in the near future.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the EU's negotiating attempts as regards confirming the right to self-determination and I support the synergy of the IAEA's Iran plan of action.
It is praiseworthy and helps to put our worries to rest, and also to defuse political and strategic speculation based on a theoretical threat to peace.
Moreover, in item 5 of the resolution there is an admission that we should give up on speculative political rhetoric as regards Iran.
The entire first part of the resolution and the proposal to create a new multilateral framework for the use of nuclear energy are part of the same approach.
However, the second part seems to be demagoguery.
Violations of human rights in so many other regions of the world have not attracted this level of diligent condemnation.
Examples of this are the recent resolutions on Pakistan and China, which were not nearly as strong in tone, nor was there such evident support for the internal opposition.
This forces me to declare my opposition to the resolution, because human rights and freedoms are absolute values that cannot be applied differently in different situations, and do not lend themselves to inequality between requests and condemnation.
Mr President, the Iranian nuclear programme remains the source of our greatest concern.
We hope that the process of negotiating a solution will be continued.
The European Union should stand united on this very difficult issue, and we should support the efforts of the High Representative and of the Commission, Member States and the international community, including the recently proposed UN Security Council resolution.
Efforts should be aimed at encouraging Iran to return to talks concerning long-term arrangements resolving the nuclear issue.
We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this House decided to invite Mr Jalili to talk and to have a dialogue.
Our committee was dissatisfied with the answers given, and we know how difficult dialogue is.
However, the meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs has shown our unanimous stand on the Iranian question, and it has also sent a strong political signal to the Iranian Government.
If we want to continue any meaningful dialogue, we have to restore credibility to our relations.
Our Iranian partners must introduce absolute transparency to their nuclear programme by cooperating fully with the IAEA.
They must fully implement the provisions of the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement, and we should maintain pressure on the Iranian Government to comply with its commitments and to make them understand that this is the only way to gain international recognition, as well as to pursue successfully economic development to the benefit of its citizens.
The human rights situation in Iran has seriously deteriorated recently, and we should keep condemning the systematic violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially those carried out on juvenile offenders and women.
As a community based on values, having at the core of our values human rights and democracy, and looking at stability and security as our highest concern, we should not and cannot disregard the worsening human rights situation there, and we should do our utmost to convince our partners that it pays to respect the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution to the debate today allow me to concentrate on two aspects of relations with Iran.
A civil society is the first aspect.
As I experienced myself during my recent visit to Tehran, a very strong and active civil society exists in Iran.
Women, journalists, national and religious minorities all strive for their rights.
The student scene is fairly lively.
Bus drivers, bakers and many other professions organise their own independent trade unions.
Economists and entrepreneurs are pushing for privatisation and liberalisation of the Iranian economy.
All these groups and elements that form Iranian society are turning to Europe, to the European Union, seeking dialogue and help.
That is why I would like to call on the Commission and on High Representative Javier Solana to put the new tool for democracy and human rights that is at our disposal to efficient use as a part of this dialogue.
It is also my opinion that the European Union should have diplomatic representation in Iran.
Not only would this boost discussion and dialogue with the civil society; it would also boost cooperation with local institutions and authorities in areas of common interest.
Indeed we share many common interests with Iran, in spite of our differences of opinion on the nuclear program or on human rights.
I will mention only one country neighbouring Iran, and that is Afghanistan.
I am convinced that it benefits neither us nor Iran if, for example, tonnes of Afghan illegal drugs flood Europe.
We have similar common interests when it comes to the issue of Afghan refugees and when it comes to the issue of an overall peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan.
That is just one of the many reasons why the European Union needs to have its own diplomatic representation in Tehran.
Mr President, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have stressed repeatedly in their presentations today the need for dialogue, negotiation and persuasion.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner highlighted the need for people-to-people contact.
She told us of the success of our Erasmus Mundus and poverty alleviation programmes.
So, are we training their nuclear physicists in our universities?
Are we, at our taxpayers' expense, paying for poverty relief in one of the richest oil-producing nations in the world because they have chosen to spend billions on a nuclear weapons programme?
What has our policy of appeasement achieved?
According to Mr Solana, so far, no success.
He said that the Iranian regime continues to ignore us.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said that we have more executions than ever before.
Well, let me tell you, Mr President, 23 people were executed in the first two weeks of this year, including several women.
Five people had their hands or feet amputated.
Men and women continue to be stoned to death by this jihadist, misogynous, homophobic, genocidal, brutal regime which is a world sponsor of terror.
If we wish really to support Iranian students, we should support the brave students of Teheran University, who have been demonstrating for the past five days, demanding regime change.
Instead of backing appeasement, we should back the legitimate Iranian Opposition.
Instead of keeping the PMOI on our terror list, we should put the revolutionary guards of Iran on the EU terror list.
(DE) Mr President, as we have just heard, even here in our European Parliament there are representatives whose priority is not to modify the behaviour of the Iranian regime but to destroy that regime.
I believe there is one thing that has to be spelled out very clearly, namely the logical imperative that those who seek the destruction of a regime and focus their policies on that goal will do nothing to modify the regime's behaviour.
Yet such modification must be our aim whenever we discuss the nuclear issue.
The diplomatic offensive would be greatly reinforced if the United States were directly involved in the talks, because it can offer something the European Union cannot provide to the same extent, namely security guarantees.
As Mr Solana pointed out, the findings of the US intelligence services do not warrant the conclusion that the Iranian programme is not a potential threat.
That is indeed a problem, and it cannot be solved by removing the pressure.
The issue cannot be taken out of the UN Security Council, because that is liable to result in the Iranian regime eventually saying, 'Thanks, that's it now - we have enough highly enriched uranium; it's time for us to renounce the Non-Proliferation Treaty and start producing our nuclear weapons'.
Should that scenario materialise, we would have no alternative but to revert to the strategy of nuclear deterrence we know from the sixties and seventies.
One thing we should exclude from this debate at all costs - and let there be no doubt about this - is the so-called military option.
Whatever is understood by the term 'the West', whether it be North America alone or whether it include Europe, exercising the so-called military option would be a political disaster which would rebound on the West for decades to come in its relations not only with the Muslim world but also with countries such as India that have helped to put this issue on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
(SK) Let me say how deeply worried I am about the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran: use of the death penalty, torture, inhumane treatment of prisoners and repression of political opponents.
We should categorically condemn such obvious breaches of the human rights and fundamental freedoms that form the basis of our democratic societies.
Personally, as a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly I am rather worried about the security issue and about the fact that Iran, in spite of protests from the European Union and the international community, is continuing to develop its nuclear programme.
In spite of assurances that it is doing so entirely for peaceful purposes, it is very difficult not to be alarmed about the direction in which this situation is going.
In conclusion, I would like to refer to the fact that Russia recently supplied nuclear material to Iran.
There are further indications telling us that Iran is an untrustworthy partner and we should act accordingly.
Mr President, have all EU Member States been consistent in the political message delivered to Iran to back the efforts of the EU three and Mr Solana on the nuclear file by living up to the imposition of the economic sanctions?
And have EU Member States and you, Mr Solana, been pressing the Bush Administration to talk to Iran directly, not just about Iraq, but about the nuclear file in particular?
Or are you of the view that there is no point, that it will wait for the next US Administration?
(PL) Mr President, I want to return to a point made by Mr Solana, that is, the correct interpretation of the CIA report on Iran's nuclear programme.
Let me repeat what Mr Solana said: only one element has been halted, and it is extremely doubtful whether it has been halted definitively.
The Iranian opposition claims the programme has simply been dispersed over other sites but is still continuing.
I think we should believe this, since it was the Iranian opposition that first drew attention to the military aspects of the nuclear programme in Iran, and its claims proved to be absolutely true.
Which brings me to the next point, namely, that it is high time to remove the People's Mujaheddin from the list of terrorist organisations.
The courts, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Italian Parliament have already spoken out on this matter.
It is time we did so too.
(FR) Mr President, like Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I do not see any difference between civil and military nuclear power.
Mr Solana has explained to us that uranium is all that is needed to make a bomb.
I think one would have to be a little naÃ¯ve to believe that a country as rich in natural resources as Iran needs nuclear energy for its development.
On the other hand, we know very well that it needs nuclear energy to make the bomb.
Mr Solana has also said that nuclear energy is a cause of instability and we do not have any influence over Iran.
He is quite right.
We entirely agree with his proposal that enrichment should be banned.
I shall even go further than that: I think nuclear energy should simply be banned.
Only 4% of energy worldwide is nuclear at the moment.
The question I should like to ask Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is this: do they not think that France, and its President Mr Sarkozy, are playing with fire and creating instability in the world by signing nuclear agreements with countries like Libya, China and Georgia?
Could we not use the unhappy experience of Iran as an opportunity to put a stop to nuclear proliferation in the world?
(NL) Mr President, the debate on Iran is about more than nuclear energy, threats of war and human rights violations.
In his introduction Mr Solana has already described why Iran, despite having certain elements of democracy and a high level of education, is not a nice place to live for so many people.
Many of those who are being persecuted by the Iranian government or cannot live freely under the current regime have fled to Europe.
The European Union and its Member States must not stand in these people's way, and must allow the peaceful opposition in exile the greatest possible freedom.
This is why it is important that the European Court of Justice has ruled that it was wrong to put this organisation on the list of terrorist organisations.
It is important that Parliament should point out to the Council that it is unjust and unacceptable to do so.
This list is one area where there can be no compromise with the Iranian regime.
Mr President, I would like to know if anybody can give me an answer.
During the parliamentarians' visit to Teheran, did they attend any public executions?
Especially those in which cranes of European production were used.
(CS) I would like to mention that the Iranian nuclear program paradoxically started off during the time when Iran was a United States ally.
Americans advised the Shah to build twenty nuclear power stations.
It looks like times have changed: ally has become enemy and Iran's image is full of contradictions.
Although I know about the suffering of our friends in the Tudeh Party, I must also point out that no other Arab country enjoys such a degree of plurality and as developed a civil society as Iran.
The trade union scene mentioned by Mr RouÄek definitely merits attention, as does the women's movement.
In my opinion, Mr RouÄek's proposals to establish a European Union representation in Tehran should be examined and supported.
It is essential to develop these relations.
Iran is a large nation and a great culture that has more similarities with us than we can imagine.
Mr President, Iran remains a danger to the stability of the world and the Middle East.
Iranian jihadis are fighting alongside terrorists in Iraq, killing British soldiers.
Iran's judges routinely pass death sentences on homosexuals and teenagers.
Why is Iran pressing ahead with uranium enrichment when it has no operational nuclear power stations or even plans to build them in the future?
Why is Iran developing Shahab III missiles with the potential to carry nuclear warheads and drop them on European cities?
Our message must be clear and uncompromising.
Iran will not be allowed by the international community to arm itself with nuclear weapons.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this was, of course, a very important discussion.
Why?
Because there is a huge civil society in Iran that certainly would like to have a different way of life, but there is still a very difficult regime.
I think we all know that the nuclear issue is the huge stumbling block at this moment.
It spoils all the possibilities for development and also for a bilateral relationship, which would have very great potential.
This is what I said repeatedly to Mr Jalili: 'Why do you not take this?
Why is there no possibility of entering into a dialogue with you?
Why do you not show some political will on this?'
