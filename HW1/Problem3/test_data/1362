In supporting it, however, we must not repeat the mistakes of the past, by which I mean, primarily, that we have to give the market more of a chance.
For this reason, I ask that an EU internal market for biomass or long-term subsidies not be introduced immediately.
We must not go back down the route of farm subsidies, only to realise a few years later that our well-meaning policy is incompatible with WTO requirements.
Instead, we must recognise that rising oil prices make the cultivation of biomass interesting even without state support.
Only where the critical mass for market integration is lacking should political support be introduced, and then, support programmes must be for a limited period and on a decreasing basis, and progress must be permitted.
Genetic engineering springs to mind: particularly in the case of energy crops, this has the potential to bring vital economic benefits in global competition.
Therefore, there are good free-market prospects for renewable raw materials in Europe.
Politicians must supply the framework to enable this delicate plant to become a strong energy source.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Parish, on the work he has done in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The resolution that the European Parliament is going to issue today praises the Commissionâs initiatives to promote non-food crops and, given their crucial importance, calls upon it to implement them as soon as possible.
Initiatives such as the biomass plan or the new legislation on biofuels are awaited with particular interest in depressed rural areas and those experiencing specific difficulties.
For example, in my country, Spain, non-food crops are in fact seen as a genuine socio-economic solution for those areas which have already been affected by the reduction or disappearance of indigenous crops, as in the case of the recent COMs in cotton and beet.
In order for these crops to be a genuine alternative, however, we must guarantee their viability by means of a policy on prices and fiscal incentives.
The Commissioner is well aware that it is not just a question of offering solutions to farmers in difficulties.
Through this new initiative, our environment will be improved as a result of the contribution of clean fuels.
Business will be done, but at the same time we will be combating depopulation.
In other words, we will all be winners.
I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission whether it intends to listen to this Parliament and, as our resolution states, draw up a recommendation to the Member States on fiscal incentives and reductions of duties and taxes.
As we are all very well aware, an action of this type, which would not be legislative, would be of great assistance in terms of promoting the use of renewable energy and stimulate the cultivation of the raw materials that make it possible.
I believe that we must not miss this opportunity.
The extremely important energy debate is opening up at a time when we are in the midst of discussions in this Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, the momentum building behind green energy, combined with the pressure on traditional agriculture, unite to offer agricultural production for non-food purposes as an alternative for some, as they consider necessary diversification.
EU-wide experiences of the use of biomass for producing energy, involving both renewable raw materials and organic farm waste, should be pooled so that the most viable initiatives can be replicated across Europe.
My government recently announced its intention to develop Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in alternative energy.
The EU should financially support that endeavour.
Tax incentives, increased aid in respect of land use to grow energy crops, and the focused use of Structural Funds: all have a part to play.
Likewise, planning policies must help, not impede, progress.
In my constituency, an anaerobic digestion plant was recently forced to close because of rigid and unnecessary planning restrictions.
We clearly need a joined-up approach by various departments.
Â Â  â I also wish to congratulate Mr Parish on his report, which I welcome.
This extremely important initiative highlights a problem that all of us must endeavour to combat.
Firstly, I feel that crops for non-food purposes can make a significant contribution to Europe's energy sector, which is the subject of ongoing analysis.
It is increasingly important to ensure energy security in the EU and greater autonomy in relation to the world outside the EU.
I feel, in this regard, that the use of biofuels could make a positive contribution.
Furthermore, I also believe that the promotion of crops for non-food purposes will be of great benefit from an agricultural point of view, especially with regard to energy crops, which could bring fresh hope for the future of European farming, and to the much-misunderstood CAP.
The search for alternatives to keep agriculture alive is of urgent importance, given the bleak future forecast for Europeâs food production, which faces competition from countries with fewer social and environmental concerns and where low cost production is permissible.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the new Member States, including Hungary, I would like to thank Mr Parish, who noticed that new Member States cannot receive financial assistance from EU sources for the cultivation of plants for energy purposes.
Therefore, the request expressed in the report, that the European Commission eliminate the obstacles to plant cultivation for energy purposes in new Member States and facilitate assistance from the European Union, has particular importance.
Another very positive element is that according to the report, assistance must be granted outside of the SAPS system, independently of the âphasing inâ related to direct payments.
The report of the European Parliament supports the interests of new Member States unequivocally, and therefore I ask Mrs Fischer Boel and the Commission to consider these proposals, because assistance for energy purposes is extremely important in the new Member States, too, in order to ensure jobs.
Â Â  Mr President, the idea of promoting crops for non-food purposes is excellent and very timely.
It is timely because, since joining the European Union, Polish farmers have experienced first-hand what limiting milk production or liquidating sugar production means, and that subsidy levels are not equal across the Union.
The production of biomass and bio fuels in particular will not only improve the state of the environment and increase employment in rural areas, but will also preserve human dignity by increasing the income of whole families.
Rather than worrying about the falling price of porkers, farmers will be able to celebrate the rising fuel prices.
Until now, farmers have protected us from the threat of hunger.
Now they can save us from an energy crisis and breathe new life into the common agricultural policy.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere thanks to our rapporteur, MrÂ Parish, who has done a very good job in producing this own-initiative report.
In view of current events, mixtures of all energy sources and the share of total energy demand accounted for by renewable energy are the most topical issues of the day.
We must seize this opportunity in the interests of the widespread use of non-food crops.
Following the agricultural reforms, farmers can cultivate energy crops on set-aside land, but alongside food production, which remains a priority.
This initial step must be followed up, however, which means that we need to strengthen research and development, extending to modern economic biotechnology.
What are important are market-integration aids and concentration on competitiveness, which means that it is important to give the promotion of bioenergy from non-food crops, which makes sense from an ecological point of view, a basis that is economically viable in the long term.
We still need more jobs in rural areas.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank you once again for the valuable contribution that the European Parliament has been making to this very important area.
I am very impressed with the overwhelming support that I have seen here in Parliament today.
We have a lot of work ahead of us.
The year 2006 will be particularly challenging, with a number of key issues to be addressed: firstly, the biofuel targets in the context of the review of the Biofuels Directive; secondly, the possibility of increasing the blend of biofuels into conventional fuels â work is already under way to review the Fuel Quality Directive; and thirdly, the energy crop regime, which we will also review this year.
All the different actions are set out in the biomass action plan and the biofuels strategy, which must be put on track this year.
There is plenty to do and we are very dedicated.
This is why we have set up a new unit in my department with special responsibility for biomass and biofuels.
We will also continue to find ways of encouraging the enormous economic, social and environmental potential of non-food applications, particularly those highlighted in the report.
I firmly believe that the whole economy stands to gain from the contribution which renewable bio-resources can make to ensuring a sustainable future for Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The promotion of crop production for non-food purposes is a unique opportunity that can potentially bring considerable social, economic and environmental benefits for European farmers and rural economies.
As a matter of fact, the report clearly highlights the potential offered by the developments and the investments in the non-food crops sector for farmers.
Developing the non-food crops sector is very likely to have a positive impact on farmers that undergo the consequences of the sugar CMO reform.
We should therefore support the development of this sector as it brings alternative productions for European farmers under competition pressure.
Moreover, it is clear that supporting crop production for non-food purposes is in line with the targets set by the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies for the development and use of renewable energies, as crop production for energy purposes brings a large potential in order to meet Unionâs energy needs.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should appreciate it if the President could speak a little more slowly, as the interpretation is not heard immediately.
Â Â  I do, in fact, read the titles of reports more quickly when they are long and complicated.
I hope that the interpreters, who have the same text in front of them, are able to follow.
Â Â  Mr President, you may have an appointment somewhere else later on, I do not know, but we are here to do a job and to vote.
You are going at such a furious pace that we cannot put our hands up in time in order to vote.
Could you please slow down?
Â Â  As regards my timetable, I can reassure you.
I shall not be leaving Parliament before tomorrow morning so I have plenty of time.
I am not sure that is the case for all Members.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to request a clarification, an addition.
After
âmanagement expenditure forâ
the following phrase:
âany executive agency created or extended to administer this programmeâ
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to table an oral amendment with the intention of changing recitalÂ C. It is a matter of substituting the terms, which I will read out in English as that is the only version I have:
âŠ âenvironmental protectionâ by âenvironmental sustainabilityâ âŠ
I believe these are the recognised terms.
The text would then read as follows:
âŠ âwhereas there are three main objectives for EU energy policy: security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainabilityâ.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  Mr President, I rise on a point of order under RuleÂ 151 on inadmissibility of amendments.
I would like you to rule that none of these amendments are admissible because at 10.45 a.m. this morning when we last checked, there was no voting list on the electronic system.
We therefore do not have a voting list and we will be voting on something we cannot see.
I would therefore respectfully ask you to move on to the next item of business and defer this until we have a proper voting list.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the services say that the voting lists have been available since yesterday evening.
Having said that, they were not necessarily in the place where you looked on Parliamentâs web site, as they were moved because of the reorganisation of the site.
Nonetheless, given what the services tell me, I do not see why I should act on your comment, as the voting lists were indeed available yesterday evening on the Internet.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a minor amendment, aimed at making the text more precise: to change the word 'historically' to 'frequently'.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would much prefer to keep the original text because the word âfrequentlyâ clearly changes the meaning.
I thank MrÂ MartÃ­nez MartÃ­nez for the amendment and I accept it.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, this House has provided a major impetus to the development of European political parties.
We now have 10 party families, which shows the variety of our political culture.
This report marks the start of a new stage that is to simplify the work of these parties.
European parties are a necessary part of European democracy, and we hope, above all, that the parties nominate top candidates for the office of Commission President before the next European elections, so that the public has the choice between personalities and programmes and is able to participate in deciding what kind of Europe it wants.
I should like to thank the party Chairman and Secretary-General for their important suggestions.
This budget heading is one of the few for which Parliament itself is responsible, and so I would also thank the Bureau and the administration of this House for their truly good management of this delicate budget heading for the European parties.
I would ask the House to adopt the report.
Â Â  Mr President, could you tell us whether any Members of this House declared a financial interest before voting on the previous report?
Â Â  To my knowledge, no Member has made a declaration.
I will remind you of the rule: we have a special register with which to declare once and for all any financial interests, thus obviating the need to declare any possible financial interests at every debate.
Therefore, if you want to avoid any disagreement, complete the register properly.
Â Â  Mr President, this is an oral amendment to replace the words âimproving compatibility of school hours with working hoursâ with âimproving the compatibility of working hours with school hoursâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say that, as rapporteur, I initially did not think this made any difference to the text.
Having looked at it, however, I think it does improve the text so, personally, I am in favour.
Â Â  Are there any objections to this oral amendment?
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report by MrÂ Brok is formally technical, but nevertheless very important.
I voted in favour of adopting the report, and I believe that by adopting this agreement we in the European Parliament are showing our desire to strengthen our relations with the independent state of Israel, the only democratic country in the Middle East.
It is important that we in the European Parliament support countries where European values, such as democracy, human rights and the principles of the rule of law are in effect.
Accordingly, Israel needs our undivided support.
I hope that this vote will send the signal that we in the European Parliament respect basic European values, and that we cannot permit cooperation or negotiations with the terrorist organisation Hamas, which has come to power in the Palestinian Autonomous Area.
Before we can even talk about negotiations, Hamas must unambiguously 1) acknowledge Israelâs right to be a Jewish state, 2) cease all acts of terror, 3) give up its weapons, 4) refuse to support other violent groups, and 5) respect existing international agreements between Israel and the PA (Oslo Accords, the Roadmap, etc.).
I hope that the European Union will stand by its basic values.
It is important to support independent, democratic Israel and its right to exist.
Â Â  MrÂ President, people are starting to leave, so I shall be brief.
Since I was unable to take the floor at the vote last week in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate that it is important to separate the programmes for consumer protection and health from each other, even if the Commission did not give this a particularly positive assessment, because, ultimately, the two programmes have different legal bases, and hence consumer protection needs to be afforded in a different way.
Secondly, I should like to use this explanation of vote to reiterate that, generally speaking, attempting to create further EU agencies and thus spread the competences of the various authorities wider, hence decreasing transparency, is not an effective way to proceed.
For this reason, I welcome the Thyssen report of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which takes full account of this concern.
Adopting the report today with the oral amendment on financing was a good solution.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report, as it gives autonomy to the Consumer Protection Programme, in contrast with the Commissionâs attempt to create one single programme also encompassing health.
Quite apart from this key difference, which we support, the report introduces significant improvements, in terms of the areas to be addressed, the overall amounts of money involved, and increased expenditure for the functioning of European consumer organisations representing consumer interests.
Although in some areas we would like to have gone further, we now hope that the Commission and the Council take on board Parliamentâs position.
Â Â  . I welcome the Community's Action Programme to set up a joint health and consumer protection programme.
The Action Programme aims to deliver an opinion on the consumer protection aspect for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - the committee responsible.
It will do this by harmonising consumer protection throughout the single market, enabling citizens to move freely within the EU and buy goods with the same confidence as in their countries of origin.
By providing a better understanding of consumers and markets, this Action Programme protects citizens from risks and threats beyond the control of individuals.
I am also particularly in favour of this Action Programme as it will put health and consumer issues at the centre of policy-making in the EU.
Â Â  .I should like to congratulate Mrs Thyssen, who has done an excellent piece of work.
I thank her all the more because she has been willing to incorporate the amendments that I had tabled concerning relations between consumers and craft enterprises.
Craft workers play a vital role everyday in terms of giving information and advice to consumers, with whom they are in direct contact.
I am also satisfied that the two programmes have been kept separate: health and consumer protection.
These policies are of equal importance to people, and each of the programmes can only be reinforced by this.
Nevertheless, I am still extremely worried about the Councilâs proposals concerning the Communityâs budget for 2007 to 2013, which would lead in a few years time to a drastic reduction in the current policy for consumer protection at European level.
It is unthinkable that this budget should be reduced to EURÂ 5 million a year in 2009, that is to say one cent a year for each European consumer.
This is by no means enough to finance a consumer protection policy worthy of the name and, moreover, of fundamental importance to peopleâs daily lives.
Nonetheless, I am voting in favour of this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am including the Parish report when I say that there are three things that Europe needs to secure its future: firstly, a healthy environment, particularly in terms of air, water and soil; secondly, healthy food and enough of it; and, thirdly, energy.
Rural areas are capable of offering us all these three things in sufficient measure and independently of external sources, on which we would only become reliant.
In this respect, it was disastrous when, a few months ago, in this Chamber, Tony Blair defamed farmers in Europe, in particular, as backward-looking.
Every cent that we invest in agriculture and in rural areas is an investment in the future of Europe.
These are three vital fields, which are full of innovation and future prospects.
The key to securing Europeâs future â and this is a revolutionary development of which we have yet to take nearly enough account â lies to an ever-increasing extent in our rural areas and rural, decentralised structures.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to propose a calculation justifying why I voted in favour of nuclear power.
If emissions in the EU are cut by approximately 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the first phase of emissions trading, the market price in terms of emissions permits will be 2.5Â billion a year at current prices.
A cautious estimate is that the price of electricity in the European wholesale electricity market could rise on average by EUR 10 per megawatt-hour as a result of emissions trading.
Since electricity consumption in the EU stands at approximately 3Â 000 terawatt-hours a year, the costs of emissions trading in the wholesale electricity market will be around EUR 30 billion a year.
One option which goes against the principle of the market would be to tax electricity.
I am not suggesting that, but I do propose a thought experiment.
If emissions trading were replaced with a tax on electricity and the revenue were used for genuine investment in emissions reduction, the 30Â billion or so a year could be used as investment aid to build up a huge amount of capacity, which would remove the need for fossil fuels.
Nuclear power is an example of a form of emission-free energy which the electricity market does not support, and which in fact is not really needed either, unlike many other forms of energy.
If you imagine, however, that an investment of 3Â billion would result in cuts of approximately 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through the use of nuclear power, the 30Â billion would in fact result in that annual cut in emissions through the construction of nuclear power plants, with the difference that the electricity produced could still be sold.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of the joint resolution submitted by four political groups on the security of energy supply in the European Union.
The issue of energy is going to become crucial in a post-oil age as far as guaranteeing environmentally-friendly economic development and social progress is concerned.
The fact that nuclear power is no longer a taboo subject is a positive development, and I am delighted that sustainable energy sources have been highlighted, together with the urgent need for research and development programmes to gather pace in this area.
I regret that the idea of introducing a Community tool to control oil prices has not been taken up.
In this motion for a resolution, it is not a question of opposing the increase in oil prices, which is unavoidable, but rather of softening the brutal effects of such an increase by making it an annual one.
Finally, it is very important that the European Council draft a clear policy in this sector which, it must be pointed out, is not the responsibility of Europe, and this so as not to give false hope to our fellow citizens who, if they were not satisfied, would once again turn against the European ideal.
Â Â  . The PPE-DE Group has decided to abstain on paragraphs 10, 22, 27 and 29 not because we have objections to the content, but because these paragraphs were clearly defined as originated by the Verts/ALE Group.
That group regularly abuses the process of negotiating joint motions.
Until the last moment they skilfully obtain the insertion of several paragraphs coming from their own resolution and the deletion of text they dislike, but at the end they refuse to sign the joint resolution, for some spurious reason such as one word in the text being unacceptable for the Greens.
Compromise means giving and taking on both sides and at the end accepting something that is not exactly what you originally wanted.
The PPE-DE Group believes that if the Verts/ALE Group wants to play its role in a democratic and fair way it has to play the game.
Â Â  . As the resolution says, the import dependency for energy of the 25 EU Member States is extremely high â 48% in 2002, potentially rising to 71% in 2030 if no additional measures are taken.
Some of the figures paint a very clear picture:
- 76.6% of EU demand for oil, 53% of demand for gas, 35.4% for coal and almost 100% for uranium and uranium products is met from imports;
- EU-25 gross electricity generation is as follows: 31% nuclear, 25% solid fuel (predominantly coal), 18% gas, 14% renewable energy sources and 5% oil;
- final energy use in the EU-25 was 28% in the industrial sector, 31% for transport and 41% in buildings.
It is therefore clear that measures must be taken to strengthen cooperation, research, public policies and appropriate investments, if we are to reduce the Member Statesâ dependency and to increase energy efficiency.
There are a number of proposals in the resolution to which we object, namely the prominence given to the liberalisation of the sector, to competition, and to the internal energy market.
This path can only serve to strengthen the economic and financial groups, and will not lead to any improvement for the economically weakest countries and the people who live there.
Â Â  .We are partly in agreement with the statements made in this resolution: concern about our countriesâ dependency on energy, and its possible economic and social consequences; and the need to promote local renewable energy sources that are more environmentally friendly, to invest in energy efficiency or to research new ways of saving energy.
There is, however, a lack of attention paid to the predicted exhaustion of world fossil fuel resources.
On the other hand, we do not agree with the role that the Commission has bestowed upon itself in the energy sector, a role that is not in the Treaties, that even your European Constitution reduced to a reaffirmation of the existing situation, but which this Parliament wishes to develop.
The liberalisation of the market for gas and electricity only results in an increase in the price of energy for the consumer, disruptions in supply and a general move towards the merging of businesses.
Even my country, in which almost 90% of the electricity production comes from nuclear power or from sustainable energy sources, and which traditionally produces a surplus, is now encountering these problems.
Thanks to Brussels!
The market principle alone is not compatible with the pursuit of national strategic objectives or the safeguarding of a countryâs vital interests.
The Member States must remain the only masters of their own energy policy.
Â Â  . I voted for this resolution because as a London MEP I believe that recently published energy sector inquiries found that some continental firms have been guilty of price fixing.
It is this kind of price fixing and long-term contracts which have led to disparities between London and continental gas prices.
I want the European Commission to respond to this robustly.
I am also concerned about key issues of fuel poverty in my constituency not covered in this resolution.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy makes an accurate analysis of the energy supply problems that have recently come to light.
What we can refer to as the âenergy questionâ is the expected result of economic progress, coupled with the restricted production and processing capacity of traditional energy sources.
The most serious problem is that these elements of the equation are very difficult to change.
The economic growth of giants such as Brazil, Russia, India and China is a predictable and, fortunately, incontrovertible fact.
Furthermore, even if there is some increase in the production and processing capacity â assuming that the capacity of refineries is resolved in time â the finite nature of these resources is also irreversible.
I should also like to say that I have major doubts as to the immediate effectiveness of reducing consumption, unless this process can be extended to the production of goods, equipment, transport and buildings.
I also feel that this debate can only be realistic if nuclear energy can be included in the debate alongside renewable energy.
Lastly, I endorse the Green Paper, and the resolution, especially as it introduces the issue of security into the debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, anyone who has ever flown over Africa in daylight knows how much the Democratic Republic of Congo is its geostrategic heart.
For this reason, we have to attempt to secure democracy and stability there.
However, the present critical discussion of this issue should be seen as a last warning sign that the necessary structures should be created at long last, including to safeguard Europeâs own interests in a neighbouring continent of such great strategic importance.
We are rightly making policy in other continents, we are taking responsibility for peace and freedom, but we are not managing to provide the instruments that are needed.
We need a European army at long last, a professional army, to supplement our conscript and other armies.
The national armies must continue to undertake domestic defence, but, largely, we are still lacking the instruments to intervene in other continents.
We are risking taking on too much, and so I say âyesâ to this deployment.
However, we must take this as a serious warning to make sure our common foreign and security policy also has the necessary instruments for peacekeeping at its disposal at long last.
Â Â  The current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo is very worrying.
For a long time, the country has suffered great instability, which has led to famine, brutality towards civilians and a very serious situation in the whole of the Great Lake region.
We are, however, encouraged by the fact that elections are now being organised.
We in the June List are strongly opposed to the mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo being used further to strengthen the EUâs common foreign and security policy.
The situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo must be resolved, but not through the deployment of a joint EU force.
It is up to each Member State to decide, at the request of the UN, whether or not troops are to be deployed.
We have thus voted against the resolution.
Â Â  . Africa is a most appetising fruit.
The main capitalist powers seek to dominate it and exploit its immense resources. This is evidenced by the increase in the presence on the continent, and the number of operations and military bases, of the USA, France, the UK and Germany.
Military action in the Democratic Republic of Congo is steeped in this approach and paves the way for further military operations in the future.
Let us not forget that this is the second intervention under the âEU' umbrella in the country, following 'Artemisâ, with French troops, in 2003.
The major powers in the EU, namely France and Germany, with the support of the Portuguese Government have failed to promote the end of the illegal exploitation of natural resources â in which companies from EU countries have been involved â and the end of external meddling in the country; have failed to respond to requests for humanitarian aid from the United Nations; and have failed to promote and provide financial support for the disarmament and socio-economic development process, thereby ensuring that it is the local population that uses and benefits from the natural resources in the country.
Instead, they have sent more troops to a country in which more than 15Â 000 troops are already stationed as part of the Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC).
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  â The EU decision to send the military forces of the Euro-army to the Democratic Republic of Congo relates to competition between the imperialist forces to control the markets and the wealth-producing resources of the Congo and Africa in general, which has paid for this policy with millions of lives.
The mantle of safeguarding peace and the electoral process is being used by the ÎU to cover the real objectives and create a situation of fait accompli for future interventions.
Moreover, this Euro-army mission constitutes the first application of the reactionary UN reform, the aim of which is to integrate regional organisations (ÎÎÎ€Î, Euro-army) into UN mechanisms, in order to 'legalise' imperialist interventions.
It is no coincidence that the resolution refers to the need to reconstruct the Democratic Republic of Congo in accordance with the Iraqi standard for which provision is made in the 60th anniversary UN declaration.
The second organised military mission of the Euro-army after Bosnia also demonstrates its aggressive, interventionist character.
The peoples of the Congo and of Africa do not need 'international protectors' who are in any case responsible for the wars and the desperate situation they are in.
Â Â  . British Conservatives are opposed to EU involvement in military activities, which are an aspect of EU political integration, produce no additional military capabilities and undermine established military alliances.
There is a tragedy brewing in the Congo, but the proposed international deployments do not address this.
The EU is neither designed nor equipped to handle such matters from a military standpoint.
Nor should it be.
The EU has not even been able to fulfil its meagre security obligations to Sudan, where it insisted on a role when NATO was already committed.
There have been two EU civil missions in the Congo and it is not clear what the mandate of any EU military mission would now be.
The Congolese Government has not requested it.
Clearly this exercise is cosmetic, designed more to publicise the EU label than to overcome the Congo's problems.
The EU should respond to UN requests through use of its political, humanitarian, electoral observation and development assistance tools.
Depending on the context, these matters should be the responsibility of nations, NATO or the UN.
British Conservatives are supportive of the UN in its many difficult tasks but not of EU military adventures.
We therefore voted against the resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to explain why I voted in favour of MrÂ Leinenâs report on the regulation of European political parties and on their funding.
When, in Italy, I cry out âPensioners, take a stand!â all the pensioners fall in behind me, and young people do so together with the pensioners, because they believe in the Pensionersâ Party, of which I am the leader.
I am sure that, if I cried out âPensioners, take a stand!â in the 25 languages of the European Union, pensioners from the other 24 EU Member States would also support me because the European political party goes right to the heart of the population.
I am absolutely certain that we will create Europe when we have created the European parties, just as the Pensionersâ Party is creating the European Pensionersâ Party.
Pensioners, take a stand!
Â Â  Mr President, running through the Leinen report is the belief that fully-fledged European political parties are necessary, because they truly benefit democracy at European level.
I think that it would be no exaggeration to say that the opposite is the case.
The unbridled increase in scale of the decision-making process in a Europe which should, mark well, consist of very different and very definitely sovereign Member States, is the surest way of reducing democracy and making decision-making even less transparent by introducing bureaucracy that is virtually impossible to monitor, something of which there are many examples these days, by the way.
Just think of the totalitarian way in which this Parliament is dealing with the rejection of the European Constitution in democratic referendums in France and the Netherlands.
The intention is, then, that the European political parties should serve the purpose of siphoning off yet more piles of money from the taxpayer and give even more of it to political parties, but only, that is, to the politically correct ones.
It follows that when Europe talks about democracy, we do well to watch our step.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst I would disagree with the previous speaker and say that also at European level we need political parties to offer choice to citizens, I should like to place on record that I disagree with one of the suggestions that has been floated in the context of the Leinen report, namely that we should have European-level lists for elections to the European Parliament.
Such a proposal would, for a start, need an amendment to the Treaties to be made now, while we are still in a period of reflection about what to do as regards Treaty amendment.
I also think it is not necessary.
There is a risk that such lists might place the Members elected through them further away from citizens than those who are elected in the regions, as most of us are.
Where we could explore a useful way of linking the European elections to the idea of choice for citizens, is by taking up the idea that our rapporteur made just a few minutes ago, namely that each European political party should name its candidate for President of the Commission.
That would make a link between the vote for a parliament and the resultant composition of the executive that people are indeed used to when they vote in national elections in European countries.
Â Â  It is important for us to have political parties at European level.
They play an important role in disseminating political information and knowledge of European policy, as well as in promoting democratic values and creating a European consciousness.
We do not, however, believe that the EU should decide on how membership, lists and nominations are to be dealt with.
It must be up to each party to lay down rules concerning the ways in which they wish to handle issues such as these.
Â Â  . Our vote against is consistent with our position on Europeâs political parties.
Given the enormous chasm between the citizens and the European institutions, the solution is not to set up more European parties or to increase the funding of those already in existence.
Each national party must retain the ability to organise itself autonomously, not least with regard to its relations with the Union and Parliament.
In order to encourage the citizens to become more involved in politics at Community level, what is needed is a complete sea change away from neoliberal policies, the end of the Stability and Growth Pact, the withdrawal of the so-called Bolkestein Directive, and the replacement of the Lisbon Strategy with a strategy characterised by solidarity, sustainable development and social cohesion.
What is needed is more high-quality jobs with rights, better public services, more employment-generating investment and greater social inclusion, along with fairer distribution of wealth.
Â Â  .The European political parties are merely extremely lucrative organisations.
The basic points in this report amount to a demand for them to have more money and more freedom in how they use it, as well as more status and a tax exemption system.
For what purpose though?
Just to exist and to meet, for the moment.
Since the aim is to give these parties a monopoly to spread the good word of Europeism.
Their creation depends, moreover, on some unacceptable certificate of European âright-thinkingâ bestowed by this institution, based on the programmes that they are required to submit to its authorities.
We know too that you would like at least some of the seats in this Parliament to be reserved for those elected from lists drawn up at European level, lists that could only be presented by European parties.
The ultimate outcome for you would be if they were authorised to participate as such in national and local ballots, thereby allowing unacceptable political meddling at all levels of decision making in the Member States.
Democracy consists of allowing nations to govern themselves or to choose representatives to defend their interests within decision-making authorities, parliaments or governments.
Imposing artificial entities that are representative only of themselves and subject to the ideology of Brussels is anything but democracy.
Â Â  We oppose the subsidised system now being developed for European political parties.
Parties must be constructed from the bottom up by the parties in the Member States.
If these parties find no justification for increasing their appropriations to their European parties, it may be questioned whether there really is a need for European political parties to exist.
We object to setting up parties at EU level that are heavily subsidised by EU taxpayers.
We are therefore voting against this report.
Â Â  . Today, nearly 85% of the members of this Parliament have agreed to an increase in subsidies that benefit their own political parties and to soften up the rules on how this money can be spent.
Moreover, the current budget of EUR 8.4 million that was spent last year on subsidies for European parties will be further increased, and those parties will be allowed to put these subsidies aside if they fail to spend them within the space of one year.
In many cases, politicians develop a logic all of their own, quite independently of their electorate.
That was the case in the failed proposal for a European Constitution and this is even more the case in subsidies of this kind.
Initially, funds voted by Parliament were used, illegally for cooperation at European level between political parties.
On 18 June 2003, I voted against legalisation of this abuse, and today, I am voting against a further expansion.
Whether national parties want to unite in European parties is up to them, but I cannot see why they should not fund some things themselves.
The fact that they are now demanding an increase in subsidies and more flexible rules that apply to those subsidies, creates the impression that politicians are more concerned about the interests of their own groups than those of their electorate.
Â Â  â The Kommounistiko Komma Elladas opposes the EU decision to create European political parties which it wants to control and use to defend or promote a one-way street in Europe.
The report promotes the upgrading of their role and makes the funding system more flexible, so that they can be used as part of the brain-washing mechanism in preparation for the Euro-Constitution and its policy, in order to break grass-roots opposition.
Within the framework of the so-called 'European communications policy', in other words of the ideological attack by capital, and making use of the 'phase of reflectionâ, it mobilises initiatives, regional authorities, NGOs, the media, journalists and political parties in favour of a one-way street in Europe for the purposes of propaganda and in order to resurrect the Euro-Constitution and raise the 'low stock' of the ÎU in the eyes of the workers of Europe.
Particular importance is attached to young people, by strengthening the 'European parties' in order to create European youth organisations.
At the same time, it safeguards absolute control and the lack of independence of these parties, up to the point of defining their internal rules of procedure.
We are voting against the report, refusing any declaration of loyalty to the imperialist alliance of capital, the ÎU, and we call for opposition, insubordination and disobedience.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, before boarding my flight yesterday to come to Brussels today, I shouted out âPensioners, take a stand!â, as I always do.
I turned around and saw that elderly people and young people were following me because, in the Pensionersâ Party, everyone works together, whether old or young.
The report by MrÂ Bushill-Matthews â whom I thank for his customary diligence â rightly talks about solidarity between the generations.
MrÂ President, everyone â young people and pensioners alike â has asked me the following question, which is one that I also ask myself: should it be the elderly who provide for the young or, on the contrary, should it be the young who provide for the elderly?
Undoubtedly it is the elderly that, after having given their entire lives to society and to everyone in it, are supposed, even as senior citizens, to hand over their pensions to young people.
I believe that the governments of the 25 EU Member States would like this to happen, but are we really sure that it would be the best solution?
Might not a better solution be for young people to finally give elderly people the recognition that they deserve?
Long live pensioners!
Â Â  Mr President, I have abstained from the vote on the present Bushill-Matthews report because I disagree with some of its recommendations.
Recital 70 on immigration policy springs to mind, although I have to confess, incidentally, that even this recital contains a phrase that is remarkably nuanced for this House.
Admittedly, this report is actually relatively even-handed and, if nothing else, has the merit of once again placing the demographic problem of Europe on the agenda.
What I do not find in this report, though, is the conclusion that very many parents today still opt voluntarily in favour of staying at home and decide in favour of the family, and that probably many more people would take that option should this be made financially viable by the government.
In this connection, my group has for a long time argued in favour of fully-fledged parent wages, including social security and accrual of pension rights for the parent staying at home and looking after under-age children.
I am convinced that this measure could also go a long way towards providing an answer to the enormous demographic challenge which we are currently facing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, singles are praised in the contemporary media as the measure of all things.
Families with several children are virtually seen as antisocial.
Yet the higher the proportion of childless people today, the more young people will, in turn, want to remain childless.
In my opinion, the parents of tomorrow need to grow up with children to be able to appreciate them.
Therefore, we have to step up action to put the contemporary image of the family straight.
If we want to avoid a scenario where, in cities, the traditional family only exists among immigrants, I believe that we need to increasingly orient the promotion of the family towards the indigenous population of Europe, too.
Another important starting point, of course, is the reconciliation of family and career.
It is no coincidence that those countries that have succeeded in this have higher birth rates.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the report on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations.
However, we voted against the wording to the effect that increased taxes designed to fund social security offer a less sustainable solution in the long term.
Moreover, we interpret an increase in the retirement age as an increase in the actual, rather than the statutory, retirement age.
Because the wording was insufficiently clear on this point, we were unable to support it.
Nor do we support the European Parliamentâs calling on the Member States and private companies to break the link between higher ages and higher wage levels.
Â Â  The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain from voting in the vote on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations.
Even though the report puts forward many relevant proposals, we cannot support it. The reason is that it concerns issues that fall within the Member Statesâ areas of competence.
Â Â  .I voted in favour of Mr Bushill-Matthewsâ report on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations.
The facts are there and are irrefutable: Europe is growing older.
In my country, the equation is a simple one: since we live under a system of redistribution for the payment of statutory pensions, whereby each generation of working people pays for the pensions of the generation that has gone before it, that means, in very practical terms, that fewer working people will have to fund the retirement and health care of a greater number of pensioners, who will be living longer and longer.
If nothing is done, either future generations will have to bear much heavier costs to the detriment of their own standard of living, or, if they were to refuse to do so, tomorrowâs pensioners would find themselves reduced progressively to a subsistence standard of living and to the rationing of health care.
On the face of it, neither of these possibilities is acceptable.
Neither will be accepted in any case.
We have to find other ways, and urgently; all the countries of the European Union are faced with this challenge.
It is the duty of a democracy to look ahead for an answer to challenges that it knows are unavoidable.
We owe it to the future generations of Europeans.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which is a response to the trends resulting in demographic changes.
According to the Commission, in order to face up to demographic change, Europe should pursue three essential priorities: a return to demographic growth, ensuring a balance between the generations, and 'finding new bridges between the stages of life'.
In our society, it is more important than ever that we confront our demographic challenges and harness the knowledge of our older citizens to the best of our ability.
Â Â  . From China to Europe, passing through Russia, not to mention Africa, a huge demographic problem is emerging.
The world is growing older.
What is worse, in some countries of Europe, the population is declining or is going to decline, as in Germany or Russia.
The demographic consequences are well-known: increases in expenditure on health and pensions, the need for millions of jobs providing personal care and a shortage of staff resulting in a migration influx, which has the psychological effect of pushing societies towards cautious, do nothing attitudes and Malthusian âno futureâ policies, of which the âausterity budget pactâ has been the expression since Maastricht.
In other words, who is going to pay the taxes to finance this situation?
The Gods of the stadium or old people on their last legs?
Of course, family policies will endeavour to create contributors and contributions.
While we wait, however, for the increase in the birth rate and, hence, new workers, in the vacuum of the next 20 years unfolding before us, the Belgian, Dutch or Swiss laws on euthanasia, dressed up as the right to choose oneâs own death, demonstrate the âJourney to the End of the Nightâ that the policies, especially in Europe, have begun.
Â Â  . Europe is facing an unprecedented demographic problem.
In 2030, the EU will have 18Â million fewer young people than at the moment, and in 2050, it will have 60Â million fewer inhabitants.
Between 2005 and 2030, there will be a 52.3% increase in the number of people over 65 (40Â million more), whereas there will be a 6.8% drop in the 15 to 64 age group (21 million fewer).
The proportion of inactive people (the young, the elderly and other dependent persons) in relation to people of working age will rise from 49% in 2005 to 66% in 2030.
These developments can be put down to two factors: firstly, people are living longer and, secondly, the birth rate has dropped.
Average life expectancy for 60 year olds has risen by five years since 1960 for women, and almost four years for men, meaning that the number of over 80 year olds will grow by 180% by 2050, whereas the birth rate has been falling.
The number of children per woman in 2003 was 1.48, whilst at least 2.1 children per woman would be required to maintain the population level.
Mindful of the consequences of these factors on prosperity, standards of living and relations between the generations, I voted for this report.
Â Â  Mr President, I strongly support the maximal development of bioenergy, but when we talk about promoting the cultivation of non-food crops in connection with self-sufficiency in energy, we need to point out that liquid biofuels are by no means cost-effective.
Also, the EU cannot even produce enough biofuels to meet the targets set out in the biofuel directive.
I think it is important to call things by their right name in order to prevent a situation where, unnoticed by us, the Directorate-General for Agriculture starts managing EU energy policy.
This will therefore be about subsidies for agriculture, not carbon dioxide efficiency or self-sufficiency in energy, as long as the costs of liquid biofuels are clearly greater than those for the conventional fuels they are expected to replace, or while the fossil energy used to manufacture them is greater than what is obtained from them.
That is how things stand, especially with Nordic field-based energy.
Consequently, an increase in the use of biofuels would raise both EU energy costs and the price of food. That would inevitably impact on the EUâs competitiveness.
With liquid biofuels, we need an honest life cycle analysis, which would be undertaken by an independent, impartial agency.
Â Â  . Mr President, I support the Parish report.
Remember, colleagues, that using sugar as raw material, Brazil is the worldâs ethanol superpower, with an interesting ownership of the sector â not all Brazilian.
I am deeply disappointed and saddened by the decision to close the last sugar factory in Ireland.
Hundreds of jobs will be lost.
This is a cruel blow for all those who faithfully served the industry for generations.
The Commissionâs decision to reform the sugar industry and to cut the supports it paid to growers never favoured the Irish sugar industry.
We must now ensure that those who served the sugar industry loyally for many years receive equitable compensation.
The whole area of growing alternative crops which may be used among other things for the production of bioethanol must now be given serious consideration and support at both EU and national level, particularly for the sugar beet sector.
Biofuels offer excellent new opportunities and can utilise the expertise notably of Irish tillage farmers.
Biofuels will contribute to Europeâs energy self-sufficiency, at a time of rising oil prices and in light of the recent controversy over gas supplies from Russia.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes because we think it is a good idea for farmers to plant crops other than the traditional ones when the latter no longer pay their way.
Technological development is important where alternative forms of energy are concerned, and we are also aware of the opportunities provided by the restructuring of agricultural policy.
We do not, however, believe that a transition to energy crops should be allowed to slow down the phasing-out of the common agricultural policy.
It is important for these new products to be developed and to thrive in a free market without subsidies.
To the extent that it is provided at all, temporary aid should be targeted not at subsidised production but at infrastructural measures designed to get activities up and running.
Â Â  .On the occasion of the adoption of this report, which I supported, I would like to mention the recent developments in the field of bioenergy in Belgium.
In addition to microeconomic projects relating to the use of biofuels in farming, large-scale industrial projects are finally emerging in my country, and I am delighted.
As regards production, six major projects are currently under way, the two most important ones being situated in Ghent (biodiesel sector) and in Wanze (bioethanol sector).
What is more, the programme for tax exemption for biofuels, adopted by Belgium and approved by the European Commission, fixes, in the case of biodiesel, the ratio of the mixture with traditional diesel at 3.37% for 2006 and at 4.29% for 2007.
For bioethanol, the mixture has been fixed at 7%.
At this rate, we might even achieve the objective recommended in Directive 2003/30, namely that 5.75% of all fuel sold should be âgreenâ by 2010.
To this end, the Parish report calls for these targets to be made compulsory.
The utilisation for energy purposes of agricultural products, which is both a real opportunity for the future for our farmers and environmentally friendly, indeed deserves restrictive targets to be set, especially if they are reasonable.
Â Â  . The rapporteur says, and we agree, that âthe production of renewable raw materials and the use of organic waste can contribute to the improvement of the environment, the sustainable production of energy, employment and regional balance, while playing a role in rendering multifunctional agriculture more diverse and self-sufficientâ.
Nevertheless, we feel that attention should be drawn to existing capacities as regards alternative energy, and the existing relationship between energy, the environment and farming within the framework of sustainable development.
This will ultimately benefit the citizens and their quality of life, as well as the economic sectors involved.
We feel, however, that an appropriate balance must be struck between food crops and energy crops, so as to ensure that food sovereignty and safety are not put in jeopardy.
The production of crops for non-food purposes is not protected by the CAP, given that aid is less than EURÂ 80 per hectare per year, and the rapporteur calls for steps to be taken to put an end to public aid.
This measure would render such production dependent on the energy industry and the rules of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Hence my abstention.
Â Â  . I welcome in principle this report by my colleague Neil Parish on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes.
While these techniques will not solve our energy problems, they can make a small but significant contribution.
Fast-growing willows and poplars can be used, as I saw some years ago in Austria, to provide small-scale heat and electricity supply in remote, isolated areas.
Oil-seed rape and wheat can be used in the production of biofuels whether diesel or petrol and save on CO2 release.
Yet one warning: the schemes must be part of the solution, not the problem.
Where they make economic, environmental and energy sense, I will support them, when they merely maintain agricultural expenditure at the expense of common sense, I will not.
Â Â  The report is just the European Parliamentâs own take on the matter concerned and involves no legislative procedure.
It looks towards further extending the existing common agricultural policy within the field of energy crops.
There is a lot more to be said in the debate about energy crops.
We have chosen to vote against the report.
Â Â  . The report on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes is extremely timely given the rapidly declining reserve of fossil fuels.
The cultivation of biomass, for example, can contribute efficiently in decreasing the greenhouse effect, which is primarily caused by CO2, by buffering the CO2 emission.
I am in favour of the promotion of renewable energy through the production of crops.
Several current technologies, such as energy derived from biomass, are economically viable and competitive and will, in turn, open up new markets for farmers in the European Union, thus stimulating economic, social and environmental growth.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 March 2006.
Â Â  The Conference of Presidents has asked me to inform the House that the ex-President of Liberia, Mr Charles Taylor, was captured on 29 March and extradited to Sierra Leone to face the Special Court for Sierra Leone.
As you know, Taylor has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The accusations against him include responsibility for murder, rape, recruiting child soldiers and mutilation during the civil war in Sierra Leone.
The European Parliament dealt with this case and, in its Resolution on the case of Charles Taylor, of 24 February 2005, and in its Resolution on Human Rights in the World, of 28 March 2005, called for Taylor to be brought before the Special Court.
Having adopted these Resolutions, I believe that Parliament can now applaud this important victory in the fight against the impunity of war criminals.
I would remind you that the new President of Liberia has been invited to speak to the House, and I hope that she can do so soon.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 30 March 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed:
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament proposes that the vote on the report by Mr Åry, scheduled for tomorrow, be moved to Wednesday.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to the original version of the order of business, the Åry report was put down for Wednesday, with the vote on it scheduled, accordingly, for the same day.
The Conference of Presidents has now decided â as recently as last Thursday â to bring the report forward to Tuesday, with the consequence that our group has not had the chance to have a final debate on it today, since we assumed, when sending out invitations to our members, that the vote would be on Wednesday and so we could have our final debate on Tuesday.
I would therefore be grateful if the House could agree on us debating it tomorrow, but waiting until Wednesday to vote on it.
Â Â  . I see no objection to that, and I personally agree with it.
Thank you very much.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament proposes that the vote on the reports by Monica Frassoni (A6-0089/2006), Bert Doorn (A6-0082/2006), Arlene McCarthy (A6-0083/2006) and Giuseppe Gargani (A6-0080/2006) be postponed until a later part-session.
Â Â  â Mr President, without, admittedly, having given you prior notice, I should like to say something more on the subject of âBetter Lawmakingâ.
This is an important debate, and we agreed that it should be held this week, but it has turned out over the last couple of hours that there are still a few issues to be resolved as regards the vote.
It has been agreed with the authors, at any rate, that the vote on all four reports on better lawmaking should be held during the next part-session rather than this week.
I do not know whether we can go straight ahead and vote now if there is a consensus, but I did, in any case, want to say today that there is a strong movement in favour of debating the reports on better lawmaking this week, while not yet voting on them.
Â Â  If I have understood correctly, your request is that the debate be held as scheduled, but that there be no vote on it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to confirm that that is the general opinion and say, on behalf of my group, that we are in favour.
Â Â  At the moment we are talking about tendencies.
Can we vote on tendencies?
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a trend of the major coalition, but we too agree that the vote should be postponed, for a very simple reason: we believe that the mutual relationship, so to speak, between these reports has not yet fully developed.
Therefore, we most certainly need to debate them and we will vote in May, if that is what the House decides.
Â Â  I shall take the view that this tendency can be interpreted as a concrete proposal that the vote not take place during this part-session.
The Council has added to the title of the last of the statements that it will make during the afternoon as follows: âMeasures to enhance road safety (SAFETY) and security measures in the transport sector, including the financing thereof (SECURITY)â.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would ask the services to point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that he should focus on the original definition of security, namely that of fighting terrorism, rather than only addressing the security of transport, since it is to be feared that only the second issue is going to be dealt with.
Â Â  The Commission takes good note of what Mr Swoboda has just said, of course.
Security against terrorism and road safety are two very different matters, but the Council is not here to take note of your observation.
I shall pass it on.
It would be good not just to talk about road safety, if the intention of the request was also to deal with the issue of security against terrorism.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left proposes that a Commission statement on the situation in South-East Turkey be added as the first item on Thursday's agenda, ending with a vote on a resolution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my group has called for a statement from the Commission followed by a debate.
We were, I might add, also in favour of submitting a resolution, but I believe that several groups do not want one.
Why are we insisting, however, that there be at the very least a statement from the Commission followed by a debate?
We are insisting because, for some days now, tanks have been sent to this region, Turkish Kurdistan.
There are a great many victims, including children.
The repression is extremely violent.
This is a country that is in the process of negotiating its accession to the European Union.
I therefore believe that this extremely serious breach of commitments made by the country in question is of direct concern to the Commission.
That is why we want a statement and a debate to be included on Thursdayâs agenda, and, if possible, as the first agenda item in the morning.
Â Â  â Mr President, although we can agree to the motion for a debate following a statement by the Commission, we do not want to frame a resolution right now; instead, we would like this issue, if at all possible, to be one of those addressed in the forthcoming report by Mr Eurlings.
I would just like to move that we should either slot it in at 3 p.m. on Thursday or begin earlier on Thursday, or else we will have even more problems with the voting on the two reports scheduled for that day, in that we will again be in the same situation of having to defer the vote, and all the rest of it, so we can either begin earlier on Thursday, or deal with this at 3 p.m. in order to have a proper vote on both reports.
â Ladies and gentlemen, I fear that there is one aspect of the decision we have taken that has not been made clear.
We have decided to begin the sitting at three and to deal with the issue of South-East Turkey, but it is not clear â in my view â whether or not this debate will end with a vote on a resolution.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, after consulting the various groups, and in order to keep in line with them, we have decided that it is better to withdraw the request to submit a resolution.
We were initially in favour of submitting a resolution, but we have decided not to put it to the vote following the consultations we have had.
Â Â  I am delighted that that has been cleared up.
There will therefore be a debate, but it will not be followed by a vote on a resolution.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats also proposes that the title of the debate âThe situation of prisons in Iraqâ be changed to âThe Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation of prisons in Iraqâ.
Â Â  â Mr President, according to the original title, we were to have been debating the Assyrian community in Iraq, but then the Conference of Presidents changed the title to âthe prisoners in Iraqâ.
We have nothing against discussing the situation of the prisoners in Iraq, but we do think it a matter of urgency that something be said about the Assyrian community, and so I would ask that we agree that this debate is to be about the Assyrian community and the prisoners in Iraq.
Â Â  If my memory serves me right, this was the wording that was agreed by the Conference of Presidents.
It does not appear on the agenda like that and we will have to decide whether we are keeping it or changing it, as requested by Mr Poettering.
Â Â  Mr President, as MrÂ Poettering said a moment ago, there was some confusion as to the precise title and the way it was fleshed out.
We go along with Mr Poetteringâs suggestion to give equal weight to both issues, namely the role of the Assyrian minority and the situation in Iraqâs prisons.
The title should be totally unambiguous.
If, therefore, we discuss a change, or a proposal for a change, along the lines of âThe situation in Iraq: the prisons and the situation of the Assyrian minorityâ, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can certainly lend its support to it.
Â Â  Mr Poetteringâs proposal is specifically âThe Assyrian community in Iraq and the situation of prisons in Iraqâ, the two things.
(1)
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Many speakers are listed and, once again, I must warn you that, unless you all conform strictly to the speaking time of one minute, it will not be possible for everybody who has asked to speak to do so, particularly if there are further requests for the floor during the sitting, as is always the case.
Â Â  (Mr President, for several years now the European Parliament has been investigating the Lloyds case relating to the first non-life insurance directive and to the way in which this directive has, or rather has not been properly applied, especially in the last 20 years before the law was duly modified following the opening of an infringement procedure against the United Kingdom in 2001.
The intention of the last exchange of letters on the Lloyds case between us, Mr President, was to close the matter and assure the petitioners of the support of the European Parliament.
May I ask whether you have anything to add that might enable us to finalise this matter?
Â Â  Mr Libicki, as you know, I wrote to you about the Lloydâs petitioners on 17Â January 2006. As I reminded you in that letter, Parliamentâs most recent resolution on the subject â adopted in June 2005 â confirms its impression that there are substantive and reasonable grounds to believe that the first non-life insurance directive and its later, modified versions were not properly transposed and applied in the United Kingdom.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wished to draw the European Parliamentâs attention to the serious project undertaken by the French Government, which consists of introducing a âfirst job contractâ.
This is undoubtedly a serious threat to Franceâs social model, but I understood â and some of my fellow Members will speak on this subject â that threats of this kind exist in many countries in which casual work offering little security is the only solution offered to people, particularly young people, when they enter the world of work.
From the perspective of the commitments made via the Lisbon Strategy, whereby our European Union seeks to be the most competitive area in the world at the same time as developing an original social model, it would seem highly appropriate to me that the European institutions call on France not to bring into question a point that was specifically upheld by the International Labour Office, namely that no redundancies should be made without a legitimate reason.
Be that as it may, we can observe a great sense of anxiety among our young Europeans about their future, and it would seem important to me that we reaffirm our desire to fight against what is referred to as atypical work and job insecurity.
Â Â  (Mr President, may I draw Membersâ attention to the unfair taxation principles currently applied in Poland to Polish nationals working abroad.
The problem applies first and foremost to the several hundred thousand people working in the United Kingdom and to the UK/Poland Double Taxation Agreement signed in 1976.
The Polish method of calculating the tax payable on income received by Polish nationals in the United Kingdom is unfavourable and may in fact lead to double taxation.
Both the UK Government and, above all, the Polish Government must ensure that the Agreement is renegotiated as soon as possible in the interests of European Union citizens.
Poles deciding to leave their homeland to work in other countries contribute to the wealth of the whole of the European Union; they frequently do the hardest work for low pay and live in difficult conditions.
In many cases, they are exploited by dishonest intermediaries.
The Polish Minister of Finance should not levy any tax at all on income received by Polish nationals abroad and repatriated by them.
At the same time, the European Parliament should come to the defence of those people, guarding justice and the right of the citizens of the European Union to a decent life.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to raise the question of Zimbabwe.
As we all know, there has unfortunately been no change for the better in that country.
On the contrary, the political situation continues to deteriorate and half of the rural population is surviving solely on international food aid.
Parliament has consistently taken the position that no assistance from the EU should go to Zimbabwe other than through NGOs; it should not be in any way in the hands of government.
I am therefore a little alarmed to hear that apparently the Commission is intending to release EURÂ 1 million in aid to Zimbabwe for so-called âparliamentary reformâ, administered, admittedly, through the United Nations Development Programme.
The United Nations Development Programme itself states that it is an âimpartial and trusted partner with the Zimbabwean Governmentâ.
I hope the Commission can give us an explanation before it releases any aid and that it can also give us assurances on this matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to emphasise that support and respect need to be safeguarded for the human rights of all European citizens without exception, but especially of the large majority which, for 'historical' reasons, is considered to enjoy them and for that reason does not claim them through organised groups which exert pressure and protest.
The apportionment of the rights of the population of the European Union on matters for which, of course, noÂ one thinks of denying the right of non-discrimination often results in misunderstandings and doubts as to whether the self-evident applies to the silent majority as regards every type of right: the right to life and human dignity and to respect for freedom of expression and choice.
Moreover, inalienable fundamental human rights are respected and supported by the majority of the population, which is why support for the rights of the few must not give the impression of the abolition of the rights of the majority.
Â Â  â Mr President, the disturbances in France cannot fail to move my generation, to which the famous First Employment Contract or, to put it differently, the 'disposable worker' model is addressed.
Young Europeans, under the pressure of unemployment, may decide to participate in this experiment.
In addition, the risk of a clash between the generations is inevitable.
Older workers will see young people as their competitors.
They will be squeezed out by young 'disposable workers', by shifting cheap and disciplined manpower.
These coercive solutions being proposed by advocates of economic liberalism clearly undervalue the subject of history: the citizen, the worker, the person.
That will also be their fatal error.
Recently the Constitutional Treaty was voted down.
Now there are social clashes for the full withdrawal of the law on 'working pawns'.
The social movement is strengthening, rejecting and making claims.
Unemployment can and must be combated, but not in an unruly manner, not by ignoring the needs of society and certainly not at the expense of a generation which is not to blame for the world it has inherited.
Â Â  (Mr President, some Western European printed media have recently taken to describing the Polish Government and its power base as nationalist.
This type of content is scandalous and offensive to millions of Poles.
It is this Government and its supporters that are grounded in the proud history of such events as World War II, when tens of thousands of Poles risked their lives to hide Jews and people of other nationalities, and when thousands of them paid for it with their lives.
This so-called political correctness, which ruins freedom of speech in the European Union, defines all those who talk about patriotism, national traditions and the importance of Christianity for Europe as chauvinism, nationalism and perhaps before long as fascism.
They regard as normal all behaviours contrary to nature and to the traditional values of Christian Europe, as well as those condoning insults to the feelings of Catholics and members of other faiths.
Irrespective of what is promulgated by Western European press, Poland will remain faithful to its traditions and democratic values.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity today to discuss the way in which the Commissioner handles questions from MEPs.
I recently put a very detailed question on three specific issues to the Commission.
What I got by way of a reply was a brief excerpt from a legal text.
I think that an organisation such as the Commission can be expected to address the issues that Members of this House are raising in the questions they put, to provide answers that relate to the substance of those question and not just to forward a legal text of the kind that I, as a lawyer, could have sought out for myself.
That is not what the whole exercise is all about.
Mr President, I would like to make this question, and the answer to it, available to you; perhaps you will be as outraged as I am at this reply and will be able to do something about improving this state of affairs.
Â Â  Mr Leichtfried, I will be very happy to try to communicate your complaint to the Commission, in order to ensure that in the future replies do not consist merely of reduced photocopies of texts that everybody is aware of.
Â Â  The question of human rights is an integral part of the fabric of the foundations of the European Union.
The latest Report of the US State Department on Human Rights Practices of 8 March 2006 also mentions a failure to comply with the decision of the Austrian Constitutional Court, which has been demanding for years that bilingual regional signs be posted in German and Slovene in the southern part of the Austrian province of Carinthia, which is home to a Slovene minority.
On the very same day, however, JÃ¶rg Haider, Governor of Carinthia, instigated proceedings against District Governor August Muri for âabusing his public officeâ by finally issuing an order for bilingual signs to be posted in Bleiburg/Pliberk.
Two bilingual signs have also been placed on view in our Parliament building in Brussels.
As you are well aware, Russia has issued an official proposal for breaches of the rights of the Slovene minority in Austria to be placed on the agenda of the EUâRussia Summit.
I would be interested to know how the Commission will act to resolve this glaring example of a breach of the rights of the Slovene minority, at the very time when Austria holds the presidency of the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, we are shocked by the pictures and the news that have been reaching us since Monday of last week from many Kurdish towns, but mainly from Diyarbakir.
The resemblance to the sort of pictures we get from Gaza or from West Jordan is astonishing.
So far, 11 people have been killed by the Turkish security forces, the youngest of them being a three-year-old child.
Hundreds of people have been injured, some of them severely, while hundreds have been imprisoned.
This situation must be prevented from escalating further.
Prime Minister Erdoganâs statements, to the effect, for example, that âOur security forces will take whatever action is necessary against all those who make themselves the instruments of terrorism, even if they are women or childrenâ do nothing to help achieve a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish problem.
I ask the Commission, and you, Mr Borrell, to contact Mr Beydemir, the mayor of Diyarbakir, and I demand that an delegation be assembled and despatched to examine in detail what has happened in the affected areas.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to draw Membersâ attention to a set of pan-European scams which target small businesses.
The best known of these is the âEuropean City Guideâ from Spain, but there are others: âConstruct Dataâ in Austria, âNovachannelâ and âIntercable Verlagâ in Switzerland, âDeutsche Addressdienstâ and âTVV Verlagâ in Germany.
They all mail deliberately deceptive documents to small businesses across Europe. These are disguised as free update forms, but hidden in the small print is a notice indicating that signature of the form will incur huge costs.
Recently a Swiss newspaper revealed that there is just one man â Meinolf LÃŒdenbach â behind most of these organisations.
He also controls the debt companies that pursue victims once they have been duped into signing.
His network amounts to a conspiracy to defraud small businesses in Europe.
These scams hop from country to country, taking advantage of our divergent legal systems to escape justice.
I am therefore delighted that Commissioner Kyprianou has agreed to look into this matter and I would urge all colleagues who have examples of these in their constituencies â and there are many of you, I know â to write to him with information so that he can complete his dossier.
Â Â  â Mr President, numerous Members have referred on occasion to the time taken by the competent institutional bodies to reply to questions they have tabled.
The most recent incident concerns my written question, which I tabled on 27 September 2005 and which referred to the meeting of the Committee of Ministers on 11Â October 2005.
The competent institutional body replied to my question five months later, on 9 March 2006 to be precise, informing me in just three lines of text that the Council had not discussed the matter on which I had requested a position and had no plans to do so.
What therefore, Mr President and honourable Members, is the role of MEPs and the function of the European Parliament and what of respect for and responsibilities towards the European citizens who have entrusted us with the position which we occupy today?
What justification shall I give the citizens for the reply which they expected and which we never received?
Â Â  Mr Mavrommatis, your complaint is extremely reasonable.
The only reason I can imagine for them taking so long to reply to you, just to tell you in the end that the Council has not dealt with the issue, is that they were waiting for the Council to deal with it, but even under those circumstances the time taken does not seem reasonable.
I shall inform the Council and the Commission of the need to ensure that Membersâ questions are answered in good time, as in your case, and properly, that is to say, not just that they are received within a reasonable time limit, but that they are proper replies with real content.
I am sure that the appropriate authorities within the Council and the Commission will take good note of this request.
Â Â  Mr President, as you said just a moment ago, Charles Taylor, who is accused of war crimes, has been brought before the UN War Tribunal in Sierra Leone.
As Chief Observer of the European Union's election observation mission in Liberia, I have urged the newly elected President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to insist on extradition.
She agreed to this, provided that the Nigerian President and the African Union would lend their support.
The arrest and bringing before the law of Charles Taylor is a triumph for the new Liberia and for not only the African Union, but certainly also for the EU, both of which have passed this test with flying colours.
This reflects credit on the work we did there.
Since the arrest, a shadow has disappeared from over western Africa and the region has been given a chance of peace and a chance to develop democracy.
As Chief Observer of the election observation mission in Liberia, I warmly support the idea of the chairmen inviting her to speak here before the plenary, and I hope that in the meantime, the EU will continue to lend its strong support to the Millennium Objectives and democratisation in that country, for that is what the citizens over there deserve right now.
Â Â  Mr van den Berg, as I pointed out before, the President of Liberia will be invited and let us hope that she can come soon.
Â Â  Mr President, I wrote to you on 16 and 23 March of this year in my capacity as Chairman of the IND/DEM Group office, concerning the so-called reconstruction of the Independence and Democracy Group of which the Parliament authorities were informed by the Groupâs leadership during the last plenary session.
In the view of the Polish delegation, the procedure leading to the exclusion of two national delegations, the Italian and the Polish, from the IND/DEM Group was unlawful.
May I ask when we can expect an answer to the above letters?
Â Â  Mr Piotrowski, just before the sitting began I held a meeting with Mr Bonde and Mr Farage; we discussed this issue and I am waiting for them to communicate to me their views about the situation and the measures to be taken in writing.
I hope that I will be able to communicate something to you about it at the beginning of tomorrowâs sitting.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it was exactly 1Â 500 days ago that Ingrid Betancourt and her colleague, Clara Rojas, were kidnapped by the FARC in Colombia, thus joining the excessively large group of 3Â 000 hostages, to say nothing of the thousands of missing persons in that country.
I am speaking today on behalf of the International Federation of the Ingrid Betancourt Committees which, in collaboration with her family, has three requests.
Firstly, actively to support the mediation efforts of the three countries consisting of France, Switzerland and Spain.
Secondly, to put strong pressure on the FARC, via the organisations that support it overseas and especially in countries that have not included it on their list of terrorist organisations, so that it responds positively to the proposal submitted by the group of the three countries, thereby demonstrating its genuine desire to reach a humanitarian agreement.
Thirdly and finally, to put strong pressure on the Colombian Government to comply with the Geneva Convention, which Colombia ratified.
This Convention does indeed stipulate that, in the event of an internal conflict, the government is obliged â in line with the commitment it made previously - to conclude humanitarian agreements in order to save as many human lives as possible.
Â Â  Mr President, last night was the first anniversary of the death of a great man and a great European, Pope John Paul II.
I am grateful for the opportunity to pay tribute to a man who was and will remain a symbol of interfaith dialogue: between Christianity and Judaism, between Christianity and Islam.
John Paul II is also a symbol of tolerance and respect for all people, irrespective of race, nationality, gender, social class or financial status.
A Pope who came from Central and Eastern Europe, he repeatedly stressed the unity of Europe, even during the times of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.
In Santiago de Compostela in Spain, some 20 years ago, he spoke of Europe as representing unity in diversity.
It is my hope that those words have remained relevant to this day.
Â Â  Mr Czarnecki, indeed a year has passed since the death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II.
At that time, I was on an official visit in Lithuania and I witnessed the great emotion felt by the Europeans of the countries of the East at the death of a person who had such a great impact on the process that led to the subsequent enlargement of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the recent heavy rainfall in the area of Bulgaria and northern Greece caused the River Evros to burst its banks.
The river flooded thousands of acres of agricultural land, damaging both horticulture, in areas that had been sown, and animal farming, given that over 3Â 000 head of sheep, goats, pigs and cows drowned.
Numerous villages were flooded and many houses were totally immersed under water.
Alongside the relevant action which will be taken by the individual Member States, is the European Union prepared to demonstrate its support in this difficult time in order to send a message to the farmers in the countries affected that the European Union is by their side because, as we know, solidarity is the leading principle in the European Union?
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my displeasure with the final declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly that was held on 27 March.
Whilst I can of course appreciate the importance of a dialogue between the north and south of the Mediterranean, I am not convinced that a dialogue of that kind serves any purpose if it results in a unilateral admission of guilt, in this case by Europe.
I do not think there is any other word for it when I read this final declaration.
First of all, the Danish cartoons are condemned with an obligatory brief sentence, or clause, about violence against those cartoons.
Although people are quite specific about those Danish cartoons, anything else is deliberately kept very vague and very general.
There is talk of promoting democracy, but there is no reference anywhere to the discrimination systematically meted out to Christians or other minority groups in the Muslim world.
We certainly do not have to go as far as Afghanistan to find examples of this.
In Turkey, for example, a change of religion must be notified to the government.
In that country, an Italian Catholic priest was recently murdered for what he represents.
In that country, it is made virtually impossible to restore Christian buildings.
I regret the fact that this has not been brought up for discussion.
Â Â  It does not in fact appear in the conclusions, but, as you know, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has not finished its work.
It will continue to debate, and I hope that Parliamentâs representatives in this Assembly will take up your suggestion and say as much.
The only way that it can appear in the conclusions is for members of the Parliamentary Assembly to raise it there.
Â Â  Mr President, one of my constituents, Alexander Litvinenko, was formerly a lieutenant colonel in the Russian Federationâs FSB, the successor to the KGB.
MrÂ Litvinenkoâs exposure of illegal FSB activities forced him to seek political asylum abroad.
Before deciding on a place of refuge, he consulted his friend, General Anatoly Trofimov, a former deputy chief of the FSB.
General Trofimov reportedly said to MrÂ Litvinenko: âDonât go to Italy, there are many KGB agents among the politicians.
Romano Prodi is our man thereâ.
In February 2006, MrÂ Litvinenko reported this information to Mario Scaramella of the Guzzanti Commission investigating KGB penetration of Italian politics.
This allegation against a former head of the European Commission is one of the utmost seriousness.
It should be thoroughly investigated. The European Parliament should conduct its own investigation.
Â Â  All suggestions must be treated with respect.
Are you suggesting that the European Parliament should investigate whether Italian politicians are agents of the KGB?
Is that your proposal?
Â Â  I am suggesting it would be appropriate for Parliament to conduct such an investigation in view of Mr Prodiâs former position as President of the European Commission.
It seems that the much-vaunted democratic credentials of this Parliament could be enhanced by such an investigation.
Â Â  I fear that we will not have time to carry out that investigation before the next Italian elections, but we can always do so afterwards, if Parliament considers it appropriate, of course.
Â Â  Several European Union Member States have recently been hit by severe flooding.
Thousands of people in the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Austria are fighting heroically against the floods which threaten their homes, possessions and farms.
There were over 100 larger floods in Europe between 1998 and 2004.
The floods we experienced last year and this year have confirmed the necessity of joint action at European level.
In January 2006, the European Commission proposed a directive for flood management in Europe.
The aim of the directive is to mitigate the risks and effects of floods, and to boost joint action.
It is a European priority to adopt the directive as soon as possible, and to act jointly to protect ourselves from floods.
I ask President Borrell and urge the Council to take steps as soon as possible in order to develop a single European flood defence system.
Â Â  â Mr President, last week, in Diyarbakir in Turkey, four people lost their lives and approximately 500 more were injured when incidents broke out at the end of a funeral.
All the victims were Kurds, while the perpetrators were the special forces of the Turkish police.
A fortnight ago, the Turkish army started an operation to suppress the Kurdish workers' movement, during which another 14 people were killed.
Turkey is obviously demonstrating with these actions that it intends to resolve this problem not through democratic process but through violence, with the survival of the fittest.
We are therefore aiding and abetting the extermination of a people, while at the same time bringing Turkey into the European family.
Such a policy is paradoxical and we should remind Turkey, as a candidate country, of what European democratic tradition means.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to raise the case of a company in my constituency.
Hygrade â a subsidiary of the Danish company Tulip â is proposing to close two factories in Chard and Chippenham with the loss of 300 and 500 jobs respectively.
This will devastate those two market towns.
At the moment they are going through a consultation on the proposed closures, which is frankly farcical.
Already residents in new neighbouring housing in Chippenham have guarantees in their mortgages that the company will close.
In Chard, it is already planning to remove equipment.
I hope you will raise that point with the Commission.
At the same time, this is a company that is not facing bankruptcy but is making massive profits.
In the negotiations, it is offering people who have been loyal to it for as long as 22Â years the minimum redundancy payment available.
It supplies its goods and services mainly to the Co-op and Tesco â they are food processing companies.
I hope that people will put pressure on those companies, which talk very often about fair trade, to ensure that the workers at the factories that supply them get a fair deal.
Â Â  It is possible that the case that you have mentioned could be taken into account in the application of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which the Commission has proposed and which will be included in the future budgets.
Let us hope that it can be taken into account when these resources are applied.
Â Â  Mr President, freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration is a fundamental part of the .
Unfortunately, in a large area bordering my home town of Limassol, this freedom of expression is not permitted, because the is not applicable there.
That area has been under British military occupation since colonial times, and although it is part of Cyprus and is inhabited by Cypriot civilians, Britain made sure that it was left outside the EU.
Therefore the European does not apply there.
Last Saturday â Freedom Day for Cyprus â a Cypriot civilian attempted a peaceful demonstration against the presence of British bases in Cyprus.
He did not disturb anybody and did not trespass onto military property.
Within minutes he was attacked by British soldiers pointing submachine guns at him and threatening to shoot him.
He was detained on a public road against his will at gunpoint until military police and the local press arrived.
He was released when it was realised that he was a Member of Parliament â this Parliament!
How long will this House tolerate having British troops occupying part of another Member State and subjecting its citizens to such harassment?
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to mention the decision taken late last week by the British Government to sell the British Nuclear Group and put it into private ownership.
This would mean that the Sellafield nuclear facility would end up in private ownership.
Considering that 80% of all British nuclear waste is held in Sellafield and that it can process 5000 tonnes of waste per year â about one third of the worldâs waste â and considering the serious questions about safety at this plant for many years and the number of accidents that have taken place, I would like to know what guarantees the British Government can give concerned parties and the people of Ireland that the highest safety standards will be met while this plant is being operated in private hands.
One could argue that it could not get any worse and it should go into private hands.
However, it is only right that the British Government should give categoric assurances that the highest possible safety standards will be met, because this issue is of huge concern to the people of Ireland and to many others.
Â Â  Mr Ryan, I understand your concern fully and I am sure that the British Government will be sensitive to the issue that you are raising.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry I was not here earlier: it was Air Franceâs fault.
I would just like to mention that Air France has cancelled flights from London.
I want to raise the issue of the 84Â Lisbon directives that have been approved by Parliament.
Seventy-six of them should have been enforced by now and fully implemented, but only 13 of those 84 Lisbon directives have been fully implemented by all Member States.
The directive on the common regulatory framework for electronic communications should have been fully implemented by 24Â July 2003, but Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg have yet to notify the Commission of their implementation.
The Lisbon Strategy is in jeopardy through such lax behaviour by Member States.
However, I am encouraged to see that the Commission will open 50Â cases against Member States that fail to implement the liberalisation of the energy markets.
It is about time we saw that happening.
Â Â  We have come to the end of the Members listed, but I thought I saw Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges timidly raising her hand.
I did not wish to deny you the floor, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree with my two fellow Members, who complained about the fact that Membersâ questions are not answered in time.
I believe that you are the guardian of our Rules of Procedure and I would ask that you make sure that the Commission responds to our questions in a timely fashion.
The matter to which I am referring is that of Luxembourgâs cable distributors, who applied to the Commission in MarchÂ 2005 and were sent from one Commissioner to another Commissioner who, in SeptemberÂ 2005, gave them an answer that contradicted the one given in response to my parliamentary question three months too late.
MrÂ President, if we want to legislate more effectively, then the Commissionâs legal services need to function accordingly, and you need to ensure that our Rules of Procedure are applied in full.
Â Â  (A fortnight ago we saw the end of the bizarre Belarus elections, naturally won by Alexander Lukashenko.
These elections were rigged by the use of force, of the Belarusian KGB, the police and the army.
Mr President, what was the European Unionâs and Parliamentâs response to this situation?
Many observers were arrested, as well as journalists and a Polish Member of Parliament.
Some of them remain in prison to this day.
Whereas we have been concerning ourselves with elections in Liberia and various elections in exotic states, we did not even send an effective delegation of observers to Belarus.
The European Parliament and the European Union must take up a very firm and decisive position on Belarus, so that we can finally overthrow the last bloody dictatorship in Europe.
Â Â  In Poland there is growing dissatisfaction with the European Unionâs agricultural policy.
The feelings of Polish farmers are well illustrated by their protest banners: âthe Union means bankruptcy for the Polish countrysideâ.
The farmersâ demands include renegotiation of the Accession Treaty, initiation of protection procedures in the soft fruit and vegetable markets and in the apple market, suspension of sugar market liberalisation and the release of the milk restructuring quota of 416Â 000Â tonnes.
Poland has been allocated a quota of 9.3Â millionÂ tonnes of milk, whereas it needs approximately 12.5Â million tonnes.
This has already led to farmers being charged an overproduction penalty, and as from 2010 will result in Poland having to import milk and milk products.
In this way, Poland is gradually losing its food security.
Europe too is losing its food security.
We need to ask ourselves a fundamental question: what are we aiming at?
Â Â  We have reached the end of the speeches.
As you can see, the Presidency is trying hard to ensure that all of you can speak and nobody is left unable to do so.
That delays the debates.
I would apologise to the Commission for making it wait longer than expected.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission Statement on the situation of the refugee camps in Malta.
Â Â  Mr President, the problems faced by Malta affect the European Union as a whole and call for a global approach to the management of migration and asylum.
The external borders of the European Union are under permanent pressure from irregular migratory flows, and many people who undertake such journeys require protection.
In December the European Council identified a series of measures that would boost the EUâs external policies on migration and asylum.
The Commission is actively seeking to find structural answers to the pressure of heavy migration on the European Union and its partner countries.
In that respect, the EU-Africa Ministerial Conference held on 10 and 11Â July in Rabat, reinforced cooperation with the African Union and dialogue with the main countries of origin have been important new political initiatives designed to discuss migration issues in detail and, at the same time, to find durable joint solutions.
The Commission is aware of the particular situation in Malta and is taking the following action to improve the situation.
The most immediate assistance available to Malta at EU level is through the appropriate EU financial programmes.
The European Refugee Fund already provides financial support for Member States in bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons.
Support for the development of adequate reception conditions for asylum seekers is a priority of the European Refugee Fund, and Malta benefits from the Fundâs assistance in that area.
The European Refugee Fund allocated to Malta EURÂ 114Â 000 in 2004, EURÂ 500Â 000 in 2005 and EURÂ 600Â 000 in 2006.
In addition, the Commission most recently agreed to provide financing of EURÂ 120Â 000 for a project to improve reception conditions on Malta as part of the ARGO Programme.
In order to address specific situations, such as those faced by Malta in recent months, amendments will also be proposed to the European Refugee Fund to enable Member States to access funds more quickly, and with the minimum administrative burden, to deal with the consequences of sudden arrivals of large numbers of people who may be in need of international protection.
Specifically, the amendments will aim to support emergency measures to grant appropriate reception conditions for asylum seekers, including basic needs and fair and effective asylum procedures.
The Commission will also shortly be making a proposal for a Council decision to ensure practical cooperation between Member States, as set out in the Communication on Strengthening Practical Cooperation adopted on 17Â February.
That proposal will initiate the setting-up of expert teams to assist Member States in situations such as those Malta is facing with reception conditions and asylum processing.
The directive on reception conditions, now applicable, sets a minimum standard for the accommodation of asylum seekers, including those held in detention or with restrictions on their freedom of movement.
The Commission is monitoring implementation of the directive and particular attention will be paid to how Malta is applying it, also in the light of the reports from honourable Members of this House following last weekâs visit.
A report on the application of the directive and possible improvements will be presented to the European Parliament in the autumn.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, last week a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs went to Malta, just as in the past it had gone to Paris, Ceuta and Melilla and Lampedusa.
We all need to be aware of and sensitive to this issue.
Rumours are one thing and facts are another.
The immigration situation in Europe is certainly not pleasant, appealing or suitable.
It is not suitable for the year 2006, for the European Union and its principles, for the Treaties or for the political responsibilities that we, as the European Parliament, have towards the peoples of Europe.
The Commission is skirting around the issue: first I heard talk of initiatives worth EURÂ 25Â 000 or EURÂ 120Â 000.
Commissioner, I should like to inform you that Malta, on the contrary, spends an annual sum of EURÂ 1 million on this problem.
Since 2002, or from its pre-accession phase until now, that country has recorded an increase in the immigration rate and now finds itself with as many as 2Â 000 more people than it knows what to do with.
The 2Â 000 people in Malta could be the equivalent of 400Â 000 people held in the national prisons of Germany, or even 300Â 000 people in the national prisons in Italy, France and the United Kingdom.
In order to keep a check on the immigrants, Malta employs 10% of its police force, which would amount to employing 30Â 000 people if it were Italy or 40Â 000 people if it were Germany; in other words, all of the law enforcement personnel put together.
That is not possible.
Commissioner â although here I address the Council most of all â we have a precise duty: we cannot abandon our Member States and, above all, we cannot abandon Malta in the middle of the sea because, in actual fact, that country is Europeâs most southerly border.
It is the border of Europe.
From that perspective, Malta cannot be regarded as an autonomous State.
The European Union needs to take all appropriate measures in that regard.
Commissioner, I call on you to convene an internal affairs council in Malta as soon as possible, before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
At present, Malta is enduring some extremely serious situations: it has 2Â 000 people that it does not know where to send and that can only be sent to Gozo, and taking that course of action would mean making an already extremely serious situation even worse.
We are making the people of Malta regret what they have done, even though they do not want to, since Malta is a resolutely pro-European country.
Xenophobia is starting to emerge in Malta, and that is a very serious state of affairs.
As Parliament, we have a duty to accept political responsibility.
I urge the Council to move quickly and to revise the Dublin Convention.
Malta must be a transit country.
People today do not want to go to Malta in order to remain there; people pass through and stop in Malta merely to take refuge.
I call on you all to support Malta.
As chance would have it, the President of Malta will be here the day after tomorrow, and I am very pleased about that.
I hope that this Parliament gives all due support to this great, ancient and noble nation that is suffering because of mistakes that we have made.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, during the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairsâ visits to the detention centres, a large number of very serious problems were in fact observed.
However, what we saw in Malta was terrible.
The conditions of detention are inhuman and degrading.
Asylum seekers are held in cages without any opportunity to get out, and their most basic rights are overlooked.
They do not have access to any legal or medical help.
We met people who had been held sometimes for 18, 19 and even 20 months, without any contact with the outside world and in unbearable sanitary conditions.
Admittedly, we can take heart from the fact that the Maltese authorities have hidden nothing from us.
This is a mark of respect towards the European Parliament and towards the Union itself.
However, these conditions of detention still constitute a violation of human rights and of the European directive on the reception of refugees.
We therefore resolutely call on the Maltese Government to put an end as quickly as possible to its system of systematically detaining migrants.
Asylum seekers are not criminals.
They often come from hellish situations and they need to be treated with dignity.
That being said, we must recognise that Malta is a very small country and that, due to its geographical location, the island is subject to particularly strong pressure.
It is therefore the European Unionâs duty to display a united front and to share the financial cost of managing Maltaâs borders by doing what you said, Commissioner, and specifically calling on â as you said, Commissioner â existing programmes, such as ARGO and the Refugee Fund.
A more comprehensive reform is necessary, however, because this is not just an issue of money.
That is why I am calling on the Commission to revise the Dublin II Regulation as quickly as possible and to draft proposals designed substantially to amend it.
Ought we not to challenge the very principle behind it, namely that the Member State responsible for processing an asylum application is the first country in which the asylum seeker sets foot?
This principle does in fact put an intolerable burden on countries located in the South and East of the Union and has the pernicious effect of jeopardising the access to asylum and undermining reception conditions.
Migrations are well and truly a phenomenon of the contemporary world.
We will not shirk the responsibilities incumbent on us as wealthy nations when it comes to receiving victims of oppression or fighting against poverty, which â lest we forget â represents the fundamental cause of migrations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to add my voice to that of Mrs Roure, who has painted an extremely vivid picture of the situation that Parliamentâs delegation found in Malta.
I would also like to add my voice and that of my group to what we have heard from Mr ZappalÃ  and MrsÂ Roure about its implications, not just in Malta but in various other places our delegation has visited, including Dublin.
What seemed like an extremely logical system at the time to the majority of Parliament â not to all of us â has real problems that need addressing.
We have heard that a number of these problems are due partly to a lack of resources and a lack of expertise.
The Commission has said that in the framework of the continuation of the asylum policy one of its aims would be to ensure that all Member States were operating to the highest possible standards and best practice.
So I am pleased to hear about the expert teams, but the Commission should not underestimate how many of them will be needed in many parts of the Union.
I assume that they will be working together with agencies such as UNHCR and others that have such expertise.
That in itself has budgetary implications in terms of the money that the European Union gives UNHCR.
We are already a large donor to UNHCR and if we are going to ask more of it, we will need to take that into account.
I also have a question to the Commission about the timescale in relation to Malta: how fast does it think expert teams can get in there?
Furthermore, what other resources will be needed to help the Maltese in the long term to treat people with the dignity they deserve?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank my colleagues from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for having nominated me and asked me to be the rapporteur for this visit that we carried out in Malta.
As rapporteur, I can only maintain that the situation in the immigrant detention centres in Malta is simply terrifying: it is a real Dantesque hell in which the immigrants are denied even their most basic rights.
We visited three detention centres in which we discovered downright inhuman and degrading conditions, unworthy of a civilised country: unacceptable hygiene conditions, promiscuity, pregnant women detained until the fourth month of gestation, terrible food and cold water showers, toilets without doors and rubbish and squalor all around.
Maltese law is abominable: it allows for 18 months of administrative detention for citizens who have committed no crime whatsoever.
I believe that that is truly excessive.
Furthermore, I believe that the treatment reserved for asylum seekers runs counter to the Geneva Convention and to the European directives on asylum.
The migrants do not receive any information, and their asylum applications are not analysed until eight or nine months have elapsed.
In Malta, even refugees from war zones, in particular Darfur, are being refused asylum.
I was struck by the sight of a man who had a card on which was written âgenocide in Darfur and detention in Maltaâ.
Europe cannot remain silent over this dreadful situation, and the visits by our committee to the temporary detention centres in Europe lead us to believe that the policy on the reception of migrants needs to be radically changed.
First and foremost, we need to widen the legal entry channels, turn the matter into a Community one and amend the Dublin II agreements and, lastly, close all the administrative detention centres located on European soil.
They are legally unacceptable places in which all human rights are being violated.
Â Â  â What the Member who spoke before me, MrÂ Catania, omitted to say was that the complaint expressed most loudly and forcefully by the immigrants in the detention centres we visited related not to the conditions in the centres but to the fact that they had never intended coming to Malta.
They ended up in Malta against their wishes, and they want to move on to continental Europe.
This, moreover, is the tragedy.
âAllow us to go to other countries in Europe,â they told us one after the other.
I therefore say that it is good that, through this debate and by means of this resolution, this Parliament is showing its solidarity with the immigrants as well as with the people of Malta, the Maltese authorities and the Maltese forces of order, which are doing a very difficult job.
It is good that the political groups of this Parliament are showing that they are able to come together to demonstrate this solidarity and to ask both the Commission and the Council to take practical and urgent action.
What is this practical and urgent action?
Firstly, that Member States should accept persons in Malta requesting asylum.
Secondly, that the DublinÂ II regulation be revised in such a way that the responsibilities of Member States are shared more fairly than they are at present when Malta, and other countries too, carry disproportionate burdens quite beyond their capabilities.
Thirdly, that the financial resources of the European Union be used also in urgent cases, as the Commissioner himself rightly said they should be.
There should, however, be an emergency clause in each of the four European funds that we shall have in the immigration sector as from next year, and not only in the fund for refugees.
Finally, MrÂ President, I should like to ask the Commission what has become of the initiative, promised last year, of joint patrols in the Mediterranean.
MrÂ President, Parliament is speaking.
We shall expect the Council and the Commission to take action.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Setting aside some initiatives taken recently, I feel that the Union has not tackled the current situation with due urgency, energy and practicality.
The resolution we have before us reflects the alarming situation in Malta and other countries in an incisive, clear and objective way.
The document rightly states that the centres in which the immigrants are detained should be run in such a way that the immigrantsâ dignity and rights are safeguarded.
Shortcomings need to be remedied immediately, wherever they are to be found.
However the resolution also makes it clear that no single country is able to cope with this problem on its own, let alone a country like Malta, which is shouldering a much greater burden than it can carry.
As a matter of fact, the European dimension requires an integrated policy based on the principle of burden sharing, whereby the burden is shared proportionately between all the Member States according to the countryâs population and GDP.
Equally important is the fact that there should be a revision of DublinÂ II and, especially, of the system for processing immigrantsâ applications.
In order to even start resolving this issue, the Union needs, however, to provide funds and not only to make promises.
It has to allocate the necessary funds to help small border countries manage this issue.
There should also be specific funds allocated to provide for emergencies, particularly when there is an excessive influx of immigrants, notably during the summer.
With this initiative, Parliament has shown that it is ready to act.
Now it is the Commissionâs and the Councilâs turn to show that they are ready to put their promises of solidarity into action.
MrÂ President, every action taken by the European Union in order to help immigrants in a way that is fair and in order, too, to provide practical help to small Member States such as Malta does more than a hundred thousand declarations or leaflets to give the European Union more credibility and inspire more confidence in it.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that the visits undertaken by the European Parliamentâs Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have the great merit of highlighting the fact that the imprisonment of foreigners has become, as it were, the standard way of managing migration issues and that this logic of imprisoning foreigners throughout Europe clearly demonstrates the limits of this development and its entirely unacceptable consequences - particularly in Malta - for the reasons that have already been pointed out in the debate.
Unfortunately, we need to move on from this de facto observation, since it was already made by large international human rights organisation in 2004 and 2005.
We are aware of the situation, and I believe that we must now simply acknowledge the absurdity of the Dublin Agreement being applied to Malta.
I believe that we must really forge ahead with this reform and, as some of my fellow Members have requested, do so in an in-depth manner.
Firstly, people arriving in Malta must be able to submit and formulate their asylum applications in the countries in which they wish to settle.
Equally, people who obtain refugee status in Malta must be able to move freely in Europe, whether, I might add, that be in Malta or in any other country in which they first set foot.
I believe that these reforms are entirely necessary if we want to emerge from these situations that are totally catastrophic from the point of view of human rights.
Equally, the European Union must be able to establish a lawful policy on migration and stop giving absolute priority to repression and to the closure of borders, with a style of management that we now see to be inhuman and totally lacking in substance.
This observation is borne out by the hundreds, indeed thousands, of people who each week drown not only in the Mediterranean Sea, but also in the waters surrounding the Canary Islands, since we know that the flows of migrants have now moved on to Mauritania.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commissioner spoke earlier about reception centres.
However, I want to say that what we members of the mission of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs saw in Malta were anything but reception centres.
It is unacceptable and scandalous for Europe, under the shadow of a crisis of anti-terrorist hysteria, to turn itself into a mediaeval fortress and to promote the operation of centres in which immigrants and asylum seekers are kept under detention conditions, contrary to the relevant international conventions.
The detention conditions in the closed centres that we visited in Malta are perhaps the worst we have seen so far.
The geographical position of Malta and its lack of financial and administrative resources to cope with waves of immigrants, especially after its accession to the European Union, which has resulted in an increase in the flow of immigrants and refugees, are no reason to justify the situation.
The practice of detention is, per se, condemnable.
Depriving asylum seekers and immigrants of their freedom is unjustified.
The conditions under which they are detained are poor and the lack of transparency in the modus operandi of the centres in question and the practices followed is unacceptable.
Â Â  â The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs having sent a delegation to Malta to see for itself the situation facing illegal immigrants, I today note with satisfaction that Parliament is attaching due importance to the particular situation we have in Malta.
Everyone present saw the difficult situation faced by all those who have come to our shores and who are staying in our centres.
They also saw, however, the enormous efforts made by the Maltese Government to enable all those who arrive in Malta in an irregular manner to be treated well, despite very limited resources.
It is clear that this situation has to change soon.
We have all heard that the influx is expected to double this year, and so the problem will continue to get worse.
Malta cannot perform miracles on its own.
We have been trying for years to attract Europeâs attention to this problem so that the necessary solutions to it might be found.
I am speaking not only about financial aid (of which, I must say, we have seen precious little) but about more practical solutions whereby the European Union, of which we are Members, might help us absorb the huge influx of immigrants to our country.
We must duly respect the dignity of the detainees, but we can no longer go on stretching our resources and making efforts beyond our means.
The situation before us is a critical one, and we have to find solutions whereby we no longer place Malta under undue pressure to take action and do not allow the situation to get out of control.
We therefore need now to translate fine words and promises into action.
The Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament should take action to put into effect, as soon as possible, the solutions already mentioned by the Members who have spoken before me in this debate.
The Government and the people of Malta will continue to do their utmost, but we are right to expect everyone to make real and practical efforts because I think that, ultimately, this is not only Maltaâs problem, but a problem for all the Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  â Commissioner, what you have said today has genuinely made me put away the speech I had prepared and address you directly as a representative of the Commission.
I do not think you can expect us, the representatives of the Maltese people, to say thank you in this House because you are going to give us money or because you have given us as much money as we collect in one day for charity at Christmas.
Your responses do not reflect what is really happening in our country.
Secondly, you have evaded the most crucial question of all.
We are presenting you with a practical proposal: that DublinÂ II be revised so that responsibility for processing the applications of people coming to Malta no longer lies with that country but is shared among other countries.
What do you think about this proposal?
I ask this because, ultimately, it is not just any amount of money that we want (and, I repeat, âmoneyâ not peanuts) but money to the tune of millions, substantial enough for providing a proper welcome to these fellow human beings of ours.
Apart from money, however, what, in terms of real administrative and long-term help, do you think would solve this problem?
That is what we should like to know today.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament regarding this very important matter.
Unfortunately, Malta has been abandoned and left to fend for itself.
During these difficult times, which are being faced not only by the inhabitants of our country, the Maltese, but also by those who are in detention, we have felt that we have been swimming against the tide, that we have been left alone and that, in spite of all the fine words of solidarity, Europe has abandoned us.
What happened and, indeed, had to happen is that, as we had been requesting for a long time, a delegation came to Malta and saw for itself the awful conditions in which the detainees are being held.
These conditions are unfortunate, and nobody is happy with such a situation; but it is a question of resources.
Two thousand people entering Malta every year may not sound very many, but these two thousand are equivalent to eight hundred thousand persons entering Germany every year or four hundred thousand entering Italy.
Just imagine the influx of refugees into the smallest country and imagine what one of the countries without any resources has to go through.
We do, emphatically, need financial aid.
We also need solidarity â the solidarity whereby you come to our aid by taking refugees into your own countries in which they can be properly absorbed, as they cannot be in Malta, which is an island of just 300 square kilometres.
I would conclude by saying that we consider you as clear proof that solidarity does indeed exist when it comes to acknowledging the needs of a country whose surface area is small compared with the vast expanse of Europe.
Thank you.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I said in my first statement I cannot agree with the statement that Malta has been abandoned.
The Commission has so far provided all reasonable support possible and all the programmes that can be used will continue to be used to help Malta solve the problem.
But we should also be aware that centres do not solve the problem and it is most important to work with the countries where the migrant flows originate.
This is our first challenge because, as long as there are conditions influencing people to move, they will move, and if it is now to Malta, perhaps next time it will be to my country or another country.
So that is the main challenge.
The Commission has already promised financial aid.
We will provide it quickly.
There are also expert teams and the proposal will be ready for 31Â May.
We will continue to work on joint patrols.
As regards the Dublin II package, it takes time even if the Member States agree â it was agreed four years ago.
It is very important that Parliament has raised this issue and consideration will be given as to how to address the situation in the best possible way.
The principle of the Member States of reception being first is quite logical, but we know what a problem that has created for Malta.
The Commission will continue to work on this issue and provide all possible support at this stage, but it is very important that the Maltese authorities also do their job because I believe that humane conditions and dignity should be considered also from the national authoritiesâ point of view.
We expect each Member State to do its homework in this respect because the Community can provide support and consider how to find the best possible answers. Yet at the same time we expect each Member State to implement the conditions that are laid down in the European directives.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report by Anne Laperrouze, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the guidelines for trans-European energy networks and on the annulment of decision no 96/391/EC and decision no (10720/1/2005 â C6-0016/2006 â 2003/0297(COD)) (A6-0071/2006).
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me most sincerely to thank my fellow draftsmen from the other political groups, in particular MrsÂ Ayuso and MrÂ Swoboda, who have supported me throughout my assessment and who have contributed a great deal to the text that is presented to you today and that will be submitted for your approval tomorrow.
I should like to thank the representatives of the European Commission and of the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their listening skills and their responses to the issues raised.
I should also like to highlight the positive role played by the Austrian Presidency, which has endeavoured to find wordings that, being based on Parliamentâs first reading, would win the support of the Member States.
I believe that it is worth pointing out the objectives of this proposal for a decision.
It is a question of guaranteeing a European label for the Olefin transport networks, thereby enabling them to lay claim to loans from the European Investment Bank, of adapting the guidelines to the shape of a European Union composed of 25 Member States, of authorising the funding of projects of common interest, of enabling an internal market in gas and electricity to be created and, above all, of ensuring the security of supply, thanks to interconnections between Member States and neighbouring countries: countries in South-East Europe, Mediterranean countries, Ukraine and Belarus.
Whereas the Council common position, which was communicated in January, proposed a different approach to that of Parliament in that it rejected the declaration of European interest and the appointment of a coordinator, the work at second reading enabled compromise amendments to be drafted during informal trialogues, which involved Parliament, the Presidency of the Council and the European Commission.
These compromise amendments entirely correspond to our objectives at first reading.
Among other things, they define the projects of European interest as a series of projects on priority axes which are of a cross-border nature or which have significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity.
It will thus be possible for these projects to be considered as priorities for funding under the category of trans-European energy networks and to receive special attention under the category of other Community funds.
The delay in implementation will be looked into, and the joint coordination meetings will address, in particular, the evaluation and the public consultation procedures.
These amendments will also provide a better definition of the role of the European coordinator, who it will be possible to appoint when a project experiences significant delays or problems to do with implementation.
This coordinator will promote the European dimension of the project, will help coordinate national procedures for consulting the populations concerned and will submit an annual progress report on the project.
Commissioner, allow me, however, to express two regrets.
On the one hand, the low level of funding available for trans-European energy networks, which is probably only just enough to fund a few feasibility studies.
On the other hand, you are aware that Parliament did not want to question the legitimacy of the projects featuring in the annexes to the report.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that priority ought to be given to projects that help secure the supply of as many States as possible, thereby promoting this European dimension.
I am thinking, in particular, of the Baltic States, whose gas networks are by no means enough to provide them with a secure and sustainable supply, bearing in mind that priority was given to the Russian-German gas pipeline as a result of the agreements made between MrÂ SchrÃ¶der and MrÂ Putin.
I call on you to encourage the implementation of the infrastructure needed in order to supply all States.
In view of the recent crisis between Ukraine and Russia and of the statements made at Hampton Court, a European energy policy is essential.
This text therefore provides the European institutions with the opportunity to demonstrate their desire for such a policy.
The new provisions introducing the declaration of European interest and the opportunity to appoint a coordinator are tools crucial to creating a genuine internal market in gas and electricity and to guaranteeing the security of supply.
This European network can only be achieved, however, by increasing the number of interconnections.
Ladies and gentlemen, I call on you to support the common position as amended by this compromise package.
Our vote will enable us to provide the Union with one of the tools needed in order to attain the objectives that it has set itself.
Â Â  . Mr President, quite recently we had the opportunity to discuss the issues related to the Green Paper on common energy policy.
I believe that the issues we are debating today â security of supply, environmental sustainability and competitiveness â are very closely related, and Europe needs a European answer.
We also need to look at how to mobilise investments in Europe. The trans-European networks are part of that.
Sometimes it is said that there are not enough funds for that, but I recently had the opportunity to be proud of a project we are supporting: the future electricity interconnector between Ireland and Wales.
This clearly shows how European funds are being used.
There are many such projects of which we can be proud; the feasibility studies we financed paved the way for that interconnector and that infrastructure.
From that point of view, I very much appreciate the work done by the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and everybody who has helped to develop this particular decision.
I really believe that trans-European energy networks will provide for enhanced development of the European Union.
As regards natural gas, for example, there is an increasing dependency on gas imports; we know that will continue.
The Trans-European Energy Network Policy aims to secure and diversify additional gas import capacity from sources such as the Caspian basin region, northern Africa or the Middle East.
We have often debated in Brussels about the need to develop the European electricity market further.
Again, for the electricity market, the trans-European energy networks will provide for the creation and fostering of real European interconnections and a European grid.
We should not only look for money from our taxpayers; we must also attract money for those projects from the European Investment Bank, the structural funds and private investors, because there is money available for investment.
Thus far, the real bottleneck is a lack of political will to build those projects or a lack of ability to take appropriate decisions.
The decision was already proposed to Parliament in December 2003.
At that time, it looked at the new challenges created through enlargement as well as at the essential energy connections with third countries.
As to the choice of projects, the Commission identified the projects of highest priority from among the larger family of projects of common interest.
Now, thanks to the negotiations between the three institutions, we have a compromise that seems â at least at this stage âacceptable to us all.
The projects of highest priority, a very selective list of projects of European interest, have the objective of supporting the rapid implementation of the largest possible cross-border interconnection capacity.
To achieve that aim, the projects of European interest need to comply with specific criteria.
They must be of cross-border nature or have a significant impact on cross-border transmission capacity, and they must be mature.
One important result achieved between the first and second reading is the European Coordinator, whose role is considered essential as he or she will encourage cooperation with users and operators and promote the projects amongst private investors and financial institutions.
As a member of the European Commission group on trans-European networks, I have seen the good work the current European coordinators have done for transport infrastructures, because they really work to promote them, to find and identify the bottlenecks and try to find solutions.
I note with satisfaction that the main elements of the Commission proposal have been retained in the package deal you are to vote on tomorrow.
I can thus fully support the agreement reached.
I should like to thank once again all those involved in finding this compromise.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a key moment in terms of energy.
The Green Paper and the recent reports by the European Commission on the state of liberalisation of the energy markets demonstrate this.
All of them demonstrate the need to enhance interconnections amongst the States and to move ahead with the implementation of the trans-European networks, in order to improve all of these energy services.
The rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, has done an excellent job, and I congratulate her, because she has been able to reconcile the demands of the Members of this Parliament with the positions of the Commission and the Council.
We support the maximum priority projects which are of a cross-border nature and which may increase transport capacity, security of supply and the trade in gas and electricity amongst the Member States.
In short, a more efficient system, which will have a positive impact on prices for companies and consumers.
In order to make the European energy network a reality, we must prevent unnecessary delays in the execution of projects, particularly those of European interest.
The governments must put all of their efforts into removing these administrative obstacles, and a European coordinator, who can contribute to speeding up projects of European interest that are experiencing significant delays or difficulties in their implementation, would therefore be an important figure.
I do not wish to end without mentioning the recent European Summit of 23 and 24 March, at which energy policy was treated as it should be treated, as a priority issue.
In particular, I am delighted that the Council has reintroduced the objective of increasing electricity interconnections between the Member States to a level equivalent to 10% of installed capacity, as agreed at the Barcelona European Council in 2002.
The increase in interconnections amongst the Member States and the increase in gas storage capacity are priority issues for the internal market.
I believe that this text that we are going to vote on tomorrow is a good step in the right direction.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Laperrouze, for the outstanding work she has done, and particularly for the way she has consulted the shadow rapporteurs and for the good debates we have had.
When we started working on this, we had no idea as to what the actual situation would be when this report saw the light of day.
The latest events have shown not only how precarious Europeâs energy supply is in some respects, but also how necessary it is in terms of our continentâs competitiveness that the supply of energy be improved, and in a sustainable way too.
We are very glad that the Commission, the Council and Parliament are in agreement as to the goals that energy policy must pursue, particularly when the supply of energy is concerned.
It is clear, of course, that not every kind of networking or connection to a network will automatically make for greater security, since certain problems can be carried over from one area to another, but, on the whole, if the electricity grid and the networks supplying natural gas and oil are made stronger, it becomes easier to compensate for them.
That would be made possible if we were to invest more in achieving diversification, something to which we are committed not merely as a concept, but also as an objective.
Mrs Laperrouze is right: it is unfortunate that the budget should make inadequate provision for this area, but this would in any case be only a small part of the total cost that would be incurred and which would have to be borne by the individual Member States, since it is in their interests to do so.
Something else that is very important is the demand for the appointment of European coordinators to be an option.
You, Commissioner, pointed out that positive signs are already evident in the transport sector, and that is indeed the case.
I was not in agreement with all the framework conditions imposed on the appointment of coordinators, but we do in principle need them if certain projects are really to be got moving.
If I might, with reference to the supply of gas, mention the Nabucco project, which affects several European countries indirectly and many directly, and would enable us to achieve the diversification we seek, then this would be one project that needs to be embarked on with all speed if security of supply is to be guaranteed.
These coordinators can mediate between one country and another and perhaps avoid the sort of situation that has occurred with the Russia/Germany project â not because there is anything intrinsically wrong with the project, but because it would have been possible to involve other countries â Poland and the Baltic states for example â from the outset too.
I hope that our energy policy in future will be a truly European one, not least where individual projects are concerned.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking my colleague, MrsÂ Laperrouze, for her work on the trans-European energy networks.
I entirely agree with her position, which laments the ever imminent danger of a return to national positions, when we ought to be much more determined to construct strong and genuinely European networks for both electricity and gas.
It is only at this level that we can manage energy most effectively: for example, it is only by means of an actual network on a European scale that we will be able to fully exploit the great potential of wind power and, at the same time, the capabilities of the base load represented by the French nuclear reactors.
It is only at this level that we can ensure genuine competition on the European market among European champions, not national champions.
The recent reduction in supplies, precisely during a period of high demand for gas, highlighted how both the interconnection between originally national systems and the effective introduction of storage facilities â including by keeping exploited gas fields that are in the process of depletion on line â are absolutely crucial in terms of implementing solidarity among countries.
Such solidarity is inalienable, as has already been highlighted effectively in the Green Paper.
That also means that we need a point of reference that can act at European level, a coordinator that can secure a genuine market for both gas and electricity and that guarantees the security of supply and the optimal use of the resources at any one time.
The construction of a genuinely European network is an unavoidable necessity.
We therefore urge the Council, the entire Union and all of the institutions to ensure that this is made possible, in the interest of the Member States and of the Union as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, the objective regarding trans-European energy networks is a good and necessary one.
A single market, however, will not solve all the problems, and, furthermore, it will bring with it new ones.
If a trans-European single market for electricity is established, it will mean a rise in the price of electricity, for example, in my country, Finland.
If the price of electricity in some other country falls, consumers in my country will pay for it.
In a single market, producers of cheap atomic and hydroelectric power would always sell the electricity at the highest market price.
Consumers in the producer country, in our case Finland, will not enjoy any price advantage linked to the fact that our waterfalls are harnessed for the production of energy from the fishing industry and transport for that spent nuclear fuel is buried for all eternity in our soil.
We have recent experience of the Nordic single electricity market concerning how producers speculate on the price of electricity so that they do not utilise all their production capacity.
During the peak in gas prices in Great Britain, the gas pipeline to the continent was not being used to full capacity.
The free market also means the freedom to speculate.
Â Â  Mr President, looking at the energy policy controversy between the Council and the European Parliament, we cannot but ask ourselves: is the Union to be an institution in appearance only, is it just to pretend to take action, is it to be a theatre of fiction?
Because this is really what this controversy is about.
There are lessons to be learned from this yearâs disputes between Ukraine and Russia and between Russia and Georgia, and those which could take place between Belarus and Russia in the near future.
The common European energy policy, while of course retaining the sovereignty of the individual Member States, must nevertheless be a new quantity.
Old methods were good for old times â the times when we had 10, 12 or 15 Member States.
Today, following the enlargement of the Union, the old mechanisms, illustrated by the old Polish proverb about everybody hoeing their own row and managing on their own, will no longer suffice.
We are facing new challenges, for instance relating to diversity of supply.
This is not a political problem, but a problem of security and an economic problem.
Poland wants to diversify its supply base so as not to be dependent on Russia.
Spain too wishes to follow the principle of diversification and to buy more from Russia so as not to be dependent on its existing suppliers.
The European Union has the chance of achieving a real rather than a virtual coordination of these actions at this time.
Europe must correctly read the signs of the times and respond to the new challenges.
The dispute about the European regulator and about European priority projects is in reality a conflict of visions, of whether the energy policy for Europe is to become a reality or whether it is to remain on paper.
If the latter, if it is to represent a simple sum of national policies, then let us say it straight out, and let us not pretend that the Union has a new, common policy.
Yet let us not be surprised about anything afterwards.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Kroes, who is responsible for these matters, for being present with us today, for it is she who is in charge of the sector inquiry which will show us where there are bottlenecks in the energy market and whether these occur naturally or by human volition.
The second thing I want to say is that Commissioner Piebalgs is currently engaged in the review, the result of which will show us where action is needed.
Recent legislation, particularly that applicable to unbundling, has brought the market entirely new opportunities.
In view of the fact that 280 projects are being presented today â 19 of them in Austria â it will be necessary to appoint coordinators who will be able to deal with the various problems that can arise in such contexts in an interdisciplinary way.
The coordinators might then form a body of their own, consulting among themselves and using best practice methods and benchmarking to achieve progress.
Perhaps it might also be advisable to devise precise timetables â that is to say, determining not only costs but also dates â and, as we indeed do in other areas, changing priorities as appropriate when going over one deadline or another.
The transfer stations, too, are relevant not only in terms of liberalisation, for there is also an ownership issue involved.
Does ownership of them reside in the European Union or elsewhere, and are special agreements required?
That is an important situation in terms of foreign policy.
Something else that needs to be considered is emergency systems: What happens in the event of emergencies or acts of terrorism or other events that cause major problems with energy?
Is it possible, in such an eventuality, to connect up certain providers or consumers?
What about the software that is needed to do this?
This is where action will be urgently needed in the future.
I would ask the Commissioner to have a Green Paper produced on this subject, so that, when disaster strikes, the necessary action can be taken throughout Europe and also by our neighbours.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution on security of energy supply adopted last month states that the creation of energy networks is a number one priority, which is true.
TEN-Energy Networks have an important role to play in the Unionâs internal energy market and security of supply, and it is security of supply that is the biggest problem we face.
The new Member States of the Union must be involved in this as soon as possible.
Speculation, something that was mentioned here, is one cause of the problems, which we in the Nordic countries have experienced.
Perhaps the coordinators could do something about this.
Our recent energy crises have shown that there is too much dependence on imported energy.
We therefore need an energy policy in which one country can help its neighbour, albeit in a way that is fair.
This is urgently needed as well.
