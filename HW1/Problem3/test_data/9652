There are countries other than Russia across that border, and I have in mind Ukraine in particular.
Ukraine is a free nation and wishes to remain one.
You spoke of showing solidarity with Africa, MrÂ Barroso.
Subsidies are not the best way of doing so, as they are mere drops in the ocean.
The best way of demonstrating solidarity is by withdrawing subsidies from European agriculture.
African countries would then be able to compete and build a better future for themselves.
MrÂ Barroso, it is essential to be guided by moral principles and common sense if weare to come up with something more than empty phrases.
I trust you will bear this in mind.
Â Â  Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently discussing your Commissionâs strategic orientations.
I should therefore like to ask your Commission, perhaps in collaboration with the Council, to give a clear message, as soon as possible, to all citizens of the European Union as to what will happen if the European Constitution is not ratified in the next two years in one single country.
I realise that the major political forces in this Parliament consider it to be just a matter of course that the European Constitution will be ratified in all twenty-five countries, but I can assure you that the reality is different in my country.
I am not saying that the Constitution will not be ratified, but nobody there is looking it at as a forgone conclusion that it will be ratified.
There is at present a sort of legal vacuum here, similar to when the initial proposals for the composition of your Commission was not ratified, and nobody is able to give a clear answer as to what will happen.
It is being said that if the Constitution is not approved in the countries of the former fifteen the process will start again from the beginning.
It is being said that if it is not approved in the new ten the same process as in Nice will be followed, namely the referendums will be repeated a year later in those countries.
I do not think that the new countries are so inferior that there should be these two different outcomes, and I think that the citizens of the European Union deserve a clear answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution fails to go through in one single country.
I should like to make one further point.
At the present time, the adopted European Constitution also includes clearly established Financial Perspectives, drawn up by the European Commission for the period 2007-2013.
I therefore consider it to be of the utmost importance that both the citizens and this Parliament should be given an answer as to what will happen if the European Constitution does not come into force.
Â Â  One of the chapters of the proposal for a decision put forth by the European Peopleâs Party and European Democrats is about how to get Europe closer to its citizens.
I firmly believe that establishing the Commission is in itself a step towards bringing European institutions closer to the citizens.
The European Parliament is the only directly-elected body of the European Union, and with the election of the European Parliament and the establishment of the Commission, a clear and unequivocal direct link has been established for the first time in the sense that the parties with the most votes will have a more definite say in the Commissionâs decisions on the issues that concern the citizens of Europe the most.
According to the European Peopleâs Party and European Democrats, there are three fundamentally important questions to be addressed by the new Commission over the next five years: competitiveness, cohesion and security, all of which have been mentioned by the President of our party.
I believe that growth, the encouragement of small and medium-sized enterprises and consequently job growth, research and development are fundamental goals of Europe that promote the welfare of European citizens.
As far as research and development are concerned, let me add that it is the European Peopleâs Partyâs determined policy to promote ethical research.
As to security, I would like to point out to the President as well, that if we examine the question of security from the European citizensâ viewpoint, then crime, crime that crosses borders, illegal immigration and terrorism are indeed interrelated questions.
It is by no means an accident that notions of freedom, security and justice are so strongly dependent on each other and from the citizensâ point of view they are downright inseparable.
The third and perhaps most important task is cohesion, the creation of European unity.
The newly-established European Commission inherited the pre-existing situation of an expanded Europe and if you are from one of the new Member States, you sometimes have the impression here in Parliament and also in other European institutions, that Europe, the European Union, has not fully realised the scale of its expansion yet.
New opportunities for a united Europe need to be created, and further steps need to be taken to ensure the success of this enterprise, which is the greatest expansion of the European Union to date.
This is not only in the vital interest of citizens from new Member States, but also in the interest of those from existing members.
Therefore, cohesion policy must be improved and expansion must be consolidated.
The expansion has only been completed from a legal point of view.
There is still a lot to do on the social and economic front and the European Union must help new states catch up and provide the means to create unity within the European Union.
With the expansion, the European Union has become a much more diverse place, but its problems have also become more diverse.
These problems need to be solved and the new questions, such as minority rights, warrant adequate, joint European answers.
I would like to emphasise the question of the Romany minority and all those that may be addressed with the help of the Commission, the cooperation of European institutions and by taking into account the opinion of the directly-elected members of Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Barroso, a moment ago, the President of our party, MrÂ Schulz, presented the vision and a list of practical proposals, and I should like today, as President of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament during your Presidency, to propose ten practical points to you.
Firstly, and as you yourself said, Europe needs the Lisbon strategy to become a reality.
It must be practical, and it must be focused.
We propose to you a five-year programme in which Europeâs development of the Lisbon strategy is placed within a time frame as specific as the one devised when we duly created the internal market in 1992.
Secondly, we need a new European multiannual growth strategy with stronger coordination of the national governmentsâ public investment programmes.
By doing things simultaneously, we achieve a far greater impact.
Thirdly, we need a Commission proposal that can strengthen companiesâ social responsibility, especially in the light of outsourcing and the major problems involved in European conversion.
Fourthly, we need to strengthen gender equality in the work place.
Fifthly, we need to double the sustainable energy objectives for 2020 from 6 % to 12%.
If we act single-mindedly, we can actually do this.
Sixthly, we need the Commissionâs programme genuinely to give higher priority to research, development and training within the financial estimates.
Seventhly, we need a European Agency for Fundamental Rights.
Eighthly, we need a charter for services of general interest that can establish the principles governing citizensâ rights in the modern welfare state.
Ninthly, MrÂ Barroso, we need a list of common principles governing âbest practiceâ when it comes to the exchange of information about the integration of immigrants into our society.
Tenthly, and finally, we need, as you yourself said, to show more solidarity.
We need the Commission to present an ambitious plan to the European Council by June 2005 to increase EU aid to developing countries, a plan to ensure that, in 2009, we make an overall contribution of 0.5% of GDP and that we establish a âroad mapâ to achieve 0.7% in 2015.
Mr Barroso, I have very quickly mentioned a number of the important points I believe are fundamental to the success of the Commissionâs work.
We need good speakers, but we also need practical action.
When I listen to your contribution in this House today, I see that such ambition is present.
We shall assess your work on the basis of the practical action taken.
I look forward to sensible cooperation in peopleâs best interests.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is by no means easy to deliver an appreciation of the Commissionâs strategic policy objectives in two and a half minutes, but, as we are in such festive spirits, I do have this to say on the subject.
Let us imagine the Commission as Santa Claus and me as a little boy.
I will have to give some more thought to the role to be played by the Council, and will leave you to imagine it as Rudolf or as Santaâs little helpers.
I now have the difficult task of drawing up my wish list, and top of the list is that I, along with all other MEPs, should no longer be denied the right of codecision in matters of justice and home affairs.
This is an important field for the EU, and one in which this House expects, from 2005, to be fully involved, for our European society is founded upon the rule of law, and every citizen allows himself to be guided by the standards set by the Community, believing as he does that these have been examined and approved by the majority of his legitimate representatives.
My wish is that that belief should become reality.
My second wish is that we should all play by the same rules â rules that we have made for ourselves.
I think we can no longer tolerate the situation in which national governments, in love with their own grandeur, circumvent the institutions they created.
When a handful of European interior ministers take decisions as a clique, they treat European democracy with contempt.
Both Tampere and the Hague Programme are good examples of a Community approach that involves everyone.
My wish is that we should press on with this open dialogue instead of forming ourselves into small clubs.
My third wish is that due account be taken of the need for data protection.
It is time that the third pillar included an instrument comparable to Directive 95/46/EC on data protection.
I would like Commissioner Frattini to remember that he has indicated his agreement to this.
My fourth wish â and my last for today â is that the European Union should face terrorism head-on, and that it should show that democracy also means the defence of democracy.
The European Union must demonstrate that it is more than equal to those who seek to send freedom up in flames.
A victory for terrorism means the destruction of free society, and that is something we must neither aid nor abet.
I would like to see the Commission valuing and maintaining fundamental democratic principles, the freedom of the individual, and giving due weight to data protection.
Most of the wish lists I have seen and heard so far are not as short as that, but for all those who wrote them they are expressions of hope.
My hope is that what I want for Christmas will not be buried under a snowdrift thrown up by political aberrations.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to make a plea on behalf of Europe's stateless nations.
Like Mr Alvaro I was struck by our proximity to Christmas.
All the good little boys and girls have drawn up their Christmas lists and instead of sending them to Lapland we are sending them to the Berlaymont.
Mr Barroso, it is up to you to find out in January whether you have been Father Christmas or Scrooge.
However, I hope you will make all our Christmases merry and bright.
I refer to paragraph 3 in the Christmas list in the name of Mrs Frassoni and Mr Cohn-Bendit and the reference to the subsidiarity protocol, which is the biggest opportunity your Commission has to put meaning to the often empty phrases about subsidiarity and bringing Europe closer to the people.
The subsidiarity protocol represents an opportunity for the Commission to do something brave and new.
It is perfectly possible for the Commission to act as if the protocol were in force from this afternoon.
Regardless of any decision on the Constitution itself, this Commission could act in a way totally unlike its predecessors and involve the relevant institution at the relevant time, regardless of whether or not it is a nation-state parliament.
By way of example, until five years ago, my own country, Scotland, had no parliament.
Now we have a parliament, a government and a civil service with near total power over health, education, justice, home affairs, the environment and many other areas.
The only thing we do not control is money, which, as colleagues will be aware, is a subject close to any Scotsman's heart.
However, we are bigger than Ireland and have more people than Denmark.
The relevant institution for the Commission to deal with in Scotland is the European Parliament and the Scottish Parliament and yet our flag is not there.
We are firmly in the second class when it comes to relations with Europe and yet we could contribute so much.
I would urge you, Mr Barroso, to make our Christmas merry and bright and use your Commission and the subsidiarity protocol to put meaning to the phrases about subsidiarity, about bringing Europe home, because you will gain, we will gain and Europe will gain.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, the economic policy guidelines for the European Unionâs strategy are laid down in the Constitutional Treaty.
Let me cite three examples from Part III: Article 177/78, which lays down the principle of an open market economy with free competition; Article 147/48 which downgrades services of public general interest guaranteed by individual states; and Article 203, which makes employment policy subordinate to economic policy.
The result of this is merciless competition to undercut in social terms, in environmental terms, and as regards protection in the workplace.
Everything the Commission does is done according to the same blueprint; you ask for a navigation system, but you already have one, in the shape of the directive on services, the directive on ports, and the third railway package.
If you really want advice as to how the European Commission should set its navigation system, then I can give you some in very brief terms: do it socially rather than taking a radically free-market approach!
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are all taxpayers, and we all pay subscriptions to the EU.
We are also all citizens with different views of the Constitution.
According to both the EC Treaty and the Constitution, we are all equal before the law.
Nonetheless, all the EU bodies now propose that we who are opposed to the Constitution should pay subsidies to those who are in favour of it.
There are major hearings to which no opponents of the Constitution are invited.
There are major subsidies to the European movement and to think-tanks that think alike, and now millions of euros for propaganda.
It is undemocratic, improper, in conflict with the principle of equality and, therefore, illegal.
I do not understand how the Commissionâs clever Swedish Vice-President can put her name to a communications strategy that will impose a particular view of the Constitution upon people.
The public authorities have just one task: to publish the draft Constitution and the alternative produced by the Convention, preferably in reader-friendly editions for every possible target group.
Opinions should be left to a free press, the political organisations and parties, citizensâ initiatives and interested parties.
States should not have opinions, and constitutions should have no specific political content.
A state is a tool for all the citizens.
A constitution should merely create ground rules for bringing the laws into being.
It is up to the people to decide the political complexion of the laws, whether they are to be adopted in Brussels or by the national parliaments and whether they are good or bad.
It is totalitarian to want to give the state a specific opinion and lock people into a specific policy.
MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m can scarcely sell that project to the electorate.
She would do much better to stick to her own proposal, which is much more reminiscent of Grundtvigâs message of âfreedom for Loki as well as for Thorâ.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that one of the new Commissionâs priorities ought to be to begin a constructive debate on the Stability Pact and possible reforms to it.
Let us quickly clear away any misunderstandings.
No one is intending â and the Commissioner responsible has done well in confirming this emphatically â to think up a reform to get around the Maastricht criteria.
Rigour in complying with the Treaty and a commitment to a progressive reduction of deficits remain the objectives needed to make Europe economically credible and stable.
I believe, however, that it is possible to have a debate on the operational criteria for achieving the objective of deficit reduction, and to think not so much in terms of a reform as of a transformation of the Pact, one that can reconcile budget rigour and flexibility in order to give renewed impetus to growth, development, employment and, finally, the Lisbon strategy.
The Italian Government has done its thinking, and has not gone unheard.
Faced with considerable concerns over the excessively high rate of the euro and the loss of Europeâs competitiveness compared with the United States and emerging countries, the proposal could be to remove investments in infrastructure and research from the calculation of national budgets.
In simple terms, this means introducing the golden rule to achieve the goal of budgetary consolidation without compromising the recovery.
In conclusion, the Pact can no longer content itself with being merely a pact for stability, and unfortunately also a pact for economic stagnation, but must become a pact for competitiveness, for structural reform and, above all, a pact to guarantee a future for our children.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President of the Commission, you have aÂ very important role and ultimately, as this discussion shows, it is difficult to build but easy to criticise.
IÂ assure you that the debate following the introduction of your programme will be far more dramatic than todays, when it is our task to present to you our aims and our dreams.
First and foremost, IÂ would urge you to address the future in your programmes, by which IÂ mean concern for the next generation, for young people and education.
IÂ would also urge you to give priority to the past and show concern for the generation which is ageing, concern for older people.
The first experimental and very clear aim will be the Constitutional Agreement mentioned by my colleague, Mrs BoboÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡.
IÂ am convinced that you will be able to assure the European Community that this is aÂ modern document which simplifies all the previous historically outmoded rules of the game.
For the first time, you are President of the Commission of the enlarged Community.
IÂ would ask you to make use of the potential offered by the ten new Member States in the shape of their Commissioners so that you too can tear down that virtual frontier that exists between the old and the new Europe.
AÂ momentous period lies ahead of you; the fulfilment of your aims, the fulfilment of the trust we placed in you when we voted for you, but, of course, this also applies to us as our assistance will be required in all of this.
IÂ cannot speak for all the Members, but IÂ can say that those of us who are here for Slovakia and for my political party are always ready to engage in constructive discussion and to participate in your programme.
IÂ will vote for it and IÂ assure you that IÂ will monitor the area of healthcare very closely and carefully.
The free movement of people is nothing more than an empty phrase if it is not accompanied by matching health cover provision.
IÂ will keep my fingers crossed for you, Mr President, and IÂ believe that in January you will succeed in putting together aÂ programme that is in line with our goals.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, the strategic policy should mainly be focused on big issues.
Tinkering with small matters eats away at both the Commissionâs and Parliamentâs credibility.
One important area of focus with regard to policy is, unquestionably, security.
We need to tackle the issue of security as a broad concept, like peace in Europe or peace in the world.
More than anything, however, we need to tackle the issue of security at the level of the individual.
Our citizens must feel that their lives and living conditions are safe.
Another important area of focus is something that is often mentioned here: competitiveness.
In this respect, the Lisbon strategy is of key importance.
The President of the Commission presented a list of tasks in connection with Lisbon and it must actually be implemented; it cannot be allowed to remain just a âwish listâ.
An essential ingredient in competitiveness is our need to create conditions that spawn new companies in Europe, which in turn generate new jobs.
These we need in order to achieve vital economic growth.
A stable, healthy and growing economy nevertheless requires instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact.
We must fearlessly adhere to that at all costs, and all countries should comply with it, both big and small.
Finally, I would like to refer back to yesterdayâs debate on Turkey.
If enlargement comes about too quickly, it might lessen our chances of achieving the results we want to see in the economy and with regard to security.
This in turn would increase public opposition to the EU.
Enlargement should therefore proceed at a sensible, controlled pace.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, a great discrepancy is becoming apparent in Europe, and we all have to deal with it, although it is of course the Commission that has to do something about making it less glaring.
On the one hand, the European Union appeals to the outside world â consider Ukraine, the Southern Caucasus, Turkey, to which reference has just been made, but also the migration that is going on, the fact that Europe is a destination for all, or many, states or individuals.
On the other hand, we find ill-feeling, disappointment, and a bad atmosphere in Europe itself.
In many cases, it will be for the Vice-President of the Commission and her public relations work to deal with that, but the Commission as a whole, along with Parliament, must work at resolving this contradiction.
This does of course tie in with what previous speakers have already mentioned, namely the fact that many members of the public believe that nothing positive is being done about reinforcing and modernising the European model â which is what we wanted to express in the resolution on which we will be voting â but rather that it is being dismantled.
Whether that actually is the case, I do not propose to consider, but people feel that social rights are being reduced, that social options are being cut back, and that there are also not enough jobs for people to earn enough money and amass sufficient financial resources to keep themselves and their families.
I believe that the publicâs perception that the social model or the European model are in danger imperils the European Union as a whole.
Even where it is globalisation or new forms of competition, which actually have no direct connection with the European Union, that are bringing this situation about, and threatening peopleâs living conditions, it is often the European Union that is blamed, and that is why we must do everything in our power to really make a success of Lisbon, so that the people can identify with the European model.
We are not dealing here with abstract concepts, but with things that are very real.
As reference has already been made to the Services Directive, let me say that I think that it, in the form in which it has been presented, may well be an example of how ordinary people can come to believe what they do.
A lot of people are afraid not only that their social rights or their rights as employees are now being eroded, but also that the same thing is happening to their rights as consumers, quite simply because the principle has gained acceptance that, in future, the lowest consumer standards should prevail and become normative across Europe instead of higher, or perhaps even the highest, consumer standards.
So, even though it is now for us to work on it, I ask you too to consider whether a different approach might be taken in future, one using something other than the principles contained in the Services Directive.
Let me say, by way of a final comment, that we all agree on the need to reduce bureaucracy and over-regulation, but, if you will just take a look at the legal opinions on how the Services Directive is to be interpreted, you will see that to say so amounts to mere pious platitudes and that the reality is rather different.
That being so, Mr Barroso, I urge you and your Commission to get back to supporting and reinforcing the European model of social and economic policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, my group expects the Commission to do at least as well as its predecessors in terms of external and security policy.
Mrs Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Mandelson are faced with the difficult task of continuing the policy of Mr Patten and Mr Lamy while maintaining the good rapport with Mr Solana as before.
We expect Commissioner Michel to breathe new life into the Unionâs development policy.
Coherence will be of the essence in order to lend the European Union the same weight in world politics as it has in the global economy.
We expect the Commission to prepare and guide the accessions that are in the pipeline, including that of Turkey, and to adopt a policy of in-depth work with our new neighbours.
Those are all fairly traditional complaints, but we expect more from you.
We expect you to become much more active in the Middle East, and to enter into fully-fledged dialogue with the United States on an equal footing.
We expect you to further shape the Africa policy without losing sight of promoting democracy, the rule of law and human rights.
We also expect the Commission to continue the policy of Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler in terms of world trade.
Indeed, the Unionâs efforts are absolutely essential to enhance the Doha development agenda.
Last, but not least, we expect the Commission to promote multilateralism in order to contribute to a more balanced, and thus, safer world.
Â Â  â Mr President, the programme statements by the new Commission may not be admissible in evidence, but they were submitted.
The faster implementation of the Lisbon strategy, with increased working hours and times, reduced wages, pensions and unemployment benefits, specialisation in part-time and temporary work, the abolition of collective agreements and privatisation in the health, education and welfare sectors will bring more profit for capital and more poverty and unemployment for workers.
The so-called 'European Constitution' and the Hague programme will result in the further militarisation of Europe, with the development of arms programmes and massacre of the individual and collective rights and freedoms of the peoples on the pretext of terrorism.
It is a policy of new privileges and power for the European monopolies.
The financing of the occupying government and cooperation with the conquerors of Iraq will be to the detriment of peace and of the Iraqi resistance, while negotiations with the WTO guarantee that new hordes will join the unemployed and small and medium-sized farm holdings will be wiped out.
The peoples of Europe should be concerned and, at the same time, should step up their fight.
Their fight can raise obstacles.
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece shall fight with them in order to put a stop to the new anti-grass roots tempest which is building up.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament is today debating the Commissionâs strategic and political goals, and the memory of the recent confrontation between these European institutions is still fresh.
In many different ways, this House is reminding President Barroso of the fact that, under pressure from the European Parliament, he has made far-reaching promises at times.
I should particularly like to draw your attention to one of those pledges, namely his promise to commit himself actively to the protection and promotion of basic rights, equal opportunities and the fight against discrimination.
We take the view that the Commission should shape this policy in such a way that the European Union does not redraw ethical boundaries.
The fight against discrimination should not result in the squeezing out of biblically-founded views about marriage and the view that life is worth protecting.
Secondly, I should like to ask the new Commission to hold back as regards the ratification of the European Constitution.
This ratification is, and will continue to be, a matter for the national states.
The Commission should keep well away from a unilateral campaign in favour of the European Constitution.
Needless to say, the Commissionâs contribution to boost turnout at national referendums should also benefit those voting against it.
In a real democracy, they too should be taken entirely seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, if we talk about the EUâs strategic and political guidelines, we will inevitably end up talking about Turkey.
Even though Parliament, the Commission and the Council have failed to even make a start on a debate about Europeâs boundaries, accession negotiations will almost certainly be opened with Turkey, a non-European country, and one which, by the time it actually accedes, will have more than 80 million inhabitants.
What fine strategic thinking that is!
We are still in the dark as to how much this accession will cost, never mind will be footing the bill.
It is a telling fact that a country such as the United Kingdom should be backing Turkeyâs accession all the way, while at the same time refusing to budge on its rebate.
The same is also true, in fact, of a number of other net contributors.
Substantial research has still not been done into the effects of immigration from Turkey.
The EU is becoming ever more estranged from its people.
We are told that we must bring Europe closer to the citizen, but when push comes to shove, nothing is done.
The Turkey issue is a perfect illustration of this.
It is a perfect opportunity to ask the public for their opinion, and yet it is unlikely that a referendum will be held in any of the Member States.
Commissioner Michel explained why that was when he was still Foreign Affairs Minister in Belgium.
He said that a referendum about an issue of this kind would open a debate with vicious arguments about Islam, among other things, which would only play into the hands of Right-wing parties.
According to him, our western democracies would not have the wherewithal to control and frame a public debate on subjects of that kind.
This anti-democratic creed is quite simply perplexing.
We should in any event thank Mr Michel for his frankness.
He has stated out loud what many of his fellow Commissioners are thinking privately.
Europe has a serious problem where its democratic legitimacy, and its being held accountable, are concerned, and there looks to be no sign of improvement in the near future â quite the reverse, in fact.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President of the Commission has already given this Parliament proof of his determination and enthusiasm by taking on the leadership of the European Unionâs executive body on a ticket of reforming practices, policies and procedures.
I hope, Mr President, that the Commission as a whole will succeed in finding what those who enter the life of an institution with energy and a desire for reform always have the greatest difficulty in finding: the right distance between realism and utopia.
It is the search for that constant balance â which some call common sense â that for the last fifty years has enabled Europe to develop the social model that is the driving force behind Europeâs identity.
The essential components of the model have been peace, prosperity and the convergence of cultures, and it has proved to be a winning model.
Today, however, we are faced with a reality in which there have recently appeared a number of hitherto unknown aspects: a worrying demographic situation together with unprecedented technological evolution, one of the principal factors to have consolidated the phenomenon that has made the world a smaller place: globalisation.
In these circumstances, for Europe to remain an area that lives up to the winning model, we must wholeheartedly accept the inevitability of carrying out reforms that will first and foremost enhance our competitiveness.
That means the opening-up of markets, increased productivity, more and better research, more innovation and greater investment in people and ideas.
The reforms that Europe needs must not, however, be seen as a task for the Commission alone.
In my view, the most critical point in the period of reform that is now beginning is rather the commitment of the Member States and their willingness to take risks in putting these reforms into practice.
Only with strong commitment from the Member States can the most dynamic sectors of society and the middle-tier authorities be encouraged to take part; without their participation no reform will be possible.
This is also an area in which I believe Parliament should take action.
Â Â  Mr President, in the introduction to your speech, Mr President of the Commission, you said that it was important to demonstrate that Europe could make a difference.
We share this aim, in particular as regards growth and employment, and, in order to restore confidence among the citizens of the European Union, the Union must clearly demonstrate its capacity to revive our economy.
The debate will, of course, revolve around the strategy and the means for restoring our competitiveness.
When you present your proposals in January, our group will be listening particularly attentively to your Commissionâs choice of economic strategy.
In this context, a number of speeches have referred to a link between the economic dimension, the social dimension and the environment, which is, I believe, no more than rhetoric and masks a real difference in approach.
In our view, it is the Lisbon strategy that represents the path to follow.
You mentioned the objective of a competitive, knowledge-based economy and we go along with that.
We believe that, in choosing an economic strategy, we are choosing a social model and if we choose an economic strategy that is only based on liberalisation, this will be at the expense of the social model.
We do not subscribe to the idea that the social aspect will simply follow on later.
I shall naturally refer to the example of the directive on services.
If the price to be paid for developing the internal market in services is that our social services â our health services â are to be deregulated, that a number of services of general interest are to be put at risk and that employment law is under threat as a result of the country of origin rule, then I do not believe the return of competitiveness will in itself allow us to retain elements of the European social model.
The Clinton years in the United States showed that it is possible to have economic growth rightly based on investment in the knowledge economy and in new technologies, but without pulling the social model up with it, since the President did not, at that time, have a majority in Congress or political support for the implementation of a social policy that would provide for such a balance.
We believe, on the contrary, that investment in social aspects, investment in public services and infrastructure and high environmental standards can be factors of production and competitiveness and can contribute towards success in international competition from the European Unionâs point of view.
We are therefore serious about this interdependence of the economy, social aspects and the environment.
We could give examples of this and we shall do so in the dialogue with you in January.
The need to increase the employment rate and the rate of labour participation will accordingly be among the subjects raised.
Let us look at the sections of society worst affected.
Women constitute one such category. It is in those countries that have invested in public amenities, such as crÃšches and in training that the employment rate among women tends to be higher. .
We could also mention other vulnerable sections of society, such as the many children from disadvantaged, in particular immigrant, backgrounds, who not only face racism and discrimination but also suffer from gaps in their education.
What must also be borne in mind is the need to reduce frictional unemployment and the fact that there have been a number of successes, for example in the Scandinavian countries, achieved thanks to investment in training.
I also believe that you will have to prove that you are capable of improving the quality of social dialogue, which will ensure greater involvement among employees in their companiesâ development.
Against this backdrop, we also await an initiative with regard to the revision of the directive on European works councils, which is now experiencing enormous delays compared to the other directives on information and consultation.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry to supplement Mr Barroso's catalogue of strategic priorities â which has already grown during the debate â but I hope that the Commission will focus upon the necessity of preventing a collapse in the transatlantic partnership.
There is currently a dangerous and unprecedented American reaction to European integration.
Europe and America diverge on a clutch of important questions: trade; science; fundamental rights; climate change; monetary policy; competition policy; foreign, security and defence policy and the Constitution.
It is a priority for us all that the Constitution should enter into force.
We have to fight for it across the Atlantic as well as within our Member States.
It falls to the Commission to state clearly what the Constitution says, why it says it, and what the outcome will be if it is not brought into force.
It is surely a perfectly sensible question for the citizen to ask 'What happens if I vote no?'.
We need some serious answers to that question.
The Commission should not fight shy of offending some of our governments that have sought refuge in plebiscites but are failing to show any signs of wanting to make an effort to win them.
The public should be informed of the sheer folly of rejecting the Constitution and of what the outcome would be for an enfeebled European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in adopting the Lisbon strategy one of the objectives that Europe set itself was the ambitious goal of becoming the most advanced knowledge society in the world.
Such an objective cannot, however, be achieved without giving renewed impetus to basic research and innovation which, in turn, makes it necessary to put greater resources into facilities, infrastructure and European centres of excellence and to target the improvement of human capital by bringing in thousands of young researchers.
This step change necessitates a rise in research investment to 3 per cent, at the level both of individual Member States and of the European Union as a whole.
The Prodi Commissionâs proposal aimed at an expenditure ceiling of 1.24 per cent of gross national income, but some major EU countries have already publicly set a maximum limit of 1 per cent.
Such a severe restriction of Community financial resources is likely to have the concrete result of penalising many high-priority policies, including the cohesion policy, the rural development policy and the funding of training and research programmes, to which development policies are increasingly closely linked.
With such a reduced budget it would truly be wishful thinking to go on talking of a renewed impetus in research in Europe and of becoming the most advanced society.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am delighted that MrÂ Barroso wishes to be informed of the views held by this House on the work of the Commission.
I shall now make my comments.
Not a single European Union competence has been devolved to the Member States since the principle of subsidiarity was announced.
It is high time we took subsidiarity seriously, and took the Member States seriously too.
It is time to recognise that Member States must not be dictated to over issues they are very well able to settle for themselves.
Indeed, excessive regulation is the next issue I would like to mention.
We must stop regulating everything.
That is the socialist approach, and socialism has been proven to fail people.
The Member States need to regain their freedom.
My third comment is that the worst type of regulation is to be found in the common agricultural policy, which should be done away with.
It is unfair to poorer Member States, especially to countries that were previously part of the Soviet bloc.
There is one notable exception to this rule, however.
The former German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, received the same treatment as members of the old Fifteen from the moment it joined the Union.
Unequal treatment of this kind must cease.
Why should a Polish farmer receive worse treatment that one in the former East Germany?
The common agricultural policy is also unfair to poor countries outside the Union, and it should simply be dispensed with.
Farmers within and without the Union should be granted freedom and equality.
My last comment concerns the approaching referendums on the Constitution.
Care must be taken to ensure that they are democratic, and that both supporters and opponents of the Constitution enjoy equal rights and equal access to the public media.
It is all well and good to support democracy in Ukraine, Iraq and Palestine, but first and foremost we must nurture it amongst ourselves.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I have six ideas to put to you.
Firstly, give back the people of Europe their confidence in a Europe of peace, freedom and justice.
What do I mean by that?
I mean that everyone should have to abide by common rules, that all must obey the Treaties, that all must implement decisions, that the Commission must avail itself more of its right of initiative and must monitor more.
The rules are sufficient, but there is a lack of political will and determination.
Words such as âinfringement proceedingsâ, âStability and Growth Pactâ, âLisbonâ and âBarcelonaâ spring to mind.
Mr President of the Commission, I urge you to withdraw Commissioner Almuniaâs proposal on the Stability and Growth Pact, which weakens the Commission and Community law.
The common rules need to be reinforced.
Secondly, do not let what you do be influenced by those who break the rules, but take initiatives to do away with unanimity in the Council, so that your success or failure is not determined by those who block progress.
Thirdly, make Europe more competitive in line with Lisbon and Barcelona, and take initiatives to remove from the internal market all barriers, blockages and distortions of competition.
We need a stronger Commission, we need more Europe, and we need more initiatives from the Commission.
Fourthly, let us not just train researchers, but also let them carry out research into things that are usable!
Fifthly, make Europe more secure and stronger on the world stage, with the common foreign and security policy, the common defence policy, a common asylum and immigration policy, and a stronger United Nations.
What we need is not for Germany to have the right of veto in the Security Council, but for the European Union to be a permanent member of it.
The sixth thing I urge is that we should make informed participants of the people of Europe.
There is not enough European consciousness in the Member States, which use a double strategy to weaken it.
Let us make it impossible to shift the blame on to the EU; this will involve you, Mr President of the Commission, putting a European information and communication strategy on the table after every summit, so that what you have achieved cannot be claimed by the nation states.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to make a few observations about external policy.
I have no doubt that we will have many meetings discussing the EUâs external policy and security policy in the coming years.
In my view, the Commission, and also its President, play a major role in controlling policy cohesion and must ensure that the Commissionâs tasks and the Councilâs responsibilities are coordinated effectively.
What is important in this is, of course, the correct use of all instruments which the European Union has at its disposal.
To date, we relied on the excellent relationship between Commissioner Patten and High Representative Solana.
However, we are now heading for a slightly different scenario, one that has been provided for in the Constitution.
What we mainly expect, and ask, from the Commission is, pending the adoption and ratification of the Constitution, is that it should continue to work in the same spirit and now to look for a model of integration in which the scope of the different pillars, namely the first, second and third pillars, can be combined.
The second point that is of importance to us is the EUâs commitment to promoting effective multilateralism.
This has to do with the Commissionâs contribution to the EUâs international relations.
We would also like the Commission to devote much of its attention to fleshing out the civilian aspects of the EUâs security policy; I should also like the Commission to return to pledges it has made in the past with regard to reinforcing the EUâs action in conflict prevention.
Furthermore, I think it is important to enter into a debate with the United States about the UNâs future.
That is a very topical issue, in respect of which the Commission can be expected to make an active contribution.
That should be a new element in the transatlantic dialogue.
As far as we are concerned, making the world more democratic â starting with Europe, of course â is the leitmotif.
I can be brief about the third point.
The EUâs enlargement and the Commissionâs commitment to negotiations with Turkey, which we discussed this week, will be important tasks in the years to come.
The fourth point concerns the relationship with Russia, a resolution on which will be adopted this week.
How can we develop the relationship with that country along twin tracks, on the one hand, economic cooperation and working on common energy policy, and on the other hand, an open debate about values, democracy and the developments in Russia in this area?
In our view, a lively debate about the relationship between the EU and Russia is inevitable, as well as a discussion about the neighbours we have in common, which should touch on Russia, Moldova, the Caucasus and Ukraine.
I should like to end with a remark in connection with the new neighbours.
We believe that the people in Ukraine have sent out a clear message.
What will be the EUâs response after the third round of the presidential elections?
We see the new neighbourhood policy, in its current set-up, is an inadequate match for what is developing over there.
I think that the EUâs action plans, in the framework of the new neighbourhood policy, must be linked more closely to the European aspirations that were very prominent in Ukraine.
I think that that requires a fresh debate in Parliament.
In short, with regard to the new neighbours, there is a need for a more comprehensive concept, a European .
Â Â  MrÂ President, behind us we have an historic enlargement and the first elections to the European Parliament following this enlargement.
It is reasonable for the Commissionâs main emphases to reflect the message that has emerged in connection with these events.
I therefore want the guidelines to send out a clear political signal worthy of the unique situation in which Europe finds itself.
We have promised that the divided Europe will grow together.
The most important emphasis should therefore be to bridge the gulf.
Differences in health must be evened out.
We want companies that operate across the borders and even out the economic differences.
In order to achieve that, we must fully exploit the opportunities provided by structural and research policy.
The Baltic must become the worldâs cleanest sea, meaning that there must be an end to the emissions from Saint Petersburg.
We want a top quality, dynamic research society in the Baltic Sea region, and there are surely corresponding expectations further south.
We must construct a legal area in which everyone feels protected by law, irrespective of where they are in the area of the EU.
Finally, we need a consistent and vigorous policy towards the EUâs Eastern neighbours too.
The crisis in Ukraine has revealed the weaknesses in our neighbourhood policy.
The EU must also tighten up its strategy and be consistent in its policy towards the countries of the Caucasus, Moldova and Russia.
These are precisely the issues also touched upon by MrÂ Wiersma.
It is easy for me to concur with Commission President Barrosoâs words in the French part of his speech: [we must set priorities for the whole of Europe].
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on other occasions I have already indicated that we should realise that a certain approach to the European project has now reached a very difficult social and political crisis point.
While the updating of the Lisbon strategy is being debated, however, concrete choices are being made which can indicate a move in a particular direction.
On this point, I would like to mention two actual examples.
The first example is a proposal for a directive, the so-called Bolkestein directive, which in our opinion ought to be rejected.
It is an outright collection of negative contents mixed up together, which would lead to an outright jungle where the fundamental rights of workers and citizens to high-quality services would be simultaneously violated, and it is therefore quite rightly opposed by the trade unions and by a wide range of social partners; we call for its withdrawal.

The second example is the proposal for the REACH regulation, designed to reform our chemical industry in terms of quality and health and safety, and we strongly call for it to be adopted speedily.
These are two concrete choices which demonstrate two different conceptions of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, this debate is about strategic priorities.
As coordinator for my Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I want to focus on one crucial priority: the internal market.
I want to say in response to previous remarks â it is a pity that some speakers have already left â that the Commissioner's support for the Internal Market Services Directive is very welcome because it is a fundamental part of completing the internal market.
Sixty percent of the European economy is taken up by services and we have a complete network of anti-competitive restrictions among the Member States.
Mr Barroso, do not withdraw the directive: make it better.
I am afraid to say that some of my colleagues are still living in the past and calling it the 'Bolkestein Directive'.
I hope, first of all, that they might move with the times and consider calling it the 'McCreevy Directive', but maybe with your endorsement it could become the 'Barroso Directive'. Who knows?
I want to make a second important point about internal market strategy.
We have to make the rest of the internal market work better for consumers and businesses.
Aside from the Internal Market Services Directive, we do not want a lot more legislation during your Commission in the internal market area.
What we want you to do is to put some serious enforcement and simplification behind the existing internal market directives.
On the ground, businesses find many of the European directives much too complicated; in many cases there are inconsistencies between them.
The objectives on the environment and social policy are, in many cases, not being delivered and yet we have the costs and inconsistencies that go with them.
Consumers are concerned that they are not getting their full rights in terms of availability of products, common prices, or access to justice if they have problems in a cross-border world.
I hope that the theme of your strategy on the internal market will be that consumers and enterprises will get a better deal from the internal market and you will bring in provisions during your term of office to make sure that we really achieve that essential goal.
Â Â  Mr President of the Commission, you expressed a personal vision nearly six months ago when we first heard you speak here in Strasbourg.
Since then your personal vision has expanded and been restructured; as you are also the head of the government of Europe, your goals will be jointly determined and we will also comment on these goals and their execution from a different perspective.
Let me refer to your first address to us, when you made the promise that parallel processes will enhance each other in your politics.
You promised a sort of Euclidean political organisational work where parallel values do not cross over and extinguish each other, although it is a great challenge.
Let me refer to two examples that have been brought up several times during todayâs debate.
Lisbon promises a Europe of competitiveness, growth and employment.
I would like to highlight my colleaguesâ comments: competitiveness, growth and an increase in employment cannot conflict with the interest and value of social acceptance.
It must be emphasised again and again that social acceptance represents European solidarity only if it is able to cross state boundaries and is able to create solidarity within all of the united Europe, as well as between states, in order to help weak and vulnerable countries to rise and catch up.
In order for this to be achieved, complex programmes are needed that help those who fall outside our field of vision (as well as those who will not make it to the job market) and that are able to rehabilitate human resources and its environment at the same time.
We need complex programmes that will make job market opportunities equal between the existing and the new Member States.
The second great set of tasks is to exercise the powers of freedom security as well as security justice.
There is no such thing as freedom security, or security justice.
Martin Schulz indicated, and I have also heard from the mouth of a high-ranking European official, that refugees to the European Union bring with them the danger of terrorism.
I hope that you reject this opinion.
It is also unacceptable to regard different cultural backgrounds or Non-Christian religious views as a basis for any sort of suspicion.
Specific legal measures are called for against discrimination and I am asking you to remember your promise of personal commitment and organisational work in order for the appropriate legal measures to be taken.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the strategic planning guidelines must also cover the area of the common agricultural policy, for the Luxemburg Council decisions also apply to this area.
A comprehensive reform of the common agricultural policy was decided on in June 2003, and this reform, which has yet to be implemented in some Member States, has brought with it profound change; it has resulted in many discussions and much insecurity and continues to do so.

The next big step that is due will be the reform of the sugar market regime, but after that there must again be some inactivity; without that, we will not be able to offer our farmers the security to plan ahead.
This must also be clearly stated in the strategic planning.
Agriculture needs periods with which it can calculate, and policy must also offer a degree of certainty if it is to have any credibility.
As regards the Financial Perspective for 2010 to 2013, Mr President of the Commission, we have to be clear in our own minds about what we want from this Europe of ours.
An enlarged Europe makes a balanced cohesion and structural policy more important than ever as a means of counteracting structural differences.
The forthcoming rural development has to do with the overall funding of the second pillar and hence with the maintenance of active and attractive rural areas, which cannot exist without working farmers.
So it is that modulation is the source of some of the money for the second pillar.
We are also concerned about our regions, their villages and towns.
Europe needs clear objectives and strategies.
The public also expect us to offer practical solutions to the thorny questions relating to immigration, asylum and security.
When all these issues have been addressed, we will also have to budget for them.
To do otherwise would be scarcely credible and will not bring us any closer to the peoples of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, we in the Socialist Group have ambitions in the field of development cooperation and humanitarian action which we will try to include in Parliamentâs recommendations to the Commission and its President.
The impetus we are calling for from the Union is enshrined in the European Constitution and it is very encouraging that here, and in other areas, the philosophy and the budgets of the Constitution are being applied even before it is ratified.
The Socialistsâ main contribution to the process of European integration was to introduce solidarity as one of the fundamental pillars of our project, solidarity not just as a great moral and political value, but also as a guarantee of peace, stability and prosperity for Europe.
In a manner that demonstrates considerable coherence, we have managed to update that principle in the Constitution, translating it to the reality of a globalised world.
In these new circumstances, intra-European solidarity is no longer enough, at least for the Socialists.
We can no longer be content with a solidarity which is restricted to the territories and citizens of the Union.
Rather, that solidarity must also be the European Unionâs distinguishing mark on the international stage, in particular solidarity with peoples who are combating underdevelopment, for the sake of their dignity and prosperity.
Our solidarity, within the new context of globalisation, must, therefore, guide the European Unionâs actions in the world, but it must also be applied horizontally to all Community policies.
Fundamental priorities for the Commission will be to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Objectives, with particular emphasis on the eradication of poverty and hunger, taking action both in the least-developed countries and in the least-favoured pockets of population in the more developed countries.
Combating AIDS and other diseases linked to poverty and underdevelopment, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must also be our priorities, as well as the promotion of women in the countries with which we cooperate with a view to ensuring their development and dialogue between civilisations, implemented by the President of the Spanish Government.
Throughout this field, the Commission will have a great responsibility in terms of promoting and coordinating its action with that of the Member States of the Union, with a view to ensuring complementarity and consistency, particularly in terms of our presence and influence in the development agencies of the United Nations.
In order to achieve all of this, it will be essential to maintain, and even to increase, the funding of our development and humanitarian action policies, fulfilling the commitments and the timetable we established in Barcelona and Monterrey, and not simply be content with that, but set increasingly ambitious goals.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the incoming Commission is starting its work at a moment that is bound to go on record as a turning point in the history of the Union.
A number of important issues have coincided; I refer to the preliminary assessment of the most recent enlargement, preparations for subsequent enlargements, including the complex debate on Turkish membership, the initial assessment of actions ensuing from the Lisbon strategy, and preparatory work for the new Financial Perspective for 2007-2013.
The new Commission will have to decide on the strategic actions it considers most important with a view to achieving the both the aims laid down in the Treaties and those thrust upon us by current circumstances in the Union and neighbouring areas.
This is an issue of great importance for the European Parliament and also for national parliaments.
Clearly, Member States are at different levels of economic development.
In the interests of all Members of the Union it is therefore essential to take all necessary action to reduce such differences, which will facilitate development of the Union as a whole.
For many years now, an active cohesion policy has been instrumental in the reduction of development differences, and has been accompanied by deepening economic integration and the entry of new Member States, which are rated relatively poorly in terms of development indicators.
This situation emphasises the appropriateness and validity of the provisions of the Treaties, in which it is laid down that one of the Unionâs key aims is attaining social and economic cohesion.
It is also recognised in the Treaties that cohesion policy is one of the Unionâs main policies.
In addition, cohesion policy is not perceived as a short-term policy in response to the current situation, but a permanent and inviolable feature of Community action.
All the experience gained to date indicates that cohesion policy is as important as ever, and this has been confirmed by successive Commission reports.
It is also apparent that, although cohesion policy requires significant financial resources, what it requires above all else is for those charged with implementing policies to show the necessary will and determination.
In conclusion, and speaking also on behalf of many Members of this House, I should like to say that we are confident the new Commission will live up to expectations.
We trust it will not start from the false premise that it needs to choose between cohesion policy and growth policy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have two clear objectives.
They are the European economic and social model which we advocate, and developing the area of freedom, security and justice.
For all this to be achieved, principles of sustainable development need to be applied.
According to the Lisbon strategy, however, competitiveness cannot come about if the Member States do not start to implement decisions effectively.
Within the Union a sort of non-solidarity movement has developed, led by those countries that are slow to implement decisions.
This is conspicuous, for example, in the telecommunications and energy sectors.
The Commission should intervene here swiftly, as it is costing us billions.
What is sustainable development?
Is it environmental, social or intellectual development?
It is obviously all of these, but particularly intellectual.
If the basic education system of our countries fails, there will not be sustainable development.
In my own country, 15% of teenage boys have dropped out of school.
The link between school and home is no longer viable, despite the fact that for years my country has been the best in the whole world in the field of basic education.
What are we doing in Europe?
The result will be a Europe of ageing and poorly educated people.
What sort of sustainable development is that?
We have to invest in research and product development.
A 3% ceiling is unachievable, except in two countries.
Take a look at all the statistics.
The countries that have achieved this top all the available statistics.
That gives us a good example of what should be done.
This is the century of revolution within the fields of information and technology.
Since the mid-1990s, 40% of our competitiveness has been based on new technology, and in the United States the figure is 60%.
We can only gain from this.
I would urge MrÂ Barroso and the Commission to take advantage of this; otherwise we will be trampled on by others.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, to answer the question as to what has to be done over the next five years, I would like to make just three points.
The first is that our great task in the aftermath of 1 May 2004 is to stabilise the process of European integration.
We must not overstretch ourselves by now accepting too many new Member States into the European Union; instead, we must join together with our ten new Member States in consolidating what we have achieved, for they want this and are willing to actively contribute to it.
Secondly, we have to make the European Union more competitive, and there is much that has to take second place to that.
Let me take this opportunity to put the very straightforward question â and I am glad that the Vice-President is here â as to whether it makes sense to use the REACH project to enhance the competitiveness of industries outside the European Union, while ushering in a programme of deindustrialisation at home?
I would like to back up Mrs Schierhuber in what she said about the sugar market regime.
Is there any sense in our allowing into the European Union sugar produced in Brazil with disregard for the environment and for human life, while at the same time making life difficult for our countryside with more and more impositions?
Does that make the European Union more competitive?
Such are the questions that the Commission will have to answer over the next five years.
The third issue is this. We need to create confidence in the euro.
This is something we can do together.
People have followed this single currency project with no more than a critical eye.
Our task must be to create the favourable prospects that this young currency deserves.
In practical terms, that means that the Stability Pact must not, of course, be called into question, nor must it be subject to intelligent interpretation; instead, Europe will not be able to produce a lasting solution to the problems of a constantly ageing population and the diminishing options for the young unless all the Member States find a way out of the debt trap.
In doing that, the Stability Pact has a highly disciplinary effect; it must not be abandoned, but defended.
Â Â  â Mr President of the Commission, the programme which the Commission will present for the next five years must have as its basic objective sustainable development, full employment and economic and social cohesion.
The citizens of Europe expect specific policies which will create new jobs and really improve their standard of living.
It is a question of the credibility of Europe that the necessary and adequate financing be safeguarded in order to implement these policies.
The Commission's stand on the question of the financial perspectives must be firmly based on the Prodi proposals and we expect a commitment from you here.
The policy on the competitiveness of the European economy has as its precondition the simultaneous strengthening of cohesion, solidarity and social Europe.
Priority also needs to be given to education, training, innovation and research and technology and equal importance also needs to be attached to upgrading services and infrastructures in the regions of Europe.
We expect specific commitments and specific proposals from the European Commission in this direction when it presents its programme next January.
Â Â  Mr President, at the start of this debate MrÂ Poettering referred to a resolution from the PPE-DE Group.
This is an excellent paper and I commend it to you, Mr Barroso.
Its priority is your priority: to make Europe more competitive and prosperous.
It recognises that this can only be done by economic reform and, as part of the reform programme, it calls upon the Commission to offer stronger leadership to make labour markets more flexible.
This does not mean that the Commission should lead only individual Member States towards the promised land, it should also lead each individual Commissioner.
What particularly worried me during the previous mandate was the way that certain Commissioners ran their own individual empires.
For example, in the area of my particular interest, employment and social affairs, I waited in vain for the Commission to act as a college and for Mr Prodi to highlight the way that certain social directives were hampering competitiveness and holding back employment.
However, this seemed to be a no-go area for the Commission as a whole, as if to say that, if it dared to challenge proposed social legislation, this might signify that it did not care about social justice and social cohesion.
We all believe intensely in the importance of social justice and social cohesion, but the greatest social injustice is unemployment: one of the greatest sources of social exclusion is unemployment.
Mr Schulz talked earlier of workers' rights, and of course these are important, but we must also pay attention to non-workers' rights, the rights of those who are willing and eager to work but have no job.
That is why the Commission as a whole must have the courage to revisit and rebalance the social agenda and to promote employment as a priority, with flexibility in labour markets as the guiding star.
Mr Barroso, you will not succeed unless you do this.
Europe will not succeed unless you do this.
You must succeed and we wish you well.
Â Â  MrÂ Barroso, it has fallen to you to lead a changed Union.
The changes have come about because of the accession of ten new Member States and because of the new eastern border.
This House believes you have every intention of fulfilling the incoming Commissionâs historic mission.
Nonetheless, if the Commissionâs actions are characterised by inertia, and if its strategic political approach fails to take these two new parameters into account, the mission will not be accomplished, MrÂ President of the Commission.
This mission consists of bringing together a Europe torn asunder at Yalta.
It involves creating a new eastern dimension for the European Union.
The first objective has to be the reunification of Europe, and ensuring that theoretical enlargement is consolidated through greater cohesion and economic solidarity should be one of the main and ongoing objectives of the Barroso Commission.
It must be an objective in its own right, and not secondary to the Lisbon strategy and subsumed within it.
In addition, good governance of the new Union calls for cohesion to be achieved by levelling out differences in economic development.
According to your statement to the House, MrÂ Barroso, one cannot have more Europe for less money.
You must therefore stand firm against the selfish attitudes of net contributors and of those Member States no longer eligible for cohesion funding following their economic success.
The new Constitution requires greater political solidarity, and it is impossible to ensure credible consolidation of the Union on the basis of this new Constitution whilst simultaneously refusing or indeed reducing economic solidarity.
Such a policy would be inconsistent and therefore ineffective.
I appeal to you, MrÂ Barroso, to defend the original budget proposal put forward by the Commission.
I urge you to hold an in-depth discussion with CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ.
As we understand it, in Parliament she adopted a position contrary to yours.
The second objective must be the new eastern dimension.
The Union is a community of values, and we ought to be delighted that these values are spreading beyond our borders.
We should be exporting democracy and human rights.
On the one hand, the Commissionâs eastern policy should be firmer, more demanding and speedier, and on the other, it should be more open and generous to fledgling democracies.
It needs to be a diverse policy, and one that imposes conditions.
It should encourage democratic choice, as in Ukraine.
Ukraine needs action, not merely words.
Its European aspirations should be welcomed, and it should be offered something more than the old action plan prepared before the great democratic transformation.
It should be offered an AssociationÂ Agreement.
The new eastern policy calls for new instruments.
The Union is in danger of allowing itself to be led by old objectives.
New challenges call for new approaches.
We trust you will foster the latter, MrÂ Barroso.
Â Â  â Mr President, President of the Commission, when it comes to setting out strategic orientations, it is best to speak clearly so that we can better express our aims.
The European Union has to be the Europe of freedom, and freedom only exists in a healthy economic environment, where there is real and effective security.
We need a competitive economy to meet the challenges of growth and full employment within a context of globalisation, the benefits of which we must learn how to harness.
The challenge we face is that of achieving an economy that makes use of natural resources in a balanced way and that is efficient because it is modern, and not because it accepts any breach of the commitments on which the essence of its social model is based.
Wealth cannot be produced without work, and more wealth cannot be produced by working less.
There is no such miracle, and those who persist in conjuring up that mirage will be responsible for less development and less cohesion on both the economic and the social fronts.
In addition, we need security.
Not the security of talk that exploits peopleâs fears or that ignores the threats, but the kind resulting from firm policies that guarantee effective borders and internal security.
Europe also needs to share with our traditional allies an international policy that promotes democracy and peace in our neighbouring countries and which contributes to a safer and more developed world.
Mr President, the coming years will require Mr Barrosoâs Commission to display competence and to chart a firm course during a period marked by uncertainties arising from the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty and the financial constraints imposed on the Member States by the Stability and Growth Pact.
We cannot have a Union with more competences, more policies, more obligations and more Member States on the one hand, and a smaller budget and fewer resources on the other.
It is an impossible equation, which, in the long term, will prevent us from achieving what we all want: a free, developed economy on safe territory.
That is truly the key to our model and to the political orientations on which it must be based over the coming years.
Â Â  â Mr President, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to focus my intervention on the strengthening of the role of the European Union in achieving a more transparent, more democratically legitimate and efficient world trade system, a system which is at a crucial stage in its further development.
We are witnessing increased international commercial interdependence and integration of the markets.
We are also witnessing a constant increase in the number of States participating in the multilateral cooperation system.
These are both good reasons for adjusting the rules and disciplines of the WTO, for further opening the markets in goods and services and for forging a stronger link between international trade and development.
This trend clearly colours the Doha agenda.
However, progress with negotiations to date demonstrates that there are difficulties.
The European Union, the most important factor in the international economy and commercial diplomacy, is being called on to take on an even more active â I would say leading â role in strengthening and constantly adjusting the WTO system.
In order for the new globalised environment to be able to optimise the distribution of resources, stability, predictability and solidarity, it will need to be reinforced with new, strong administrative institutions and mechanisms.
Only thus will repercussions be avoided such as, for example, the textile and clothing industry and the sugar regime.
My proposal concerns the fields of economic and political cooperation between the financial markets and international development cooperation on the basis of a standard for a new, international, social and ecological market economy.
Today's world needs a new, cohesive global economic order, a new system of mutually supportive institutional and operational arrangements.
I believe that this is the direction in which Europe should move and in which the Commission â I am addressing you, Mr President of the Commission â is being called on to develop creative initiatives and actions.
Â Â  Mr President, my apologies for having left the debate for a moment, but I had a trilogue meeting about unfair trading practices, which is also important, of course.
Mr President of the Commission, you have announced that you and your Commission will be prioritising the socio-economic dimension of your policy, and it goes without saying that the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this.
We all know that there is some catching up to be done in the Lisbon process, and we are delighted to hear that you want to put the train to Lisbon on a fast track.
Together with Mr Kok, we would urge you to be more focused and to coordinate the Lisbon process more effectively, as regards both the internal objectives and others, including the guidelines for employment, the global economic guidelines and the macro-economic dialogue.
We want to complete the Lisbon process, because we consider it imperative to be able to live in a social market economy in future, where efficiency goes hand in hand with justice and own responsibility goes hand in hand with solidarity.
We are acutely aware that you cannot have one without the other.
We would therefore ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to table concrete proposals in order to bring pressure to bear on the Member States and their regions, so that they can do their share of the work in the areas of education, training, and investments in scientific research, but also in structural reforms.
Possible aids could be national Lisbon plans, a number of structural indicators, involving national parliaments in monitoring and assessing the process and certainly also a classification of the Member States according to performance.
In addition, we would also urge you to ensure that the essence of the Stability and Growth Pact remains intact.
That is something about which a number of Members have had a lot to say.
Finally, we would ask you to help us to bring about the internal market in services, but in the right way, that is, with the support of the public and of civil society.
We are also expecting proposals aimed at improving the investment climate, including for the medium-sized and small enterprises that are still the driving force of our economic growth.
We all know that without any growth, there are no jobs, and without any jobs, there is no basis for social security, which we are all very keen to see protected.
Mr President, you have an arduous task, all the more so because the Constitution has not yet been approved and the financial perspectives are as yet unknown.
We are, in fact, asking you to serve up a menu without having a kitchen to prepare it and without knowing what budget is available.
However, we are counting on your creativity and on a good team spirit among your people.
If, in January, you propose solid policy and dish up a consistent meal, you will have a lasting ally in the PPE-DE Group.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to each and every one of you most attentively.
I thank you for your contributions, which reflect a wide variety of views in this Parliament.
I also eagerly await the result of your vote next Thursday.
The resolution that is then adopted will certainly be very important for the common strategic vision that we want for the European Union.
At this time I think I might already draw three provisional conclusions.
First, I note that the great majority of speakers agree with the need to define priorities that correspond to the publicâs expectations and think it important that the European Union and its institutions should respond to the primary concerns of European citizens.
Secondly, the great majority of speakers identified three basic areas for action: the area we can call Lisbon, the Lisbon strategy (economic reform with a social and environmental dimension); the areas connected with security and justice; and Europeâs role in the world.
Thirdly, I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a proactive cohesion policy, a true solidarity policy in Europe.
I particularly hope that the Member Statesâ Governments have taken careful note of this.
Accordingly, I feel that we can conclude that there is consensus regarding Europeâs need for growth and employment.
Without growth, without job creation and without greater dynamism in our economy, we shall be unable to maintain the high levels of social protection and the exacting environmental standards that we regard as part of what is normally called the European model.
What is at stake is not, and never has been, the destruction of the European model.
What is truly at stake is the need to adapt and to modernise this European model, and to take account of a number of new challenges that are now making themselves felt across Europe and the world.
The increasing age of our population, the effects of globalisation â all this requires Europe to adapt and change within this more competitive context.
I am pleased to say that I do not believe that concerns for economic efficiency and concerns for social justice are mutually incompatible.
These objectives â greater competitiveness alongside sustainable development and social concern â cannot in any way be incompatible.
We have to work to make them compatible.
These are objectives that define one of our priorities.
I therefore believe we must work towards achieving the broadest possible consensus, but a dynamic consensus and one that is not the result of cancelling out opposing points of view, because we also have to recognise that there are some contradictory priorities here in Parliament.
Accordingly, we have to identify the highest common denominator for a dynamic consensus.
I think that one consensus that has clearly emerged is the need to strengthen our solidarity at this time when we have an enlarged Europe.
We have a Europe in the process of reunification.
Our enlargement is an enlargement that has only just begun.
We have signed the treaties and have ten new Member States among us, but we have to do all we can so that we can soon stop talking about old and new Member States and become a real Union, and for that we need an active cohesion policy.
That is why I keep returning to the idea of a plan of values, and solidarity is certainly a value that can unite us.
That is why I say that now, when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe, I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national, regional and local identities.
European diversity is what truly defines our identity and, if we want to define identity, we must define it in terms of the values enshrined in the European Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, that is, respect for the dignity of the human being, for human rights, for justice, for the rule of law and for the principles of freedom and equality.
These are the values that define our identity.
Respect for the principle of non-discrimination and tolerance towards anyone who comes in through our borders.
It is therefore on the basis of these values that we can promote the idea of Europe around the world.
I said in my first speech that it is on the basis of these values that we can best look after our interests.
We are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbourhood policy: a policy for our Eastern or Mediterranean neighbours that promotes stability and peace, as we have been doing in Ukraine, for example.
I should like to underline something that has not always been put into words.
The signals that the European Union has sent out during the current crisis in Ukraine have been highly positive.
Without any competition for the limelight, we have had the Council Presidency, the European Council, the European Commission and some Member States all involved in seeking a peaceful, democratic solution for Ukraine.
That reflects very well on our Europe.
We must also, however, have a generous development policy.
As I have already said, Europe cannot be selfish.
The policy must reflect externally what we now do internally, having overcome a great many historical conflicts by means of collaboration between Member States that were very often at war with each other in the past.
That is why I believe we have the duty to advocate effective multilateralism, whereby we work on a platform of equality and respect with our principal partners, we seek to revitalise the transatlantic alliance, and unite all our partners around values such as freedom, peace and democracy.
That is how Europe progresses â by enriching its heritage, by building and renewing a dynamic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qualities that make it so different.
I should like to finish, ladies and gentlemen, by assuring you that the Commission will seek to take account of Parliamentâs positions, so as to incorporate those positions into what we hope will be a strategic vision not just for one institution or another, but a strategic vision for all European institutions and for the European Union as a whole throughout the next five years.
Â Â  At the conclusion of this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure.(1)
The vote will take place on Thursday.
The debate is closed.
We shall proceed to the formal sitting for the award of the Sakharov Prize to the Association of Journalists of Belarus.
It is a great honour and pleasure for me to welcome the winners of the Sakharov Prize 2004, a prize which the European Parliament is awarding to the Association of Journalists of Belarus, headed by its President, Mrs Zhanna Litvina.
I would like to welcome you in your language: , Mrs Litvina.
I must inform Parliament that the representatives of the Association of Journalists of Belarus include Svetlana Zavadskaya, whose husband has been missing since July 2000.
We wish to express our sympathy and solidarity with Mrs Zavadskaya and her family at this very difficult time.
This prize recognises a group of professionals who risk their lives on a daily basis to seek out the truth and communicate it to their citizens.
In 2004, more than 50 journalists have been murdered throughout the world, together with 14 media assistants.
Around 200 have been imprisoned and we should remember that two French journalists have been held in Iraq for more than 100 days now.
2004 has not been Belarus's best year.
The pressure from the authorities on the independent media has increased considerably.
The State has continued to silence critical voices, imposing fines, systematically suspending and closing newspapers, harassing journalists and taking criminal action against them.
Freedom is what society has the right to do and know and what the State does not have the right to hinder.
In Belarus, however, it is hindered.
Within Belarus's dictatorial system, the result of elections not recognised by the international community, access to information not filtered by the authorities involves risk, and the Association of Journalists of Belarus and its one thousand members, being awarded this prize today, run that risk every day.
Having suffered various methods of traditional censorship, the Association manages, courageously, to broadcast its information via the Internet.
But the authorities continue to pursue you and, nevertheless, you continue to try to keep the public aware of the right to freedom of expression and the need to exercise it.
The attacks suffered by your Association are attacks against fundamental human rights, which are enshrined in the Charter of Rights and in the draft European Constitution.
Madam President, I would like to inform you that we in the European Parliament have decided that our Delegation for Relations with Belarus will not maintain relations with the authorities of the regime, and will only maintain them and promote them with the NGOs and with civil society.
We are all saddened and frustrated to note that, 15 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, vestiges of that artificial division of Europe still remain.
We are frustrated to know that in Belarus the death penalty is still in force, and it is the only country in this continent which still applies it.
The prize we are awarding today reminds us that there are borders within Europe which restrict the application of our values.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that our Parliament usually stays in contact with previous winners of the Sakharov prize and that this month it will be 14 years since we awarded this prize to Aung San Suu Kyi, who is still under arrest in Myanmar, and whose immediate release we continue to demand.
Madam President, perhaps I should make it absolutely clear that, when you have returned to your country, we will continue to support you through all of our resources and we call on the Belarusian authorities to respect your rights and freedoms.
I would like to congratulate you on the work you are doing in Belarusian: , Mrs Litvina.
You have the floor.
Â Â  (1) Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a very emotional moment for me, because this is an extremely important, significant moment for my colleagues and I. The fact that we are receiving this prize as an organisation is a sign of solidarity and support for the entire Belarusian democratic movement and support for the political forces that will finally ensure that in future there will be a link between Belarus and the European Union.
The fact that this prize was initially put forward for two Belarusian organisations â the second organisation was the youth organisation ZUBR â is probably a sign that Belarus is the focus of international attention and that my country, which one of my colleagues has described as a chess piece which has fallen off the chess board, will once again become an independent entity in European politics and will one day take a worthy place among the other nations around the European table.
The prize is such an important signal for us because we understand our problems, but they are not just a matter of upholding our own professional principles.
It is also about defending the rights of all our citizens to receive objective, uncensored information.
It is extremely important that our problems are understood by you and by European politicians.
Unfortunately, the Belarusian authorities have managed to create a closed society built on isolation and disdain for democratic values.
They protect their stability and survival by means of total control over the flow of information.
The electronic media are almost totally monopolised by the authorities.
The situation is worse because the work of these monopolised media is directed at discrediting any political adversaries, and the monopolised media try to reinforce stereotypes and myths.
One such widespread myth in Belarus is that nobody in Europe is watching us, nobody expects us to join them and Europe is hostile and aggressive towards us, the only guarantee of stability in our country is the head of state, and so on and so forth.
Despite our constitutional provisions, there is only one obligatory ideology that prevails in Belarus now.
In Belarus a process has now been completed â the creation of a new state structure which is known as the ideological 'vertical'.
There is total intolerance of criticism and we are not allowed to object or express our views.
My colleagues know that we are subject to use of the criminal code against us if we criticise the President.
Two years ago, Paval Mazheika, a young journalist, was given a prison sentence under the criminal code.
During political campaigns there is even more pressure on the non-state press; the referendum and the recent parliamentary elections are a case in point.
On the eve of the referendum my colleague, Elena Ravbetskaya, the editor of the newspaper published an article in which she said that calling the referendum was 'a challenge to society' and that to carry it out required a total lack of conscience and total neglect of public opinion.
My colleague was also tried and fined as a result. Her newspaper has also been punished and has been closed down for three months as a result of that article.
Again, two weeks ago, a very well-known person, Garry Pahaniayla, Vice-President of the Belarus Helsinki Committee, was also sentenced for slander against the state.
The reason for this was a cassette taped by a Swedish television journalist, which was confiscated from him at the border.
Mr Pahaniayla had given an interview and mentioned the names of those suspected of involvement in the disappearance of Belarusian opposition politicians.
That was sufficient for them to bring him to trial and he may well be imprisoned for five years as a result.
We are very concerned that, despite the conclusions reached in the report on the disappearances of Belarusian politicians and journalists by Christos Pourgurides, a Council of Europe special rapporteur, and despite the international community's close attention to this subject, it seems that the Belarusian authorities are still not interested in a full in-depth investigation of these disappearances or in publishing such an investigation.
We still do not know what happened to Dmitry Zavadsky, who disappeared four years ago.
He is a journalist and a member of our organisation and the authorities have never told us what happened to him.
His wife, Svetlana Zavadskaya, is on our delegation.
The issue of the disappeared is still in the newspapers.
Three years ago, during the presidential election campaign, we were punished for mentioning this.
There was direct censorship.
At the beginning of this year, in the last campaign for parliamentary elections and the referendum, we saw for the first time the summary closure of newspapers at the behest of the Ministry of Information.
There were 19 cases of suspension of the activities of independent media outlets.
Our colleague, Andrey Shantarovich, actually went on hunger strike as a result of his paper being shut down.
After the hunger strike he was charged with carrying out an unauthorised protest.
This was absurd.
The information about his hunger strike had been published all around the city and, as a result, he was fined for the hunger strike.
Suspending the activities of newspapers is aimed firstly at hitting the newspapers economically.
Economic discrimination has become one of the ways of restricting the activities of the independent press.
My colleagues in the press are coming up against major obstacles in the distribution of their newspapers.
The distribution of alternative, accurate information to citizens is one of the major problems facing our society.
If a publication criticises the authorities, this automatically leads to problems with the printing houses.
According to the Ministry of Information, there are hundreds of independent printing presses, but already five independent publications can no longer be printed in our country; they have to be printed in Smolensk in Russia because they cannot use printing presses on Belarusian territory.
I can say quite categorically that the journalists â my colleagues from the independent press â remain true to the principles of their profession.
The independent press, which still appears in Belarus, is virtually the only institution which exercises any scrutiny over the state and it is the only source of free information to citizens.
It would not be possible for us to survive without the collective support of international and European organisations.
I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to ArticleÂ 19; to the International Federation of Journalists; Reporters without Borders; the International League for Human Rights; the Danish organisations; the Helsinki Committee from Sweden and Norway; the Centre of Extreme Journalism, as it is called â a Russian organisation; and the Glasnost Defence Foundation.
All these are partner organisations that are helping us, and our strength lies in this partnership and cooperation.
It is very important for us that European society and the European institutions should not weaken their position with regard to the principles of freedom of speech and human rights.
If there were to be any weakening of those positions, then the repressive machine within Belarus would start to go into overdrive and we would feel even more pressure against us.
Recently, at international level, many politicians from eastern European countries have expressed their concerns about the situation in Belarus and are prepared to work towards formulating a strategy towards Belarus at European level.
I would like to express our support for that and the certainty that a common European strategy towards Belarus will emerge and will very much help our situation.
We can only combat a totalitarian regime by creating an open information society; a society that would encourage debate; a forum â which is a place for people to receive accurate information.
We have a comprehensive programme which we feel will help to unlock the situation in our country.
We are prepared to discuss that with you.
I will just mention a few of the priorities.
We need support for what is legal and what is still working in Belarus.
Basically, what I am referring to is the independent press and the non-governmental organisations that are still operating in our country.
What is also very important for us is the effect of the strengthened presence of the European Union in Belarus â something that we would encourage.
Perhaps there is some way of establishing a European Union special representative for Belarus.
We feel it is very important that our people should receive a message from the European Union.
Its value would be that our return to Europe depends on us, the Belarusian people.
We understand that today, Belarus's visiting card unfortunately implies the Lukashenko regime.
In fact there are ten million people in our country and at least half of those associate the future of our country with a return to Europe.
I should like to take this opportunity to urge the Members of the European Parliament â especially the members of the delegation to Belarus â to support our proposals with regard to staging hearings on the media situation in Belarus.
Such hearings might lead to recommendations on bringing our legislation into line with European standards and would help us to demonopolise the mass media.
Once again, I thank you for this award.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the formal sitting is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, pursuant to RuleÂ 166 of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, I should like to enquire on what legal basis the miniature national flags were removed from the seats occupied by Polish Members from the League of Polish Families?
Is there any legal basis for removing someone elseâs property, and on whose orders were the flags removed?
We insist they be returned immediately.
As far as we are concerned, they are holy.
In addition, I fail to see how they could be detrimental to the European Parliament.
Â Â  This is an important issue, ladies and gentlemen.
As you will be aware, we do follow the Charter of Fundamental Rights in absolutely defending the right to property.
This morning, the Houseâs services were informed that a number of flags that had been in this Chamber were no longer there.
Even after painstaking investigations, it has not been possible to determine who removed them and where they are now.
I would ask the indulgence of the Polish and other Members.
We will continue our investigations and hope that the flags will turn up somewhere, but, for the moment, they have simply disappeared.
I must, however, point out, ladies and gentlemen, that it has not hitherto been good practice in this House for individual delegations to use flags to mark where they sit.
Let me further point out to you that the Bureau, at the request of one of the Vice-Presidents, considered this issue yesterday and that this issue of flags is on the agenda for the next meeting of the Bureau, which will deal with the matter.
Â Â  We shall now proceed to the vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, in accordance with the Rules, I had asked to make a comment about this report, and I am sorry I was not called before the vote.
I rise not because this is a controversial report for this Parliament â on the contrary, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted it overwhelmingly; and I am glad that Parliament has done so too, because it is about fairness and ensuring equality of opportunity between all 25 Member States.
All this report does is to permit the 10 new Member States to take advantage of an experimental scheme for applying reduced rates of VAT to labour-intensive services, which 9 of the previous 15 had been doing since 1999.
The scheme was unexpectedly carried forward and therefore was not included in the enlargement negotiations.
I am very pleased that this vote has carried today.
However, this a controversial matter in the Council.
Indeed, unanimity is required even for this report to be implemented by the Council.
I regret to say that my own Member State, the UK, is one of those which has 'reservations' about this; and some members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs feared that perhaps the UK or others might torpedo this report.
But, more than that, this Parliament has, since the start of the experiment, wholeheartedly supported the principle.
I hope that this vote today will encourage the Council to ensure fairness across all 25 Member States for the remaining time of the current experiment; and I also say, with the full support of the chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mrs BerÃšs, that we should be pressing the Council to make this a permanent feature of our hopes of achieving the Lisbon Strategy.
I hope Parliament will support that.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  .â I voted for the request for consultation of the European Economic and Social Committee â European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development on the proposal for a Council regulation on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).
I consider that the European Economic and Social Committee should be consulted in view of the strategic importance of the common agricultural policy reforms in 2003 and 2004.
Since it has been concluded that the main target of policy reform in the new financial period should be rural development, it must also be underlined that more than half of the EU-25 population lives in rural areas, which cover 90% of our territory.
Rural development is therefore an important political area, a fact that was reiterated in the conclusions of the Lisbon (March 2000) and Gothenburg (June 2001) European Councils.
I think it is essential, then, that we, together with the various institutional players, should find measures that will help to monitor and to further supplement the CAP reforms and to ensure that they are consistent with first pillar instruments and policies, and that will also contribute to other political priorities of the European Union, such as the sustainable management of natural resources, innovation and competitiveness in rural areas, as well as economic and social cohesion.
Â Â  .â I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions â ERDF, ESF and the Cohesion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund.
I consider that one of the fundamental instruments behind the solidarity that defines the European Union is its cohesion policy â a policy that must be ambitious and able to address the challenges of the latest enlargement and the new prospects for economic growth in Europe.
Consultation of the Committee of the Regions is essential in view of the strategic importance of these funds.
The Unionâs cohesion policy makes an important contribution towards achieving its growth and cohesion objectives because, by reducing economic and social disparities, the Union is helping to ensure that all regions and social groups can contribute.
Â Â  .â I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions â ERDF on the proposal for a Council regulation on the European Regional Development Fund.
I think this consultation is essential in view of the importance of the ERDF in correcting regional imbalances.
Regional disparities within the EU have become worse since the recent enlargement, because there has been a huge increase in the number of underdeveloped regions.
I consider the harmonious development of the various regions of Europe to be a constant challenge to which we must respond with clear objectives and firm political decisions.
The development of the Communityâs territory, which has increased with enlargement, requires greater territorial cooperation, based on joint local development projects within the context of cross-border cooperation and on measures leading to integrated territorial development, for which we need the participation of all the regional players.
Â Â  .â I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions â Cohesion Fund on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund.
The contribution that the Committee of the Regions can make to the Cohesion Fund review process is indispensable, since this is the fund that will help to finance projects in the fields of the environment and trans-European networks on the subject of transport infrastructure.
I believe that this review should retain the basic principles that define this policy and base itself on a global balance between strengthening the strategic dimension on the one hand and simplifying the implementation system on the other, without thereby creating a situation that reduces solidarity among the Member States, which is both a principle and a characteristic of this Union of States.
Â Â  .â I voted for the request for consultation of the Committee of the Regions â European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC) on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European grouping of cross-border cooperation (EGCC).
The Committee of the Regions ought to be consulted in view of the importance of the powers exercised by bodies with local and regional power in their capacity as public authorities.
In view of the serious difficulties encountered by the Member States, regions and local authorities in carrying out and managing cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation measures in a context of different national laws and procedures, it is essential to adopt adequate measures at Community level to alleviate such difficulties.
This new Community-level cooperation instrument will allow the creation of Community territory of cooperative groupings with their own legal personality, called âEuropean groupings of cross-border cooperationâ (EGCC).
The harmonious development of the Community as a whole and the strengthening of economic, social and territorial cohesion require a strengthening of cross-border cooperation and the adoption of measures providing for the removal of obstacles that hinder cross-border cooperation.
Â Â  .â The full, harmonious integration of the ten new Member States requires the adaptation of all protocols previously confined to the 15 Member States, and it also requires that this adaptation should take place as soon as possible.
Â Â  .â This proposal is the result of the authorisation granted by the Council of the European Union to the European Commission on 26Â January 2004 to undertake and conclude negotiations with Mexico, with a view to the conclusion of an Additional Protocol to the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United Mexican States, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the European Union.
The accession of the above-mentioned new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adaptations so as to place them on an equal footing in the customs, economic and competition fields.
I voted for the proposal.
Â Â  .â The full, harmonious integration of the ten new Member States requires the adaptation of all protocols previously confined to the 15 Member States, and it also requires that this adaptation should take place as soon as possible.
Â Â  .â This proposal is the result of the authorisation granted by the Council of the European Union to the European Commission on 23 February 2004 to undertake and conclude negotiations with the Republic of San Marino, with a view to the conclusion of a Protocol to the Agreement on Cooperation and Customs Union between the European Economic Community and the Republic of San Marino, regarding the participation, as contracting parties, of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic, pursuant to their accession to the European Union.
The accession of these new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adaptations so as to place them on an equal footing in the customs, economic and competition fields.
I have voted for the proposal.
Â Â  .â I voted for the proposal for a Council directive because I believe it has already been afforded sufficient unequivocal scrutiny and appreciation in the Committee on Agriculture, where it gained well-deserved, unanimous approval.
Nonetheless, I wonder whether it is worthwhile and necessary for such questions that merely correct or update legislation to have to follow the same procedure (albeit simplified) as other reports that deal with significantly more important topics.
In fact, in the case in point, I believe that the change made to Directive 87/328/EEC can only be understood in the light of an excessively positivist interpretation of Community law, since the storage of frozen semen of bovine animals that is provided for at âsemen collection centresâ (with own production) could, by recourse to ordinary rules of legal interpretation, include the âsemen storage centresâ (without own production) without any formal correction being necessary.
It may sound trivial, but sometimes even the ridiculous can be treated seriously, or something serious can seem ridiculous.
Â Â  .â I welcome the proposal to amend the Council regulation on support for rural development from the EAGGF âin order to prevent any difference in treatment between the Member Statesâ that made up the European Union before enlargement and the current 25 countries.
It should be noted that this measure arises in the context of a debate on the budget in which there will be a real cut in funds compared with the pre-enlargement period.
That means the continuation of a policy whereby support for rural development is used as part of a strategy to contain common agricultural policy costs, to liberalise agricultural markets and to negotiate with the World Trade Organisation.
Such measures, however, do not address the need to correct the profound injustices present in the European Unionâs agricultural policy and do not help the necessary and urgent drive for economic and social cohesion between its various Member States.
The effective promotion of rural development requires farmers, agricultural production and a model of sustainable human development based on the enhancement of economic, social and cultural specificities and diversities.
Â Â  The June Listâs three members voted against the report, since it is an integral part of the provisions for the common agricultural policy, which we wish to abolish.
The common agricultural policy basically needs to be reformed, and the debate on its reform must begin without delay.
We believe that, as early as 2005, the EU should begin cutting back on agricultural aid.
As a rule, the members of the June List cannot therefore vote in favour of the various reports within the agricultural sphere that are presented to the European Parliament.
Â Â  . â We consider it right in principle that the level of participation in programmes supporting rural development by countries which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 should be balanced with that of the existing Member States.
Nonetheless, we are impressed by the assurance that this balancing act will be achieved at no financial cost to the Community budget, given that the participation of the ten new countries in the programmes will increase from 80% to 85%, and by the fact that it concerns objective 1 regions only, leaving the question of the other regions unclear.
The above deliberate 'ambiguities' are rooted in the fact that the misleading statements about 'supporting agriculture' hide an effort, via specific programmes, to structurally adapt Community agriculture to the demands of the CAP, the WTO and the multinationals and monopolies and to redistribute resources between the first and second pillar in order to conceal and mitigate the consequences and prevent social outcry, given that the aim of 'differentiating economic activities in the countryside' means in practice a drastic reduction in paramount agricultural activity and the search for 'analgesics' for farmers in the new and old Member States whose holdings are wiped out.
What is ultimately important is not the size of the appropriations and the number of programmes, but their orientation, which is acutely anti-farming and hostile to any real rural development.
Â Â  .â Since this proposal concerns an amendment to the regulation in order to prevent any difference in treatment between the old Member States and those that acceded during this yearâs enlargement, and since there is no budgetary change resulting from that amendment, I am in favour of it.
Â Â  .â I recognise that the Member States that joined the Community on 1 May 2004 deserve at least the same treatment from its institutions as that granted to the older Member States.
I therefore voted for the proposed amendment, since it aims at preventing a situation of inequality from arising as regards the limit of the financial contributions to be made under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, in that it is preferable to apply the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47(2) to the new Member States.
Â Â  .â This is an administrative issue but one that is correct in terms of accounting practice since it puts right a situation that was justified before Austria joined the Union but no longer makes sense.
I am therefore in favour of this report.
Â Â  .â The milk produced in the Austrian regions of Kleinwalsertal and Jungholz is only accessible to German buyers, since the only access to those areas is by road from Germany.
Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, however, which introduced direct payments for the dairy sector, left the administration of the individual reference quantities of the producers in question to the German authorities.
At the same time, it stipulated that the dairy premium should be paid out by the Austrian authorities within the limit of their national reference quantity and their budgetary ceiling. This resulted in a highly irrational situation, as one might imagine.
It is essential to administer the dairy premium in a fair and balanced way. It is therefore necessary to convert the German reference quantities of the producers concerned into Austrian reference quantities as from milk quota year 2004/2005.
I voted for the proposal.
Â Â  .â I voted for the report because I believe it is essential that our legal instruments should be amended following the Council decision of June 2004, so that the process may take its course and achieve all its objectives, which will only be possible â and truly effective â with the amendments suggested here by the Council.
Â Â  .â Perhaps because I am a citizen of a Member State that has benefited and still benefits from financial instruments that promote development and cohesion within Europe and because I can see the real improvements that they have brought to my country, I believe I am in a position to understand the crucial importance of access to those instruments by the new Member States and also by candidate countries, as is the case with Croatia.
I therefore think it is beneficial to amend the regulations laid down under those instruments, so as to enable that country to have satisfactory access to them as part of the pre-accession process on which it is embarking.
Even during the currency of the present financial perspective, the instruments in question (PHARE, ISPA, SAPARD) will be able to contribute to structural improvements in administrative, legal and environmental terms and in the agricultural and transport sectors, preparing Croatia to adopt the unified Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), which will be made available to it from 2007.
Â Â  . It is crucial that statistics are reliable, and for that to happen, agreements must be in place between different countries in order to ensure the validity of the data used as indicators, due to the fact that they are recognised and mutually validated.
In the particular case of the Swiss Confederation, this question takes on greater importance given that countryâs proximity.
Â Â  . The report before us follows up the Council decision on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation in the field of statistics.
As we know, relations between the EU and Switzerland have grown closer over the course of the years, at economic, social and political levels.
The plan here is for those relations to extend into the area of statistical cooperation.
I, personally, fully endorse the proposal before us, which, as far as we are concerned, should have been implemented long ago.
Switzerland was actually a party to the agreement on the European Economic Area â an agreement that covered statistical cooperation â but was unable to ratify it, because of a ânoâ vote in a national referendum on the issue in 1992.
Accordingly, following various bilateral agreements, some of which were more formal than others, it is time to draw a definitive line under the 1992 reverse, and definitively to conclude the negotiations mandated in 2000, thereby establishing a complete framework for cooperation with Switzerland extended to the area of statistics.
Â Â  The purpose of the regulation with which the report is concerned is to employ support measures to improve social conditions, employment and the completion of a free-trade area for the area of Europe and the Mediterranean.
A free trade area is, however, best set up through the EUâs abolishing duties, subsidies and export grants.
It is up to each Member State to decide upon support measures in the form of aid and investments, without making a detour via the EU budget.
The June List cannot therefore vote in favour of the report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gargani () on the proposal for a Council regulation on financial and technical measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership (MEDA) (Codified version).
Simplifying and clarifying Community legislation are important ways to bring the institutions closer to the citizens.
The dispersed nature of many provisions, and amendments thereto, adversely affects the transparency needed for people to be able to understand Community texts.
Codification is laudable work and absolutely necessary.
Europe must be at the service of the Member States and their citizens, and, accordingly, must not produce legislative texts that are cloaked in obfuscation.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this new codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1488/96 and subsequent amendments thereto, which fully preserves the content of the codified acts.
This satisfies the intention to press ahead with simplifying and clarifying Community legislation, in order to make it easier for everyone to access, to understand and to implement it.
This is an area that I have always believed to be of major importance to the EUâs future: namely, making European legislative mechanisms and regulations easier to understand, raising awareness of them and bringing them closer to Europeâs citizens.
As regards this particular issue, I should also like to point out that various recent European Councils, (Lisbon, Corfu and Essen) have noted that the Mediterranean zone is a priority region for the EU and have adopted the aim of establishing a genuine and effective Euro-Mediterranean partnership.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the proposal before us aimed at codifying DecisionÂ 73/391/EEC and subsequent amendments and additions thereto, on consultation and information procedures in matters of credit insurance, credit guarantees and financial credits.
This is merely a matter of formal amendments required by the codification process.
In this case, codification is all the more important given that the issue is of a special cross-border nature.
One last thing to which I should like to draw your attention, which is consistent with the Economic and Social Committeeâs opinion: careful attention should be paid to the accuracy of translations, because any inaccuracies could lead to legal uncertainty and, in turn, to incorrect implementation of the text.
Â Â  . The proposal before us simply consists of codifying all existing Community legislation in this area, in order to ensure greater clarity and better understanding of the legislation.
It is important that this should be the case.
There have been many directives regulating the minimum level of crude oil and/or petroleum products.
Broadly speaking, all of those directives stress the fundamental importance of such products to the Communityâs supply of energy products.
These products come from third countries, and a reduction in their supply might have serious effects on the European Communityâs economic activity.
Against this backdrop, the proposal before us seeks to help European citizens to be aware of and to understand the rules and, more importantly, seeks to create the necessary conditions to solve any potential shortage of this vital energy source.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  We believe it is those countries situated around the Baltic Sea that must deal with the issue of the future management of fishing resources in the Baltic.
We believe that the European Communities should not have that competence.
The issue of managing the worldâs fishing resources must be dealt with partly via the United Nations and, in the case of the Baltic, between the Baltic countries.
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . I welcome this report fulfilling the European Parliament's requirement to verify the credentials of its Members, (under the terms of Article 12 of the Act concerning the election of the representatives of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, as amended by the Council decision of 25Â June/22 September 2002) working on an EU and Member State level.
This report highlights the need to update the current provisions of the Rules of Procedure, making them more compatible with the new provisions of the 1976 Act.
In particular, this report emphasises the need to combat certain loopholes arising in the transition from one parliament to the next.
For example, dual parliamentary mandate issues.
Â Â  . The issue before us is a Commission proposal on the future management of the fisheries resources of the Baltic Sea and the Belts.
The proposal seeks to reshape the nature of the relationship between the EU and third countries that are party to agreements concluded on the above-mentioned sea areas, following the recent accession to the EU of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
Currently, and until December 2005, the future management of fisheries resources of the Baltic Sea and the Belts is regulated by the 1973 agreement, concluded by the European Community, the Baltic States, Poland and Russia, known as the Gdansk Convention.
As a direct result of their accession to the EU, the above-mentioned Member States withdrew from the agreement.
Consequently, the agreement now applies solely between the EU and the Russian Federation.
The Commission therefore proposes the Communityâs withdrawal from the agreement. If this does not happen, relations between the EU and Russia would be regulated by an instrument created for multilateral cooperation, and this might have adverse consequences.
I support the rapporteur in that I welcome this proposal and, at the same time, I understand the concerns that the objectives of protecting...
Â Â  We believe that the European Convention should be granted discharge for 2003, because there are no reasons for bringing the economic report into question.
We nonetheless oppose the Conventionâs lack of representativeness and undemocratic working methods.
Among the Conventionâs just over one hundred members, women, young people and critics of the EU were seriously under-represented.
The Convention cannot therefore claim to represent the citizens of Europe.
What is more, the Conventionâs President, ValÃ©ryÂ GiscardÂ dâEstaing, and his Praesidium designed policy as they themselves saw fit.
Proposals were introduced that have no basis in the working groups or in plenary.
No votes took place in plenary, and Giscard himself decided how the majorities looked.
We share the analysis made by GiselaÂ Stuart, a British member of the Conventionâs Praesidium, in her book âThe Making of Europe's Constitutionâ (Fabian Society, 2003).
In her view, the work of the Convention was shaped by an unaccountable political elite that had already decided the final outcome from the outset.
Â Â  . Given that this expenditure was validated by the Court of Auditors, which felt that it had obtained reasonable assurance that the accounts for the financial year ended 31Â December 2003 were reliable and that the underlying transactions were, on the whole, legal and regular, I am voting in favour of this recommendation.
Â Â  . I share the rapporteurâs conclusion that, in light of the assent given by the Council on 8Â JulyÂ 2004 and by the Commission on 19Â OctoberÂ 2004 and the compliance acknowledged by the Court of Auditors on 13Â MayÂ 2004, there does not appear to be any justification for Parliament to withhold its assent to the granting of discharge for the financial year 2003 to the Secretary-General of the Convention.
I naturally welcome the transparency and, to use the word of the Court of Auditors, the reliability, of the accounts for the financial year.
I also agree that the residue should be apportioned between the three Institutions that contributed to the Conventionâs budget.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  The members of the June List have chosen to vote against the report because the Committee on Budgetsâ proposed changes open the way to further EU commitments, without any requirement for coordination with other international financial institutions.
The June List is opposed to the Commissionâs proposal and believes that the EIB should not issue the proposed loan guarantee.
The June List recommends instead that those countries that are affected by loan guarantees and that benefit from these should themselves stand as guarantors of those loans or find other players in the free market to do so.
According to the June List, the proposal is not in the Communityâs interest but is in danger of becoming an expensive failure if loan guarantees are given without being tested by the market in the usual way.
The June List would ideally have liked to have seen the Commissionâs proposal too rejected in the vote but, ironically, finds the Commissionâs original proposal less objectionable than the one presented by the Committee on Budgets.
Â Â  . On the proposal for a Council decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for certain types of projects in Russia and the Western New Independent States (WNIS).
The EUâs external policy is, in this case, expressed through a âNeighbourhood Policyâ, which will enable those countries to continue on the path to economic, social and political development.
It strikes me as important to point out that the EUâs external lending capacity is an important foreign policy development instrument and, in turn, a powerful tool in the overall capacity of the EU to contribute to development and security in our immediate neighbourhood.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision before us, which falls within the scope of the Commissionâs communication of MarchÂ 2003 entitled âWider Europe â Neighbourhood: a new framework for relations with our eastern and southern neighboursâ, which laid down a strategy for creating a âcircle of friendsâ â an area of shared values, stability and prosperity, and one in which it is possible to achieve deeper economic integration.
I welcome the approach that the decision is to cover the activity of the EIBâs loans until the end of January 2007, earmarked for areas such as the environment, transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure.
A further reason to welcome this proposal is that it is duly consistent with the EU-Russia Summit held in the Hague on 25Â NovemberÂ 2004, aimed at promoting strategic partnerships and deepening what are referred to as the âFour Common Spacesâ, namely, a common economic space; a common space of freedom, security and justice; a common space in the field of external security; and a common space of research, education and culture.
Â Â  . The issue before us is the third readmission agreement between the European Community and a third country, which forms part of the so-called âfight against illegal immigrationâ.
The rapporteur points out, and I quote, that ânegotiations of readmission agreements are moving forward with difficulty, in particular because of the problems the European Union has in offering anything in exchange for the agreementsâ.
This essentially boils down to expelling all workers, who, eager for a new life, emigrate to another country, but who find themselves faced with human resources âmanagementâ, which sifts them and removes those it deems surplus to requirements, and this is something that we have repeatedly condemned.
This process forms part of a tendency towards âgloballyâ exploiting the workforce, and these agreements are no more than one of the visible faces of that tendency.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  The readmission agreement with Sri Lanka is part and parcel of the introduction of a common immigration policy.
The June List does not, however, wish to contribute to any Fortress Europe.
Measures concerning illegal immigration and residence, including the repatriation of illegal immigrants, should be an issue for the Member Statesâ national parliaments.
Consequently, we are voting against the report.
Â Â  . Agreements of this kind, which have been signed with various countries, are of major importance in the fight against illegal immigration.
They are also concerned with safeguarding respect for human rights, given that we must remain vigilant to ensure that the law is being strictly complied with.
I am therefore in favour of their adoption.
Â Â  .
On the subject of the management of migratory flows, based on the Amsterdam Treaty, the Tampere Summit called for âassistance to countries of origin and transit to be developed in order to promote voluntary return as well as to help the authorities of those countries to strengthen their ability to combat effectively trafficking in human beings and to cope with their readmission obligations towards the Union and the Member Statesâ (IV.26.).
The purpose of the proposal for a decision before us is to regulate the conditions under which the EU and the Sri Lankan authorities will readmit people who do not have legal residence in each otherâs territory, a practice that the Community would like to see included in all future agreements with third countries; and rightly so in my view.
Notwithstanding the need for strict controls on access to the Community area, which must be kept up, I share the Foreign Affairs Committeeâs desire to ensure that the need to respect human rights is never overlooked.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The Commission did not manage to obtain a unanimous decision in the Council on its proposal for a directive on simplifying and streamlining reduced VAT rates.
Consequently, the period of application of Directive 1999/85/EU, authorising Member States to apply, on an experimental basis, a reduced VAT rate on labour-intensive services, has been repeatedly extended, and now comes to an end on 31Â December 2005.
The purpose of this recasting of the Directive is to make it possible for the new Member States, following enlargement, to apply it, and this is something that we welcome.
Whilst the Commissionâs assessment report says that the effects of this measure are negligible and that the cost/benefit ratio is unfavourable, the Commissionâs main objective revolves around the difficulty of harmonising VAT, although it does state that this measure does not prejudice the rules of the internal market.
Although we have certain reservations about this measure, and taking account of the fact that the measure will not solve the problems of high unemployment in the EU, we feel that this authorisation should be maintained for Member States that wish to apply it permanently.
This will contribute further towards creating jobs and towards combating the parallel economy.
We hope that the new Member States will make their contribution towards achieving this aim.
Â Â  . The adoption by the Council, on 22Â OctoberÂ 1999, of Directive 1999/85/EC amending Directive 77/88/EEC, was intended to foster the experimental scheme of reduced VAT rates for labour intensive services, thereby enabling those Member States wishing to do so to test the effects of reduced VAT on those sectors in terms of creating jobs and combating the parallel economy.
The experiment was eventually the subject of an assessment report that revealed that it is not possible to establish a direct correlation between reducing VAT rates and combating unemployment and the parallel economy.
Reducing VAT rates does not strike me as the best or most appropriate way of boosting the labour market and reducing the parallel economy.
Given that nothing, however, was laid down â the experiment was due to finish definitively on 31Â DecemberÂ 2003 â regarding the possibility of the new Member States applying reduced rates, the situation had become unfair.
As I feel that the new Member States should be entitled to the same opportunity, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I am delighted to indicate my support for this Report and for the extension of the PEACE Programme.
This programme has made an original and essential contribution to reconciliation, rebuilding trust between neighbours and bringing communities together from both sides of the border.
The PEACE projects have contributed greatly to promoting mutual understanding and better community relations and I am delighted that funding has now been extended to the end of 2006.
There is not doubt that our hopes for a peaceful future depend on the good work of the various cross-border and North-South initiatives funded under this programme.
Â Â  We have voted against this report.
We believe that those Member States that wish to contribute to the International Fund for Ireland must do so by deciding in their respective national parliaments to give such contributions.
The Member States must fund these contributions directly out of their respective state budgets, and the money should not need to take a detour via the EU budget.
Â Â  . On the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2005-2006).
This fund still has major importance in rebuilding areas devastated by the instability caused by decades of terrorism.
Its objectives continue to be pressing objectives and at this historic time of negotiations on lasting peace, the EU must show solidarity with the Irish people.
Â Â  . The International Fund for Ireland, which was set up in 1986, with the aim of helping to implement the Anglo-Irish Agreement, of promoting economic and social advances and of encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland, has done extremely useful and positive work in promoting economic and social development towards peace and reconciliation in the region.
The process of consolidating peace in Northern Ireland and in the Irish border region is now, once again, encircled by threats and uncertainty.
Indeed, the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended.
Against this backdrop, the promotion of peace through economic and social development in the regions of both parts of Ireland takes on extra significance.
It is a process that, at grassroots level, has been carried out in exemplary fashion by the International Fund for Ireland.
I therefore feel that the Commission should adopt the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland.
I am, consequently, voting in favour.
Â Â  . A key element in the running of a representative democratic institution is compliance with the principles governing â appropriately â the rules of parliamentary immunity.
Consequently, the decision to waive the parliamentary immunity of a Member of this House must be greeted with due caution.
The case before us concerns the judicial process relating to behaviour that bears no relation to political activity.
Accordingly, and given the content of the report, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . This is a sensible arrangement for the bilateral management of the Baltic Sea fishery resources, integrating the existing bilateral agreements between the Russian Federation and Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden within a single bilateral agreement.
Of course it is important place a high priority on maintaining stocks of fish. It should also be kept in mind that the greatest threat to living resources in the Baltic Sea comes from land and not from the sea, and the best way to limit the pollution of the sea is to integrate environmental protection requirements into the fisheries policy.
This aspect should be one of the top priorities while negotiating a bilateral agreement with the Community and the Russian Federation.
Â Â  . The issue before us is the creation of an instrument to facilitate the âmobilityâ of workers in Europe and, in the rapporteurâs words, âto help achieve the Lisbon 2000 strategic objectivesâ.
As we have said before, the key question here is the purpose of such an instrument; will it serve to regenerate a countryâs human resources or will it merely help the most economically developed countries to exploit other countriesâ human resources, by increasing workersâ âmobilityâ?
We fear, and with good reason, that it will serve to raise the number of technical or scientific staff emigrating to the most economically developed countries, and that, to this end, the aim is to create a European labour market, or even a European âstock exchangeâ of specialised staff.
Let me state, once again, that the proposed documents already exist as a result of cooperation with the Council and/or UNESCO.
Hence our vote in favour, albeit with criticisms of the attempts to contaminate apparently positive aims.
Â Â  We do not believe it necessary for the EU to create a standard document portfolio that EU citizens will be able to use in job applications.
The EU institutions can, of course, have a standard document portfolio for those seeking employment with these institutions.
Such a document portfolio should not, however, be turned into a compulsory standard requirement.
Instead, this is an area in which the Member States themselves must be able to take decisions.
Â Â  . I congratulate Mrs Novak on her excellent work on the establishment of a single Community framework for the transparency of qualifications and competences â Europass.
The aim of this proposal is to create a uniform âportfolioâ of documents that will enable citizens applying for a job or a course of study to set out their personal qualifications in a manner that is comparable throughout the EU.
Europass will facilitate professional mobility and encourage learning in Europe, and this will help achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy.
I endorse the creation of Europass because mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in reducing the skills shortfall in the European labour market.
I am convinced that it will provide the necessary impetus to break down the barriers that European citizens come up against in this field.
I should also like to underline the need to avoid prolonging the legislative process, and therefore voted in favour of Europass, which will enable it to enter into force as early as January 2005.
Â Â  . In line with the aim of greater coordination, streamlining and transparency of qualifications and skills, we must promote the integration of measures in the area of the certification of qualifications into a single framework.
This is not an issue of recognising diplomas, but of simplifying the processes for setting out qualifications and skills.
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation.
Â Â  . The legislative proposal before us aims to create a single âportfolioâ of documents, which will enable citizens to set out their abilities, skills and qualifications and will facilitate the recognition in the labour market of training courses and work experience undertaken abroad.
It will therefore foster professional and educational mobility in Europe.
In addition to making qualifications and skills comparable, the proposal before us also helps to achieve the Lisbon 2000 objectives, to turn Europe into the âmost dynamic and competitive area in the worldâ by 2010.
Accordingly, Europass â which comprises documents referring to training courses in different countries, to higher education, to knowledge of languages and to professional training â will make a major contribution not only to these objectives, but also to an increase in the quality of general and professional education in Europe.
This is a welcome and highly important measure for young people.
As such, it must enter into force at the earliest opportunity.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . â The Europass is yet another lever to replace systematic and integrated education with fragmented skills and outdated training adapted to current market demands, in the aim of exploiting workers and in full harmonisation with the Lisbon strategy.
It makes employers alone responsible for the evaluation of educational and vocational qualifications, so that they can select the most 'convenient' worker for their exploitative requirements, depriving the education system of this role.
The Europass is open to renewal and the inclusion of more new demands by employers; it will also tend to be converted into a tool for keeping records on workers, with descriptions not only of their skills and knowledge, but also of their views, persuasions and conduct.
Talk of facilitating educational and professional mobility is a smoke screen.
The policy of 'lifelong learning' and of interchangeable individual training modules obstructs rather than facilitates mobility and marks 'the absolute availability of man to the alternating demands of labour'.
We call for the Europass to be abolished and for the adoption of: 1) a single, free, state education system which will create an integrated educational foundation and fundamental vocational training which will result in full professional sufficiency and 2) a high standard of living and equal employment, education and living conditions for workers on the move.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite the temptation every year to try to fund Parliamentâs interests and blame the Council for everything else, I believe we are presenting a good agreement today.
The annual budgetary procedure is a perfect example of how interinstitutional cooperation should be.
I have been a member of the Committee on Budgets for ten years and I have never believed that interinstitutional confrontation is the right way to resolve budgetary priorities.
I believe that time has proven those of us who prefer agreement to be right.
The best conclusion for this 2005 draft budget would be for the three institutions to be moderately satisfied with the final result.
It would be ridiculous to present this agreement as a victory for one institution over another, because I believe that Europe is made up of the three institutions.
It has been a very complicated year from a budgetary point of view.
We began with a reduction in the ceilings for categories 3, 4 and 5, which has made it very difficult to comply with this Parliamentâs priorities.
The Member States have applied budgetary rigour, as a consequence of the Stability Pact, and that must continue in the future.
We have had European elections: new MEPs, a new Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has worked very well and I congratulate him on that; a new Commission and a new Commissioner, who has also worked very well and I congratulate her on that as well, and I also congratulate former Commissioner Schreyer.
Ladies and gentlemen, since September of this year, I have been advocating the following budgetary strategy: to defend the European Parliamentâs priorities with regard to the Lisbon objectives, information policy and the areas of security and justice.
We defend these priorities because we are a political Parliament and we have promised our citizens a Europe with economic growth, job creation, better information on the present and the future of the Union, better control of migratory flows and greater security against crime and terrorism.
Our contribution to the creation of a genuine Community response to terrorism is this Parliamentâs best possible tribute to the almost 200 Europeans murdered in Madrid on 11 March.
I would like to thank all of you for your support.
It was fundamental to our strategy that the European agencies should not be funded unilaterally, at the expense of Parliamentâs other priorities.
If we want more agencies, we must provide new resources.
That was our position and I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this Parliament has achieved almost 100% of the strategy we established.
We have managed to mobilise the flexibility instrument in the sum of EUR 185 million and this is a new resource, which is greater than the ceiling of the financial perspectives.
And with these new resources we have funded EUR 40 million of the decentralised agencies, which means that, for the first time, the Council recognises the need to provide new resources to comply with the new commitments.
We have also used EUR 100 million from the flexibility instrument to fund the reconstruction of Iraq, thereby leaving sufficient budgetary margin to fund Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean policy, the fight against disease and poverty and the democracy and human rights initiative, amongst other things.
We are still concerned about the issue of payments, despite the fact that we have a statement by the three institutions on the commitment to present an amending budget in 2005 if necessary.
The rigour and austerity we all apply â the three institutions â is one thing, but the indiscriminate saving of payment appropriations, which could jeopardise budgetary execution in 2005, is quite another.
This Parliament will be particularly vigilant next year.
Budgetary savings should never be at the expense of the Unionâs needs.
The Council has cut payments in agriculture by EUR 1 billion, which, from a budgetary point of view, is unusual, and we await further explanations from the Council.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we thank the Dutch Presidency for its pragmatism in the negotiation, which we expected, and its great willingness to reach consensus with Parliament, which has been a surprise.
In any event, thank you, Minister, for the role you have played; thank you, Commissioner, for your mediation.
I hope to cooperate closely with you during 2005.
Thank you to the coordinators, the MEPs, the members of the Budgets secretariat and my own personal assistant.
It has been a pleasure to work with all of you on the drawing up of this 2005 draft budget, which I hope can be voted for on Thursday without too many problems.
Â Â  MrÂ President, administrative expenditure has not of course been the most difficult aspect of this yearâs budget negotiations, especially since employeesâ salary increases were clearly to remain below 1% this year instead of 2.6%, as originally foreseen.
With the figures from Parliamentâs first reading, there is thus a suitable margin below the ceiling for administrative expenditure.
To this, we can add that certain institutions have been able to expedite their payments this year and have thus brought about the possibility of savings on the 2005 budget.
All in all, it has therefore been successfully ensured that the other institutions â that is to say, apart from Parliament and the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor â are able to make the planned staff appointments resulting from enlargement, staffing reforms and the reform of financial administration.
In practice, the savings due to the lower salary increases will now be implemented with the help of an amending budget in the course of 2005.
It was that agreement into which we entered with the Council.
We are not therefore voting on these savings at Parliamentâs second reading but, by making savings by means of a second amending budget, we are also making savings on the Councilâs and Parliamentâs budgets, which have of course been drawn up in the light of the conciliation entered into with the Council at first reading.
So far, so good.
It is important for all the institutions continually to ensure that the administration is as efficient and inexpensive as possible.
It is especially important, moreover, that we obtain financial gains through cooperation between the institutions.
That is also why I think it important that, early next year â and before 1 April â we obtain an updated report from the secretaries-general on how the appointments are going.
We have seen the delays there have been in recruiting staff following enlargement, and I think it important that we closely follow up how these matters are proceeding so that we might see if there are likely to be problems.
In other areas, too, there is a real need for the institutions to cooperate in their deliberations.
I should like at this point to restrict the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliamentâs leadership.
One practical example is the Committee of the Regionsâ desire to be able to use Parliamentâs meeting rooms in Brussels for its meetings.
It makes good sense for us to make facilities available as long as, by doing so, we are not interfering with Parliamentâs working arrangements.
That is a decision that Parliamentâs leadership must make.
It must be a decision that fits in with our work, but also one that is remunerative.
Parliamentâs budget stands at 20% of administrative expenditure and appears reasonable in relation to needs.
I would, however, emphasise â as I have done in the past â that in recent years we have been able to deploy major expenditure on paying for buildings under this 20% budget, and we shall thus save on rent in the budgets for the next few years.
This will also happen in the current year when more than EURÂ 130Â million will be paid out on the two new buildings â D4 and D5 â in Brussels.
When all is said and done, there will be some room for manoeuvre in Parliamentâs budget for 2005, and I would therefore call upon Parliamentâs leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs, for example regarding translation and legal assistance.
We often have to make compromises, including ones that are perhaps not always satisfactory, for example on the linguistic front.
With enlargement and increasing legislative activity, we need access to advice, as well as to studies, consultations and analyses.
It is now Parliament that is peopleâs window onto joint legislation, and we must therefore demand conditions that ensure we can do legislative work of the proper quality.
The 2005 budget appropriates EURÂ 17.5 million to an increase in MEPsâ remuneration for the purpose of appointing staff.
MEPs are experiencing an increasing burden of work as a result not only of the increasing legislative work but also of enlargement.
The legislation on which we work is very often technically complicated environmental and commercial legislation, and we therefore require support in our work.
That is why it is also only fair that MEPs be given higher remuneration so that we can appoint staff and, equally to the point, do so under reasonable working conditions.
The amount concerned has been placed in reserve while we awaited a decision.
The decision has now been made; clear rules in a number of areas have been adopted; and the Committee on Budgets will thus be able next year to adopt a position on removing the reserve in the light of a request by Parliamentâs President.
Finally, I should like to say thank you for your constructive cooperation on this budget procedure.
