This is necessary as a result of the values we share â democracy, respect for human rights and individual freedom and the promotion of peace and collective security.
Furthermore, we hope that the next United States-European Union summit, to be held in June in Vienna, will provide a clear impetus for intensifying our relations in the economic field as well.
The creation of an Atlantic area of prosperity is essential in order to ensure that our citizens continue to enjoy the economic well-being that Europe and the United States provide them with.
Â Â  â Mr President, the partnership between the USA and Europe is a difficult but necessary one.
As President Barroso once said, it is necessary when speaking with the USA to be at the same eye level.
Now, it makes little sense to demand of the USA that it should go down on its knees, just so that we can speak at the same eye level.
We have to become stronger, we have to exploit our potential fully â economically, but clearly also in terms of foreign policy.
On foreign policy I would like to mention two areas where I believe there have been a few very positive developments.
The first is the Middle East question regarding financial support.
I know, Commissioner, that you were very active behind the scenes so that we could come to a reasonable and pragmatic solution.
I am very happy that Europe and the USA found a solution here.
The second topic is Iran.
I not only wish you a lot of luck, MrsÂ Plassnik, I also hope that you can do much work of persuasion here too.
We must remain firm in this matter.
However, the USA has to talk directly with Iran as well, as has just been announced.
Above all, though, there is no place for military adventures.
These are two areas in which I hope that we can speak with the USA as genuinely independent, self-confident partners.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is certain that had dear MrÂ Brok heard the last lecture of Chomsky, the greatest living philosopher, he would have written a different report.
Chomsky said that the United States of America is dying from a lack of democracy and there is indeed a lack of democracy and intercourse.
Allow me to prove it to you.
Any American citizen can come to anywhere in Europe without a visa.
Can any European citizen go to America without a visa?
Let me reply by reminding you that, when MEPs went to America to check CIA flights, American congressmen did not receive them.
America has not signed the Kyoto Protocol and is poisoning the atmosphere.
It does not come under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in The Hague; it merely sends judges.
I ultimately refuse to accept Europe as the train whose steam engine is American and which has an American engine driver.
That is our big mistake.
We want a relationship on equal terms.
They do not allow us to have a European army.
We have ÎÎÎ€Î with an American commander-in-chief.
Even our stock exchanges follow the Dow Jones index.
We do not have our own policy.
We have American hegemony.
We want a relationship on equal terms, not the suzerainty of the Americans, which is harming Europe's progress towards more democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, nobody has mentioned Galileo â the European Unionâs direct competitor to the Americansâ GPS system â in which the Chinese have a 20% stake; a decision which has the potential to destabilise future arms production and threaten the maintenance of peace.
Galileo is a hugely ambitious and expensive attempt by the EU to rival the US as a fully-fledged global and space power, why else duplicate GPS?
The EU has no legal right to set up its own space programme â that depended on ratification of the failed Constitution.
However, such niceties are being ignored.
The EU wants its own satellites to be a part of future military operations, and is not prepared to wait.
Since all future battlefield weapons will be navigated by satellite, it is obvious that Europe will be helping China to rearm.
With its commitments in Japan, Taiwan and south-east Asia, can the United States be anything other than wary of anyone complicit in rearming China?
Â Â  Mr President, it is obvious that the United States and the European Union must strengthen their dialogue and their cooperation in the economic, commercial, regulatory or even the social domain by means of the promotion of decent work as trade unions on both sides of the Atlantic wish.
The question, therefore, is not: âShould transatlantic relations be improved?â, but âHow can they be improved?â.
From this point of view, I do not think that the answer would necessarily be the creation of a barrier-free transatlantic marketplace by 2015.
Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable?
No.
Do we want to open up our market to Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) or to beef from cattle raised on hormones?
No.
Therefore, I want the transatlantic agenda to be based on practical research of general European interest, and not on unconditional commitment to the doctrine of free trade as a goal in itself.
I doubt also whether this is necessarily the right time to propose a bilateral initiative on such a scale when our American partner is threatening global macroeconomic stability by allowing its trade and budget deficits to slide while it is publicly calling into question the merits and principles of multilateralism, or opposing initiatives like the Kyoto Protocol or the International Criminal Tribunal.
I should like MrsÂ Mannâs excellent report to be amended in light of this.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel strengthened in my intention to address a range of issues at the approaching summit, issues that concern our common future including cooperation in order to promote democracy, human rights, freedom and prosperity, but also issues relating to the global challenges we face: climate change, the fight against terrorism, the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and also the issue of energy security, which is increasingly occupying us on both sides of the Atlantic and which has been the subject of intensive work in the Council in this half-year period; I have already referred to the air traffic agreement in my introduction.
Regarding international questions it has been pointed out that in recent months progress has been achieved on a range of issues.
Here we need to advance slowly and step by step.
I would like to thank the Commission, too, for its close cooperation.
I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs and all those who have also worked on this report and those who regularly take part in the debate on our transatlantic relations.
These relations are central for the European Union and for us all, and so we must avoid adopting one-sided positions.
What is needed, rather, is to discuss existing irritations and all unresolved questions as partners in a dialogue.
These points must not, however, overshadow that which binds us together or that which is profound and resistant to strain: the shared community of values and the work on the world issues that are important to us.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for this excellent debate on a central and essential relationship that will indeed focus on how much further our cooperation can grow on foreign policy and democracy promotion, on increased cooperation in relation to energy, and on the enhancement of growth and competitiveness in our economies.
Let me respond to a few question rather briefly.
Indeed, we plan to sign a new agreement on higher education and vocational training, including launching an innovative transatlantic degree programme.
As for tourism â which was also mentioned â exchanges would be facilitated by extending the visa waiver programme to all our Member States.
As to the environment, we want to relaunch our dialogue with the US, notably by relaunching the high-level dialogue on the environment, including the issue of climate change.
Our cooperation on energy will also touch on climate change issues from the standpoint of energy efficiency.
However, our overall dialogue needs to be broader than this.
For those who might not have been here at the beginning, I would like to come back to the questions of visa waiver and visa reciprocity.
These are issues that we not only mention on a regular basis, but they are there in the dialogue, and will certainly be taken up again with President Bush.
On passenger name records and the recent European Court of Justice judgment relating to the cases brought by the European Parliament, we respect the Courtâs judgment and analysis and we will fully comply with it.
We will cooperate with Parliament, the Council and with the national data protection authorities to ensure that the judgment is fully complied with.
We have only four months to find a new legal basis, but I hope we will be able to cooperate in such a way that there will be no lowering of protection standards, no disruption to transatlantic air traffic, and that a high level of security will be maintained.
Finally, we are looking forward to the successful setting-up of the Galileo satellite navigation system, where cooperation with third countries is necessary and useful, and where we hope that cooperation with the US will bring an additional benefit to our companies and citizens.
We are very thankful to the two rapporteurs and for the engagement and commitment of Parliament.
It will certainly give us more strength.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to add my thanks to the rapporteurs for two excellent reports and simply to make two points.
The first is that for all the attention that is occasionally given to disagreements in trade matters between the United States and the European Union, it is worth bearing in mind that 98% of our trade is dispute-free.
Where there are disputes, both sides move rapidly, not always with immediate success, but rapidly to resolve these amicably and quickly.
That is something we should note and celebrate without being complacent.
The second point I want to make is that Erika Mannâs report does not actually call for a single free trade area, so those who are opposing it are aiming at the wrong target.
What the report calls for is a barrier-free area, a barrier-free transatlantic market between Europe and the United States. That is something that we can applaud and encourage.
As I said earlier on, I do not think it will attract the support of some sort of âbig-bangâ elaborate scheme.
However, the fact is that this trade and investment relationship between us is worth a amount in terms of peopleâs jobs, their livelihoods, their futures.
It is not so much tariffs, anymore, that stand in the way of growth in this relationship; it is non-tariff barriers, regulatory barriers, differences in standards and licensing and all the rest.
There is a sort of bonfire of barriers to set alight.
These are very noble and correct economic objectives for us to set our hands and our shoulders to.
This is why I so heartily commend this report and will dedicate myself and my services to realising its spirit.
Â Â  That concludes the joint debate.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a. m.
Â Â  With respect to the next EU-US summit, I would like both to congratulate the rapporteurs, and to underline the need to improve relations between the two communities.
Joint action is needed today in areas of common interest and shared values and threats, in order to lend a new, effective and representative dimension to our common policy and economic relations and to combine forces to face the threat of terrorism.
Global problems require global and prompt action.
The priorities of the UN summit in 2005 and the drafting of a plan of action against terrorism should become our goal and our motivation for cooperation, and should speed up reforms in the structures both of NATO and of the UN, with particular emphasis on the reform of the UN Security Council.
The decline of the âenemy of the Western worldâ in Eastern Europe, and disagreement between the Member States on intervention in Iraq, gives rise to a question posed frequently both in the USA and in Europe, namely whether NATO has any useful purpose any more.
The threat of terrorism could provide a basis for the existence of the alliance, but this challenge requires the creation of new political and military structures and cooperation with regard to the EUâs foreign and security policy.
Steps must be taken to draw up a common strategy on securing supplies of energy and raw materials by diversifying our supply sources, production and transportation, and to intensify political dialogue on renewable sources of energy.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, we read about this being Green Week, and the focus of this yearâs Green Week is biodiversity loss.
Last year it was climate change, and both climate change and biodiversity loss are the two greatest environmental challenges facing us.
I rise to protest at the lack of time given to debate the issue of biodiversity loss during this part-session, as this is Green Week.
As parliamentarians we should have acknowledged Green Week and the biodiversity loss focus by having a debate on that issue.
We have the Birds Directive, the Habitats Directive, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the structural funds, 18Â 000 Natura 2000 sites, plus a network, and yet we have no joined-up thinking in relation to this issue.
We have invasive alien species here, over 40% of the EUâs species â both flora and fauna â are under threat, and yet we have no debate on this issue during a designated Green Week.
I protest, and I would like you, Mr Vice-President, to pass on my protestations to the President of Parliament.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am glad indeed that MrsÂ Plassnik and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner are still here.
Last weekend there were violent excesses against peaceful demonstrators in Moscow.
I think it is most necessary that we as the European Union say that this should not be allowed to happen in a country that currently holds the chair in the Council of Europeâs Committee of Ministers.
This issue concerns a strong partner of the European Union.
We will be demonstrating on Friday afternoon in Brussels and in many other places in Europe against the violations of human rights committed against peaceful demonstrators.
On the weekend after next in Warsaw, Gay Pride will take place, and I have heard statements from officials in Warsaw that there could be excesses here too and that anyone who participates must be prepared for the possibility of violence.
I will march and fly the flag for the rights â guaranteed by ArticleÂ 13 â of everyone in the European Union.
I hope that many people will take part and say: there is no place for intolerance in the European Union.
Let us fly the flag!
Â Â  â From this Chamber, I should like to salute the Portuguese fishermen. On their national day, they are holding a massive day of protest, in which they are paralysing the fishing fleet in order to call for the adoption of measures needed to safeguard the present and the future of a sector that is vital not only for Portugal but also for the various EU Member States.
The crisis that the fisheries sector has long endured, which is due to aspects such as the commercialisation of fisheries, namely how first sale prices are established, has been exacerbated by the dramatic rise in the price of fuel.
This has led to the economic suffocation of the sector and has had deep-rooted social impact, in terms of reduced salaries and increased unemployment.
Emergency measures must therefore be taken at Community level in order to ensure revenue for the sector and its workers, which is what the sectorâs representatives have long been seeking.
This is especially true given that there is a common fisheries policy.
Â Â  â Mr President, in Poland strikes by health workers and the tragic state of the health service are a threat not only to the health, but also to the life of my countrymen.
As I have only a minute at my disposal, I would like to give just two examples of a liberal and destructive way of thinking which operates in terms of money and profit.
Since 1989 more than 20 000 doctors have left Poland, and 1Â 500 specialist doctors left the country in the five months after accession to the EU.
Every year we train 2Â 000 doctors, which means that for over 12 years we have been training doctors for other countries.
On top of that, the insatiable and greedy foreign pharmaceutical corporations are consuming more than half of my countryâs health budget.
For this reason I appeal to the European Parliament to think about the treatment of healthcare services, about restricting the economic wilfulness of the pharmaceutical monopolies and about changing the way in which the medical profession and health care are seen so that their aim is the health and good of human beings, and not just financial gain and profit, particularly as strikes in health services are also taking place in many other EU Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw the Houseâs attention to last weekâs extension of the house arrest of the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
This leader of the democratic opposition, who is also a Nobel Peace Prize holder, has been cut off from the outside world for 10 of the last 17 years.
She was due to be released last week, but the military junta ruling Burma has announced that she still represents a threat to national security, and has extended her arrest.
Today I would like to raise once again the matter of respect for human rights as a basic and fundamental principle of the European Communities.
I propose that the President of the European Parliament send a special delegation to visit the leader of the Burmese opposition who has spent so many years in isolation, and express our support for her.
Â Â  Mr President, since the 1993 Copenhagen Declaration, the enforcement of minority rights has become one of the accession criteria.
There is a great discrepancy between minority protection systems in the ten new and the fifteen old Member States.
While all ten new Member States ratified the two legally binding minority protection documents of the Council of Europe, the Language Charter and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, three of the old Member States, namely France, Belgium and Greece, have not done so as yet.
Old Member States ought to catch up with the new Member States in respect of minority protection.
It is typical that regional and minority languages have been completely left out of the Mavrommatis report concerning multilingualism, recently adopted by the European Parliament.
It is typical that the minority pages have been completely left out of the D Plan launched by the European Commission to regain the trust of European Union citizens, while every seventh European citizen speaks a minority language.
Â Â  Mr President, today the leader of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, MrÂ Schulz, insolently and arrogantly attacked members of the Polish Government and their right to take decisions that reflect the will of the majority of the Polish people.
MrÂ Schulzâs lack of respect for democracy does not surprise me, as his political champions have been Karl Marx and Rosa Luxembourg.
MrÂ Schulz, the most bloodthirsty form of totalitarianism emerged not in Poland, but in your country, where today neo-fascist organisations are growing in strength and taking to the streets.
I would therefore ask you to deal with these demonstrations, which pose a real threat to Europe, rather than condemning the Polish Prime Minister for merely upholding the will of the majority of Poles who support family values and who do not support hedonistic, pornographic parades by gay activists.
Poland has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe, and I do not believe that promoting homosexual relationships would help us. Unless, of course, you know of some way in which they can breed of which we are not aware.
German domination of Europe is fortunately a thing of the past, so please, MrÂ Schulz, remember this once and for all, and keep your German aspirations well clear of Polandâs internal affairs.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like us in the European Parliament to acknowledge the real effects of the Russia-EU summit in Sochi, rather than the media impact.
As far as one very specific matter is concerned, namely the implementation of the 1996 EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with regard to the ban on Polish meat imports, the Agreement is currently nothing more than a paper construct and window-dressing.
How is it that there is effectively no solidarity within the European Union on this matter?
Many countries of the old EU are not troubled by the fact that while they happily trade with Moscow, other countries such as Poland are excluded from this trade.
This matter will show in practice whether European solidarity is just a phrase on the lips of some politicians, or whether it exists in reality.
At the moment, unfortunately, and I say this with pain and regret, it is nothing more than a phrase.
I wish that the opposite were true.
Â Â  Last Sunday, I had an opportunity to be part of an ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament observing the presidential elections in Columbia.
Following changes in the Constitution some years ago, for the first time in Columbia's history, President Ãlvaro Uribe VÃ©lez was elected to a second four year term.
The elections were, firstly, marked by the fact that only 45 per cent of Columbian citizens, who have the right to vote, used the opportunity to participate in the polls.
However, as an election observer, I can assure the European Parliament that with the exception of a few errors and infringements, no fundamental violations were observed and the elections were democratic, free and fair.
Mr President, I propose that the European Parliament congratulate the newly elected President of Columbia and also initiate greater aid for Columbia, above all, for the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law, which could solve the security problems in this country.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your suggestion.
I think we shall do that.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to draw the Houseâs attention to a grave problem that is currently emerging in some EU Member States, and which constitutes a threat to fundamental rights, freedoms and civil liberties.
We in the European Parliament cannot idly stand by and watch as restrictions are imposed on democracy, on the right of European citizens to express their own opinions and on freedom of assembly.
This threat is all the more menacing when representatives of governments consent to violations of citizensâ rights, as is unfortunately the case at present in my own country, Poland.
We need to be alert to such situations and to react effectively in cases where a Member State violates basic principles that are a criterion for membership of the European Union.
Violating citizenâs rights is not an internal affair of Member States.
The response to such situations must not be silence, but immediate action.
This is what all citizens of a democratic organisation such as the European Union expect of the European Council.
Â Â  Mr President, Cyprus possesses a small fleet of military defence helicopters, amongst them two French Gazelle helicopters.
A year ago, the fuel indicator of one of these two helicopters was sent to a company called Vibro-Meter in the UK for repair.
This was speedily carried out, but since then, the British Government has prevented the re-export of the repaired part back to Cyprus, stating that the UK has a defence equipment embargo on Cyprus.
Cyprus, along with Britain, takes part in the common defence and security actions of the EU, including participation in EU peace missions, EU battle group formations and the European Defence Agency.
How is it possible or even logical for one Member State â Britain â to have an arms embargo on another Member State â Cyprus?
This surely must be in gross violation of the principles on which our Union was founded.
I request that you make representations to the British Government so that, in the interests of the unity of our European Union, this embargo is lifted immediately.
Â Â  Mr President, I quote from a recent article in the British Press: âBritainâs booming wine industry will be scuppered by EU regulations that want to prohibit growers in Britain, all of them unsubsidised, from planting any more vines if their sales continue to soarâ.
Growers â many of them in my region â have been calling on the Commission to increase the threshold or scrap it altogether.
Just what is it about English wine that becomes so intimidating?
Is it that when tasted blind with French wines and others, English wines come out on top for taste, thus our competitors are simply jealous?
Or is it because there are regions in other EU countries producing hugely subsidised grapes that will never produce decent wine?
Or is it just that when the EU sees something successful, it has to interfere, regulate and destroy it?
Can you wonder why more and more folk want nothing to do with the EU when it destroys their livelihoods?
Â Â  That concludes the item.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0179/2006) by MrÂ Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on trade and poverty: designing trade policies to maximise tradeâs contribution to poverty relief (2006/2031(INI)).
Â Â  â Madam President, first of all I would â of course â like to thank most warmly all those who have worked with me on producing my report. I would particularly like to mention MrsÂ Pribaz; of course I would also like to thank the colleagues on my committee, the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Development who have helped enrich this report with very constructive amendments.
The report contains initial suggestions as to how trade policies can and should be oriented in order to contribute to solving the problem of poverty.
I am pleased that this text establishes very clearly that trade must proceed according to certain rules if it is to become a meaningful and effective instrument for combating poverty and developing prosperity.
That is because trade, whether at a regional, national or international level, is not an end or value in itself, but rather a means of ensuring that people are provided with goods in order to satisfy their needs.
In todayâs world, provision for all people is not guaranteed, and the opportunities which trade brings are not divided fairly â neither geographically between States or regions, nor between individual actors in the market.
One of the results of this unequal distribution is poverty, poverty which reproduces itself. This is a problem which exists above all in developing countries, but not only there.
Evidently, the proverbial invisible hand of the market cannot even solve this problem within a developed economic area like the European Union.
The more that politics edges away from organising the economic order and leaves it to liberal market forces to do as they wish, the more the goals of social cohesion move further away â all the more so since at the same time social rights, democratic participation and environmental protection are ignored and regional and local conditions and particularities are not sufficiently taken into account.
On a global level, where existing differences in development and distribution are much more fundamental and serious, this situation appears several times more intensified.
If the present policy of urgent and speedy liberalisation under pressure continues, then the Millennium Goal of halving the number of starving people by 2015 cannot be achieved.
Politics has the task of creating basic conditions capable of producing social development that is peaceful, that avoids exclusion and that promotes prosperity.
A policy that opens borders for the international market can be a part of this.
Until now this has proven successful in countries where industrialisation could first of all take place under the protection of state measures, where an institutional framework was in place to regulate the distribution of social and economic wealth, where a sufficiently robust economic sector existed permitting flexible activity, and where the state was independent enough to support particular economic sectors against the opening up of the market.
A high level of foreign debt and dependence on credit considerably restrict this competitiveness.
In countries where these conditions did not exist, however, accelerated liberalisation has led to deindustrialisation, destruction of the environment and increasing dependency and has worsened the poverty of the inhabitants.
I can only refer to just a few aspects of the report here.
The chance to develop independently and to industrialise must be given to all countries, just as it was once given to todayâs industrialised countries.
This includes a countryâs right to decide for itself when, how much and if at all it wants to open up its markets to goods and services.
This is, by the way, already provided for in the rules of the WTO.
Since the signing of the WTO agreements, the profits made by producers on the prices of raw and primary materials have continually sunk so low that in the South as well as the North more and more small and medium-sized firms will have to close.
At the same time, the same rules mean that one-crop agriculture is promoted, which may bring enormous profits for agribusiness but which has disastrous consequences for the environment and for employment.
This is an agriculture which ultimately destroys its own basis for existence. Instead of this, politics must do its utmost to ensure, through regulation as well as through financial support, that biological diversity is preserved by lasting forms of exploitation.
Furthermore it is highly doubtful whether essential public services can be provided purely on the basis of market-economy structures to a sufficient extent that it could be said that the basic right to a dignified life is fulfilled.
Here it is a question of simple but necessary things like access to high-quality drinking water, health, care, education and training.
In areas where conditions do permit the liberalisation of market sectors, care should be taken that in doing so, international standards on the protection of social security, jobs and the environment are respected and held to be binding.
These and many other important points are included in the report in front of you.
I call upon the Commission and the Council to read the suggestions of this House and to take them into consideration when forming policies.
Â Â  . Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to continue the dialogue on trade issues with the European Parliament.
Mr Markovâs contribution provides a wealth of information and policy prescriptions on how to tackle the crucial relationship between trade and poverty, both in our bilateral agreements and in multilateral negotiations.
I share to a large extent the overall thrust of the report.
As I have said on several occasions, I want to put trade at the service of development. Trade is the driver of economic growth and, in the right circumstances, it spreads prosperity, but it is not a panacea and does not automatically lead to poverty reduction.
Trade liberalisation needs to be implemented gradually.
It should take place within a stable and supportive domestic policy framework and, in some cases, will require flanking measures to help bring about the process of adjustment.
We are already doing a lot of what the report recommends we should do. I shall give a number of concrete examples.
Firstly, in trade negotiations, including in the DDA and EPAs, and as recommended by the report, the EU respects the right of developing countries to liberalise progressively and to maintain flexibilities for their sensitive sectors.
Within the DDA, the EU is keen to see countries contributing according to their capacities and levels of development.
This lies behind the idea of special and differentiated treatment.
We are responding favourably to LDCsâ and developing countriesâ interests in services, including as regards Mode 4 and in the sectors they have requested.
Also, under GATT, we respect the freedom of countries to decide whether, and to what extent, they open up their service sector.
We have not made any service requests to LDCs.
We have set up a scheme to support ACP sugar producers in adjusting to changes following our sugar reform, and we are conscious of the need to address preference erosion.
We actively promote regional integration and South-South trade, which the report rightly recognises as key to development, especially for marginalised countries.
Beyond trade negotiations, in the area of building capacity, the EU â which is to say the Commission and Member States combined â provides more than 50% of the overall trade-related assistance funded worldwide.
Commission-managed, trade-related assistance was around EURÂ 850Â million a year in the period 2001-2004 and, on the basis of the pledge that President Barroso made at the last G8 Summit, this will rise to EURÂ 1Â billion in 2007.
We are actively engaged in the aid-for-trade debate taking place in the WTO.
The Commission is also a pioneer in carrying out trade sustainability impact assessments â SIAs â to assess the potential impact of trade liberalisation on all three pillars of sustainable development.
Since 1999, we have carried out these assessments on all the EUâs major trade negotiations, identifying areas where flanking measures may be needed.
With respect to the recommendations of the report on labour standards and social rights, although labour is regrettably not part of the DDA, all our recent trade, bilateral and regional agreements recognise and promote social rights, including gender equality, child labour, forced labour and freedom of association.
Moreover, through GSP+, we provide special incentives for developing countries that respect core labour rights.
DG Trade is also funding an ILO pilot project on decent work indicators to predict and monitor the impact of trade on decent work.
I was also pleased to see in the report a number of recommendations addressed to other players.
The report calls on other developed countries and advanced developing countries to implement duty-free, quota-free schemes for LDCs, matching our own âEverything but Armsâ.
After agreeing on 97% coverage in Hong Kong, I would suggest, nonetheless, that the United States needs to engage fully on the implementation of that commitment.
The report also calls on other WTO members to match the EUâs move in Hong Kong on export subsidies and to eliminate all forms of export support, including export credits and food aid.
The report recommends substantial reductions of domestic subsidies by developed countries and a solution for cotton â again, key areas where we expect the United States to deliver.
Since this is an open dialogue between us, I should like to raise a couple of points where the Commissionâs views differ from the report.
Aid for trade is an essential complement, but in no way a substitute, for a development-friendly outcome in the main negotiating areas of the DDA.
The biggest gains for developing countries lie in the market access component of the round and, in particular, in the South-South dimension.
With reference to the risk of fraudulent distortion of âEverything but Armsâ, we should, of course, remain vigilant on triangular trade but, to our knowledge, only one case of abuse has been reported.
As to the recommendation to exclude public services from negotiations, we do not consider it necessary to renegotiate the GATT to exclude public services.
It is entirely up to WTO members to decide which sectors they wish to open.
We have, for instance, made it clear that we do not wish to take additional commitments on health, education and audiovisual services.
Let me once again thank all those who have contributed to this report for their political support and guidance, and for the constructive criticism and concrete suggestions for action contained in it and others like it.
I remain committed to informing Parliament regularly and to listening to your views on major trade and development matters, as I have done to date and will continue to do in the future.
Â Â  â It is a well known fact that fair trade can be an effective means of reducing poverty.
However, in the last 10 years, the proportion of world trade represented by the poorest countries, trading mostly in low added value products â agricultural raw materials and extracted natural resources, has decreased.
In order to eradicate poverty, first of all, radical policy changes are needed in both industrialised and developing countries so that the structural causes of poverty are removed.
To achieve this, it is not enough to put fair trade rules, bilateral and multilateral trade relations into practice and improve WTO rules, but we must also develop trade relations between developing countries, the South-South dimension.
In the future, economic development will have a decisive influence on the reduction of poverty, especially investment in small and medium business, which provides the local market in developing countries with goods and services and creates higher added value, and offers opportunities for world trade.
Â Â  . Madam President, the history of trade in goods, both in primitive societies and in developed societies, shows that wherever such trade is based on fair rules it helps these societies survive and develop.
There is no doubt on this score.
In our group we believe that the free and fair trade for which the EU strives is also contributing at present to reducing poverty in many regions of the world.
There are instances of failure, of course, but they are primarily due to the failure to implement fair rules rather than to the trade .
In our view, the overtones of the report drafted by MrÂ Markov appeared on first sight to be that free trade exacerbates poverty rather than reducing it. Our group rejected this position.
However, after discussions and amendments to the report, it now sounds better, and, together with the proposed amendments that I believe will be adopted tomorrow, it will be acceptable to our group.
It is also obvious that while trade is not the only way of reducing poverty, it can make a major contribution.
In conclusion I would like to propose that we give free, and I repeat free, trade a chance, so that it can help to eliminate poverty.
In English, that is âlet us establish free and fair trade to make poverty historyâ.
Â Â  . â Madam President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating MrÂ Markov on his important report and CommissionerÂ Mandelson on the important speech he made a short while ago.
NoÂ one can doubt that the development of international trade and the liberalisation of international trade have made a decisive contribution to reducing poverty and mitigating the inequalities between developed and developing countries.
However, as MrÂ Mandelson quite rightly said, this is not a panacea.
As the statistics from international organisations show, we need organised liberalisation, the liberalisation of international trade on the basis of rules and regulatory mechanisms.
As the recent World Bank study showed, the anarchic liberalisation of international trade has resulted in an increase in poverty and the deconstruction of the productive fabric in the poorest countries of Africa.
The same is also happening inside the European Union: there are areas which have been hit by unemployment, deindustrialisation and poverty.
The European Union should, in my opinion, contribute to the democratisation and strengthening of the multilateral trade system through the reform of the World Trade Organisation for the benefit of the poorest countries.
It should also support with consistency the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 and contribute to the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations within the framework of a balanced and mutually beneficial compromise.
Finally, the European Union should continue to implement the important 'Everything but Arms' initiative.
Â Â  . Mr President, one of the most important achievements of the 20th century was the lifting of millions out of poverty.
The emergence of China and India on the global trading scene played a huge role in this feat and they continue to lead the developing world by example.
But the challenge is far from over.
Even today, 49% of the population in LDCs still live on less than a dollar a day.
By 2015, 471Â million of them will be living in extreme poverty.
Trade liberalisation is vital if we are to lift these people out of devastating poverty.
But trade is not a magic bullet.
The critical challenge is how to promote poverty reduction in a newly-liberalised open economy.
The majority of LDCs are still galloping in the dark in this regard.
Free trade is not the same as .
The fundamental priority must be for governments to implement macro-economic strategies that integrate trade in a way that effectively supports poverty reduction.
We must help them to do this through increasing assistance and improving its effectiveness.
This is not basic aid plunging the developing world into further debt: this is investment â investment in infrastructure, technology, human capital and the global trading system itself.
Finally, in return, we will enjoy greater openness and competitiveness and the LDCs will benefit from greater capital accumulation and technological progress. These will form the engine of growth.
International trade will be the fuel for that engine, and together we can accelerate towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals.
Â Â  . Mr President, I find myself very strongly in accord with those who have spoken in this short but important debate.
Its themes have been those of free trade and fair trade. Those are the twin pillars that support our policy objectives.
Whilst bilateral trade agreements have their place, it is multilateral trade negotiations in a multilateral framework for the international trading system that, in our view, are best able to bring equity and balance to the international trading system.
That is why the Doha Development Agenda is so important.
It has at its heart the ideal of free trade contributing to poverty reduction in the world.
As somebody once said, the victory of ideals has to be organised and, as one of the speakers tonight said, we want to see an organised liberalisation of trade.
We do not want to see a jungle in which the rules of that jungle operate to the detriment of developing countries and the poor in the world.
That is what the Commission is pursuing on behalf of Member States and I strongly believe that this report will guide us in these continuing efforts to achieve trade justice in the world, which is why I welcome it so strongly.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  â Trade is a fundamental instrument in the current international context.
Trade agreements among countries can ensure political stability and form a solid basis for more or less lasting diplomatic agreements.
Increasingly, therefore, they are the main players in a world based essentially on economic principles.
Trade thus provides an extremely important vehicle and opportunity for economic and social development, but it is also a weapon â largely in the hands of the developed countries â that needs to be used with care, since it can irreversibly determine the future of a country or a geographical area.
It is therefore absolutely crucial for Western countries to make a conscious effort to ensure that current trade practices and new agreements help to narrow the gap between North and South, rather than widening it through procedures that take no account of national differences.
While liberalisation is a global and now irreversible process that can bring well-being and wealth by creating new opportunities in developing countries, it must still be regulated according to the differing situations where it is to be carried out.
It must also be backed up with specific measures to ensure that economic development keeps pace with, and does not outstrip, appropriate and necessary development in other basic sectors, such as health, education and social policies.
Â Â  The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, of the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on medicinal products for paediatric use and amending Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 1768/92, Directive 2001/20/EC, Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) NoÂ 726/2004 [15763/3/2005 â C6-0087/2006 â 2004/0217(COD)]. Rapporteur: Erika Mann (A6-0171/2006).
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their contribution to this text and for their efforts to find a solution.
I am also grateful to the Council and to the Austrian Presidency, which have taken note of the views of Parliament and given priority to the regulation of medicinal products for paediatric use.
Finally, Commissioner, I should like to thank your staff for their technical input and recommendations.
I was extremely pleased to work with them.
Thanks to everyoneâs efforts, we shall be able to approve on second reading a regulation of vital importance for health in Europe.
We were unanimous as to the goal, and our discussions enabled us to reach agreement on the operational aspects of this regulation.
It seems inconceivable that, in 2006, our children do not have treatment tailored to their needs.
However, this is the situation we have.
Today, numerous medicinal products administered to children have not been developed specifically for them.
Frequently, products used for the youngest children are the same as those prescribed for adults, with only the dose reduced â and with consequences that are sometimes catastrophic.
A childâs metabolism is different from that of an adult.
Children therefore need specific pharmaceutical forms, not only for better tolerance but also for greater effectiveness and safety.
This European Regulation creates all the conditions for the development of paediatric medicines, notably by supporting innovation and research and by creating incentives for pharmaceutical laboratories, while at the same time requiring them to develop a paediatric form for every new drug and to make it available in all Member States.
On a large number of points, the Council had already followed Parliamentâs recommendations at first reading.
I am thinking particularly of the system of incentives which extends by six months the Protection Certificate for all new paediatric indications.
The Council had also accepted on first reading Parliament's request to avoid additional clinical trials being carried out on children where not absolutely necessary.
On the eve of the second reading, only a few differences of opinion remained.
A common position had to be found on technical details.
We therefore reached an agreement between the three institutions, largely through application of the 'better regulation' principle.
I am thinking in particular of the question of the independence of members of the Paediatric Committee and the issue of pharmacovigilance.
Earlier legislation already included robust measures on these points.
It is therefore more appropriate to refer to that legislation rather than create an accumulation of rules.
This agreement was also helped by the Commission's response to our demands concerning the use of potentially dangerous substances in the outer covering of the medicinal product.
We welcome the official declaration submitted to us and now, of course, await concrete results.
There is one further point to which I should like to draw the Commissionâs attention, namely the question of the period of time between the issue of a marketing authorisation and the availability of the medicinal product to patients.
A directive exists on transparency, which establishes the deadlines for setting the price and for the reimbursement for medicines.
The timing differences between Member States are too great.
This is a situation which has negative consequences for patients.
I have discussed this point with colleagues in all parliamentary groups and we should like to ask you what can be done to reduce these disparities.
Finally, the Commissionâs initial proposal states that all requests for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate resulting from a new paediatric indication must be lodged no later than two years prior to expiry of the certificate.
I support that approach, but, above all, we must be pragmatic.
By adopting this measure as it stands, we would stand the risk of depriving ourselves of medicinal products which, when this law entered into force, happened to be in this two-year period.
Under the terms of this article, it would be impossible to conduct research in order to develop a paediatric indication.
The transitional clause we are proposing, with the agreement of a majority of my colleagues, is intended to remedy this undesired effect.
We are therefore requesting that, for five years, any application for an extension of the Supplementary Protection Certificate as a result of a new paediatric indication may be lodged no later than six months before expiry of the certificate.
After this period, the Commissionâs initial proposal will apply.
We should be grateful for your agreement on this point.
To conclude, this text provides the opportunity to match words with actions in supporting European research; that is what we shall do tomorrow.
A great debate is currently in progress to find the best way of promoting Europe to our fellow citizens.
Europeans are not interested in grandiose rhetoric â they expect action.
This regulation on paediatric medication is a concrete response to that expectation.
This text is a good example of the added value of Europe in everyday life, as no Member State acting on its own would be able to promote such a policy on behalf of all children.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first of all, like to thank MrsÂ GrossetÃªte, the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and to congratulate her on her report.
I also want to thank the members of the committee for supporting this proposal. I would also like to emphasise the committed work of the Austrian Presidency in connection with this matter.
Thanks to the constructive cooperation between the three institutions we now have the opportunity to bring this legislative procedure to a close.
We must be reticent about making new laws, but this proposal is necessary.
In the European Union today, more than half of the medicinal products given to children have never been tested for this usage.
The reason for this is that paediatric medicinal products frequently only have a tiny share of the market and clinical testing can be very expensive.
In practice this means that a doctor who prescribes a medicinal product for a child does not always know if it works at all or whether it could have any side effects.
With the new Regulation this problem will be solved in the interests of children.
It creates incentives for first-class research in this field and promotes the development and licensing of high-quality, effective medicines for children.
I would like to emphasise two items which were raised in this Parliamentâs discussion. Firstly, the influence of the so-called Transparency Directive and, secondly, the treatment of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
The European Parliament was quite right to point out the significance of the Transparency Directive.
I agree with you wholeheartedly that the decisions of national authorities on the price of paediatric medicinal products and on the reimbursement of costs in connection with these must not lead to the availability of these products being delayed.
Decisions about pricing policies and reimbursement of costs are the responsibilities of the Member States.
However, the Commission cannot accept any deviation from the procedural rules laid down in the Transparency Directive.
We have therefore intensified our efforts to scrutinise more thoroughly the proper execution of the Directive in all Member States and to ensure that it is more effectively enforced.
Furthermore, I have established the Pharmaceutical Forum together with my colleague MrÂ Kyprianou.
Working in partnership with Member States and concerned groups, this framework is intended to provide solutions to urgent questions relating to the medicinal products sector, including among other things aspects of price and reimbursement.
The European Parliament has also raised the important question of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction.
I share your judgment that we must be extremely careful in dealing with such dangerous substances in all areas.
Nevertheless I believe that the amendments â which, together with this Regulation, aim at prohibiting the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products in general â are problematic for two reasons.
Firstly: the regulation on paediatric medicinal products can only regulate the auxiliary agents in medicines for children.
However, the rules governing auxiliary agents should be identical for all medicinal products.
Secondly, we cannot rule out the possibility that â precisely for certain important medicinal products â such auxiliary agents are indispensable.
The Commission believes that a further thorough scientific analysis of these issues is necessary, before we decide on possible measures.
The Commission therefore plans to ask the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for an opinion on the use of such substances as auxiliary agents in medicinal products for human use.
This opinion will be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Within six months of the delivery of the opinion, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the measures that it plans to put in place.
I have given a declaration to this effect to the Secretariat of the European Parliament so that the wording can be published and made accessible to all Members(1).
By way of conclusion, allow me to stress that this regulation is a good example of better lawmaking, one that does equal justice to the aims of safeguarding public health and promoting innovation.
This is one of the Commissionâs first legislative proposals that is based on a detailed impact assessment.
The proposal will improve health protection for our children and it will simultaneously promote innovation and competitiveness in the European medicinal products industry.
I am grateful for your support of this proposal.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my congratulations to MrsÂ GrossetÃªte for having achieved a consensus between all groups as well as with the Council and the Commission.
This is the culmination of a process which has, in my view, lasted six years.
Six years ago we discussed the problem and possible solutions with experts in Strasbourg for the first time, and now we are at the end of the legislative procedure.
I wish to thank the Commissioner and all those who have worked on this project, in particular however MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt, the shadow rapporteur of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who contributed a great deal and who unfortunately cannot be here today.
I wish her a speedy recovery.
This proposal contributes to the solution of a serious problem.
I myself have worked as a doctor in a childrenâs clinic and I have found out what a drama it is for children, parents and doctors when many forms of medication necessary for the treatment of children are prohibited.
I myself have had problems, but not as many problems as other colleagues and other families.
In some of these families children have died, because medicinal products that lacked authorisation were not administered or because, for example, children suffering from HIV were given too weak a dosage, which caused the children to become resistant to the medication.
That is why it is so good that we now have this regulation.
I particularly welcome the fact that the Council and the Commission have taken up the proposal to impose the MICE programme on off-patent medicines.
At first reading I was not completely satisfied with the uniform period of six months.
Even so, it is vital to make a start, and if we see that the six months are not appropriate for all cases, then perhaps we shall have to make further amendments.
Now we just have to act quickly, and so I am very glad that MrsÂ GrossetÃªte has persuaded the Council and the Commission to adopt ArticleÂ 18. For if we had not managed this, then the first medicines would only have come onto the market on the basis of the incentive system in 2009 at the earliest.
Now we shall be able to recognise positive effects immediately after the regulation is adopted, and that is important, because we have to act quickly in order to improve childrenâs health.
Â Â  . Madam President, I should first of all like to compliment and congratulate MrsÂ GrossetÃªte.
It is an important topic we are discussing this evening.
Children take medicinal products; lots of them, relatively speaking.
That is why it is so important that children are administered the right medicinal products, in the right dose and in the right form of administration.
The Commissionâs proposal is of major significance to children, parents and industry alike.
That is why I find it so regrettable that today, MrsÂ Roth-Behrendt is unable to be present, for she went all-out for this legislation, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish her a speedy recovery.
I have to say that our group was very divided on this proposal.
Of course, everyone is agreed that medicinal products for paediatric use must be developed and that their manufacturers must be given reasonable compensation for research they carry out into them.
This compensation could even be substantial, but for many of our group, the extension of the patent by another six months went a little too far.
Enquiries I made at a renowned enterprise revealed that, in most cases, research into the use of medicinal products for paediatric use costs no less than EUR 8Â million.
When patents are extended by six months, profits increase into a multiple of this sum, namely to some EURÂ 200 to 300 million, which are hefty profits.
Blockbusters command even higher amounts.
It is, of course, also possible that the profits are a little lower in the case of medicinal products for rare diseases.
That is why we have argued in favour of proportionality.
We think that the reward should be in proportion to the costs incurred.
That is a very simple and normal principle.
The bill for medicinal products need not become unnecessarily steep and that is why â and that is also my final comment â we are looking forward with eager anticipation to the assessment and review of this directive, which will then make evident what the six monthsâ of patent extension have yielded, what the economic costs are and whether it causes detriment to the industryâs innovative strength.
Â Â  - Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, especially on her negotiation skills and on the constructive result that we have today.
This regulation on the security of childrenâs medical products is a great success for patients in Europe.
It is long overdue, and now it is important that it enter into force quickly.
This is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports this helpful compromise, which makes an agreement with the Council at second reading possible.
We have had lengthy and extensive debates in this House on the renewal of patents for research-conducting producers of medicines, and sometimes there was haggling over each individual month of renewal.
Many colleagues have been quite upset about the possibility of additional profits for the pharmaceutical industry.
This unspeakable debate is now finally over.
This is, after all, about the security of medical products for children, which must be guaranteed.
If the research-conducting producers of medicines require an additional incentive in order to develop their products, then they should get it.
Finally, economic logic requires it too.
If this incentive has the additional effect of strengthening European research and attracting research-conducting pharmaceutical businesses back to Europe, then this is positive.
Â Â  Madam President, the aim of the Parliament and Council regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use is to improve childrenâs health in Europe by developing specific medicinal products designed to help children combat disease.
I would like to thank MrsÂ GrossetÃªte for the excellent work she has done on this regulation.
It is apparent that she has put in a great deal of effort, commitment and skill.
Health, and particularly childrenâs health, is a priority in itself.
When raising a sensitive issue such as medication for children, however, we should ask ourselves an honest question, namely whether it is possible to claim beyond doubt that prescribing adult medication to children is more ethical than involving children in controlled studies that are subject to stringent legislative provisions.
This is a question we should all ask ourselves, and which should form the basis for further discussion.
Unfortunately, we do not have much time for this at the moment.
With regards to the regulation, however, I am definitely opposed to reducing the period during which a company can apply to extend sole marketing authorisation for the basic product from two years to six months.
This proposal was voted on at first reading, when only 1% of votes cast in Parliament were in favour of it.
The amendment was supported neither by the Council, nor by the Commission.
I would like to express my regret that due to lack of support during the vote in May, no amendments were adopted to prevent abuse of the system of remuneration and incentives that are permissible under the provisions of the regulation under discussion.
I am keen that companies should not accumulate preferential instruments and remuneration for conducting the same studies for the same product, which would lead to abuse on too many occasions.
On the other hand, I do believe that it is important that producers of medicinal products be reimbursed for the costs incurred when carrying out trials of the use of medicines in children.
Such compensation could take the form of patenting new means of administering medication or forms of a medicinal substance and of giving sole marketing rights for medicinal products for children.
It is important here to stress that medicinal products used in adults should only be subject to investigation for their use in children where this is reasonable and necessary.
Finally, I would like to express my full support for the establishment of a Paediatrics Research Committee made up of members with specialist knowledge and competence, and who are independent experts in their fields.
I believe this to be a very positive solution.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the organisation of healthcare in the Member States is based upon solidarity through hospital networks, social security systems and mutual insurance schemes.
The pharmaceutical industry, however, selects its patients on the basis of their resources â I am thinking of the diseases of poor countries â or on the basis of the numbers of patients involved.
That is why we now have to legislate on the question of medicinal products for paediatric use.
We welcome the fact that this report will be adopted tomorrow, as we all want children to have medication appropriate to their age and medical condition without delay.
Having said that, I regret â and MrsÂ GrossetÃªte has also pointed this out â that the two-year period for marketing a medicinal product has been maintained, and, moreover, I regret that the amendment intended to cut that period has not been supported.
I also regret the long delay in obtaining an inventory of needs for paediatric treatments.
These delays belie the declarations of urgency made here in Parliament.
Finally, in relation to the provisions on risk management and pharmacovigilance, we must be careful to ensure they are properly implemented and, if necessary, be ready to amend our text.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m.
Â Â  I am pleased with this proposal, because I am convinced that it will result in more medicinal products developed and tested specifically for children being launched onto the market.
This is, above all, of great importance for young patients suffering from serious illnesses such as cancer or disorders of the immune system.
We should, however, not lose sight of the ethical side of the matter, and must prevent children from being used as guinea pigs.
That is why it is good that double testing is being cut out by the possibility of research already being done in third countries being valid.
Since estimates show that 50 to 90% of the medicinal products that are currently being used in paediatrics are never specifically studied or approved for use in that age category, the negative and positive effects of their application are virtually unknown.
It is therefore a good thing that European legislation should promote research into medicinal products that have been developed specifically for children and that we can thus put an end to this uncertainty.
Â Â  It is good that we have recognised the need to test childrenâs medicine specifically for children.
Once this principle is established we must go further to refine testing.
Childhood is not static.
The biology of a baby is quite different from the biology of a teenager.
We must also insist on periodic scientific reviews.
The long-term effects on children must be studied not just to look at accumulative effect, as we do with adult medicines, but to look at the particular effect the medicine has at different stages of a childâs development and on the health of the young adult they become.
Ritalin is the most widely prescribed drug for children in the US.
Only now, after almost 20 years of use, have we realised the permanent damage Ritalin has done to the development of the cardiovascular system of the young adult the child user becomes.
Thousands, even millions of adults will face adulthood with cardiovascular disease from a paediatric medicine tested for its effect on behaviour, not hearts.
Scientific testing must be specific, in this case for children, and must be updated.
Otherwise, we find out the bad news when it is too late.
Â Â  Considering the risks of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to reproduction, the Commission shall appoint the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products to formulate an opinion on the use of these categories of substance as auxiliary agents in medicinal products for human use; the legal basis for this is ArticleÂ 5(3) and ArticleÂ 57(1)(p) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of 31Â MarchÂ 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency.
The Commission shall forward the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use to the European Parliament and to the Council.
Within six months of the delivery of the opinion by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council about the measures that it plans to put in place following this opinion.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0180/2006) by MrÂ Chatzimarkakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013) [COM(2005)0121 C6-0098/2005 2005/0050(COD)].
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Parliament most sincerely for the strong support enjoyed by the Commission throughout this programme.
Parliamentâs extremely active participation and its amendments have made an essential contribution to the constructive development of the Commissionâs proposal.
The most recent economic growth and employment forecasts in Europe are altogether encouraging.
Nevertheless, we should not lose sight of fundamental problems and weaknesses.
In the newly formulated strategy for growth and employment of February 2005, the Commission clearly identifies the challenge.
The Commissionâs proposal, made in April of last year, for a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme should signal our willingness to follow up the analysis with the necessary effective steps to more growth and employment.
We want to use this programme to establish a link between the means and the political ends.
Innovation plays a key role here.
By innovation, I should point out, we mean more than simply the commercialisation of research findings.
Naturally we must ensure that research also produces marketable results, but innovation goes beyond that.
Our goal must be to make better economic use of knowledge and the potential of the knowledge-based society as a whole.
This means innovation in areas such as design, marketing and logistics as well as in business structures.
The broad-based support for the CIP demonstrates our common awareness of what must be done to strengthen Europeâs competitiveness.
The fact that today we are about to adopt the programme at first reading serves to highlight this all the more clearly.
Furthermore, this is the first major Community programme to be adopted for the period of the new Financial Perspective. A clear signal of European Parliament support and a beacon for the Agenda and for growth and employment.
The speed with which an agreement has been reached is due, above all, to the work of the rapporteur, MrÂ Chatzimarkakis, his shadow rapporteur, MrsÂ Thomson, MrÂ Vakalis and MrÂ Turmes, who have accomplished much through truly positive and flexible cooperation with the presidency.
The Commission has followed this process closely, and I should like to express my full support, on behalf of the Commission, of the supplemented proposal.
We have come to the end of a road we have travelled together, and I believe it has been a successful journey.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen, this is indeed a historic moment, since it would appear that this is the European Unionâs first Framework Programme to be adopted at first reading.
I should like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for the excellent proposal without which, after all, this would not have been possible.
I am, however, also grateful for the open nature of the negotiations, which involved four directorates-general.
Special thanks go to the Austrian Presidency of the Council, which has truly embraced the cause of innovation and the aim of its adoption within the term of its incumbency.
I should like to make particular mention of Josef Mandl and Matthias Martinek, who managed to dispel the reservations of several Member States.
But my thanks, of course, also go to my fellow Members here in Parliament.
I appreciated the trust and cooperation of MrÂ Vakalis, MrsÂ Thompson and MrÂ Turmes as well as the draftsmen of the opinions, especially MrÂ Langen.
I should like to express my particular thanks to my fellow Members from the Committee on Budgets.
Without their real commitment to obtaining the additional fourÂ billion, to upholding the blockade against the Council Decision, this programme could not have come into being in its current form, since a large part of the additional budget we in Parliament obtained has gone into innovation, into this CIP.
My heartfelt thanks, especially to MrÂ BÃ¶ge.
So what has changed?
Where has the European Parliament been able to leave its mark?
Our very first priority was to place this programme at the service of small and medium-sized enterprises.
These are the main parties involved; they must be the ones to drive innovation in Europe, and we placed them in the foreground by removing many sometimes obviously bureaucratic obstructions, for instance through a new Vademecum.
The Commission will publish a CIP handbook to enable applicants quickly and easily to gain information about the CIP and find the right way to obtain support.
And then we introduced a new principle. For this, I am extremely grateful to all concerned.
This is the principle of âno wrong entryâ.
There is no wrong door within the Commission for an SME.
Anyone with a question will not be turned away but will be directed to the right place.
This is a new principle and an important contribution to the simplification of procedure, an important step in cutting red tape, and I am confident that the Commission will ensure that detailed inquiries will always find the relevant, competent consultant.
This programme has also allowed us to make a quantum leap for innovation, in that we have attempted to close the gap in the so-called âprecede phaseâ, the period before a product or idea comes onto the market, by affiliating the programme with the seventh Framework Programme for Research.
In our committees we are currently engaged in negotiations on the seventh Framework Programme for Research, and I have been in close collaboration with MrÂ Buzek, the rapporteur, who is also here today and will say a few words shortly, despite not actually being on the CIP speaking list.
I am very glad that our cooperation went so well and that we were able to link the programmes so effectively.
It must be said that this programme covers all the essential elements of the Lisbon Agenda, which I should prefer to call the Liverpool Agenda, because Liverpool FC were three-nil down at half-time in the Champions League final and still pulled through to win in the end.
This is, after all, the very situation in which we now find ourselves.
Nonetheless, the major issues, innovation, competitiveness and energy, are all covered by this programme.
When we speak about innovation, we must be sure to define the word properly.
Innovation is a name given to anything nowadays.
All sorts of things are labelled âinnovationâ.
But what is innovation?
Innovation is not invention.
Invention has to do with research; invention is the process of putting money into knowledge, of investing in knowledge.
But innovation is the opposite process â making money out of knowledge!
And it is precisely here that we Europeans have a major deficit; it is here that we need to make up for lost time.
We have wonderful ideas.
We just manage less and less often to convert these ideas into real products.
The magnetic-levitation train that you all know, the Transrapid, was invented as early as 1934, and we still have not managed to realise it in Europe.
The computer, invented by Konrad Zuse, is hardly produced in the European Union any more.
Nuclear fission â perhaps not everyoneâs favourite subject â came from the European Union.
The Internet was basically invented in the European Union.
It blossomed, or its use blossomed, elsewhere.
Or that hot topic, MP3, a German invention, although 90% of sales are now made outwith the EU.
This Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme creates scope not only for inventions but for their concrete application in Europe as well.
This is the only way we can achieve the Lisbon objectives; it is the only way we can make progress.
My sincere thanks once again to all concerned.
Â Â  .Madam President, I should like first of all to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for searching so cooperatively for solutions, especially considering the general need to reduce the size of the budget.
This is an outstanding example of cooperation.
And my particular thanks also go to the Commission, to Commissioner Verheugen, whose work on this programme has proved his dedication to promoting innovation and small and medium-sized enterprises.
The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on which I am to report here for one minute, was adopted on 1Â December 2005, before the framework resourcing plan.
It follows that our wishes far outweighed the eventual achievements.
We fell into line; we endorse the motions for less bureaucracy in the programmes, for more sharply focused support and for innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises.
This has been recorded in the Chatzimarkakis report, and these motions will be vigorously supported by my colleagues on the Committee.
Â Â  . â Madam President, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, my conviction led me to place the emphasis of my contribution on the 20Â million or so small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that make up 98% of European businesses and that account for 70Â million jobs.
Many of these SMEs are the driving force behind innovation.
SMEs also represent an invaluable asset that should not be neglected, as they offer a resource that is scarce and that Europeâs economy most needs, namely entrepreneurship, which is often practised in distinctly unfavourable conditions.
I have put the case for simplifying the procedures.
This is a crucial point given that in Europe there are 18Â million businesses employing fewer than 10Â people.
These businesses have a great deal of difficulty in accessing information of this nature.
With Parliamentâs proposal aimed at creating a userâs manual, which will hopefully be adopted tomorrow, SMEs will have a clearer, simpler and more transparent framework on the rules of this programme.
The members of the committee therefore voted in favour of this proposal.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) is to contribute to the EUâs capacity for innovation and its competitiveness, with a particular focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, entirely in accordance with the goals of the Lisbon Strategy in terms of growth and jobs.
I am pleased that the programme contains a broad definition of innovation, so that this definition also includes non-technological innovation.
This ensures that the CIP also applies to enterprises in, for example, the adventure industry.
Adding value occurs at all stages of the value chain, which means that innovation in distribution, marketing or management is just as important as innovation in production.
In connection with the current debate about which direction Europe should take in its energy policy, it is a positive thing that we have been able to retain the environmental focus that has been a central element of the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme.
One reason for this is that energy efficiency and renewable forms of energy are amongst the areas in which more innovation can make the biggest contribution to the competitiveness of the EU.
A substantial challenge in relation to the CIP is to achieve the necessary synergy effects in relation to other programmes.
I believe that it is essential to ensure sound coordination between the CIP, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, the programme for Life-Long Learning and, especially, the Structural Funds.
Finally, I would like to emphasise the fact that I believe equality to be an important dimension within the CIP.
If we are to increase the number of entrepreneurs in Europe then we must get more women to take on the challenge.
We therefore have to remove the barriers that women face.
I hope that the Commission will focus on the gender-specific dimension in relation to entrepreneurship, and it pleases me a great deal that the programme will provide the opportunity for microfinance, since precisely this form of financing is of particular advantage to women.
Â Â  â Madam President, the reply to the question as to whether or not I am satisfied with the final text which we shall vote on tomorrow is, yes I am.
I am satisfied because, compared with the past, we have given priority to fast, simple procedures.
We have placed small- and medium-sized enterprises at the centre of the programme.
We have linked, in the best possible way, appropriations with the Structural Funds.
We have linked, in the best possible way, research with innovation. We have included and we have emphasised the cross-border dimension of innovation and entrepreneurship.
We have stressed the need for high quality services from small- and medium-sized business information and support centres.
We have clarified and elucidated what the innovative actions are.
We have focused on industrial and intellectual property rights.
We have emphasised and promoted the importance of non-technological innovation, alongside technological innovation.
I am satisfied because we have included an advisory body in the overall programme planning and implementation procedure.
Its role, without getting involved in comitology, is twofold and very important.
Firstly, because I hope that it will safeguard cohesion between sub-programmes, so that the CIP manages to operate in practice as one programme rather than three and, secondly, because it will safeguard the participation of innovation specialists and the sectors promoted by the programme.
The answer to the question of whether or not I am satisfied with the development of competitiveness and innovation in Europe is no, compared with our international competitors.
I am not satisfied, because it is important for us to improve, although that is not enough, because we need additional means, measures and actions at all levels, because we are not, for example, applying a bold public procurement policy to innovative small- and medium-sized businesses, because â unlike the USA â few of our businesses look on innovation as a worthwhile investment, because â generally speaking â we are lacking a culture of innovation and a culture of entrepreneurship.
To conclude: the CIP is a good idea, a very good idea.
However, innovation does not stop there.
To close, I thank the Austrian Presidency and the Commission for their excellent cooperation, as a result of which the programme was approved on time.
It could not have been more on time.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleague MrÂ Chatzimarkakis; tomorrow we will be voting in favour of competitiveness and innovation, and once again we will move a little closer towards the Lisbon Objective.
We in our group support this proposal.
It is short-sighted, however, that, just as we ought to be rapidly increasing levels of innovation, this budget is being cut.
In many crucial areas our competitiveness is waning.
A doctorâs assessment of the patient would be âweak, but not yet hopelessâ.
Investing in socially sustainable competitiveness will give us a chance to create a Europe where innovations flourish in a sustainable way.
A European Institute of Technology could help us turn innovation into products.
We nevertheless have to ensure that the founding of the EIT does not happen at the expense of the European Scientific Council.
The Framework Programme stresses the need to support the work of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It is there that a huge army of challengers â and employers â must be found.
Â Â  Mr President, my thanks to MrÂ Chatzimarkakis.
The European Union is strong on scientific research, but not as strong on innovation.
As rapporteur for the Seventh Framework Programme, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen on his new idea, namely the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme.
I fully support this programme, as well as MrÂ Chatzimarkakisâ report.
The programme guarantees the provision of industry funding for innovation, and will boost small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
The European Union cannot be successful in the technology race without such a programme to fill the gap between research and innovation, and this is both the basis of the Lisbon Strategy and the path to building a common European area for research and innovation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  It is of paramount importance for the Union to recognise the role played by SMEs in our economy.
In this respect, I am glad to notice that SMEs are at the very heart of the strategy of the new Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme.
As a matter of fact, if our aim is to bring further productivity, innovation capacity and sustainable growth for the Union, the emphasis should be put on the role of SMEs.
In this respect, while reforming the programmes and the instruments for the next programming period, we should bring forward without distorting the markets the horizontal objectives of the Union such as gender equality, environmental protection, protection of the disabled, the sharing of best practice, the promotion of lasting quality employment and economic growth.
In the end, it will be the citizens of the Union themselves within the framework of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy that will be the real beneficiaries of the EU-wide promotion of competitiveness and innovation.
Â Â  â The next item is the report by MrÂ Langen on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the enlargement of the euro zone [2006/2103(INI)] (A6-0191/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, we have before us the report on the enlargement of the euro zone.
It is based on the Commissionâs second report, which appraises the state of practical preparations and entry status of individual Member States.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to CommissionerÂ Almunia for the clarity of his report and of his stance, and I make a point of saying this because a year ago, during the review of the Stability and Growth Pact, I was rather inclined to think of the Commission as too compliant.
You have adopted a very clear position, and for that you have my wholehearted thanks.
Following the debates in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and those conducted within political groups, as well as the agreements made amongst the groups, I am convinced that the Commissionâs stance will be largely supported.
The euro has been successful across the board, since it has ensured monetary stability both within the euro zone, with low rates of inflation, and in relation to outside currencies.
This is only possible if we observe not only the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty but also the Stability and Growth Pact.
Given that the two largest states of the euro zone, France and Germany, have remained in contravention of the stability pact for years on end without finding the necessary inner strength to enact essential reforms, it is imperative that we, in this current phase involving the entry of Member States with a derogation, fulfil the conditions of the Maastricht Treaty to the letter.
We have twelve euro zone members and eleven states with a derogation; Britain and Denmark have a special âopt-outâ status.
That is something else again, and they can always reconsider what they want to do.
All the others are compelled to accept the supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and the appraisal of their level of convergence.
The Commission has done these things carefully and rigorously, and for this, too, I offer my most sincere thanks.
The difference, which was not evident to all here in Parliament â even in discussions within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs â is that, under the Regulations of 1997, both members of the euro zone and states with a derogation are subject to supervision of their budgetary and financial policies and to coordination of their economic policies.
Within the euro zone this is achieved through stability programmes, while states with a derogation have convergence programmes.
This is why, after lengthy debates, we have adopted a report which is strongly guided by the Maastricht Treaty in terms of entry criteria, which are as follows: price stability; a candidate for entry must have a rate of inflation no more than 1.5% higher than that of the three best EU Member States.
As regards public finances, the level of debt must not exceed 60% of GDP, with a 3% ceiling for new debts.
I sometimes get the impression that the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are being misinterpreted.
And then we have the adherence to ERM II for two years, interest-rate convergence, legislative compatibility, an independent central bank and economic convergence.
I am convinced that premature introduction of the euro is detrimental to the Member States, since real convergence and financial, economic and monetary stability are essential when determining the ultimate exchange rate so that an accession candidate, having entered and no longer being able to devalue or revalue, does not default.
We deliberated and agreed that countries would not be named, but that we wanted, on the other hand, to enter into discussions with the Commission and the European Central Bank on the setting of the rate of inflation, another area in which differences exist.
The European Central Bank has defined a value close to 2% as price stability for the evaluation of its monetary policy, and we are keen to become fully involved in this dialogue.
We decided, moreover, that we do not wish any one of the candidate countries to be given special rebates, but that we place great value on equal and proper treatment for all, be they new or old Members.
We also do not wish the experience of the first accession phase, involving the entry of Greece on the basis of incomplete data and Italy before completion of two yearsâ compliance with the ERM fluctuation margins, to be taken as a precedent for the enlargement of the euro zone; we wish instead to encourage the Commission to be impartial and true to the Maastricht Treaty in the assessments it delivers.
You will appreciate, Commissioner, that our wish is for greater transparency.
I am grateful for the constructive cooperation of my fellow Members.
In the end, I feel that the report we have developed and refined is a good one which will have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues here and which in turn emphatically endorses the Commissionerâs stance.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank MrÂ Langen for his excellent report and all of the Members of Parliament, those in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in particular, for taking part in this discussion, which is of very great importance.
It is important to look after all of the countries which do not yet belong to the eurozone but which wish to and which are obliged to join, because all of the Member States, except those with an opt-out clause the United Kingdom and Denmark have the right to belong to the eurozone, but also the obligation to join it and to prepare themselves for doing so.
To this end, the aspects dealt with in the report that led to yours, on the preparations of the Member States that will join the eurozone over the coming years, are very important.
I must tell you that, over the coming weeks, we are going to approve a new report, because from now on those reports will be published by the Commission every six months, rather than every year.
They are preparations of a technical nature, which are very important in terms of keeping public opinion informed and trying to prevent the kind of abuse in the exchange between the national currency and the single currency that has happened in the past in certain cases.
We are learning from past experiences in order to cooperate with the candidates to join the euro, in order to prevent that abuse and in order to convince the citizens that moving from their national currency to the euro has no direct relationship with price rises, which can easily be avoided.
Of course, the candidates for joining the eurozone must prepare themselves for fulfilling the criteria laid down in the Treaty, since the Treaty of Maastricht.
The debate has focussed more on this last aspect, because, as you know, a few weeks ago the Commission and the European Central Bank adopted convergence reports in response to the requests of Slovenia and Lithuania.
In those reports, the Commission â and the European Central Bank â gave their interpretation of the application of the criteria laid down in the Treaty.
I would insist that they are laid down in the Treaty, they are not defined by the European Commission artificially or on a whim.
The criteria in the Treaty cannot be changed.
Our obligation, therefore â and we have done this on other occasions and we will do so in the future â is to apply the Treaty and to apply it rigorously, since that is the only way to guarantee equal treatment for each and every Member State seeking to join the eurozone.
The most obvious discussion relates to the inflation criterion.
MrÂ Langen talked about the criterion of the European Central Bank for maintaining price stability.
I must tell you that it is not the same: the European Central Bankâs objective of maintaining price stability in the eurozone below 2% inflation, but close to it, is one thing, but the Treatyâs inflation criterion, which states that candidates for joining the eurozone must have an average inflation rate over the last twelve months below the reference value, which is the inflation of the three best performing countries in terms of inflation, plus 1.5%, is quite another.
This is laid down clearly in the Treaty.
The Commission cannot alter the criteria in the Treaty; we have the duty to see them applied and that is what we have done.
Since I have noted from certain comments in the report or in the amendments that the Commission is being asked for transparency in the way the Treaty is interpreted and applied, I am at Parliamentâs service, not just to explain the convergence reports on Slovenia and Lithuania in detail, but also, if you wish, to provide the additional documentation on which the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 16 May is based.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always endorsed and promoted the enlargement of the European Union and has always said that this enlargement, including accession to the euro zone, must move forward without further delay.
That has always been our policy, and it still is our policy.
In addition, it has been the policy of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party throughout recent years to fight for a strong euro in line with the Maastricht criteria and accompanied by strict adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact.
For this reason there have been extensive discussions with the Commission in recent years whenever the large countries were involved â France, Italy and Germany.
We will therefore continue this policy in pursuit of a stable euro and so would like to assure the Commission of our unequivocal support for the clear stance it has taken on the question of our future approach to enlargement of the euro zone.
Let me say once again that we are very clearly in favour of new Member States entering the euro zone; this must, however, take place in accordance with particular criteria; we have a certain amount of tradition and rigour to uphold in this respect.
So, once again, our heartfelt thanks to the Commission.
At the same time, however, I would like to encourage the Commission to be more assertive the Member States when it comes to data.
It has the support of Parliament.
I also encourage the Member States to grant the Commission more rights in relation to the verification of data pertaining to potential entry.
I say this because Parliament will ask the Commission whether it can vouch for the data on which it bases its recommendation.
It must therefore be given greater access to information, and this requires the Member States to be more cooperative.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Treaty on European Union states that the accession of new Member States to the euro zone is their right and obligation, as Commissioner Almunia just said.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament fully supports this notion.
The conditions for joining the euro zone are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty in the form of so-called ânominal convergence criteriaâ.
These criteria must be fulfilled in order to join the common currency area, and fulfilment of them is sufficient in order to do so.
However, there have been attempts to impose additional conditions on the new Member States, such as âreal convergenceâ, or the âeuro zone absorption capacityâ, which has not been defined in detail.
These criteria do not exist in the Maastricht Treaty, and so they cannot be applied.
There must be no double standards when it comes to new and old Member States.
If we fully agree that the provisions of the Treaty must be respected, we should abide by the rule that we are bound by the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty.
I would also like to point out that the convergence criteria give rise to a whole series of reasonable doubts as regards economic factors and interpretation.
These problems became glaringly obvious in the recent convergence reports on Lithuania and Slovenia.
The definition of price stability that the European Commission and the European Central Bank used in their reports assessing fulfilment of the inflation criteria was contrary to the definition of price stability that the ECB applies in its monetary policy.
Other aspects of the assessment are also dubious.
This is not a minor matter, because on the basis of the assessment Lithuania was not given a positive recommendation by the Commission for joining the euro zone.
This situation gives cause for concern, because the European Commissionâs decisions must be reliable and should not give rise to doubts concerning partisanship or lack of objectivity.
The rules used when assessing individual Member States must be clear, and the decision-making process must be totally transparent.
Mr President, the convergence criteria formulated 15 years ago, when the Member States still had national currencies and separate monetary policies, should be adapted to the current situation, in which the new Member States are joining an existing common currency area.
This requires appropriate amendments to the relevant provisions of ArticleÂ 121 of the Treaty and the Protocol to the Treaty.
I ask for a debate to be opened on this matter.
Â Â  . I am very sorry that discussion of the problems regarding the expansion of Euro zone was given very little attention.
Now those problems will have to be solved during the actual process of expansion, and the Commission is not ready for this.
But we do not think we should blame one another.
From our experience of reforms, we know that satisfactory results can also be achieved in such a way; we simply have to react quickly to the changing situation.
Therefore, I would like European institutions to react quickly to the changing situation.
It is obvious, that preparation for the introduction of the Euro involves substantial expenditure; therefore, the assessment of candidate countries must be carried out not half a year before introducing the Euro, but much earlier, perhaps in a few stages.
I also agree with the opinion that we must review the calculation methodology of the Maastricht inflation criteria.
After all, we reviewed the Stability and Growth Pact methodology without any difficulties.
I trust that this was not because a large country requested it.
The voice of small countries must also be heard.
As for my third point, all the Commission's assessments must be submitted to Parliament because decisions in the European Union must not be taken without democratic control.
The European Union is based on democratic rules.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is impossible to disagree with many conclusions expressed in the report.
What objections could be made to an obligation to rigorously observe the Treatyâs conditions?
This is just as it should be, and personally I am in favour of this position.
If this approach had been consistently adopted, however, then the history of the euro zoneâs creation would have been significantly different, and it is even possible that the number of states that are currently members of the euro zone would differ.
A third of the current members of the euro zone joined it whilst in breach of one or other of the criteria.
In reality, the admission criteria were only used as reference points, and political decisions were the real deciding force.
This is not surprising, since in many cases the economic foundation of the criteria is very questionable.
Thus, for example, the permissible inflation level was also set by reference to countries that are not in the euro zone and, most paradoxical of all, the best inflation indicators differ from the European Central Bankâs vision concerning the best level of price stability in the euro zone.
The demand for countries to achieve exchange rate stability together with the inflation indicators makes this criterion even more contradictory.
The European Central Bank does not even claim to bring this about in the euro zone.
Concerns expressed in the report concerning potential problems with the applicant countries following accession to the euro zone cannot be attributed to the small, flexible economies of, for example, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, which are also open economies and have since the beginning of the 1990s had experience of exchange rates fixed over the long term.
If Lithuania, with its trifling divergence from the inflation criterion, is not accepted into the euro zone, then that is obviously a political decision.
I would support the report if it were truly focused on the improvement of the admission criteria in the future.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Rather, what we can detect in the report is the theme of the notorious Polish plumber.
Â Â  â Although IÂ am not from Lithuania, in the context of the matter under discussion, IÂ would like to comment on the matter of Lithuaniaâs joining the euroÂ zone.
For aÂ number of years now the country has achieved good economic results which would be aÂ cause for jubilation in the vast majority of euroÂ zone countries.
Lithuania has achieved robust long-term economic growth approaching 10% of the GDP.
For aÂ long time, and with aÂ great deal to spare, it has also met the Maastricht criteria for the public spending deficit, for public sector debt and long-term interest rates, unlike most of the euroÂ zone countries.
In only one criterion did the country exceed the 2.6% reference level by one tenth of aÂ percent in the last evaluation period, although it had met the target for several years before that.
My friends, joining the euroÂ zone should not be like an athletics event, where a one-tenth measure decides on whether you qualify or not.
The postponement of Lithuaniaâs entry is an insensitive decision.
It will be aÂ cold shower for future candidates.
Â Â  Although this item on the agenda does not involve the discharge of a legislative role, the rapporteurâs task has not been an easy one.
I should, therefore, like to congratulate MrÂ Langen on a job well done and on gaining such convincing support in the committee.
I particularly welcome the fact that the report clearly defines the relationship with the citizens of the European Union, that is, with the consumers, which is necessary if there is to be a successful transition to the single currency in the accession countries.
We are all aware of the importance of the Euro project for European integration and how important it is that all parties in the process of Eurozone enlargement retain their credibility.
This also means that we have to follow the criteria which have been set in a consistent manner, and that we must not the change the rules of the game halfway through.
I am happy that in the eyes of the European Commission and the European Central Bank Slovenia has passed a challenging test, namely that it has met all the requirements for entry to the Eurozone.
Of course, I would be happier still if the requirements for the expansion of the Eurozone had been met by more new Member States.
I say this in the belief that the further enlargement of the Eurozone is important for the political development of the European Union and also if it is to play a more powerful role in a globalised world.
Â Â  Mr President, in congratulating Slovenia, I would like to remind you that Lithuania has met all of the Maastricht criteria for five consecutive years, except for a one-month period during which inflation exceeded the criteria by a small margin.
However, it was exactly at that time that the Commission rushed to make a negative recommendation.
The day after the Commissionâs conclusion, it emerged from the latest data that Lithuania did in fact meet the Maastricht criteria.
Yesterday, the President of the Ecofin group, MrÂ Juncker, said that Lithuania was warned not to apply for the euro because of its probable rejection.
Unfortunately, this demonstrates the Commissionâs preconceptions based on suspicion and prognosis.
It seems that Vilnius was punished for not following Brusselsâ advice and, ironically, because it met the criteria for five exemplary years.
Of all the eurozone countries, only Finland can be proud about meeting the same targets.
The situation could be restored.
I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment in which the Commission is âto review its evaluation of Lithuaniaâ.
I also invite the initiation of a broader discussion on the legitimacy and application of the present convergence criteria in the enlarged EU.
Â Â  â The report on the expansion of the Euro zone being debated is uncommonly unprofessional and meaningless.
It lists known truths.
In Point 1, requirements like the independent Central Bank and the conformity of the legislative system with the Maastricht Agreement are mistakenly included among the Maastricht criteria.
The goal named in Points 4 and 5 â the stability of the EuroÂ zone â needs clarification about what stability is, when not one of the 12 EuroÂ zone members managed to meet all criteria at the time of accession and continue to infringe them to this day, especially the inflation and non-excessive budget deficit indicators, and what damage can expansion do?
Discrimination against EuroÂ zone candidate countries is obvious when double standards are applied.
An indicator stability requirement, not made previously, must now be fulfilled prior to expansion, irrespective of the fact that today's economic and political situation is different from that which existed 15 years ago when the EuroÂ zone was created.
I urge the Commission and the Council to take the EU's economic and political realities into account, to improve the Maastricht criteria and implement them in all Member States and continue the expansion of the EuroÂ zone.
Â Â  Mr President, in taking the floor in this debate I would like to draw attention to the following issues.
Firstly, the report quite clearly states that new Member States must meet all the Maastricht criteria before they can join the euro zone.
At the same time it passes over the fact that when the euro was introduced, many old Member States did not meet these criteria.
Once again the political signal being sent out is that some are more equal than others in the EU.
Secondly, since the introduction of the euro in 2002, at least five countries, including the largest â Germany, France and Italy â have not complied with the most important criteria, and have been unable to keep their budget deficits and public debt under control.
In some of these countries, public debt greatly exceeds 60% of GDP, which means they will have to restrict it for many years to come.
Despite this the continued membership of these countries in the monetary and currency union not only continues unquestioned, but nobody is making any particular effort to force these countries to change the current state of affairs.
The recent amendments to the Stability and Growth Pact which benefited Germany and France are glaring examples of this.
Thirdly, and in view of this situation, the rejection of Lithuaniaâs application to join the euro zone as of 1Â January 2007, merely because it exceeded the inflation indicator by 0.1%, may at the very least cause confusion and bodes no good for the debate on enlargement of the euro zone to include all the new Member States, or on the accession to this zone of the United Kingdom, Denmark or Sweden.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank all of the Members who have spoken during the debate.
I would like to thank them for their contributions, regardless of whether they agree with the Commissionâs views on the issues that we are discussing today.
I would like to say four things: firstly, that the Commission is, of course, in favour of enlarging the eurozone.
There is no other option: the Member States have that right and obligation, and we respect that right and demand compliance with that obligation.
We do so regardless of whether those who are to join the eurozone over the coming years are new or old Member States â a distinction which we believe belongs in the past â or whether they be large or small, rich or not so rich.
We are not going to come up with any new conditions, MrÂ Rosati: we are applying the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty.
That is the only way to ensure that everybody is treated equally, and I do not imagine â and I am sure that none of you wishes to do so â that anybody in this House would ask the Commission not to fulfil its duty as guardian of the Treaty and not to apply the Treaty equally to each and every Member State.
Can the Treaty be modified?
Of course.
This afternoon I have had the opportunity to attend the debate at which Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the future Constitution, the necessary changes and the future of Europe.
Of course the Treaty can be changed, and it will be changed eventually.
But for now we have to apply the existing Treaty, and you know, just as I do, that it is not for the Commission to change the Treaty.
What does the Treaty say about the inflation criterion, which has been discussed in the debate?
It says that the reference value consists of the average inflation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation.
It does not say âmembers of the eurozoneâ.
It clearly says âMember Statesâ: all of them, including those with an opt-out clause; we cannot exclude any Member State from the calculation of the three best performing Member States in terms of inflation.
And we must add 1.5% to that average of the three: that is the reference value.
Something quite different is the figure defined by the European Central Bank, independently, as an objective within the context of its mandate, which is to ensure price stability.
It is not the same, and there is no reason why it should be, and in this debate we must not confuse the European Central Bankâs inflation objective with the reference value of the Treaty's inflation criterion.
They are completely different things.
The Treaty's inflation criterion says something else though: it also says that the inflation of the Member State in question must be sustainable.
Some of you talk about a small difference, and it is true.
In the inflation criterion, however, in addition to the difference, in addition to the comparison between the inflation of the Member State and the reference value, the Treaty states that we must analyse whether or not the inflation of the Member State in question is sustainable.
We cannot ignore the Treaty, and we are not going to.
We are going to explain it over and over again, because rigorously analysing the criteria is not in the interest of the Sates currently in the eurozone, but of the Member State that is a candidate to join the eurozone; because, if we do not do so, that State will have to suffer the consequences once the decision to join the euro is irreversible.
References to the past are not of any use to me, therefore.
If things were not done perfectly in the past, then somebody is paying for the consequences today.
Let us learn from experience, since that is what rational and reasonable politicians should do.
We apply the Treaty, but we apply all aspects of it, not just the bits that are in our interest, and when applying it, we learn from our experience, within the margin for interpretation permitted by the Treaty.
With regard to Lithuania, I am not going to deny the obvious, of course: its economic results are magnificent.
The efforts it has made to improve its economic situation are extraordinary.
We all want Lithuania to fulfil all of the Treatyâs criteria as soon as possible.
Today it has been able to fulfil all of them but one; let us hope that it overcomes that difference very soon.
As soon as it does so, I will be looking forward to receiving a request from Lithuania which is its right pursuant to the Treaty so that I can issue a favourable opinion on behalf of the Commission.
But please do not ask the Commission to say anything in the convergence reports that goes against a rational, clear and transparent application of the Treaty.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â When the press announces that Otmar Issing is leaving the European Central Bank (ECB), but that the monetarist legacy will live on, it is merely confirming our view that monetarist guidelines continue to prevail and to guide the EUâs economic and social policy, regardless of who is in charge of the ECB.
As we know, and the Langen report confirms this, joining the euro requires âtotal compliance with the Maastricht criteriaâ, which implies meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, and observing the guidelines of the European Central Bank, the European monetary authority whose decisions have an impact throughout economic life.
The report expressly states that âEuro changeover should not be tackled and projected as simply a technical change in currency but as a major conversion with significant economic, monetary and social effectsâ.
It highlights Parliamentâs maximalist approach, which is that the budgetary cycle at national level needs to be synchronised and based on the same prerogatives, namely the loss of monetary, and in turn fiscal, sovereignty.
Unfortunately, in Portugal we are very familiar with this situation and its effects, as confirmed by the recent spring 2006-2007 economic forecasts.
The loss of monetary sovereignty has ramifications for the real convergence of economies, serving the economic groups, directly or indirectly.
Hence our opposition to this report.
Â Â  In September 2003 there was a referendum in which the people of Sweden were given the opportunity to decide whether Sweden should introduce the euro as its currency.
The verdict, not surprisingly, was a loud and clear ânoâ.
It is now two years since ten new Member States joined the EU.
The state of opinion in those countries in relation to the euro varies from country to country.
Replacing a currency is, however, an incredibly important and serious matter.
It is not just a question of changing coins and notes, but also of giving up a part of your independence.
By extension, you lose the ability to control your own economic development.
The June List believes that the people must be consulted when decisions of this importance, such as in relation to a new draft Constitution or the euro, are to be taken.
For the sake of democracy, it would be best if referendums were arranged â if that is what the people want â in those countries intending to introduce the euro as legal tender.
The result of these referendums must then be respected, just like the people of Swedenâs ânoâ to the euro.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Grech on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on Parliamentâs estimates for 2007 [2006/2022(BUD)] (A6-0188/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, 2007, the first year of the new financial perspective, will be a year of spending consolidation in Parliamentâs budget estimates for the coming year.
Through this stocktaking exercise and consolidation process, we must strengthen what is proving to be efficient, and shed, or at least reduce, activities which do not add value.
In this type of scenario, the implementation of activity-based budgeting commands greater importance.
The report, moreover, stresses the fact that the budget should reflect actual budgetary needs.
This explains why it is necessary for the retention or otherwise of the self-imposed ceiling of 20% to be evaluated thoroughly.
We need to carry out a cost-benefit analysis to examine what serves Parliamentâs best interests, including its financial independence now and in the future, when the Membersâ Statute amounting to circa EURÂ 100 million per annum comes into force in 2009.
This budgetary approach translates into more effective, transparent and analytical estimates, which leads me to another key issue in the report: the acquisition of parliamentary buildings.
In this respect, and considering the recent events regarding the purchase of the WIC and SDM buildings in Strasbourg, we have no hesitation in putting into reserve the EURÂ 50 million intended for the purchase of those premises.
It would be inadvisable to release these funds until the outstanding and unclear issues surrounding those premises have been satisfactorily clarified.
We do not wish to underestimate the positive financial impact of our acquisition policy.
We have repeatedly commented on the substantial savings this policy has created over the years.
Nevertheless, it would be prudent to consider re-examining the overall acquisition policy of Parliamentâs buildings, including the information offices in the various Member States.
The report also addresses the issues relating to the visitorsâ programme and information policy.
Regrettably, no decision has been taken on the EURÂ 5Â million allocated to improving the visitorsâ programme.
This situation is untenable and Members expect the Bureau to take a decision prior to first reading.
In 2006 Parliament decided to invest in three major information projects, which included the building of a new visitorsâ centre, audiovisual facilities and web television.
In this respect, the administration has put forward for our consideration funds amounting to EURÂ 25 million to implement these projects in 2007.
In principle we agree that more needs to be done to improve connectivity between the citizens and the new institutions that represent them.
However, more precise and detailed information regarding political oversight, organisation, cost structure and programme contents have to be submitted before releasing all, or some, of these funds from the reserve.
Bearing in mind the existing budgetary constraints, we are not as yet convinced that the request for an additional 74Â posts is justified, especially at a time when we are advocating spending consolidation.
Under these circumstances, the respective appropriation has been put in reserve until detailed information justifying this request is available prior to first reading.
On another level, it is to be noted that EURÂ 48 million are being allocated for the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.
In the event of a postponement, the financial impact of circa 24Â million should be deducted from the 2007 budget.
Another important area we have focused upon in our report is that of the assistance and facilities available to Members.
In this regard, the administration will be conducting a quality survey on the service being given to Members.
We feel confident that the stocktaking process on the raising the game exercise, together with the surveyâs conclusions, should go a long way towards improving this important aspect.
In our report we have also referred to a number of other priorities that we have to address, such as training, recruitment related to enlargement, the assistantsâ statute, security and contracts relating to external supplies.
Regrettably, I do not have the time to address all these points, but we certainly cannot ignore them.
In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs, coordinators and members of the Committee on Budgets for their cooperation and constructive participation in drawing up this report with the common goal of improving the performance, quality and accountability of Parliamentâs operation.
Â Â  .
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Grech; he has done an excellent job, and the level of cooperation has been very agreeable.
It has been a pleasant experience collaborating on this project.
I would nevertheless like to make a few observations.
First, it has always been said that we are spending 20% more than in the previous year.
There may not be any principle at work here.
The principle may just be that we are giving careful consideration to what needs we have and how we can use taxpayersâ money sparingly.
Then there are the budget headings, and especially information policy.
Last year we decided by a clear majority that we would add EUR five million for groups of visitors.
Members of Parliament are expecting this EUR fiveÂ million to be used, but it has not.
This seems somewhat frustrating.
Why does Parliament decide things in general if they are not put into practice?
I hope that Parliamentâs President will ensure that Parliamentâs will is implemented with regard to this matter and that the EUR five million will be spent.
Then the desire was expressed to start having web television, although no decisions have been taken on this.
In my opinion, the Committee has quite rightly made it a condition that there should be long-term financial plans for it: consideration of what it will cost next year, in five yearsâ time and even over a longer period of time, so that we know where we are going and how the administration will work.
Before that happens, no decisions can be made.
I would further like to mention one detail connected with the childrenâs nursery.
Parliament has abandoned the idea of a nursery here and has bought a splendid house: a nice setting for the children but totally in the wrong place.
The nursery ought to have been in this building or close by.
How we behave as an employer is important.
We should set an example, and I am disappointed with the Social Democrats, who do not care about families with children, who put people down, and who seem contemptuous of families with children.
We vote in favour of the sports centre, money for web television and for many other comforts, but we do not care about families with children.
I hope that this issue will be raised again.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very thorough work on this report.
I applaud Louis Grech on the emphasis on improving the effective use of the funds.
For this reason, I strongly support the introduction of activity-based budgeting.
I have been asking for this system to be adopted by the Parliament for the last five years, as it provides an opportunity to demonstrate greater transparency.
I have been disappointed, however, by the reluctance of the administration to introduce such a system and I think it is about time we did so.
Therefore, I would ask the Secretary-General to take this issue up very seriously and see what progress we can make on that front.
The second issue I want to raise is the annual question of the car service.
I do not go along with what is in the report, namely to increase the support of additional funds for the chauffeur service for the Members.
I support the amendment that the Verts/ALE Group has put forward, which is to look at the service and see how we can improve it without increasing the funds.
We do not need to start increasing funds, especially when we have taxi reimbursement available for Members.
On information and communication, we cannot stress enough the need for results that are essential for us to connect with the citizens.
I thoroughly support the suggestions of having web TV and an improved visitorsâ centre.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would also very much like to thank MrÂ Grech for his constructive and thorough work on Parliamentâs Budget for 2007.
We are dealing here with a budget of just under EURÂ 1.4Â billion, and there are three points to which I would like to draw attention.
The first of these is that nearly half of the expenditure is caused by the geographical spread of Parliamentâs activities and the fact that we work in many languages.
These are conditions that are very specific to the European Parliament but also conditions that we are not, ourselves, in control of.
Secondly, I wish to emphasise the need constantly to reprioritise and to bring about greater efficiency, particularly with regard to staffing policy, where redeployment is required.
I would like to draw attention to the need to have better facilities for Members, so that they are able to work more efficiently, and to make information policy more effective, in which connection there is a need carefully to assess the contributions of the national information offices.
A third point that I would like to raise is the matter of the purchase of buildings in Strasbourg.
There has clearly been a lot of public blustering about this issue, and it would be entirely unacceptable if it should turn out that the location of Parliament in Strasbourg has been a money machine for the city.
So we are forced, for the time being, to put the purchase of buildings on hold.
Personally, I would prefer it if Parliament were able to content itself with being located in Brussels, so that we could work effectively on this issue too.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking in the expectation of being allowed the same length of time as the previous speakers, to whom you were very generous.
What you present us with here is really an extremely sad situation.
Yet again, the report shows that the budget is to be raised by another 4.2% and that another 250 new posts are to be established.
This makes what you are doing here an expression of organised irresponsibility.
It is clear that a group of people have hijacked the European project, and I am, regrettably, convinced that those who acquiesce once again will go down in history as benighted squanderers.
If you took this report, translated it into all the official languages and gave it to the men and women of Europe to read, they would be horrified; they would say, âWhat are you thinking?
We do not have that any more; we cannot afford that any more!
Even half of that would be too much.â
And everybody here knows that, but they do not act accordingly.
It reminds me very much of the late Soviet Union, where every year they would talk about new record harvests and new maximisations and efficiency gains.
What we have here is a disgrace and is unworthy of the European Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrsÂ Hennicot-Schoepges on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) [(COM(2005)0467 C6-0311/2005 2005/0203 (COD)] (A6-0168/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to the Committee on Culture and Education, in particular to Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, and to the other committees involved, for all the valuable comments on and amendments to the Commissionâs proposal concerning the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
I am very glad that the European Parliament shares the Commissionâs view on the importance of intercultural dialogue and the priority it should be given in the European Union.
The Commission welcomes the majority of the amendments.
The Commission is particularly sensitive to the call for strong cooperation with civil society and to the emphasis on the role of education.
We also applaud the emphasis on the contribution of different cultures and expressions of diversity to the heritage of the Member States, as well as to European identity.
We are very much in favour of ensuring continuity with the European Year of Equal Opportunities For All in 2007.
The Commission is also in favour of a reference â preferably in a recital â to the fact that intercultural dialogue embraces dimensions related to religions and beliefs.
However, the Commission would like to express some concerns relating to a couple of the amendments.
Firstly, we cannot subscribe to limiting the resources for the communication and information campaign to EURÂ 2Â million.
Experience gained from previous European Years shows that these campaigns are crucial for achieving the awareness-raising objectives, and evaluation reports have always pointed to scarcity of resources as an issue in this respect.
The Commission could show some flexibility vis-Ã -vis its original proposal of a EURÂ 4.5Â million budget, but certainly not on such a drastic cut.
Another financial issue is the level of co-financing of the actions at national level, which an amendment proposes to increase to up to 80%.
As already stated, due to the limited budget of the Year, this change would significantly reduce the number of events that could be co-financed, as well as the commitment of partners at national level.
The original proposal for 50% cofinancing is the standard formula which has been retained for all previous European Years.
A number of amendments introduce a discrepancy between the geographical scope of the Year, which is limited to the European Union, and some new objectives and actions to be carried out with respect to third countries.
The Commission proposed to concentrate the specific instrument on the Year of Intercultural Dialogue within the European Union, while committing itself to developing a parallel effort for the dialogue in, and with, third countries on the basis of external relations instruments.
Some amendments include problematic references to several very concrete actions.
The Commission is of the opinion that the Year should be a bottom-up process, where projects and initiatives come from our partners, in particular from civil society.
Given the limited number of initiatives which can be supported, the introduction of references to precise actions within the legal basis would hamper the creativity of our partners and lead to implementation difficulties.
Last, but not least, the Commission understands and appreciates the will of the European Parliament to be closely associated with the process.
Unfortunately, it cannot support the amendment suggesting the participation of representatives of the European Parliament in the Advisory Committee.
Comitology is a highly codified matter. It is our wish to adhere to the existing rules.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for setting out the Commissionâs views so clearly.
First of all, I should like to thank my fellow Members who have assisted me in this task, all the committees which have submitted amendments and everyone who has given me advice.
The Commissionâs initial proposal was undoubtedly extremely wide-ranging, somewhat opaque and rather long-winded, but its aim was to be general in nature.
The question Parliament has to consider is: can we express aspirations and launch an initiative for intercultural dialogue without extending the subject in advance to the issues that really interest us, and also without discussing thorny issues such as inter-faith dialogue?
We sought to clarify a number of things in our text.
Firstly, reference is made in ArticleÂ 2 to the European Unionâs common values.
In adhering to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we make it sufficiently clear that our common basis and the one we have all accepted is the one which guarantees non-discrimination between the sexes and equality of opportunity in all its aspects.
It is unnecessary to keep repeating it.
There is also the issue of extending the action beyond 2008, and stimulating dialogue across the large range of initiatives already underway in Community programmes.
There is no doubt that education will be of vital importance here, not to mention the involvement of civil society; cooperation with all parts of civil society is essential.
It is obvious that the media will have a major role to play and we must use the opportunity of the large-scale gatherings and emblematic events planned for 2008 to combat, in particular, the trafficking of human beings and enforced prostitution.
It is also necessary to include other international organisations, such as the Council of Europe and Unesco.
That does not mean that intra-European dialogue must not occupy centre stage, merely that we must take into account the joint actions already launched by Unesco.
On this point, I would draw attention to the vote on cultural diversity, when the 25 spoke with a single voice.
On another point: the Internet portal will have to be developed and, when the Commission says that it cannot agree with a lower budget for communication and information, I would ask the Commissioner if the overall budget could not be increased.
Our Committee on Culture and Education has already pointed out to him that a budget of EURÂ 10Â million is extremely small to achieve the objectives set for this year.
We know that culture is always the poor relation in budgetary terms.
In these circumstances, your comment that you would like to revert to the initial budget is unsatisfactory.
We would ask you to make a further effort in terms of the overall budget, so that we can increase the amount devoted to communication and information.
In relation to the dialogue with the religious world, I have to point out, here, Mr President, that only yesterday the President of the Council and the President of the Commission launched a debate with the representatives of religious communities on the issue of fundamental rights and mutual respect.
Despite that, Parliament is asked to refer to that aspect only in the recitals, whereas in my view Parliament must also be ready to engage in that dialogue.
We can no longer keep such taboos in our society.
We must move forward and tackle the difficult issues.
Religions and their rejection are a key factor in the process of social identification, integration and exclusion.
I would emphasise, with the support of my colleagues, the importance of this aspect of intercultural dialogue in the broader sense.
Finally, Mr President, we must not overlook the fact that concrete actions will undoubtedly be a way of stimulating attention.
Why not create a dialogue prize in Parliament, like the Sakharov prize for human rights?
Why not organise an intercultural forum in Parliament to round off the year, thereby giving Parliament the visibility it merits on these issues?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the importance she attached to our collaboration.
The European project derives its richness from the cultural diversity of its Member States.
Thus, intercultural dialogue is now, more than ever, a process to be encouraged.
The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will provide the opportunity.
To achieve this, I envisage a two-way communication.
European citizens must be able to gain access to the cultures of other European and non-European countries, particularly their neighbours.
In parallel there is a need to increase awareness among the rest of the world of the cultures and values of the Union, in order to foster mutual understanding.
Similarly, intercultural dialogue has to be a driving force for the social integration of immigrants.
As shadow rapporteur of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the European Year in 2007, I would emphasise the importance of cohesion and consistency in the actions to be undertaken in 2007 in support of universal equality of opportunity, and would also stress the importance of cohesion in the initiatives forming part of the 2008 cultural dialogue, as these two years complement one another.
I would also invite the Commission and the parties involved â in particular civil society, as the Commissioner has said â to take the opportunity of the major events planned for 2008, such as the football World Cup or the Olympic Games, to make the public, and especially the target group of young people, more aware of the importance of intercultural dialogue.
Â Â  .Mr President, the idea that 2008 should become the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue emerged in connection with the EUâs enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which have added cultural, linguistic and religious diversity to the Community.
This initiative is entirely appropriate to the challenges faced by Europe today, and it fully addresses the need for multi-level dialogue with a view to building mutual understanding based on respect and tolerance.
Unfortunately, this noble idea has not been backed up by an appropriate budget.
EUR 10 million divided by 27 countries, with no additional support from the Member States, will not pay for any high-profile or truly valuable cultural events.
We should, however, hope that with the appropriate use of other programmes intended to fund cultural actions, and by involving representatives of civil society, non-governmental and religious organisations, schools, universities and especially the media, we will be able to join forces to achieve the ambitious aims for 2008 despite the modest and nominal budget.
This would serve to make it a dialogue, rather than a money-saving cultural monologue.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur and draftsmen, because their work has highlighted all the aspects and possibilities of the Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
This initiative is directly interconnected with all the internal and external challenges of the European Union.
Indeed, maintaining and strengthening the multicultural aspect of Europe is a decisive factor for its integration.
At the same time, a dialogue of cultures and citizens from around the world â because it is the citizens who are the vehicle for the culture â is needed for peace and equilibrium.
The tradition of the European Union and our development goals are such that we need an open society of dialogue seeking common values with the citizens of other countries in our Member States in order to achieve mutual understanding, mutual respect and less discrimination.
On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to stress the importance of our working within this framework in order to combat the discrimination suffered by women and to encourage their participation in all activities and initiatives relating to intercultural dialogue.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my honourable colleague, MrsÂ Hennicot-Schoepges, for her outstanding work.
Without wishing to cause offence to the Commissioner, I would like to say that she has very much enlivened what was originally a rather administrative proposal.
But the Commissionâs proposals always do leave room for improvement.
The European Parliament is a democratic forum in which political debate relates to the lives, everyday existence and concerns of the people.
The geographical area of the European Union has not only seen the construction of cathedrals but was also the scene of the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as well as the birthplace of the rule of law and of the welfare state.
The EU has a common cultural heritage and respects cultural diversity.
That is why I wish to stress most emphatically that interreligious dialogue must be a major part of intercultural dialogue.
If we want to promote intercultural dialogue, as we should, but fail to mention interreligious dialogue, then we are betraying it.
We should see it not as a hindrance, but as a challenge, or even an opportunity to better our mutual understanding and to live together in harmony.
Given the current grappling with Islam, now is not the time for us to be ignorant of our roots, to deny and to disown them.
We have our backs to the wall in this respect.
We should speak confidently; only then can we enter into dialogue.
Education must also play an essential part in the action, on the European level as well as nationally and regionally.
Civic education and initiatives designed to promote understanding of others in their diversity are a contribution to constructive and effective dialogue.
Educational institutions in particular must play a role in this European Year.
The European Year of Intercultural Dialogue also presents the opportunity to distribute teaching and learning materials on the various cultures.
Intercultural dialogue is extremely important politically; it is, however, only meaningful once it includes interreligious dialogue and education.
Only then can it bear fruit, and only there lies the soul of such dialogue.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank MrsÂ Hennicot-Schoepges for her work on this report.
Tomorrow we will approve the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008), an initiative that will undoubtedly promote dialogue amongst all cultures and people of different origins residing in the European Union.
2008 will contribute to integration and cohesion within our societies, as well as peaceful governance throughout the international community.
The aim is to make it possible to turn this diversity into an opportunity for everybody.
The States and all competent levels of administration should promote educational policies based on values and respect for the diversity and equality of people, eradicating the prejudices that are often the cause of distrust and xenophobic attitudes.
A firm and responsible approach is therefore required, aimed at promoting knowledge, cooperation, respect and mutual understanding.
This dialogue, however, must be based on the conviction that culture is made up of a whole range of very diverse values and traditions â including religious traditions â and respect for all cultural sensitivities and all religious beliefs, and I believe that the latter are a private matter for each individual.
This programme is clearly directed towards the members of the European Union, but, as I have said, in view of its importance in terms of world governance, it should complement the only world-level project for promoting intercultural dialogue that exists within the framework of the United Nations: the Alliance of Civilisations.
As you know, it was an initiative of the Spanish Prime Minister, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero, and the Turkish Prime Minister, and it currently has the support of the United Nations as a whole.
I am convinced that, when this programme is applied, this complementarity will become clear, because in reality the two programmes must work together.
Â Â  . â The implementation of the programme for the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue will help to achieve the fundamental obligation of the European Union â to enable Member State cultures to flourish and highlight Europe's common cultural heritage.
As far as Lithuanian culture is concerned, I could give many examples which would interest every curious European.
I will mention just two â cross crafting and the song festival traditions of the Baltic States, both included in UNESCO's cultural heritage list.
This project is also important because of demographic changes in Europe.
As a result of emigration, we already have whole communities of Lithuanians in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain.
These communities are quite closed.
The cause â a lack of information and opportunities to become acquainted with the traditions and cultural differences of these countries.
I believe that every state must create conditions for residents to get to know the rich cultural heritage of the whole of Europe and common European values.
This experience is essential if we want to strengthen active and open European citizenship.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Hennicot-Schoepges, for her work and for the way in which she performed it, by holding a dialogue with several Members and considering the different points of view.
It has been a very good experience from which we have all benefited.
It is important to recognise cultural diversity in Europe â within each Member State, each society, each region and each nation â in order to achieve unity with diversity.
That is our European point of view.
We can only build European citizenship if we recognise this diversity and if everyone agrees on the same common project for Europe.
On religion and intercultural dialogue, we should understand that the recognition of religious values can only come through intercultural dialogue.
Cultural diversity includes religious diversity, which must therefore form part of that dialogue.
Â Â  . Mr President, intercultural dialogue is only possible when cultural diversity is defended and promoted, and when we regard European culture as the totality of its different cultures, different nations and different environments.
