The phenomenon that is migration is as old as mankind itself.
Since time immemorial, we have been searching for a place to call home, along with security and peace.
Certain individuals leave their homeland voluntarily but most men, women and children flee from violence, hunger, poverty and persecution.
Poverty is an overwhelming driving force.
We can build walls around Europe but these will not stop people who are seeking a better life far from home.
According to the United Nations, there are approximately 191Â million migrants worldwide.
Half of these are women.
Female migrants and refugees live with the enormous risk of becoming the victims of sexual exploitation and violence.
The correlations between migration and the slave trade in this regard must, above all, be examined from a gender perspective.
When calling for a guarantee fund for microprojects involving migrants, gender-specific projects must receive special attention.
I ask myself how we can be proud of a European Union where women who have fled their homelands on account of poverty and violence become the victims of discrimination and exploitation.
Migrants make an enormous contribution to the development of their homelands.
Every year, EUR 150Â billion are transferred via banks.
This is three times the development aid offered worldwide.
On top of this, a further EUR 300Â billion is received through other channels.
In this regard, I am particularly calling for more transparency and aid as regards financial transfers to the countries of origin.
In September, for the first time, the UN would like to deal with the theme of migration and development in the context of a high level dialogue.
Through its delegation, the European Parliament should demonstrate that this silent human rights crisis, as MrÂ KofiÂ Annan termed it, puts us to shame and that we want to stand up for a more just situation for migrants and refugees.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank MrsÂ Carlotti for the excellent cooperation between us when negotiating the amendments that are going to allow the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to back this report.
Nevertheless, we have been talking about this issue for a long time â the Commissioner has reminded us of the many times we have dealt with it â but very little has been achieved so far.
This is a clear example of the paralysis we are suffering from and illustrates the current situation of European politics in relation to one of our most serious problems.
The Council has not been able to reach a common position, and it does not appear that it is going to do so, while each Member State adopts unilateral measures, which are often contradictory, and then asks the Council for help, as if the Council had nothing to do with them.
The Commission says â as the Commissioner who is here today said a fortnight ago in Vienna â that it does what it can but that this is a competence of the Member States, and it is absolutely right.
Furthermore, it currently lacks an operational and sufficient budget; we are working with the extension of a budget that expired almost a year ago now.
Meanwhile, thousands of illegal immigrants are crossing our borders and in certain countries this happens on a daily basis.
There is no doubt that we can do many things, as MrsÂ Carlottiâs report indicates.
Money sent by immigrants triple â not double, as has been said â the total volume of official development aid throughout the world, but these investments do not represent an economically productive income in the countries of origin.
There is little, and sometimes no, application of the Cotonou Agreement in the majority of cases.
ArticleÂ 42 of the European Union Treaty would allow for the adoption of measures to combat people trafficking; after three years, the Commission also told us a fortnight ago in Vienna that it is assessing the issue and will make proposals in the future.
I could carry on giving examples, but those will suffice.
I believe that the time has come to act and leave statements of intent for later and for less serious issues.
Â Â  . â Mr President, migration is an international phenomenon.
Europe concerns itself with visas, with coastal surveillance, with customs policy, with combating people-trafficking, with labour market policy, and with integration: that, putting it in broad terms, is what Commissioner Frattini is doing with AENEAS.
We believe that the security arrangements, which are often anti-immigrant or intended to curtail immigration, must be paid for from their own independent budget, rather than by stealing from development funds.
Our concern today, then, is in fact with the other side of the coin â the development aspects of migration: migration from one part of the South to another, migration as a cause of under-development and instability.
The issues here are education, health care, and MrsÂ Carlottiâs practical and good proposals; the migrants who are driven from one country to another, those who are refugees within their own country, ECHO, the coordination of UNCHR, NGOs, regional organisations, preventing ethnic groups from being persecuted or isolated, whether this be in Asia, Latin America or Africa; uprooted populations, vulnerable groups, among them primarily women and children.
The Commissioner was right to say that these issues fit outstandingly well into development policy, being the typical things that official development aid is spent on, but all those things that have to do with migration policy, on the basis of Europeâs perfectly legitimate interest in it being well-managed and safe, certainly go further than official development aid and are not primarily aimed at dealing with poverty.
We must look after our own interests, but must not arrange our own affairs or pay for this at the cost of poor countries in unstable regions, for that affects the fundamental causes of poverty.
The intention of the Carlotti report is that the new geographical and thematic development instrument should address precisely these underlying causes.
From India to Bangladesh, from Bolivia to Ecuador, the new instrument can be the means whereby Europe can make a good contribution.
That is why it is relevant that, of the 17Â billions that we will be spending over the next six years, we are setting aside at least 50% for those celebrated Millennium Development Goals, while redoubling our efforts in favour of basic education and health care by bringing the amount allocated to them up to 20%.
As Bono would say: âPut your money where your mouth is; make poverty historyâ.
I think the Commissioner has no intention of doing anything else.
Â Â  . â Migration, especially economic migration, has a history of more than three centuries.
But today, the countries of the developed world are encouraging the migration of labour forces from developing countries.
We are trying to solve the problem of an ageing population and a shortage of labour in our own countries at the expense of third countries.
We hope to satisfy the anticipated demand for labour in the future not by fostering innovations more actively â one of the most important means of increasing work productivity, but through migration.
On the one hand, the European Union is supporting the growth of qualified labour forces in developing countries by implementing development policy and providing developing countries with over 55 per cent of world aid.
On the other hand however, it is striving to entice the best workers in order to solve its economic problems.
Very often, these workers acquired their qualifications in Europe or with European Union funds.
Thus, part of the EU funds set aside for development aid are used to finance the labour market of the EU itself.
Migrants support their families with money earned in the EU, but their contribution to the development of their countries of origin would be far greater if they worked and created wealth not abroad, but in their own countries.
Migration policy is not just an EU matter.
Agreements with third countries and the establishment of migration policy, above all in third countries, is one of the prerequisites of the economic growth of developing countries.
As well as migration policy, the priorities for developing countries themselves should be strategies for the establishment and expansion of their economy and the creation of jobs for their labour forces.
Meanwhile, the European Union must help implement those strategies, or else developing countries will forever be poor.
Â Â  . Mr President, I too would like to thank MrsÂ Carlotti for this report, which proposes many interesting initiatives, though, as the Commissioner has pointed out, there appears to be a lack of coherence amongst the different policies of the European Union.
During this part-session we have dealt with a number of reports on issues such as asylum, immigration and development which in some cases take us in contradictory directions.
We must acknowledge that today, in our countries, the prevailing tendency is towards securitarianism.
There is an excessive tendency to link immigration and security, and the policies adopted are essentially aimed at sending immigrants back to their countries of origin, particularly illegal immigrants.
The impression is that people only show any real interest in immigrants when they want to go home: this effectively means not recognising the freedom of those people who wish to settle and live in a country other than the one from which they originate.
As you know, subsidiarity is also very important in this field, and the Member States implement policies which are their own and which vary from country to country.
In France, the government's current policy is aimed at expulsion and at sending illegal immigrants home; just today, in front of the European Parliament, there is a demonstration in support of school children threatened with expulsion.
This kind of policy has not been adopted in Spain or other places, and in some countries, how to react to illegal immigration is being considered.
Subsidiarity is therefore much too important in this field.
While co-development seems an interesting idea, I do not believe that it can replace the necessary European Union public policies, which are extremely strong, in the field of promoting the rule of law and democracy.
Going beyond any difficulties we may face, that is the aim of the Unionâs actions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which places the emphasis on public policies in the fields of health, education and the environment, but this has regrettably been jeopardised over recent years by other policies on the part of the Union and the Member States, particularly in the economic and commercial fields.
We therefore need coherence and a global approach, so that we can link immigration to sustainable development issues and not treat it as simply a security issue.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two points of view are always wrestled with as regards the topic of migration.
On the one hand, the libertarian perspective, which focuses on human rights and the Millennium Development Goals; on the other, the point of view adopted by Interior Ministers, who instead view an external threat, predominates.
In view of the growing and current dramas associated with migration, the EU debate is dominated, unfortunately, by Commissioner Frattini and the Ministers for the Interior.
Border protection facilities and intervention teams form part of this picture.
Yet your very fine report, MrsÂ Carlotti, analyses the causes and status of migration in the 21st century in much greater depth and also proposes a whole raft of very sensible measures which I am unable to reflect on here in the two minutes I have available, however.
Your call for controlled migration should not mean though that in future, for instance, the EU turns Lampedusa into Ellis Island or perhaps something even more terrible, namely that there are combined EU refugee and recruitment camps in the Libyan desert and which also therefore operate outside EU legal standards.
Naturally, I also regret the lack of proposals for resolving the situation of migrants who live outside official legal status in the EU.
The crux of the entire migration policy remains the growing economic and social disparity between the European Union and those regions of Africa that are becoming impoverished, and the EU is itself contributing to this impoverishment with its aim of competing for leadership in the global economy.
Please take the fair trade report to be debated here later in Parliament seriously if you wish to reduce migration out of economic necessity.
Combat the contribution Europe is making to the migration of war refugees through its arms exports and reduce the emissions output of Europe and its trading partners if your desire is to reduce migration which is primarily the result of climate change and the spread of deserts.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party.
I am grateful to the Commission and to the rapporteur for having addressed this issue.
The strategies proposed, which are primarily designed to facilitate financial transactions and the transfer of pension rights, constitute two measures that are feasible in practice and that would have a significant impact on the precarious resources of many immigrants.
However, the proposal to channel the income generated into measures designed to promote development in the country of origin also seems extremely important and reasonable to me.
If it is true, as the report claims, that better management of migration promotes development, then it is in fact also true that we should ensure that the most competent human resources do at any rate find attractive opportunities in their countries of origin and are encouraged to take the resources they have accumulated, together with their wealth of experience, back to those countries, for the benefit of their communities.
I am referring in particular to doctors, professionals, teachers and researchers.
It is in fact rather idealistic in this day and age to believe that, after years of studying and working in Europe, a citizen of a third country might spontaneously decide to return to a country lacking in adequate social structures and systems.
With this in mind, we therefore need to pay extremely close attention to the management of any funds that may be generated, so that the efforts of individuals and of the international community are not wasted.
Â Â  Mr President, as well as thanking MrsÂ Carlotti for her thorough work, I would like to draw your attention to three points.
Globalisation also involves people breaking down barriers in their search for normal living conditions.
However, differences in levels of economic development and political models impede the free movement of people.
If, within the framework of the WTO, we cannot agree to the free movement of goods, it seems that agreeing to the free movement of people is an even more difficult task, although these two issues are worlds apart.
Although we lack such an agreement, people do migrate, in particular to richer countries.
The European Union, as a destination for migrants, will be increasingly obliged to draw up solutions to this issue.
Currently, we face the problem of Malta. Another problematic issue is the phenomenon of selective immigration, which mainly benefits rich countries.
We are talking about the brain drain, which is immoral with respect to poor countries.
We need a good policy to prevent the situation deteriorating in places such as Africa due to the exodus of educated people, and we need instead to help these countries to develop.
Examples of such a policy are reintegration projects, which I had the pleasure of discussing with Commissioner Luis Michel.
As we already have immigrants in the European Union, in countries such as Scotland, which are already an attractive destination for Poles and Slovaks and are likely to become all the more attractive for citizens of countries such as Togo or Jamaica, we have to create an educational, social and legal programme to integrate immigrants as rapidly as possible into their host countries.
The immigrants have indeed adapted.
The period of integration is both a psychological factor and an economic one.
The shorter and more sensible this period is, the better the outcome will be for both sides: for the immigrants and for the hosts.
As a result of these actions, we will be able to avoid the phenomenon of âbrain wasteâ, namely a loss of skills.
Finally, I would just like to add that the problem of mainly economic immigration does not only affect France, Sweden or Malta.
It is a common, serious problem facing the 25 Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my friend and colleague MrsÂ Carlotti for the work she has done, above all because I believe that it brings development policy to the fore within the Union's foreign policy when we are dealing with the phenomenon of migration too.
There is no question that in the future we will not so much have to slow down migration, but rather regulate it, so that todayâs movements of people benefit countries of origin, transit and destination, as they have always done.
The States know that their objective and interests can be better served if there is cooperation and if their actions are coordinated.
The Euro-African Summit on migration will take place next week in Rabat.
Development cooperation is a priority on its agenda.
We would ask that this opportunity be taken to establish concrete measures aimed at the development of African countries and we call upon the Union to make a decisive commitment to democracy, peace and security in the countries of origin of migration, leaving behind the all-too-frequent approach
Perhaps what we should do is promote education, which always brings freedom and development.
We must improve and increase the Unionâs presence at political and institutional levels.
The right to development is multi-faceted however and it means economic exchange, cultural exchange, conflict management, combating terrorism, environmental protection and policies to promote gender equality.
There is no doubt that migration brings benefits, but the benefits of international migration, not just for migrants but also for the societies receiving them, will only be possible if we maintain respect for the rights of workers, which are the universal guarantee against exploitation.
The rights of all workers must be protected, whether they be legal or not.
The measures we provide for must fully respect the rights of people coming to our borders, including the right to asylum.
In this regard, the European Union must ensure that asylum seekers are not denied the international protection they require.
As we all know, Mr President, migration and movements of people cannot be stopped.
Let us guarantee respect for the rights of migrants.
Â Â  Mr President, the fact that the European Parliament is discussing development in relation to the question of migration shows that we are open to the problems of developing countries.
We want migration to become a part of the development process.
Unfortunately, at the moment, this is merely a pious desire.
If this desire is to become a reality, certain conditions must be fulfilled.
I will mention two of them.
Firstly, migration needs to become cyclical in order to avoid the âbrain drainâ phenomenon as much as possible.
Secondly, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers needs to be ratified by all Member States.
Finally, the issue of migration and development significantly affects relations between the European Union and the ACP countries.
That is why the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of which I am a member, must seriously investigate this matter.
To end my speech, I would like to extend my warm thanks and congratulations to my colleague MrsÂ Carlotti.
Â Â  â The Carlotti report is a step in the right direction.
Development aid is necessary, but is not in itself sufficient.
New instruments and measures have been proposed that will enhance the lives of immigrants and their relationship with their countries of origin.
This is a fair, intelligent approach, which replaces the current policy focused on border controls with a two-way migratory flow strategy.
Fortress Europe has been condemned, with its inevitable cost of death in the Mediterranean.
All that is lacking now is commitment, and a clear position on detention centres, which are unacceptable.
The rapporteur also recognises that on one side of an invisible border are the citizens and on the other people with no papers who are forced into resorting to illegal methods.
What is the upshot of this?
Immigrants without papers?
No.
Temporary authorisations for seeking work?
Yes.
This is where the principle of citizenship takes us.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, even while this report was being considered in the Committee on Development Cooperation, I realised what the main thing was about it that I found disappointing.
I find the same thing here in this debate in this Chamber.
Nowhere, it appears, is anyone stopping to consider the inevitable social consequences of migration for the countries of the EU, which are already wrestling with the problems presented by the formation of ghettos, criminality, rootlessness and Islamism.
After what happened in the French suburbs last autumn, I would have expected some reflection on this from a French rapporteur in particular.
We must not, in this debate, point an accusing finger at the people who flee their countries of origin in search of a better life.
They are doing only what anyone would do, but Michel Rocard, incidentally the former chairman of this Houseâs Committee on Development Cooperation, and a member of the same party as the rapporteur, got the measure of the situation when he, as the Socialist Prime Minister of France, said that âFrance cannot take upon herself all the miseries of the worldâ â and nor, for that matter, can Europe do so.
It is, moreover, primarily the weakest people in the countries of origin in Africa, the ones who do not have the means or the clout to get themselves out, who are the victims of the immigration flows, the victims of open borders, for they are left behind, poorer than ever.
Such ideas as the mobility of brainpower and circular migration may be appealing, but they are unrealistic and do nothing to change the situation.
More immigration into our own countries, then, means more misery in the developing world, contrary to what the report suggests.
What Europe needs is for immigration to be stopped outright; what the developing countries need is effective aid on the ground.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, in these works by plenary, we have in particular debated issues relating to migration.
We have referred to numerous dimensions and aspects which relate mainly to the management of migration flows at our borders and within the Member States.
The report by MrsÂ Carlotti gives us a new and very important dimension and I thank her for that.
It is the dimension, it is the relationship between migration and development, the relationship between the European Union and the developing world countries which are mainly countries of origin of immigrants and political refugees.
Our external action at Community and national level gives us many opportunities to create conditions of sustainable development in countries and communities which suffer from absolute poverty, to create jobs, democratic institutions and structures and protection for human and social rights.
These conditions will give hope to the local populace and prospects for a better life at home.
The regional funds, European cooperation, stability agreements, our development action within the framework of the United Nations, the good neighbourhood policy and everything else already referred to are exceptional tools, but they are tools we must make better use of, with better coordination and serious and proper evaluation of our policies and our objectives, both by our central services and our representations, which have enhanced, decentralised responsibilities and better knowledge of local needs.
We also need to achieve better cooperation with local factors at all levels.
In addition, Commissioner, at the level of transparency and terms of good governance, our control mechanisms must put before their responsibilities both national and local administrators in beneficiary countries.
On behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to stress the importance of adding the gender dimension to all our policies, because women are the most serious victims of all forms of discrimination in developing countries and the first victims of illegal immigration when they arrive in our communities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to congratulate MrsÂ Carlotti on her excellent work.
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I was very pleased to see that the majority of our proposals have been incorporated into the final text, in particular the protection of migrant women against discrimination and violence, and improving their access to health services, to education and to employment, as well as the need to pay special attention to the children of these female migrants, and the situation of women displaced as a result of conflicts.
My only regret is that one of my proposals aimed at allowing migrant women in illegal situations access to health care and to legal and psychological support has not been included.
These women in illegal situations represent a particularly vulnerable category whose fundamental rights must be protected, just like those of people with legal status.
I hope that this point can be dealt with within the context of the report by MrsÂ Kratsa, which is specifically dedicated to the situation of migrant women.
Â Â  Mr President, MrsÂ Carlotti, Commissioner.
Migration, especially illegal migration, has until now been a problem of colonial or mother countries, leading to the introduction of strict visa requirements and making necessary laws on migration and international discussion of the topic.
The complexity of the problem is vividly demonstrated by the present situation, in which 60Â 000 people are waiting on the northern coast of Africa for the opportunity to come to Spain.
In connection with globalisation, the issue of migration will likely also reach the new Member States.
Mr President, Europe has a moral obligation to help at least a few migrants reach the countries of the developed world so that they may break out of their current conditions and find a decent life, enabling them to acquire an education and profession and later return to their country of origin, thereby bringing about circular migration.
In order to implement the above-mentioned suggestions, it will be necessary to update and reform the immigration policy of the Member States of the European Union.
The channelling of legal immigration will require long-term cooperation between countries of origin and target countries, but the latter proposal will demand increased funding.
Thus, Mr President, it is not impossible that we will soon have to speak of the European Unionâs common migration policy, so as not to find ourselves in the same complicated position we face today in connection with the European Unionâs common energy policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report and for the clear conclusions drawn in it.
These include the admission that the European Union has still not found a common, cohesive solution to the issue of immigration.
It is a worthy challenge on a large scale: 3% of the worldâs population, namely 175Â million people, are migrants, and 40% of these people live in developing countries.
The European Union is sometimes criticised for earmarking too few resources for the integration of immigrants and refugees.
Over the last seven years, EUR 15Â million has been spent.
This amounts to half a euro per immigrant.
However, it also seems that using these resources efficiently is no less of a problem.
We have seen many worrying signs of this and we hear reports of wastefulness and corruption in the distribution of funds.
Aid for immigrants has a moral and also a political dimension, as we need to work out a new, transparent European Union policy in this field.
The fact is that, over the last 10 years, the European Unionâs migration policy has been rather more restrictive than it was before.
Let us also not fool ourselves into thinking that this policy will become less restrictive in the coming years.
The opposite is more likely to be the case.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, around the world there are currently almost 10Â million refugees and 25Â million people displaced within their countries, mainly in the countries of the South.
Given that I was once a refugee myself and passed through the refugee system â a refugee camp â I should like to devote this speech to the situation of migrants in refugee and transit areas.
There is no doubt in my mind that the living conditions of migrants in host and transit countries, especially in the Sahel countries, must be improved.
The time has come to build a variety of information centres, foreign aid centres and legal aid centres.
Programmes aimed at preventing and treating various diseases including sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS should be put forward.
The most vulnerable sections of society, including women and children, should be the main focus of assistance.
I would therefore urge the Commission to develop an integrated strategy aimed at supporting host and transit countries.
The capacity of these southern countries needs to be bolstered and the right of such countries to pursue their own independent migration policy should be respected.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to highlight the incompleteness of the report, which talks about immigrantsâ rights without, however, referring to their obligations.
It also says nothing whatsoever about the danger that certain forms of extreme religious beliefs bring to our Europe.
I cannot overlook the fact that people have been murdered â the last of whom being Theo Van Gogh â and that, due to certain attitudes of immigrants, our freedom has been significantly restricted, so much so that it has become downright dangerous or impossible to wear a satirical t-shirt like the one that I have with me here.
No reference is made to this issue in the report.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly thanking MrsÂ Carlotti for her excellent work, the approach of which I support fully.
In the South, migration too often means the departure of the best-trained citizens, a real haemorrhage of skills, depriving those countries of revenue and jeopardising the provision and quality of essential services, which are crucial to their true development.
Let us make no mistake: this brain drain is encouraged by the policies of selective admission of migrants implemented in the North, under the name âselective migrationâ or âselective immigrationâ.
Selective immigration in the North always means immigration suffered in the South, a policy which effectively deprives the South of any right to development.
In opposition to this approach which has such harmful results, the general philosophy and the concrete measures proposed in this report, such as circular immigration as an alternative to the brain drain, the âcirculationâ of brains, seem to me to be interesting.
We have here the notion of shared immigration, of each party enriching the other.
We are talking about promoting co-development, of enshrining it in European texts, without forgetting the funding it requires, of thereby recognising and supporting the role of migrants in the development of their countries of origin. The true intention would be to turn immigration into a lever for development and for mutual aid amongst peoples.
I hope that this essential solidarity will dominate the discussions at the forthcoming Euro-African Conference in Rabat.
We are all aware of the history of walls being erected in the illusion that they will protect people from each other. They are always destined to be breached and ultimately destroyed.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating MrsÂ Carlotti on her report, because it really has come at the right time, in view of the fact that the UN General Assembly is due to meet in September and will examine the relationship between migration and development.
I believe that the time has now come from us to move from words and wishes to deeds.
We all talk about achieving the Millennium Development Goals, but nowhere is there any express reference to the problem of migration.
I believe that the UN assembly in September will be a good opportunity to explicitly link development objectives to migration and, more importantly, for the response to this global problem to be a quantifiable objective within the framework of a specific timetable.
The European Union must speed up the incorporation of migration into all external actions and foreign policy and, more importantly, we must examine ways of incorporating it into the new strategy for development cooperation, the new European neighbourhood strategy.
I believe that the Euro-African summit will be an opportunity to discuss all these problems, but what we need above all is an integrated and cohesive European Union strategy.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and to draw attention to one aspect of development and migration that increases the wealth and intellectual potential of already prosperous states and bleeds developing countries dry.
I am talking about the brain drain.
Development policies will not yield results unless this process at least slows down.
At the moment the EU offers help to developing countries with one hand, which is visible, and takes it away with the other, which is invisible.
First, I suggest we tidy things up at home in the European Union, where we are seeing a similar brain drain from the new to the old countries.
The process is even more painful, since internal borders and barriers are diminishing and disappearing.
The EU must create a special fund to regulate the brain drain and soften its impact.
After sorting out the situation at home, we could use that as a basis for cooperation with the developing countries and with the USA, which profits greatly from the brain drain.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally agree with the thrust of what has been said.
In the short time available to me, I should like to mention a few points that will help me to set out my position clearly on a number of issues and proposals.
I should first like to reassure MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Burg regarding his extremely important question on the need to make a clear distinction between security-related and development-related spending.
It is obviously not a matter of using development resources to finance security measures. The development budget should not be funding these measures.
From this point of view, you can be reassured by the Commission.
The second point that I consider important is the old chestnut of the âbrain drainâ.
As Commissioner for development, I should like there to be no doubt as to my commitment on this issue.
I am opposed to the policies of some Member States, which actually call for, and tempt people with, selective immigration.
In my view, selective immigration is a cynical concept of development and I do not accept it.
In this regard, I am suspicious of suggestions and ideas revolving around the notion of the âgreen cardâ.
I feel it is very dangerous to play with ideas that clearly tie in with âselective immigrationâ.
I do not like this approach and I feel it is right to make this point clearly.
I must say, MrsÂ Aubert, that I warmly welcome your call for investment in public policies.
You speak of the EUâs public policies, but one should really focus principally on the public policies of the partner states and of developing countries.
This is one of my obsessions because it forms the very foundations of reconstruction and development.
It is extremely difficult to encourage citizens from developing countries who live without prospects, who feel that they have no prospects, who live without access to the basic services that any normal society should provide, to stay at home and contribute to their countries.
In other words, everything that revolves around the statesâ ability to guarantee basic services â namely access to education, health, administration, justice, culture, basic goods â should form a central part of our development strategies. There is no doubt in my mind that therein lie the ultimate answers to the phenomenon of immigration.
The essential functions of the State, so dear to those like me who believe in the primacy of the secular nature of States, must be developed.
This is something I consider important.
I should like to commend all of the speakers without mentioning all of them by name. I agree entirely with MrÂ Kulakowski, who placed the accent on extremely close ties between migration and development.
The proper response to migration is development, purely and simply.
The answer is not to close the borders, to send people back or âselective immigrationâ. The proper response lies in development projects aimed at strengthening, improving or rebuilding the countries concerned.
In a number of developing countries, one can say that there is no longer a State and I would urge the EU, our institutions and the ACP countries particularly affected to come together around the negotiating table.
Lastly, I should like to say to MrÂ Dillen that he has quoted MrÂ Rocard totally out of context. Of course Europe cannot absorb all of the worldâs misery.
I should like to tell him, however, that the wealthy world could do so comfortably, so there is no excuse.
That, MrÂ Dillen, is simply a matter of political will.
I know that in this area you have none.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0207/2006) by MrÂ FrithjofÂ Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on fair trade and development (2005/2245(INI)).
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by means of the report on fair trade and development, we, as Parliament, are reacting to the remarkable economic and political success story which is fair trade.
In recent years, growth rates in fair trade within Europe have risen, on average, by 20%, with the trend upwards.
In individual countries, we have market shares of up to 20%, as is the case with coffee in Great Britain.
This all serves to demonstrate the success of a civil society initiative under market conditions which, hitherto, has got by without significant state support and funding. At the same time, this is also directly successful in combating poverty since fair prices guarantee a fair income.
It is also fairly crucial as regards social development in the southern states that producers in these countries receive a fair income.
At the same time, the entire matter demonstrates the high level of awareness on the part of European consumers and their interest in social responsibility in relation to trade internationally speaking as well as high product quality.
This topic also therefore concerns the protection of consumer interests.
Fair prices, fair working and production conditions, adherence to ecological standards; all of these things are of equal benefit to the quality of life of producers in the south and consumers in the north.
There was also broad agreement in the Committee on Development, something I am very pleased about.
At this point therefore, I would like to extend my express thanks to all my colleagues in the Committee on Development, the shadow rapporteurs, and the coordinators, for their constructive advice.
The report was adopted unanimously in committee.
This was preceded by intensive exchanges between the Fair Trade Movement and numerous associations on the problems of fair trade.
In committee, we jointly drew up and put forward criteria which have to be met by products designated âfair tradeâ so as not to deceive consumers.
This report therefore calls on the Commission to present a recommendation relating to fair trade. This involves the promotion of a political and economic concept and not, for instance, the promotion of a trade name, nor does it involve a legally binding, detailed regulation or a Fair Trade Act for the whole of Europe.
It is not, nor should it be, our intention to over regulate and, hence, possibly impede this successful, burgeoning market.
However, it does involve defining criteria which make up the substance of the concept of âfair tradeâ.
Key criteria that have been put forward to this end in the report include, , producer prices which guarantee their existence, informing consumers about the prices maintained by producers, that is, transparency, observance of the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation regarding health and safety at work and child labour in relation to production, the observance of environmental standards, supporting production and market access by producer organisations and monitoring compliance with these criteria.
It would be important for these points to be included in the Commissionâs recommendation.
At this point, I would also expressly like to thank the Commission.
Especially in the Directorate General for Development and the Directorate General for Trade, openness to and, I might add, also a liking for this report, was clear to see.
We had highly constructive exchanges.
One more personal observation: Commissioner Mandelson, I know that you love chocolate and I have often seen how you prefer fair trade chocolate from Oxfam.
These are two predilections we both share.
I am therefore already aware through your consumer habits that you take an open view of this topic.
I would again like to make a particular appeal to you.
In the âaid for tradeâ programme, which is now being discussed at the WTO, create an âaid for fair trade sector.â
If we were only able to use 10% of the funds in this area for the fair trade sector, that would provide enormous impetus for this fine concept.
Help us by giving preferential treatment to fair trade products in public invitations to tender, and breathe fresh life into ArticleÂ 23 of the Cotonou Agreement, whereby fair trade in collaboration with ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States is to be accorded important status and supported.
The European Union needs a well-coordinated fair trade policy.
Parliament will today, I hope, take an important step in this direction and it is then up to the Commission to take a further important step.
We need this recommendation, Commissioner Mandelson.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like straightaway to thank MrÂ Schmidt for this report and for drawing attention to my increasingly conspicuous consumption habits, which, I am afraid, are becoming only too obvious as I grow into this job as Europeâs Trade Commissioner.
Sincerely and warmly I would like to thank him for this report, which I think is very valuable and will be well received.
Fair Trade is one of the key tools, in my view, to enhance sustainable development and to equip us better to fight poverty in the world, and as a concept it is developing fast.
It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice.
It is gaining in currency and appeal with public opinion, and helps to raise public awareness about all the issues that are involved in sustainability.
You are not just undertaking an act of consumption that is good in terms of the content of what you consume.
It is also a stimulus to the brain.
It makes you think and therefore it is even more valuable.
Consumers do take into account considerations about the conditions of production.
People care, they do not just eat, and Fair Trade has pioneered this in a most attractive way.
The Commission actively supports Fair Trade.
We took on commitments to Fair Trade in the Cotonou Agreement with the ACP countries, as well as in our communication on policy coherence for development.
Many trade and development assistance projects support Fair Trade: development projects to the tune of over EUR 4 million in 2003, and growing.
These consist mainly of support for NGO activities, but also of direct aid to the harmonisation of standards at work.
We also participate in Fair Trade events.
One could argue that whilst Fair Trade helps salve the conscience of those who buy such products, others continue, nonetheless, to exploit the needy.
I am not happy about that argument: Fair Trade is not a panacea for all the problems of poor producers, nor does it necessarily mean that because you are not buying and consuming Fair Trade products you are exploiting the poor.
What is required to tackle poverty and to enhance development is a general and coherent policy framework.
It is this that we need to develop, to conceptualise, and this report will help us to do so.
Fair Trade is private and limited to the participating producers, while the UN Millennium Development Goals are for all.
So Fair Trade is particular and specific, the Millennium Development Goals are general and wide-ranging; but there is a clear interconnection between the two.
The objective is different for an individual and for EU policy-making.
An individual makes a personal choice.
He or she is entitled to exercise that choice.
You cannot automatically translate that into a more wide-ranging policy.
The individual consumer looks at one packet of coffee, rightly.
Policy-makers, on the other hand, have to take into account the sector as a whole and our obligations to that sector as a whole.
We need a complete and public solution â one that should not be confined, therefore, to Fair Trade only.
As the report rightly points out, there are other non-Fair Trade operators that can achieve similar results to those obtained by Fair Traders, that have the same growth potential and that can influence consumer choice and the international trading schemes.
We should fully use the potential of all credible initiatives to support sustainability.
That should be our test.
Does it help, does it aid, does it take forward sustainability?
If it does, that should govern our response and attitude to it.
Building on commitments taken previously, we want to explore with our partners the use of economic partnership agreements with the ACP countries, as well as other trade agreements, for including specific incentives targeted at improving market access for fair trade products.
That is where I believe we can leverage our interest and leverage our commitment most beneficially.
It is very useful, therefore, that the report points to the danger of inappropriate national legislation in the field of Fair Trade.
I am aware of some initiatives being taken that might harm the status that Fair Trade has already achieved.
We need to be vigilant about these and to see, therefore, whether it is not better to take a more coherent and collective approach in order to leverage the greatest benefits for Fair Trade.
Conversely, too firm an adhesion to the particular approach embodied in Fair Trade would be at risk of being discriminatory against other systems, some of them acknowledged in your report, which have similar claims and that we can and should support.
You are right about the need to protect consumers, the question is how.
I believe the role of policy is to ensure that messages given to consumers are accurate and transparent, and I am glad that this is also stressed in the report.
We already have protection against misleading claims, but we might consider going further and help engage the consumer actively in the ethics of production.
I believe that there is scope for better information about claims schemes in general, and work is in progress on this.
I will ask my services to look at how sustainability is enhanced by different certification and assurance schemes, including Fair Trade.
We will look at all the suggestions made in this report and of course keep Parliament informed of further developments.
We need a dialogue with Parliament on a continuing basis.
I am glad, therefore, that this report provides the framework, both for this dialogue and for the way in which we can, should and will take our commitment in this area further forward.
In conclusion I would like to thank the rapporteur again for the quality of this report.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrÂ FrithjofÂ Schmidt, who dealt with the problem in a very objective-oriented manner and successfully put it to the vote.
Although the topic has been dealt with by the Commission and Parliament on numerous occasions, there is always the need for further action so that fair trade can continue to develop efficiently and successfully.
What is important here is that central standards and criteria are introduced on which basis the market should develop.
However, as far as this fledgling sector is concerned, consideration must constantly be given to the fact that precipitous directives always involve the risk of schematic harmonisation and over regulation.
With a figure of 60-70% of total sales, Europe is the largest sales market for fair trade products and offers, based on my assessment, further opportunities for growth.
In this regard, it is a matter of particular concern for me that municipalities, towns and cities, and other regional administrative bodies are reminded time and again and asked to consider fair trade products in their invitations to tender as well as use them at various events and suchlike.
Given the meagre production diversity in fair trade products, the customer is often unsure whether the product designated as such is actually a fair trade product in the first place.
The bigger this market, the greater the uncertainty.
Therefore, we may have to consider a European fair trade logo in future.
For the producers of fair trade products, I am calling for price structuring which ensures their existence, fair production conditions and adherence to environmental standards in the context of sustainable development.
Fair trade must be inseparably linked to key labour standards.
Now that we have succeeded in creating positive framework conditions for developing and promoting fair trade, as Europeans, we are able to assume a very important role as a pacesetter in this sphere.
Â Â  . Madam President, I would like to congratulate and thank MrÂ Schmidt for this report and for his interesting speech about Fair Trade.
Fair Trade can make a positive contribution to the development of poor countries by ensuring better conditions for producers and their families, as well as ensuring better access to world markets and promoting sustainable development.
I would like to draw your attention to a number of points in the text which are problematic due to the substance of the report.
First of all, in my opinion, the report sometimes confuses the idea of Fair Trade (written in capitals) with fair trade in the general sense.
The text will be the first in the history of European lawmaking to deal with the Fair Trade sector, or in other words with Fair Trade written in capitals, in the form of a report on goods labelled with the Fair Trade logo and marketed as such.
The subject of the report should have been the labelling of products so that the guiding principles of Fair Trade would not be distorted at the cost of consumers who want to buy Fair Trade products.
The report concerns the Fair Trade sector.
However, and I would like to emphasise this, the report being debated here is not a report on fair trade in sense of making international trade fairer.
It is clear that fair trade (written using lower case letters) is something different.
It is an attempt to make all trade fairer and this subject has been touched upon in many other European Parliament resolutions and reports.
That is why, in my opinion, referring to the Cotonou Agreement in this context is inappropriate, as this Agreement deals with fair trade written in lower case letters and not capital letters.
I also think that the issue of stabilising prices is a dubious subject and comments related to it will not help us to assess the report as a whole.
Â Â  . Madam President, last night I was driven home by a Ghanaian taxi driver.
I believe he was one of the few working, because of the World Cup excitement.
I asked him whether he liked living in France.
He said it was OK, but he missed Ghana.
Here in France, three of his children were able to go to university, something that was impossible to imagine in Ghana.
I was in Ghana last year. What the taxi driver said confirmed what I had seen there.
I went to northern Ghana to meet tomato and rice farmers.
They were unable to make a living wage and therefore unable to send their children to school or to have any access to medical care.
At the same time, on the markets in northern Ghana, there was US-subsidised rice and EU-processed tomato products, cheaper than the local produce.
On the same trip, we visited Fair Trade cocoa farmers in central Ghana.
They were certainly not rich people but they had a sustainable price, they had a long-term contract for their product.
Therefore they were able to access medical care, there was a school for their children, and the Fair Trade premium meant that there was investment in water in their local villages.
I saw the same differences between Fair Trade farmers and non-Fair Trade farmers in the Windward Islands, on the banana farms.
We want fair prices for farmers in all developing countries.
We hope that the WTO will deliver a more just system, but in the meantime we need Fair Trade, with a capital âFâ and a capital âTâ.
I am pleased to hear that the Commission will support that.
On the issue of other labels, yes, other ethical labels are being developed.
Some of them are very good, but we have to be careful here.
We cannot have Fair Trade on the cheap.
As the market gets bigger, there is a temptation for more and more players to want an ethical label, but they do not want to pay the real price.
So we have to watch who we support and make sure the labels really are ethical.
Fair Trade is about price and sustainability.
It is about the Millennium Development Goal of tackling poverty.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, on raising the standard and with it our ambitions.
I am sure we shall all benefit greatly from following his recommendations.
I also welcome the views as expressed by the Commission.
I am sure that our partnership approach will deliver much good.
It is of particular importance, because today much of our food and drink comes from the developing world, where farmers and workers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a decent living.
In our global marketplace, the use of internationally recognised labels or marks, which conscientious consumers can have confidence in, is a logical and significant contribution to economic and social improvements across the globe.
Through the use of clear labelling, individuals are beginning to realise that they are able to play their part in tackling the problem of international poverty.
The simple decision to buy products with a Fair Trade mark can have a huge impact, guaranteeing that growers and workers benefit from fairer wages and better working conditions, and can make a crucial different to their ability to provide for the basic needs of their families.
In the last five years, the United Kingdom has proved to have the most dynamic Fair Trade structures of all the EU Member States and is the fastest growing Fair Trade market in the world.
A staggering 87% of the UK population would rather buy from companies that do something positive for the community.
When asked which products fall into this category, 27% specifically noted Fair Trade products.
This figure could and should be much higher and it is the duty of all responsible Members of this House to raise awareness of this necessary project.
In my own north-west constituency, we are determined to promote equality and sustainable development wherever possible.
Garstang in Lancashire was the first town to achieve Fair Trade status in 2001.
Thirteen north-west towns, including industrial powerhouses such as Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool, have all followed.
Kendal was the first Fair Trade borough and now Lancashire Council has pledged to become the first Fair Trade county.
As well as in the European Parliament, Fair Trade products are available in many Council buildings, tea and coffee served at meetings is Fair Trade and awareness days have been held to inform staff about the benefits of Fair Trade.
Â Â  . â At a time when the World Trade Organisation negotiations have hit yet another deadlock, it is good to see this Chamber debating a report on fair trade.
We know that this is still a drop in the ocean in terms of the global economy and that one million rural workers benefit from it today.
This may sound like a large number, but it is actually not very many at all.
The EU must therefore make a commitment to fair trade, if only to appease the conscience of a common agricultural policy that spreads hunger and poverty in the countries of the South.
Fair trade could be a feather in your cap, Commissioner.
Other people, farmers, trade networks and demanding consumers could breathe new life into it.
MrÂ Schmidt has put forward some good proposals, especially reducing VAT and the end of import duties, but the positive aspect of the report lies elsewhere; it shows the way forward and a principle of hope.
With fair trade, the world could be a better place.
Â Â  . Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report, one that is long overdue.
Fair Trade is about paying poor producers a fair price and helping them gain the necessary skills and knowledge to develop their business and work their way out of poverty.
I agree with the Commissioner.
It is not the sole answer, but it is part of a solution.
Shoppers who choose produce with the Fair Trade mark play a vital role in alleviating poverty and supporting marginalised producers in a manner that promotes dignity and self-sufficiency.
New figures released today reveal that global sales of Fair Trade certified products reached 1.1 billion in 2005.
That represents an increase of 37% over 2004.
The message is obvious: consumers are happy to support Fair Trade.
To generate greater sales of Fair Trade terms for the benefit of more marginalised producers, it is important to involve commercial manufacturers and to encourage Fair Trade supply to supermarkets, where most people do their shopping.
Fair Tradeâs significant worldwide growth in 2005 also shows that more and more producers, traders and suppliers trust the Fair Trade certificate mark and like to join the system.
However, the challenge ahead will be to make sure that the standards in that certification are maintained.
I recently visited Guatemala with Trocaire, an Irish NGO.
During our visit we visited the Claremont coffee estate, where 50 families who have lived and worked on that estate for three generations, living in what can only be described as feudal conditions, were thrown off their farm because the owner, who happens to be the sister-in-law of the countryâs president, decided that she did not want them on the estate and wanted to change what they were doing.
They are a group of people who want to start a co-op to produce Fair Trade coffee.
They know how to produce coffee; as I said, they have been doing it for generations.
I just want it put on record that I have raised the plight of these people in Guatemala in this House, because I think it is an absolute outrage that people can be treated like that in this day and age.
Fair Trade is not just about selling and buying, it is about creating justice for people globally.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, I am in favour of Fair Trade.
For me, it means free trade, trade without customs and quotas in an environment where free enterprising spirit and the right to property are respected.
In parts, this report has a different perspective to mine, and in places it seems almost to strive for the opposite.
The report mixes up two different kinds of Fair Trade.
When companies and organisations themselves define what they think is fair and then offer the consumer products produced according to the criteria thus defined, this is a demonstration of consumer power, which is a very good thing.
The other kind of Fair Trade is when politicians involve themselves in a voluntary business relationship and lay down conditions and prices that they deem to be fair so that they can then call this Fair Trade.
For me, this is socialism and something very bad.
The report proposes providing companiesâ Fair Trade with a legal basis of its own and setting political goals and criteria.
This is to take consumer power, which is so important, and turn it into some sort of socialist planned economy.
It amazes me that so many MEPs think this is desirable.
Despite the fact that Fair Trade labelling is an expression of consumer power and something very positive, I would still like to conclude by calling on everyone, both politicians and citizens, to continue to be critical consumers, particularly in relation to goods bearing Fair Trade labelling.
They often give more money and influence to organisations controlled by leftist ideology and opposition to free trade than to the really poor in underdeveloped countries.
Tropicana and Dole orange juice probably do more to contribute to development and fighting poverty than, for instance, the example we have here from Oxfam.
The European Parliamentâs unthinking embrace of Oxfam is in itself a good example of the crazy turn things can take when we are not critical in embracing Fair Trade products.
The Oxfam orange juice sold here in Parliament, for example, comes from Cuba.
Until someone has explained to me how it can be called Fair Trade when I buy state-produced juice and my money goes to a communist dictatorship I demand that all Oxfam products be removed from the range of goods on offer in Parliament, because that is not Fair Trade.
Â Â  â Madam President, I wish to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur and also to the draftsman of the opinion.
It is a very fine report.
In the case of certain speakers, one gets the impression that they have not read the report and are giving lectures they have brought with them from other political fora.
Irrespective of whether fair trade is written with capital or small letters, for me, it is very important that attention is drawn to the fact that the âfair tradeâ label, under the corresponding conditions, can be a model for the global market.
I am wondering why people in this House are so afraid of fairness in world trade.
We would save ourselves numerous discussions on development and migration policy if the world trade system was structured more fairly.
We spoke with entrepreneurs from the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States when a parliamentary meeting took place two weeks ago in Vienna.
Representatives of these small business employers told us about the important role played by the âfair tradeâ label in their regions.
They also mentioned that it would be a good example and a solution to the problem in their regions if international trade as a whole would move more in this direction.
Reference was also made to the enormous influence of fair trade production on combating poverty in general and, specifically, on the lives of women.
It is important that we state this clearly and I hope that we adopt the rapporteurâs report as is so as to support both the âfair tradeâ label and fair trade itself in an energetic manner.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Schmidt for his excellent report.
Fair Trade is a success story.
The value of Fair Trade products sold in the United Kingdom doubled between 2002 and 2004 and Fair Trade brands of coffee and tea have become household names.
It is estimated that three million Fair Trade hot drinks are consumed in the UK each day.
The largest UK Fair Trade organisation, Tradecraft, is based in Gateshead in my constituency.
I am proud of the momentum towards Fair Trade that now exists in the North East of England, with more and more places signing up as Fair Trade towns.
However, although Fair Trade is growing in many places, it is much less developed in some Member States than others.
EU support for Fair Trade through consumer awareness and information campaigns can help Fair Trade grow across the whole of Europe.
A modest amount of promotion of Fair Trade would trigger a substantial growth in the market for Fair Trade goods and significant poverty reduction in producer countries.
Â Â  â Madam President, the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, the fairer distribution of the benefits of globalisation and the more effective incorporation of developing countries into the global economic system are the prime challenges for the global community.
No one can doubt the positive contribution of fair trade initiatives and programmes to the sustainable economic and social development of developing countries.
It is a well-known fact that the Union is one of the most open markets in the world, especially as a result of the 'everything but arms' initiative for the benefit of less developed countries and the preferential treatment of other developing countries.
Nonetheless, free access is not all that is needed.
We also need more balanced access and a redistribution of resources between competitive exporters and small producers.
We also need to combat social and ecological dumping.
The concessions made by the Union and its development policy need primarily to target vulnerable countries, especially those in greatest need.
In other words, there is no point in opening up the European market for the benefit of large exporters in developing countries to the detriment of small and medium-sized European producers.
The development of fair trade systems and the promotion of products which meet high social and environmental specifications are even more important in light of the absence of such matters from current World Trade Organisation negotiations.
To close, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ Schmidt, for his qualitative contribution to the debate on international fair trade law.
Â Â  Madam President, I welcome the commitment shown by the Commissioner to these issues and indeed for giving us the clear understanding that it goes beyond just enjoying Oxfam chocolates.
I would also like to say that, like Linda McAvan, I have many experiences from developing countries, such as Uganda, where last year I met a farmer who had a kilo of coffee beans to sell for 150 Ugandan shillings.
Subsequently I paid 1000 Ugandan shillings for one cup of coffee.
This is the kind of injustice which the Fair Trade movement is dealing with.
My own country, Wales, has now voted to become a beacon of Fair Trade practice.
This week our First Minister announced proposals for Wales to become a Fair Trade nation.
We are now working to increase awareness of Fair Trade issues amongst the population in Wales.
That means working in colleges, schools, the voluntary sector, across business networks and elsewhere, and increasing awareness amongst our population.
I believe that in 2007 Wales will become a Fair Trade nation and our Fair Trade support will, as others have said, make an enormous difference to the lives of countless poor people and will mean that we will make our contribution to making poverty history.
Â Â  Madam President, I fully support MrÂ Schmidtâs report and the European Parliamentâs motion for a resolution.
In summarising the documents, I can state that fair trade is not simply about achieving fair prices and access to markets.
Neither does it solely involve work to increase social standards, eradicate poverty, provide technological assistance and build skills.
It also involves paying attention to the socio-economic situation of producers and their local communities.
That is why, on behalf of the members of the European Parliamentâs working group on the destruction of obsolete pesticides and the non-governmental organisations working with us, I would like to draw your attention to the problem posed by the tens of thousands of tons of obsolete pesticides stockpiled in African countries, former Soviet states, European Union Member States and countries applying for European Union membership.
These pesticides are a serious threat to development. They restrict the production of healthy food and, as a result, affect these countriesâ ability to participate in trade.
Let us please help these countries eradicate the source of this threat.
Â Â  . Madam President, this has been an important and illuminating debate that will send a very clear message to citizens across Europe who want to put trade more effectively at the service of development.
Just because Fair Trade schemes are not a panacea, that does not mean to say that we should fail to support them.
Just because they are not a total solution, that should not blind us to the fact that they make a very important contribution to the overall solution that we want to see in putting trade at the service of development, to enable us to tackle poverty in the world.
That is why this report and debate enable us to take a stand and deliver a message, not least because there is growing public interest and concern.
I thought MrÂ Karimâs speech in particular illustrated the growth of activity, public opinion and consciousness.
We as politicians need to express and reflect that opinion and find ways for it to grow.
For all those reasons, because consumers are becoming increasingly aware and want to make an informed choice, that translates into pressure on mainstream operators, producers and traders to raise their game in order to match higher public expectations and standards.
That then also converts into pressure on governments to act to help raise those standards and to increase consumer awareness and information.
So we have a âvirtuousâ circle here, to which we should be contributing.
Of course, what works in the private context and what works for an individual consumer choice does not automatically or neatly convert into a prescribed public policy.
That is obvious.
Nor is it the case that one particular Fair Trade scheme or Fair Trade label gives that scheme or that label an exclusive right to endorsement.
There are other organisations and NGOs, such as the Rainforest Alliance, which deliver many of the same environmental and social benefits by working in collaboration with mainstream companies.
The key policy challenge is to get the most out of all these efforts, not to identify some in order to discriminate, unwittingly and unintentionally, against others.
I would like to re-commit the Commission to working with NGOs in this area and we welcome Parliamentâs support.
There is broader work being led by Mr Michel on commodity supply change, through which we are planning to support the creation of a web portal to serve as a clearing-house of information about consumer assurance schemes of all kinds.
There are other ideas and proposals that I want to take back to the Commission and to consider with my colleagues.
We need to establish good models that provide for higher standards.
That is what we are jointly committed to and I look forward to continuing this work with Parliament.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today.
Â Â  The next item is the oral question to the Commission (0-0036/2006/rev.1 â B6-0314/2006) by Mr Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the results of the WTO meetings at the end of April in Geneva and future perspectives.
Â Â  . Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the WTO ministerial meeting held in Geneva from 29Â June to 1Â July is clearly a disappointment.
We went to Geneva the previous week to hold a meeting of the Steering Committee of the WTO Parliamentary Assembly that we have created with the Interparliamentary Union.
The Director-General, MrÂ Lamy, told us that it was the moment of truth and, as he himself has said, the result we are faced with is that we are in crisis.
The Chinese have a character to illustrate the idea of crisis, which I believe can be applied to the current situation of the WTO: the upper part means 'mortal danger' and lower part, 'opportunity'.
I believe that we are in a situation in which what is at stake is the survival of the WTO as a multilateral platform for consolidating world trade and the process of globalisation, in order to ensure that the WTO does not fall apart and we do not return to bilateral approaches, which may be useful within a multilateral framework, but which, if they become an alternative to the multilateral, would be extremely destructive in the long term.
This is the situation we are in and, furthermore, time is fast running out for the US President's authorisation from the United States Congress to negotiate, which is known as the Trade Promotion Authority.
I must say, in this regard, that I believe that there will be negotiations at these meetings.
The method chosen by the recently appointed MrsÂ Schwab, the US Trade Representative, is not the best method: to meet on Capitol Hill and have a photo taken before coming out with 56 Senators and with the representatives of the American Farm Bureau Federation, which is the most important agricultural lobby.
That may be appropriate for going to play in the Football World Cup, but it is not the best method for going to a negotiation of this kind.
I believe that we must point this out to our colleagues in the United States Congress.
The fact is that that is the situation we are in, and the Director-General, MrÂ Lamy, has been given a mandate to try to determine the methods for applying the agreements reached in Hong Kong.
In this regard, I believe that MrÂ Lamy is being asked, by means of travelling diplomacy â not an exploratory mission â to find a solution by means of what we in the European Union institutions call the confessionary system, that is to say, to try, by means of bilateral meetings amongst the interlocutors, to talk about things that nobody dare raise at a table, either in the green room or in the general meeting.
Above all because, when something is put on the table, it is no longer part of the negotiation, but rather it is something acquired.
In this respect, I believe that we must continue to support this process.
From Parliamentâs point of view, as Commissioner Mandelson knows, we are following the process very closely: a delegation from Parliament travelled to Geneva, having travelled to the Assembly the week before.
I must point out that we have obtained an interview with the Presidency of the Council, both the outgoing Presidency and the incoming Presidency, although it is not what we achieved in CancÃºn, which was to talk to the 133 Committee, and that our collaboration with the Commission has been very positive, both with Commissioner Mandelson and with Commissioner Fischer Boel.
Not only have they given us important information, but we have also been able to work together, building bridges and holding talks.
I must also tell you that we were given some excellent coffee in the Council building.
It now falls to the Commissioner to explain to us why it was not possible to make progress, above all, on the basis of agriculture and the NAMA, with other products, and also to what extent we can make progress on services.
Furthermore, I believe that it would be useful for the Commissioner to explain to us how far he has remained within the mandate, because that is one of the criticisms that have been levelled at him and that I imagine will be again.
I believe that you have acted well, but in any event, Madam President, these are my questions on behalf of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Madam President, between 29 June and 1 July, Mariann Fischer Boel and I attended ministerial meetings in Geneva on the Doha Round of trade talks.
We also met and remained in contact with the MEPs who were present in Geneva during those days.
I would like to thank the honourable Members of this House for their effort and for their commitment.
It is much appreciated by the Commission.
The ministerial meetings did not find agreement on the main parameters for reductions in tariffs and subsidies, in agriculture and industrial goods, the so-called modalities of the agreement which are necessary to move to the final stage in the talks.
We met several times with the ministers from the Group of Six, that is ourselves in Europe, the United States, Brazil, India, Japan and Australia.
We also met in the Green Room format of 30 ministers and in the Trade Negotiations Committee, which brings together the entire WTO membership.
There was no shortage of ministerial meetings and encounters, but the encounters were frankly better than the quality of the negotiations that took place within those encounters.
We went into the discussions stressing the EUâs agreement with a principle expressed by Pascal Lamy beforehand, that the landing zone for an agreement would require effective real cuts in farm subsidies by all and real cuts in both agricultural and non-agricultural market access â real cuts in tariffs.
We then specified that to capture such a basis for agreement we would on our side be prepared to move towards and close to the level of average cuts in farm tariffs proposed for developed countries by the G20, provided that others moved in concert, with a similar level of ambition in other areas of the negotiation.
We made it clear to our partners that we would not be prepared to meet every G20 demand, in particular on the structure of the cuts.
We pushed hard to establish a clear correspondence between the effort that we would make in agricultural market access and the effort that the United States in turn would have to make in the reduction of domestic subsidies close to the G20 levels of average cut by us, to be matched by close to G20 reductions of trade-distorting subsidies by the US.
The United States was the only major player to refuse to consider moving on this basis and declined to signal any room for further movement within this landing zone.
Indeed, they demanded further significant moves by others in order only to sustain their present offer, which all others regard as insufficient.
We also made it clear that, if a negotiating landing zone was to be identified in agriculture, we would only take our position in this pillar to the limit of our flexibility if we got a fair result in non-agricultural market access, requiring real cuts in developed and advanced developing countriesâ tariffs.
That is economically doable and, I would argue, desirable for these developing countries and politically essential for us and for other developed countries.
The United Statesâ unreadiness to engage stopped developing countries from making any move or showing any flexibility of their own.
The conclusions of the meeting therefore focused on the political handling of our failure to reach a breakthrough.
All members reaffirmed a willingness to reach agreement by this summer.
In this context G6 members first, subsequently backed by the broader membership in the Trade Negotiations Committee, asked the Director-General, Pascal Lamy, to intensify consultations and act as a catalyst for generating the basis for an agreement in the coming few weeks.
He has not been asked to author a final agreement or provide a Dunkel-type text, like the previous Director-General at the end of the Uruguay Round, but instead to use his good offices to act as a go-between for a final agreement to emerge.
That will require very active engagement by us with him and with the main players in the next ten days to two weeks.
Depending on progress made, it is likely that ministers will need to meet in a similar format towards or at the end of July to take the key decisions on modalities as well as to confirm progress made in the other key areas of the round, i.e. services, rules and the development package.
The possibility of a meeting of Heads of State and Government in some formation or another to take forward the negotiations around the time of the G8 meeting in ten days is not ruled out.
There is a lot at stake here and we shall have to work very hard and very fast in the coming days and weeks.
Failure of the DDA would have severe consequences, not least for the developing countries.
This is an opportunity that will not repeat itself to open markets further, to reduce subsidies, to strengthen world trade rules and to make a real contribution to growth in the poorest countries in the world.
This is why these multilateral negotiations continue to be the EUâs top trade priority.
No number of bilateral deals would have the same widespread effects or benefits.
This being said, our trade agenda goes beyond achieving a successful Doha deal.
In the months ahead, the Commission will define its commitment to boosting our competitive performance at home and abroad and this will be set out after the summer in an overarching Commission communication on the external aspects of Europeâs competitiveness.
This will examine how future trade policy can contribute to our internal competitiveness policies and what the priority tasks are for us to build new and secure global markets for our investment and trade.
This will include a new strategic approach to market access, including non-tariff barriers, the consideration of new bilateral and regional policy approaches and the examination of our political and economic ties with China.
This is not, however, an alternative to the DDA: it is an extension of a successfully concluded end to this round.
Our immediate priority remains, therefore, to bring about the necessary political engagement by all governments to negotiate a balanced and ambitious end to the DDA.
We will, of course, take a closer look at the social dimension of globalisation.
Modern social systems and a better quality of life are not optional extras: they are an integral part of a formula to deliver a lasting political response to globalisation and it is this goal, above all, that remains at the heart of my mandate.
Â Â  I ask that Members lower the noise level.
I can tell you that we are now adjourning.
We have very many votes so I ask for your understanding.
Â Â  â The next item is Voting Time.
Â Â  . Madam President, the NPI regulation is of major importance.
It provides an essential basis for the European Unionâs work and partnership with our neighbouring countries to promote and assist political and economic reforms.
Todayâs vote follows a lengthy process of negotiations on many detailed and complex issues, which all sides approached in a constructive spirit.
I am pleased to report that many significant amendments proposed by Parliament have been accepted.
As a result, the regulation is more complete and more comprehensive.
The amendments I have now tabled jointly with the shadow rapporteurs of the PPE-DE and PSE Groups reflect the common intention to secure a first-reading agreement.
The normal legal-linguistic verification process should deal with any remaining textual variations on this basis.
There are minor textual variations in Article 3.1 and in certain amendments.
These are considered purely linguistic or technical and do not involve any point of substance.
Â Â  Mr President, on behalf of the rapporteur, Mrs Beer â who cannot be here at this moment, for which I pass on her apologies â I would like to give a few words of explanation before the vote on her report.
Mrs Beer asked me to pass on her thanks to the various political group coordinators and to the Council and Commission for their good cooperation in the fruitful compromise negotiations.
Today we will vote on a first reading compromise agreement.
However, there are five important agreements that were reached during the negotiations which are not reflected in the amendments in front of you, but which nevertheless form an integral part of the compromise achieved.
They have been documented in a letter by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner.
Amendments 108 to 112 take account of various documents concerning the following issues.
Firstly, the Commission reacted to Parliamentâs demand for enhanced involvement in the policy level, which is closer to the implementation phase.
Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner gave formal assurance that the Commission would enter into regular dialogue with Parliament on the content of the draft country, regional and thematic strategy papers and guarantee to take due account of the position of Parliament when implementing the strategies proposed, the âdeclaration on democratic scrutinyâ.
Secondly, concerning exceptional assistance measures, the Commission gave the guarantee to treat the European Parliament at the same level as the Council, which means informing Parliament in a timely manner of exceptional assistance measures which it has adopted.
Thirdly, the Commission gave its word that anti-terrorism measures will be based on full respect for human rights and humanitarian law and that the Commission engages to ensure compliance with these principles through careful monitoring.
Fourthly, as a result of the demand by Parliament and civil society for better coordination of the EUâs peacebuilding capacities, the Commission agreed to establish a Peacebuilding Partnership.
The Commissionâs written explanation also reflects the long-standing demand by Parliament to advance the idea of a European Civil Peace Corps.
Lastly, in view of the severe financial cuts that the Stability Instrument underwent in the course of negotiations for the new Financial Perspective, Commission Ferrero-Waldner confirmed in writing the Commissionâs engagement to secure additional resources if needed, via various budgetary options, including the Emergency Aid Reserve and the Flexibility Instrument.
Our Legal Service has asked us to state that there are still a small number of purely linguistic and technical variations between the texts adopted by the Council and the text recommended for adoption today.
This is a purely technical issue linked to the fact that, in a first reading agreement, the normal process of legal revision and verification can only take place after the vote.
However, any variations should take full account of the intention of the House.
Â Â  . Mr President, the purpose of the pre-accession instrument is to ensure an efficient and transparent framework for financial assistance, and to provide a genuine European perspective for candidate states.
We have taken into account the experience gained during previous rounds of enlargement, and we have considered the interests of the European Union and the specific requirements and problems of candidate states.
The adoption of this instrument is particularly important at this time, when we are experiencing apathy towards enlargement in Europe.
The adoption of this instrument will send out the message that construction has not stopped, but is continuing.
However, a good instrument requires an appropriate budget.
The budget framework is very ungenerous towards candidate states.
We hope that the 2008 â 2009 review will create an opportunity to rectify this.
I would like to thank the co-rapporteurs, MrÂ Dimitrakopoulos, MrsÂ DeÂ Keyser and MrÂ Lagendijk, for their help and constructive cooperation, and the Commission too for its constructive and supportive cooperation.
Please adopt this instrument.
Â Â  , . â Mr President, I would like to emphasise an important point as the outcome of the negotiations and, provided there are no objections, I would also like to have this put on record.
The Commission and the Council have agreed that these three instruments shall be subject to a review prior to the European elections in 2009.
As regards this review, Parliamentâs full rights, including its power of codecision, should be preserved so as to thereby facilitate practical and flexible management without delay and to ensure that Parliament has the opportunity to carry out checks, but also to ensure at the same time, in the case of a project which, in total during this financial period, including the development instrument, accounts for EUR 43Â billion, that Parliamentâs influence is guaranteed.
I would like to say a special thank you to the rapporteurs, the Commission, the Commissioner and their assistants for their cooperative attitude.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like, in particular, to take this opportunity to say how very grateful I am to MrÂ Bullmann and to ProfessorÂ Lauk of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who ensured that cooperation with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs was very good and very fruitful, and, at the same time, extend warm thanks to the Council and the Commission, too, for their cooperation.
I would also like, speaking on behalf of my group, to reiterate that we, despite the content of this report, will be abstaining when it is voted on, and that the reason for our doing so is that there is a very close connection between the matter we are dealing with and the SWIFT debate that is currently going on.
It is particularly because so many people are concerned about interference with fundamental rights and about programmes about which people are not informed that I would have thought it politically well-advised for us to wait and see what comes out of the SWIFT investigation, and I will, for that reason, be recommending to my group that we should abstain.
As for the report itself, MrÂ Lauk and MrÂ Bullmann have my support, and I wish to thank the two groups for their good cooperation.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, would like to thank MrÂ Alvaro and MrÂ Lauk for their good cooperation.
We have come to agree, to a very great degree, on how a proper basis in law should be created, although, as regards the European Union, we do take the view that it is best to frame laws that everyone has to comply with and that every member of the public can comprehend.
It is on this small point â the only thing that divides us â that we are to vote today.
All I want is for this procedure to be technically unobjectionable.
There is a certain connection with the Corbett report, which has just been adopted, and in respect of which an amendment tabled by MrÂ Radwan was adopted, the intention of which was to affect a single technical detail in the way we are now to vote.
That does nothing to change the result, but the amendments relating to comitology have a minus against them in all the voting lists, in that we all agree on them; they should not be allowed to lapse, but should be voted on.
Let me now tell the House which ones these amendments are; I ask you to allow them to be voted on, but all the groups that have considered them have marked them with a minus.
Even so, we need a clean procedure if comitology and the Corbett report are to be brought into line with the item of legislation that we are now enacting.
The amendments in question are Nos 20, 22, 24, 103, 124 and 125, and they are to be voted on, and they are to be voted on even if there is a minus against them; that is the political compromise on which the rapporteurs have agreed.
Â Â  I should like to amend the title before paragraph 6.
Instead of âmost of which are allegedâ, it should read âsome of which are allegedâ.
There was a linguistic mistake in the original version.
Â Â  Mr President, while it is envisaged that the original document be translated into all languages, AmendmentÂ 1 proposes that these be whittled down to English and French.
I wish to propose, by way of a compromise, that it be translated into the languages of those EU Member States affected by the investigations.
I think it only fair that we should do this, not only for this House, but also for the benefit of other committees of inquiry in â for example â other parliaments.
Â Â  â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by means of my report, we are making an important proposal for the combating of VAT fraud within the European Union, which cheats the European taxpayer out of some EURÂ 60Â billion every year.
I see my report as constituting an important step in combating this fraud, including as it does the proposal for the reversed charge procedure, an approach that would also be practicable at the national level.
That is something that will need to be discussed, but, right now, it is the turn of the Council and the Commission, now that this House has shown great unanimity in taking this step â for which I am very grateful to it.
Â Â  â The EU-Caribbean partnership for growth, stability and development, a mutually beneficial partnership based on shared values, represents an opportunity for the two sides to work together towards democracy and human rights, and to fight against poverty and against threats to peace and stability.
I support the steps proposed by the Commission aimed at helping the countries of the region, which are already on the road to regional integration thanks to CARICOM, CARFORUM and MEUC.
The usually small and economically vulnerable Caribbean countries have made significant attempts at economic diversification, restructuring and reform and should now, with Europeâs help, be able to make the most of the opportunities offered by globalisation and to avoid its pitfalls.
I should like to thank the Members of this House for adopting my amendment calling for the French overseas departments in the region, namely French Guyana, Guadeloupe and Martinique, to be closely involved in the future political dialogue on EU-Caribbean cooperation, on account of their obvious role as 'Europe's bridgehead' in that part of the world.
Â Â  . Needlestick injuries occur when the skin is accidentally punctured with a needle that is potentially contaminated with a patient's blood.
Contaminated needles can transmit more than 20 dangerous blood-borne pathogens, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.
The majority of these injuries are suffered by nurses and doctors, but other medical staff are also at significant risk, as are auxiliary staff, such as cleaners and laundry staff and other downstream workers.
I welcome this report, which outlines the preventive steps that should be taken in health and veterinary care to protect workers from injuries caused by needles and other medical sharps.
This includes written instructions at the workplace and training for all workers, especially those who perform cannulation.
Effective response and follow-up to accidents or incidents is also outlined in the report, including rapid post-exposure prophylaxis.
Furthermore, all workers who might come into contact with needles and other medical sharps are to be offered vaccination against hepatitis B.
Â Â  â Mr President, trust is a beautiful thing, but there cannot be unconditional trust.
Although we voted today on a number of packages of financial proposals, the stability instrument is the least transparent of them.
The complexity is apparent from the very goals of this measure.
Such a broad-brush definition is capable of covering practically anything, for example justification for the policy of non-engagement in the case of right-wing coups such as the putsch carried out by General Franco.
Two days ago, MrÂ Giertych indicated that, according to the second part of the objectives of this instrument, it would even have been possible to support General Franco from EU funds. He pointed out that he was merely interested in renewing and consolidating traditional Catholic values in Spain.
Although the document does not contain any figures, the Commission has promised that it will provide them soon.
For the time being, only one thing can be said. Parliament is completely out of the loop.
Ultimately Parliamentâs Committee on Foreign Affairs emphasised this in the trialogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission and called for this state of affairs to be changed.
Parliament should not give anyone carte blanche.
Some parts of this document are dubious, unclear and manifestly open to possible abuse.
I therefore voted against the proposal before us.
Â Â  . Just like the rapporteur, I welcome the Commissionâs proposal to simplify the management of the EUâs external aid, by reducing the 30 or so existing instruments to six, including the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI).
This will lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness, and âmakes perfect senseâ.
I support many of the amendments proposed in the report, including strengthening Parliamentâs role in planning and monitoring ENPI programmes; increased involvement of civil society in the consultation process; and a bigger role for partners such as local and regional authorities, and civil society.
I regret, however, that the point relating to the outermost regions in the neighbourhood context, such as Cape Verde, was not brought into the scope of application of the ENPI.
A Wider Neighbourhood Action Plan had been proposed, with a view to facilitating cooperation between the outermost regions and their neighbouring countries.
This formed part of the sustainable development strategy for the outermost regions proposed by the Commission in order to pursue one of its priority action areas, namely bringing these regions into their own regional environment.
In spite of this, I voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . As draftsman for the report from the International Trade Committee on this report on external actions for financial, economic and technical assistance to third countries recovering from crisis I was concerned that this Stability Instrument should provide genuine added value, delivering an effective, immediate and integrated response.
Although there were concerns initially about the legal base of this instrument, it was eventually agreed that it should be based dually on development cooperation and economic, financial and technical cooperation.
I support Development Committee colleagues in their concerns that the inclusion of peace-support measures in this instrument should not bleed funds from the development budget.
Most importantly, the agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on this report reflects Parliamentâs initiative on a review clause, which will allow for modification and better reporting: an important consideration, since this instrument is new and far-reaching.
Â Â  â The so-called stability instrument forms part of the broader package of financing instruments (development and economic cooperation, pre-accession aid, neighbourhood and partnership) which are designed to form an integrated tool for exercising the imperialist policy of the ÎU in candidate countries, in countries in the immediate and wider neighbourhood and on the entire planet.
By giving 'economic aid' to third countries, the European Union is acquiring the right to intervene in them, on the pretext of addressing situations of destabilisation, 'crisis' and âunfolding crisis', situations which constitute 'threats' to the rule of law, law and order and the protection of human rights and to the promotion of the principles of international law, including support for special national and international criminal courts.
This funding will at the same time be used as a means of coercing third countries into complying with the imperialist ambitions of the ÎU and of open interference in the internal affairs of independent countries, with governments being undermined and the EU's candidates being funded, given that the facility to use financing to support and organise civil society, including to promote independent, pluralistic and professional media, is being introduced.
The Greek Communist Party voted against the report because it is in favour of and at some points formulates in an even more reactionary direction the tenet of the European Commission's proposal for a regulation.
Â Â  Mr President, against my advice, Parliament adopted the amendment tabled by MrÂ Radwan, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to my report on comitology.
In its statement last night in the debate, the Commission took the view that this amendment effectively undermines and sabotages the agreements that we have negotiated.
This may, indeed, have been Mr Radwanâs intention â I do not know â but the amendment refers to a resolution adopted by Parliament, which envisages the adoption of sunset clauses on the delegation of legislation that apply systematically to all legislation that we adopt in the financial services sector.
However, I would urge the Commission not to overreact.
The amendment adopted â however much I deplore it â was only an amendment to a recital in which we refer to a past resolution having regard to it.
We do not, as a Parliament, reaffirm our endorsement of the resolution.
This nuance should enable the Commission to accept our text and to consider that the agreement we have negotiated remains valid.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to go back to the Corbett report.
I can only assume that my request for an explanation of vote went astray in the confusion caused by Members leaving the Chamber.
I should like to say a few words on the subject of comitology.
Just like my fellow members of the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS), I voted against this report.
I did so because we believe that this is a controversial issue insofar as it transfers more power from the Member States to the Commission.
We feel that the voters of France and the Netherlands told the European institutions quite clearly how they feel about transferring those powers to the Commission.
We do not think that their decision should be circumvented through the back door.
Â Â  . In 1993, under a new codecision procedure, legislative powers were allocated to Parliament and the Council on an (almost) equal footing.
Parliament took the view that codecision acts, in which Council and Parliament can jointly delegate implementing measures, implied that they should both be involved in defining the procedures for exercising delegated powers and that they should have equal rights regarding retrieval or call back.
The Council, however, argued that Article 202 of the EC Treaty remained unchanged, providing for the Council (alone) to define the system for implementing powers.
The key step forward for Parliament which is possible now as an outcome of negotiations with the Council and the Commission, is that Parliament will be able to block the adoption of âquasi-legislativeâ implementing measures to which it objects.
If it does so, the Commission can make a new proposal or table draft legislation.
I welcome this reportÂŽ, as it expands the powers of the European Parliament and enables it be an ever more effective and democratic institution.
Â Â  â Should we be pleased or concerned about the agreement reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission?
One might be pleased to see curbs, however few, placed on this disproportionate power, unprecedented for a democracy, that practically enables Brussels officials to amend legislative acts without the legislator.
There are a great many reasons to be concerned, however.
The first is that one must once again point out the cardinal sin of the European institutional structure â the Commission is the institution with the least legitimacy but with the most power.
The second is that Europeâs body of legislation has not been simplified.
The âbetter lawmakingâ initiative, which Parliament debated for the umpteenth time last month â the thorny issue of âEurocracyâ â is clearly nothing but window dressing.
The third is that this agreement is the implementation â partial, it is true, but actually happening â of a provision contained in the European Constitution, a document which, as the House is no doubt tired of hearing, is obsolete given that two European populations rejected it by a huge margin in referendums.
The best way to curb the Commissionâs powers is to revise the Treaties and to build the Europe of the nations, which could do without this institution in its current form.
Â Â  . The ALDE group unfortunately feels compelled to abstain from voting on the final vote on thisÂ report.
ALDE's request to postpone the vote not having been granted, we feel adoption of this report is premature as long as the question marks over the recent SWIFT scandal have not been resolved.Â The legislative proposal at hand must be adopted on the basis of an international agreement (FATF), to which both the EU and the USA are signatories.
The position of the USA must be clarified before the EU should proceed to fulfilling its part of the agreement.Â Clarification by the ECB and the national central banks is equally precondition for adoption.
In view of growing concerns about civil rights and protection of personal data of EU citizens, ALDE feels further assurances are needed in this area.
We note that in recent years a host of security measures has been taken, whereas measures to strengthen civil rights and privacy protection have been stalled, and decision making in this area largely takes place without any meaningful parliamentary scrutinyÂ or judicial review.
The case of SWIFT casts doubts on the adequacy of data protection instruments in the EU.
A fundamental debate must be held first.
Â Â  . In the past decade, there has been a huge rise in acts of terrorism around the world.
The fight against this scourge has accordingly become one of the key political priorities in Europe and around the world.
This proposal forms part of a range of measures taken by the Union aimed at reducing access for terrorists to financial and other economic resources.
Its purpose is to transpose into Community legislation the Financial Action Task Forceâs Special Recommendation VII on wire transfers.
It is aimed at the authorities responsible for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and establishes rules on the requirement to provide information on payers transferring funds.
This will be a useful, effective measure to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorists and other criminals, and to trace their assets.
I agree with the proposed derogations aimed at taking on board the specific nature of the payment systems in the different Member States.
I support MrÂ Brejcâs position that there must be a sunset clause, whereby this regulation will lapse after five years if it does not prove useful.
I also support the compromise reached between MrÂ Brejc and the rapporteur.
Â Â  . We abstain from voting on this report, as it presents Parliament with an unsolvable dilemma.
On the one hand, it is implementing an international treaty and voting against it would simply reinforce the Commissionâs position.
On the other hand, we cannot support the introduction of ever more legislation intruding on privacy without further evidence that a massive surveillance of innocent citizens increases safety or is helpful in preventing acts of terror.
It has been shown that money flows for the funding of terrorism are increasingly going underground, making use of cash and transferring money using couriers.
Further, no matter what steps are taken to protect privacy, the temptation to use these for other purposes by authorities will be great and so far no-one has created a register that does not leak information.
WeÂ are also deeply concerned about the effects on NGOs promoting democracy and human rights in undemocratic regimes.
An extensive register, even though we are told it will not be used that way, will undoubtedly impair their activities.
In abstaining, we also urge the Parliament to start discussing a comprehensive policy on protection of privacy and civil liberties.
The present course, where liberties are curtailed step by step, must come to an end.
Â Â  . The purpose of the amendment to the financial regulation is to simplify the rules on external contracts and grants and make them more transparent.
The text currently lacks clarity and structure and as such is difficult for potential users to read.
This bureaucratic collection of rules, solely in the area of some within the Commissionâs DGs, is a very costly procedure for providers and organisations applying for these grants. This excludes many micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as smaller associations, institutes and NGOs.
Furthermore, the Commission has discretionary powers in the process, and there are therefore very few companies and organisations â and it is always the same ones â that are conversant with the mechanics of the process.
Ultimately, this may lead to choices being made on the basis of political support or otherwise.
As the Court of Auditors has stated, however, the review that has been submitted is not sufficient to reduce the burden and simplify the procedures for both the Commission and for potential users.
Parliamentâs proposals improve the situation but fall short of the urgently needed global review of the financial regulation in these matters.
Â Â  â Mr President, I have already, during past debates on mutual information procedures relating to asylum and immigration, had cause to put a number of questions to Commissioner Frattini, since I do find myself wondering what the added value is of this system in contending with illegal immigration.
I am not saying that it is a bad thing, but I do think that it still amounts to a sticking plaster on a wooden leg.
The real problem is, after all, that the policy of regularisation adopted by Italy, by Spain, and by Belgium, has resulted in an inflow of hundreds of thousands of new economic migrants, whom our open borders policy is enabling to spread themselves throughout Europe without difficulty.
If the European Union really does have the intention of addressing the problem of illegal immigration, then it has to begin at the beginning.
It goes without saying that the practical repudiation of the pernicious regularisations is the only way in which this policyâs powerful attraction can be neutralised, followed immediately by a consistent policy of sending all illegal and criminal immigrants back whence they came.
Â Â  . â We need to implement a proper joint asylum and immigration policy.
It is crucial for the Union that we put mechanisms in place for the Member States to exchange information.
Indeed, if the Member States can gain a better idea of each other's laws and regularly exchange best practice, they will be better able to identify the areas in which European legislation is needed and in turn reach an agreement that is acceptable to all.
It would be simplistic and inaccurate to say that this instrument could enable the Member States to ban regularisation, which in some national contexts is necessary.
Exchange of information on these measures will help them to be better understood.
Furthermore, a crackdown on legal immigration could have the effect of diverting flows to another Member State.
A crackdown of this nature will therefore also have to be reported.
Â Â  â Mr President, MrÂ Gargani is right to ask for Parliament to be consulted on the modification of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities.
He is also right to call, in his report, for Parliament to have the right to appeal to the Court of Justice in the event that Member States fail to respect Membersâ immunities, which were established to defend Parliamentâs rights and in particular to protect MEPs against action that a hostile executive may decide to bring, via a proxy prosecutor.
Particularly so after the act of utter treachery â that is not too strong a word â committed by the French Supreme Court in the case of our erstwhile fellow Member MrÂ Marchiani.
Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs must also uphold the fundamental law not to examine a request for parliamentary immunity protection on manifestly inappropriate grounds, in this case ArticleÂ 9, when it is ArticleÂ 10 that applies.
It should adopt the same legal stance on defending freedom of expression when there has manifestly been , as in my case.
Lastly, Parliamentâs legal service must not endeavour to water down Parliament resolutions, or rules that the latter has inserted into its own Rules of Procedure, while there is action pending before the Court of Justice
Â Â  . Mr President, the MEPs belonging to the Free Democratic Party have voted against the resolution on the economic and social consequences of business restructuring operations in Europe, being convinced that, in Europeâs market economies, businesses should be free from political pressure in deciding where their production sites should be located.
In our single market, competition â including competition between regions â plays a decisive role in terms of the further development of European enterprise and of the way in which it can keep itself fit.
The ultimate effect of political pressure is to impede the functioning of the market and it is for that reason that it should not be applied as a means of deterring businesses from acting on their own decisions.
Â Â  . We voted against for the following reasons:
- there is no mention whatsoever of solidarity with the Opel/GM workers, and in particular the 1Â 700-plus workers (and their families) of the Opel factory in Azambuja, Portugal, whose jobs are under threat due to the indifference of the GM board to the potential economic, social and regional consequences.
This position has been imposed by the Right, with the complicity of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which signed the joint resolution;
- the defence of the right of companies to take management decisions aimed at delivering their own economic growth, regardless of the potential social consequences;
- there is no mention of the economic and social impact of relocations, which most often take place with the sole purpose of cutting costs and maximising profits, with factors such as economic viability and productivity playing no part in the decision; these relocations often fail to respect contractual obligations, yet in the most mercenary fashion the businesses involved enjoy local, national and Community public aid, leaving behind a trail of unemployment and undermining local economies.
Last year alone relocations led to half a million redundancies in the EU;
- the resolution falls well short of the results obtained in the March resolutions on the impact of relocations and restructuring on employment and regional development.
Â Â  . The spirit of entrepreneurship and the role of business is vital to economic growth and development, and the substantial economic changes that we have seen mean that many companies need to restructure.
Yet it is also true that there are two highly pertinent points in this proposal that should not be overlooked.
The first of these is the social responsibility of businesses and the duty to honour agreements and contracts, not least when they have received grants and subsidies in respect of a particular activity.
The considerations, concerns and proposals contained in this resolution are worthy of my support.
I feel, however, that the proposal to set up a European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a timely reminder of the scale of the problem, to which we must find far-reaching solutions.
The ongoing process of restructuring Europeâs business fabric, not least manufacturing, will hopefully have positive consequences, but will also have a negative social impact, especially in the initial stages.
Europe, individual governments and Community institutions have a duty to prepare now for the very near future.
In addition to this fund, we need to discuss other solutions and invest in other mechanisms.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in voting in favour of this report, we must pay tribute to what is perhaps a positive development, namely that the European Parliament, rather than constantly laying the blame on the United States, is beginning to look at the way in which the European Union and the Member States comply with the law, because all too often, when faced with illegality and abuses that exist, for example, regarding the transfer of personal data and regarding air passenger traffic, we have actually hidden our own illegality â the inability to comply with our own rules â behind that of the United States.
It is time for us to accept our responsibility, and I believe that the Fava report is a first step in that direction.
Â Â  â Mr President, I voted against the Fava report on the grounds that it is a typical example of Left-wing bias.
The temporary committee has already decided everything in advance, so that all that was needed was to find the evidence.
It just so happens that no evidence has come to light of torture or of other illegal activities on the part of the CIA in the European Union, so what this report does is to take what are actually suppositions and indications and systematically put them forward as facts, and that is intellectually dishonest.
That typifies a certain mentality that is present in this House.
It can indeed be said, speaking frankly, that there are Members of this House who do not actually want terrorism to be dealt with.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my bitter disappointment at the adoption of the Fava report.
There are a total of four reasons why I say this. Firstly, the report is based on one-sided, general information, and not on accurately expressed facts verified by various sources.
Secondly, the report is full of contradictions.
If there were incontrovertible facts showing that the CIA had used European countries for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, the word âallegedâ should have been taken out of the title.
On the other side of that coin, the rapporteurâs use of the word âallegedâ in the title of the report, after all the efforts of the members of the Temporary Committee and other interested parties, is tacit acknowledgement that the committee has been unable to prove that any illegal act has taken place.
Thirdly, it is possible that over time, a number of the suspicions that have been voiced will prove to have been violations of the law, or perhaps new cases will come to light.
Given the extent and complexity of the fight against terrorism, this should not come as any surprise.
The most important thing is that we would be talking about details and not about errors in the system.
People who consider that their rights have been curtailed can go through the proper, well-functioning channels to enforce these rights and claim redress.
Fourthly and lastly, we must look carefully into how much time Parliament devotes to investigating an alleged problem and how much time it devotes to the real problem of terrorism.
By adopting the report by MrÂ Fava, we are leaving ourselves open to doubts as to whether we are capable of assessing the relative importance of individual problems and whether we will manage to address those problems appropriately.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today in this plenary session, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party (ODS) chose not to support the interim report by MrÂ Fava on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners.
The report is, in our view, based on the current trend for anti-Americanism, which does not take account of the serious threat of international terrorism.
The United States of America and its allies, including the Czech Republic, have channelled all their efforts over the past five years into combating this terrible threat.
Since 2001, we have witnessed terrorist attacks in the USA, the UK, Spain and a host of other countries.
This is a very real danger and the Fava report completely ignores the need to combat it.
The report also entirely disregards the fact that it is the approach jointly adopted by the USA and its allies from a number of European countries that has enabled us to reduce international terrorism substantially and has thus provided the citizens of Europe with greater security.
The report instead focuses on a number of unsubstantiated cases of dubious behaviour by the security services of the USA and its allies, and draws sweeping conclusions from those cases.
The MEPs from the Czech ODS cannot support such a position with their votes.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that some of our amendments have been accepted, the Fava report, on which we have voted today, remains biased, one-sided and imbued with preconceptions, as well as being intent on supporting totally groundless theories.
This is a text that is one-sided in terms of its content and that even runs counter to the positions of the Italian Government.
It was Prime MinisterÂ Prodi himself who, in an official communication, contradicted MrÂ Fava on the Abu Omar affair.
While MrÂ Fava rejected an amendment of mine, which maintained that there was no evidence of involvement on the part of the government and of the Italian intelligence service, the Prime Minister's office was last night reaffirming its faith in our secret services.
MrÂ Favaâs attitude demonstrates how much bad faith exists within the Italian left, which does not want to renounce the anti-Americanism of the past or to stop using the European institutions for the purposes of attacking its opponents.
Â Â  . I voted against extending the mandate of Mr Favaâs committee to continue investigating so-called âextraordinary renditionâ because to date it has produced no substantiated evidence such as would justify its continuance.
Rather, it is being used as a vehicle for rabid anti-Americanism, willing to trade in selective tittle-tattle while operating on a presumption of guilt by the CIA.
Â Â  . UKIP have voted in favour of Amendment 13, because it emphasises that the EU High Commissioner and EU High Representative have no powers to request information in this matter from Member States.
UKIP rejects the authority and opposes the creation of both these positions and therefore welcomes the acknowledgement of a limitation to their powers.
Â Â  . This report contains positive elements that confirm what we have known about and have been speaking out about for a long time, namely that the CIS and other US bodies âhave been directly responsible for the illegal seizure, removal, abduction and detentionâ of citizens â euphemistically referred to as âextraordinary renditionâ â and the transfer of citizens to third countries to be interrogated and subjected to torture, thereby brutally violating international law and human rights.
Among other important aspects, the report considers it âimplausibleâ that European governments were not aware of these criminal activities and âutterly implausibleâ that hundreds of flights could have taken place in European airspace without the relevant authorities taking any action.
The report should help to demystify the real meaning of the terms âpre-emptive warâ and the âfight against terrorismâ with which the USA and its allies have sought to cloak their attacks on the populations and sovereignty of countries, in breach of international law and human rights.
The report should also help to get to the bottom of what happened and to bring those responsible to account, by clarifying the content of the NATO agreements and the agreements between the EU and the USA on this issue.
It will, moreover, ensure that national parliaments will carry out their own enquiries.
Â Â  . I voted for this report as I consider it is an important practical step forward in the way in which the European Parliament is now willing to confront serious abuses of human rights within its borders and its relationship with the USA.
We cannot simply accept assurances from friendly governments concerning the prohibition on torture and cruel and degrading treatment: we have a responsibility to ensure that we and our allies act within international law.
In political terms, we now need to examine whether the EU and its Member States have the necessary instruments to pursue the truth about what is happening on our territory and in our name and the appropriate safeguards to protect our citizens and residents.
I welcome the parliamentary majority for the continuation of the work of this Temporary Committee.
Â Â  . â I did not vote for the motion for a resolution by the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
Firstly, I feel that this Temporary Committee should not have been set up in the first place, given that the Council of Europe carried out an inquiry into the matter, under ArticleÂ 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Why duplicate this task?
Why impinge upon the powers and responsibilities of the Council of Europe?
Why bother tasking a Prime Minister, regardless of the size of his country, with drawing up a major report on collaboration between Parliament and the Council of Europe if, at the first opportunity, we waste our time creating a new resolution, the only purpose of which seems to be to indulge in rabid anti-Americanism?
I share the minority opinion that this Temporary Committee, which has hitherto failed to find any confirmed evidence of the alleged violations of European law and international law by EU Member States, is surplus to requirements, and that it should not continue its work.
Â Â  . Yesterdayâs plenary debate on the Americansâ secret flights and secret prison camps brought out two violently opposed points of view.
There are those governments that make peopleâs rights and freedoms subordinate to the campaign against anyone who dissents and can therefore be suspected of terrorism.
Those who think like that are under the illusion that freedom and democracy can be protected by being restricted or even abolished, and tend to have a sense of close ties to the USA, with especial loyalty to the present American administration and its policies, which have resulted in the occupation of Iran and Afghanistan and to the toleration of the unsustainable situation in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories.
I utterly repudiate this approach.
Terrorism cannot be fought by extending, rather than reducing as much as possible, the seedbed from which it springs.
Such an approach does no more than prompt more and more desperate people to sympathise with the terrorist hotheads who claim to know the best solution and the best way of improving their living conditions.
What is going on before our very eyes is a gross abuse of human rights.
The freedoms of individual human beings evidently no longer count for anything in the fight against terrorism.
The EUâs Member States must acknowledge their share in responsibility for this.
Â Â  . The EPLP will be voting for the Fava report because we believe that it continues to be important for the European Parliament to investigate the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the alleged transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.
The interim report is important for two reasons.
Firstly, unlike members of the Council of Europe, MEPs are directly elected and answerable to our constituents.
We investigate all manner of issues on behalf of them and we cannot ignore calls that Member States may have breached their Treaty obligations under Article 6 of the EU Treaty, which outlines the basic principles of democracy, human rights and respect of law.
The European Parliament is the only body that can impose sanctions on Member States that breach these Treaty obligations.
Parliament's report is also important as, unlike the Council of Europe, the committee was able to call witnesses to testify before it.
The committee heard strong personal testimonies, which provided compelling evidence in the report.
Â Â  â The interim report on CIA activities, with abductions, transportation, interrogations and torture in European countries confirms the disclosures by organisations and the media.
The resultant outcry forced conservative socialist forces to set up a committee of inquiry to acknowledge known facts, so that they can appear as 'innocent doves' in the eyes of the people, thereby creating a delusion as to the role of the ÎU.
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained, in a refusal to take part in the theatre of the absurd being played in the European Parliament because: An EU-US agreement was signed in Athens allowing the CIA to act with impunity and now the forces which support it are 'protesting' about its results.
The governments of the Member States, both centre right and centre left, knew about and took part in the CIA orgy and the members of the parties which support them, many of whom knew about it, appear to condemn them.
They are mocking the world.
Conservatives and social democrats have sided with the 'anti-terrorist' strategy of the USA and have accepted 'preventive war' and the massacre of grassroots freedoms and democratic rights and are now washing their hands like Pontius Pilate.
No European Parliament report can be used to launder the political responsibilities of the parties that support imperialism or to delude people into believing that US-EU terrorist action will stop.
It will increase as the grassroots, anti-imperialist movement grows and shifts the power ratio.
Â Â  . The subject matter of this report cannot be addressed lightly.
Human rights and the fight against terrorism, in tandem with relations with our main ally, require special focus and consideration.
What emerges from this interim report is a number of doubts and suspicions that have not been clarified, as well as some contradictory statements from a number of bodies.
It is therefore understandable to press ahead with the Commissionâs work, but unreasonable to present unproven hypotheses as conclusions.
On a more serious note, the rejection of a number of amendments aimed at including in the report some relevant details counteracting some of the accusations and insinuations is indicative of a desire to behave belligerently towards an ally that is above any desire to discover the truth.
I will have no truck with this interpretation of the role of Parliament and the EUâs external relations.
I believe that both European countries and our allies are capable of making mistakes and of carrying out acts that break the law.
These acts should be acknowledged and punished, but I am not prepared to make accusations without investigation or to condemn without evidence.
Â Â  . My British Conservative colleagues and I are unable to support the Fava report because we believe that the report is heavy on allegations and short on new evidence or proof.
We were against this TDIP committee from the beginning and feel that it is a waste of money which duplicates Senator Marty's efforts in the Council of Europe.
Furthermore, there is no proof whatsoever of the existence of CIA detention camps in either Romania or Poland, neither do I believe that there has been a systematic US policy for extraordinary renditions to torture abductees in third countries.
Â Â  . UKIP (the UK delegation in the IND/DEM Group) voted in favour of Amendment 13 because it emphasises that the EUâs High Commissioner and High Representative have no powers to request, from Member-State governments,Â information of the kind referred to.
UKIP opposed the creation, and does not recognise the authority, of these posts.Â We welcome Amendment 13, therefore,Â insofar as it acknowledgesÂ some limitation of their powers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, when bank transfers are carried out in foreign countries, these are actually commercial transactions, and the personal data resulting from these transactions are data that must not be systematically used for security purposes.
In confirming my vote in favour of this resolution, I should like to stress that the problem is not just one of data being illegally transferred to a third country, but is also one of data that has been collected for commercial purposes being used instead for security purposes.
According to the European Court of Human Rights, it is a question, in this case, of blanket surveillance, which runs counter to the European directives and to the legislation of the Member States, and it is also for this last reason that we support the Swift report.
Â Â  . â We voted for the resolution tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, but rejected the joint resolution on the Society for World Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) case, on the grounds of a lack of balance that cannot be rectified by a series of amendments.
We all know the difficulty involved in assessing the level of priority of the fight against terrorism and the similarly fundamental respect for our individual rights.
The debate has been regularly affected by the news of detention conditions at GuantÃ¡namo, the case of the secret CIA flights, the detention centres in Europe, and now the SWIFT case.
It is tricky to know where to draw the line, but this is a crucial debate in a world in which terrorism cuts across national borders.
An inquiry has been launched in Belgium to ascertain whether there are any loopholes in our data protection laws.
We do not think that this vindictive resolution â which is virulently anti-American in its form, flawless in its substance (4 and 13: what a brilliant idea â the secret services are to make their operations public!) and often unreadable â improves our image among Europeans.
There were other ways in which we could have expressed our determination to shed light on any breaches, whilst reiterating our steadfast commitment to combating those whose ideology flies in the face of our values.
Â Â  . Although there are some aspects with which we disagree, we feel that this resolution should help to show the so-called âfight against terrorismâ in stark relief, and the securitarian trend that characterises it.
Under the âTerrorism Finance Monitoring Programmeâ the USA has, with the help of a secret agreement, gained access to all financial data stored by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), a cooperative of 8Â 000 banks and institutions in 200 countries, including the European Central Bank.
The USA has thus gained access to an extraordinary amount of data on bank transfers and transactions carried out by citizens and businesses around the world.
Access to this kind of information has been granted in violation of the legal procedures on data protection and without any legal basis.
This breaches peopleâs rights, freedoms and guarantees, and the sovereign responsibility of each country as regards protecting its citizens.
Consequently, the truth must be brought out and those responsible for this unacceptable situation held to account, including the role of the European Central Bank.
This is not an isolated incident, but yet another tip of the iceberg of the true meaning of the securitarian trend that is undermining the citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees.
Â Â  â The monitoring of movements on the accounts of millions of innocent people by the USA, with the agreement of the ÎU and the governments of the Member States, shows the depth and the objectives of the so-called anti-terrorist strategy.
It forms part of the global and integrated strategy of the imperialists to record data in order to control, coerce and terrorise anyone who opposes them.
It reveals the role of the banking system, private companies and public corporations in the capitalist countries and the European Central Bank, which even infringe their own rules in the general interest of the system.
Resolutions and calls for protection of citizens' privacy and for a balance between the fight against terrorism and human rights by the conservative and social democrat parties that predominate in the EU and in the governments are monumental hypocrisy.
They were the ones who signed these agreements.
It is equally insulting that, at the same time, at the same meeting, they approved a report and a proposal for a regulation to record the financial banking transactions of all EU citizens.
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained, in a refusal to take part in the attempt to create false impressions and sanctify the ÎU and the forces that support it.
The Greek Communist Party will help to uncover more of the role of the ÎU which, however hard it tries to appear sensitive and democratic, will take harsher anti-grassroots and anti-democratic measures and will feel grassroots resistance growing.
Â Â  Mr President, no matter how much it is claimed in the Lambrinidis report that integration is, in principle, a two-way process, I in fact find in the text as approved little or nothing of the sort; on the contrary, indeed, it was once more the same old tune of plenty of rights and hardly any duties.
Once again, the European Member States are called on to make it their business to discriminate positively in favour of immigrants, the logical consequence of which is that the indigenous population are to be put at a disadvantage or discriminated against.
Moreover, immigrants must be accorded all political rights without any questions being asked about their willingness to integrate.
It is even claimed at one point that certain cultural and religious customs must not be an obstacle to foreigners enjoying rights or being integrated into society: this even though we all know perfectly well that this is a veiled way of talking about the so-called cultural and religious customs of Islam, which are the real point at issue here and which, in fact, run completely counter to the things our European democracies have achieved and the rights enjoyed in them.
It is for this reason, among many others, that I have, of course, voted against the adoption of this report.
Â Â  â Mr President, I voted against the Lambrinidis report on the grounds that it contains no solution whatsoever to these problems, but, on the contrary, is itself part of the problem.
The fact that it speaks, for example of the 40Â million foreigners in the European Union being capable of being considered as a twenty-sixth Member States is in itself an adequate demonstration of that.
For the umpteenth time, Europeâs voters are being made the scapegoats and a veiled plea is being made for yet another restriction on the right to the free expression of opinion.
The report calls for the introduction of suffrage for aliens and for positive discrimination, which is another way of saying discrimination against Europeans and in favour of aliens.
It is not just a matter of practical experiences that unrealistic rules of this sort do not work, but there is also no democratic basis to be found for them.
This sort of report is the latest of innumerable examples of the democratic deficit in Europe and of the interference from the European level that can only erode still further Europeansâ confidence in Europe.
Â Â  â If proof were needed of the collapse of the pro-European political pseudo-elites, of the mental confusion in which they live, of their loss of reference points and of the topsy-turvy values from which they are suffering, the Lambrinidis report has given us that proof.
What he is proposing is tantamount to across-the-board, institutionalised bias towards non-Europeans, and a form of discrimination against Europeans on their own soil, which is accompanied, financially speaking, by a kind of Marshall Plan for what he calls the â26th State of the Unionâ and, politically speaking, by the unilateral granting of rights that ought only to be for nationals of a State.
Wake up, MrÂ Lambrinidis. The official admission of 40Â million immigrants from outside Europe is the opening of the floodgates.
The Member States already set aside hundred of billions of euro every year for so-called integration policies, which are blatantly failing, costly for society and a hindrance for their economies.
Do not forget the inter-ethnic conflicts in the United Kingdom.
Do not forget why Theo Van Gogh is dead.
Do not forget the riots in France, in which young people shouted their hatred of our institutions, our values and everything that we stand for.
The multicultural societies that you want to create are powder kegs.
Millions of Europeans are doomed to unemployment, social problems and housing difficulties.
They are the ones with whom we should primarily be concerned.
Â Â  . My British Conservative colleagues and I welcome the broad approach of the Lambrinidis report and support the many positive and balanced elements of this report to promote the integration of immigrants into European society.
However, we should like to restate that great attention needs to be paid to ensuring thatÂ the principle of subsidiarity is completely respected in each and every aspect of policy in this important area.
In addition, we believe that asylum policy must remain the competence of national governments and do not believe in a pan-European approach as stated in recital L.
For these reasons, we have decided to abstain on this report.
Â Â  . â Today, there are around 50Â million immigrants in Europe, most of them from Africa and Asia, and that figure is increasing by one to two million every year.
The explosion in ethnic violence, the islamisation of many of our towns, and the challenges faced by our social security systems, which cannot cope with these new arrivals, are the most serious consequences of this immigration, which is all the more difficult to assimilate because the immigrants come from cultures alien to our civilisation.
Far from solving the problems, the integration proposed by the rapporteur in fact aggravates them.
In France, three weeks of rioting in November 2005 reduced to ashes dozens of buildings constructed as part of this policy, including community halls, gymnasia and schools.
Other proposals, such as 'encouraging political participation among immigrants', in other words giving them the right to vote, as MrÂ Sarkozy wants to do in France, will break up our societies still further.
Instead of swallowing up thousands of people in pseudo-integration, our governments should, firstly, establish a true cooperation policy with the countries of origin, based on reciprocity, and, secondly, launch a major pro-family policy in order to ensure the long-term survival of our nations.
Â Â  . I wish to congratulate MrÂ Lambrinidis on his outstanding report on the strategies and means for the integration of immigrants in the EU, to which I lend my full backing.
In this regard I wish to highlight the need to guarantee the effective implementation of the Community directives on the integration of immigrants.
To this end, the EU must monitor the transposition of directives on integration and the effectiveness of administrative practices that implement the relevant legislation in the day-to-day lives of immigrants.
Â Â  . Although I share the rapporteurâs concerns, I cannot agree with all of the proposals he puts forward to solve one of the key problems raised by immigration, namely integration.
To cite just a few examples: the rapporteur confuses immigration from accession countries (especially in the past) with immigration from other countries, which is an error of analysis that emerges in his conclusions; he makes the mistaken assertion that the 40Â million-plus nationals from third countries make âthe EUâs 26th Member State (and its fifth largest)â; and lastly the idea, since withdrawn by the Confederal Group of the European United Left, that the Member States must confer citizenship on immigrants, without mentioning that this issue has different regulations and different , is a simplistic approach to a complex matter.
The fact that there is a problem at the moment with integrating some immigrant communities in the EU shows that no European model is currently working fully and effectively.
Integration is a two-way process.
It needs to be facilitated by the host country (by the authorities and the citizens) and must be something that the immigrants themselves want and put into practice.
Failure to acknowledge this is tantamount to handing the initiative to extremist movements on both sides.
Â Â  â Immigration is too serious a subject to simply leave to the polling organisations or to decree it to be an important subject only during national elections.
Immigration is a fact of life: more than 40Â million people live within the territory of the European Union, which seems to have a great deal of difficulty coordinating its activities.
It must act quickly to establish a consistent and effective immigration policy.
The Finnish Presidency intends to move this thorny issue forwards by breaking down the barrier of unanimity in the Council of Ministers, which is holding back all progress in the crucial field of judicial and police cooperation, in order to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration.
I very much hope that this Nordic desire will soon be put into practice, through the implementation of a humane joint policy on the right to asylum, or cooperation between the 25 Member States to allocate quotas to each country.
Another challenge that needs to be met is the integration of immigrants.
As the Lambrinidis report emphasises, there is still much progress to be made in the Europe of 25 Member States if we are to make a success of this integration, particularly in the fields of access to employment, non-discrimination, the education of women, language-learning programmes and political participation.
If we can win this bet, we will be one step closer to social peace.
Â Â  . â European immigration policy cannot be limited to the fight against illegal immigration: we must, as a matter of urgency, establish a European policy on the integration of third-country nationals.
The Commission communication on a common agenda for integration therefore constitutes an important step forwards, and the creation of a European Fund for the integration of third-country nationals is very much in line with this.
Immigrants must be able to benefit directly from this fund, and it must therefore allow them to participate more actively at all levels of education, culture and politics.
We need to promote an exchange of best integration policy practice across the Member States, in order to smooth the path for a truly European integration policy.
I also support the rapporteur's proposal that we establish fast and humane procedures to grant long-term resident status, for family reunification and for the naturalisation of long-term resident immigrants.
Â Â  The ÎU addresses the question of immigration solely within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, in order to increase the competitiveness of its economy; in other words, from the point of view of increasing the profitability of European capital.
That is why its pronouncements about the social integration of immigrants are nothing more than a general wish list, without any practical backup to resolve their worsening problems.
They are insulting hypocrisy, given that immigrants throughout the EU are subject to the harshest exploitation of capital, in poorly paid, uninsured jobs, with no access to fundamental social and political rights, permanently hostage to the reactionary institutional framework of the Member States and of the ÎU, which illegally keeps millions of immigrants prisoner.
The Greek Communist Party supports the fair applications of immigrants for legal status, the abolition of undeclared, uninsured jobs, increased wages and salaries, equal pay for jobs of equal value, improved, free public education and health services and full political rights for everyone.
The way to resolve their problems is through their integration in the workers' class movement, resistance and the development of its struggle against the anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU and the governments, which are responsible for the poverty and misfortune of local and immigrant workers in the ÎU and the entire world.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues welcome the broad approach of the Carlotti report and support the many positive and balanced elements of this report.
However, we are against the idea of integrating the migration issue into EU external policies, as stated in paragraph six.
We do not believe that a common strategy is the best way to deal with the issue.
We believe that policy in this area must remain within the competence of national governments and do not believe in a pan-European approach to immigration policy.
Â Â  â MrsÂ Carlotti's biggest failing, which can be found in all the European Parliament's reports on this subject, is that she thinks that immigration, rebaptised for the occasion as 'human mobility', is a human right.
No, we do not all have the inalienable right to settle permanently in whatever country we choose: the states must be able to decide who can enter their territory, who can stay there and for how long.
The quasi-religious philosophical prejudice held by the rapporteur has therefore led her to the wrong answers.
It is quite obvious that there is a link between development and migration: hundreds of thousands of people are forced into emigration by poverty, and it is clear, as the has been saying for years, that development policies are needed that will enable these people to stay in their own countries by giving them the means to live there with dignity.
One element of this is to organise the repatriation of immigrants to their countries of origin, so that those countries can benefit from the experience and the skills they gained during their stay in the European Union.
This is the only option that MrsÂ Carlotti's report completely ignores, and that is why we are going to vote against it.
Â Â  . We supported this report because it contained a number of points that we welcome.
It does not, however, criticise the immigration policy operating in the EU or condemn the underlying causes behind the migration of millions of men and women around the world.
The report fails to criticise the EUâs immigration policy, the prime objective of which is to exploit cheap labour deprived of rights while implementing repressive measures that seek to criminalise immigrants, men and women who simply want to enjoy the right to live â that is to say, access to food, health, water, housing, education and culture â the right to employment and the right to an income.
The report also sidesteps the underlying causes of migration, which are rooted in increasingly deep inequality. This inequality is engendered by the neoliberal, militaristic policies that lie at the root of capitalist globalisation.
These policies of liberalisation and privatisation are intended to promote the concentration of wealth and property in the large economic and financial groups and to manipulate the Member States into pandering to their interests, which demonstrates that they do not need interference and war to impose their ideas.
Â Â  . â On the eve of the Rabat conference, it is vital that we remember that cooperation between the European Union and immigrants' countries of origin must not be limited to helping them to strengthen their borders.
We must engage in dialogue to tackle the fundamental reasons why people risk their lives to cross the oceans in search of a better life in Europe.
We must facilitate codevelopment that is more closely focussed on the people, in order to reduce poverty and inequality, which are the primary causes of emigration.
The establishment of a European codevelopment fund will perpetuate this principle.
Finally, we need to remember that migration must represent an opportunity for the countries of origin: we can encourage migrants to invest in their countries, in order to optimise their impact on the development of their countries.
Â Â  I am voting in favour of this report as it does not set out legislation and does provide many sound proposals.
It emphasises equality, rights for asylum-seekers and assistance for integration and cooperation.
I am, however, against the proposals contained in the report that provide for greater power for the EU on migration policy since this would have a negative impact both in practical and democratic terms.
I am opposed to the inefficient new funds that are proposed and that the EU will be unable to administer successfully.
I am further opposed to the cost-ineffective proposal to pay the difference in wages for returning high-earners.
Â Â  â In MrÂ Schmidt's report, the European Parliament has tried to make a statement on the need to give fair trade a truly European political framework.
This approach is absolutely vital, because the pressure currently exerted by the increasing openness of the world markets represents a serious threat to the economic, environmental and social viability of the various agricultural models across the world: by forcing farmers to sell their produce for lower and lower prices, it puts them at risk by undermining their income, and is partly responsible for the deteriorating working conditions of agricultural workers and the deterioration of the environment.
Free trade can and must help to provide an alternative to this situation, which, by favouring the lowest common denominator, undermines the Millennium Development Goals.
In this light, the Commission now needs to send a strong political signal in favour of a system of trade that provides producers with a decent income and helps to remove any temptations to social and environmental dumping.
The growing popularity of free-trade products with European consumers is bound to act as an incentive for an initiative of this kind.
Therefore, even though I find it regrettable that Parliament has not seen fit to advocate special tariff measures (a differentiated approach similar to GSP+) to benefit free-trade products, I will vote in favour of the Schmidt report.
Â Â  . Although this report has the best of intentions, it ultimately fails to get to the root of the problem.
The producer must of course receive a fair income â so as to cover the costs of production and to ensure a sustainable livelihood â and must, moreover, be involved in the process of placing his products on the market, to name but two of the many positive points in this report.
This must not hide the fact that the broader ideas underpinning so-called fair trade are very much at variance with the policies of liberalisation of world trade, for example in the WTO (not to mention the free trade agreements encouraged by the EU and the USA), which seek to manipulate the production systems of the economically least developed countries to meet the expansion needs of the large economic and financial groups of the ânorthernâ countries.
What is needed is a policy that respects people's right to use the natural resources and to enjoy the production and economic benefits of their country in order to improve their living conditions; a policy that encourages mutually beneficial cooperation and delivers food sovereignty; a policy whereby natural resources and the strategic sectors of the economy remain public property and under public control.
Â Â  . I welcome this balanced report which explores the ways in which the growing popularity and number of Fair Trade products in the EU could contribute to our attempts to end social injustice and raise the standards of production in developing countries.
I have support for a number of conclusions for this report, namely that there should be adequate consumer information, a fair producer price and transparency throughout the supply chain.
I sought to amend the report to make sure that the conditions of production play a full part in the notion of Fair Trade through the need to respect the eight core ILO conventions.
I also submitted an amendment urging the Commission to liaise with the international Fair Trade movement in supporting clear and widely-applicable criteria against which consumer assurance schemes can be assessed, so as to support consumer confidence in such schemes.
Given the existence of several national schemes recognised by the consumer I would not at present support an EU-wide Fair Trade mark.
However, I think this option should be considered in the event that a proliferation of standards and marks leads to confusion among consumers.
Â Â  . It is well known that more than 65Â million people in the world have been infected with HIV, around 25Â million people have died and some 15Â million children have been orphaned by AIDS.
This is especially serious in the developing world, where of the 40Â million people currently living with HIV, over 95% live in the developing world, with over 70% in Sub-Saharan Africa alone.
Against this appalling backdrop, I wish to highlight the plight of women, who represent over half of all people living with AIDS and 60% of those living with AIDS in Africa, with women being between two and four times as susceptible to the disease as men.
Although we wish to highlight the declaration of the UN General Assembly Special Session of 2Â June 2006, in particular its references to promoting access to medicines for all, which includes production of generic antiretroviral drugs and other essential drugs for AIDS-related infections, it is regrettable that the declaration lacks any global targets or timelines on treatment, resources and prevention, and does not provide a viable action plan to back up the goal of providing universal access for all HIV-affected people by 2010Â ...
Â Â  â The next item is the continuation of the debate on the oral question raised by MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo on the results of the WTO meeting at the end of April in Geneva and future perspectives.
Â Â  Mr President, I think most of our speakers would like Mr Mandelson to be here when they are speaking.
Do you know if he is coming?
Â Â  â I am told that the Commissioner is on his way and, in fact, I think he has just entered the Chamber, so I think we can let MrÂ Mandelson make himself comfortable while the first speaker takes the floor on behalf of his group.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to make a serious proposal in addition to what was quite rightly said by the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo.
The results of the meeting in Geneva should not deflect our commitment to multilateralism, to organised international economic relations and to balanced and fair world trade governance.
Nonetheless, I do not understand why the Union continues to be at a disadvantage in the agricultural sector.
We all know that it has demonstrated a constructive negotiating stand.
The negotiating emphasis, with concessions, is being dictated by other leading developed and dynamically developing actors.
We must stamp out the delusions which some of our trading parties are taking pains to maintain.
Firstly, agricultural liberalisation is not a panacea for development.
On the contrary, it is only expected to benefit a few competitive exporters, such as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Argentina.
All recent economic studies agree that the greatest benefits from the current round are expected from the opening up of the industrial products and trade services markets.
Secondly, the liberalisation of industrial products and services does not only constitute an aggressive interest on the part of developed countries.
Gradual liberalisation, with the necessary technical assistance, will prove to be of benefit to developing countries themselves.
Thirdly, special treatment for developing countries is absolutely positive.
At the same time, however, it is by looking outwards that these countries will help themselves to integrate more effectively into the global trade system.
When it comes to the multilateralism or bilateralism/regionalism dilemma, we are unreservedly in favour of multilateral trade relations.
Consequently, further negotiation is needed, but keeping the principle of uniform commitment intact.
I believe that there are still margins for agreement.
The Doha round must not founder.
It is accompanied by major ambitions and expectations.
To close, I should like to extend my particular thanks to the Commissioner, MrÂ Mandelson, for his detailed report on the Geneva meeting and to honestly congratulate him on his negotiating stand.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to take my turn in thanking the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, and the Commissioner, MrÂ Mandelson, on their reports.
I believe that the breakdown of negotiations in Geneva last week created a climate of scaremongering; that was the climate that was cultivated.
