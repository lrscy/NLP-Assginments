Competition rules
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0217/2000) by Mr Evans, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission communication on competition rules relating to horizontal cooperation agreements [C5-0304/2000 - 2000/2154(COS)].
Mr President, perhaps I can begin by saying the introduction of the title of our debate no doubt had many Daily Mail journalists salivating, but the issues that we are considering are fundamental issues that go to the heart of what the European Union is all about.
That is the development of a true, single market; because if we were able to achieve a true, single market, not only might we find more unanimity within this Chamber, but we should be well on the way to serving our constituents by ensuring that we achieve real economic progress in Europe.
Therefore, this particular piece of legislation falls within that context.
There are a number of ways in which competition policy is important in driving this agenda forward.
The Commissioner, and I congratulate him for it, has seized the initiative in terms of the application of state-aid policy; we will be debating that in the second session in Strasbourg in connection with another report which I am currently taking before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
The other major area that Commissioner Monti has been busy with is the modernisation of competition policy itself.
We are awaiting the outcome of the Commissioner' s review of over 100 responses to his White Paper on the reform of restrictive trade practices and the abuse of market power.
Earlier today I heard that we may receive the result before the end of this month; perhaps we will hear more from the Commissioner about that in due course.
The reform that we are looking at, according to the Commission itself, forms part of the overall agenda of reform.
Within that context, I want to say to the Commissioner that business is looking for a number of things.
It is certainly looking for the things that the Commission was seeking consultees from about whether the current regulations have become too legalistic, too bureaucratic and could be simplified.
I have no doubt that the Commissioner' s proposals will achieve that simplification.
Business is looking for the development of confidence in the whole range of new mechanisms which the Commissioner is seeking to bring forward as part of its overall reform package.
I would therefore ask the Commission how he sees this specific reform, which is not controversial, in the context of his wider reform of competition policy which, as he well knows, might be generously said to be slightly more controversial.
May I turn to some of the detailed areas in the particular proposals that the Commission has asked Parliament to comment upon.
Firstly, I welcome this process.
The Commissioner is inviting Parliament to express its views in relation to the paper that was produced in April of this year.
In essence there are a number of areas where, having agreed with the thrust of the reform being taken forward, I feel that the Commission might give the matter further thought.
Firstly, I would like the Commissioner to explain why there is a contrast between the treatment of horizontal restraints and vertical restraints.
I would like the Commissioner to indicate whether, in due course, it is his intention to see further exemption categories specified in the legislation.
I have indicated that businesses are strongly of the view that the duration of exemption in the cases of research and development should be expanded up to a period of ten years.
Since the Commission' s own papers make it clear that horizontal cooperation agreements are generally not made in order to work against the interests of consumers, I would be grateful to see what the Commissioner' s response is in that particular area.
I would also be grateful to have clarification of the position regarding trade supplies, not least because that is an issue that troubles Mr Berenguer Fuster.
I know he has tabled amendments in relation to that.
I am particularly concerned to ensure that we take all steps to avoid a re-nationalisation of EU competition law and I would be grateful to hear what reassurances we can have from the Commissioner in that area.
Finally, business would prefer a lengthier transition period; they would also prefer the Commission to look at more than just the market share in assessing market power.
For these purposes what the Commission proposes may be appropriate, but deciding market power solely by assessing market share is too inexact a science.
Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Evans warmly for his report, and also for his statement just now, which has already placed this report and the Commission' s statement in the wider context of the necessary reform of competition policy.
We know how rapidly the world economy is changing and so we are also aware of the increasing importance of research and development, the value of cooperation between companies, and the need for companies to specialise, and hence also the need for specialisation agreements.
Competition is not an end in itself, as far as we are concerned, it is a means of achieving growth and employment, and if, like the Commissioner and ourselves, you champion a functioning single market organised along the lines of the social market economy, you do not favour unlimited competition, but competition governed by the necessary principles of political organisation, keeping in mind that we have a responsibility towards the future and our fellow human beings.
The point has already been made today that these are very welcome reforms, that there is a need for companies to work together, and that the statement affords companies greater freedom as regards their cooperation agreements, and will allow for simplification, flexibilisation and liberalisation.
That is what we have on the plus side.
We are also critical of some aspects, and there are certain things we would like to see.
The rapporteur touched on some of them, and I would like to explore them again.
Firstly, Commissioner, we believe that, in view of increasing autonomy, the people hanker after legal certainty.
I therefore ask myself whether treating horizontal restraints and vertical restraints differently will really lead to greater legal certainty, or whether it would not be better for both, to have a block exemption regulation.
Secondly, it is our wish that the exploitation of the results should not be restricted to five years, but should be extended to ten.
We urge you to make it perfectly clear, by including them in the guidelines, that reciprocal, or unilateral agreements on supply - 'trade supplies' for short - are not affected by the ban laid down in Article 81(2), and we take the view - which is also expressed in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - that you ought to consider the definition of market share.
Which market do we mean?
The buying market, the selling market, the national market, the regional market?
We all know that the market is in a constant state of flux for the businesses concerned, and we also fear that guidelines 122 and 141 will set an arbitrary market power threshold of 15%.
We feel it is important to increase this threshold, just as we believe that the length of the transitional period for introduction of these regulations should be increased to at least two years, so that your aspirations are fully realised.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Evans on his wonderful report and point out once again the large extent to which we have agreed on analysing the reforms of Community competition law as a whole, as well as the social consequences of competition.
It is true that the great beneficiaries of an appropriate competition policy are the consumers, the citizens as a whole.
We should not see this regulation as something that exclusively concerns companies; it is of interest to all of us as citizens.
We also agree on our positive assessment of the Commission' s attempts to modernise and reform Community competition law.
We must congratulate Mr Monti and the whole of the Commission on having the courage and bravery to complete a reform - which the Commission is determined to do - a reform that was started years ago.
I have said in other interventions that, in my opinion, it is not only necessary but also takes us in the right direction.
The Commission' s chosen path is the right one.
Having been in force for 40 years, Community competition law had begun to show signs of exhaustion.
There is no doubt whatsoever that the competition rules included in the Treaty, and in the law derived from it, have contributed significantly to the growth of a culture of competition, and have been fundamental to the creation of the single market.
On the other hand, the Commission' s decisions and the judgments of the Court of Justice have enjoyed well-earned prestige in terms of achieving this aim.
We must not forget, however, that those rules were initially alien to European law.
The European legal tradition, especially the continental tradition, concentrated more on aspects relating to unfair competition; the free competition elements were imported from the United States.
A Spanish business academic - Professor Garrigues - explained very graphically that the American soldiers who came to Europe to fight in the Second World War brought 'antitrust' legislation in their rucksacks.
Now, those positive aspects could not disguise certain deficiencies which had traditionally been demonstrated by the experts.
Perhaps the best-founded criticism referred to the rigidity of the rules.
It is true that it was perhaps necessary at the beginning to apply the rules so rigidly, because new rules had to be applied, imported from the United States, in accordance with the continental legal tradition.
I must add here that it is no surprise that Mr Evans' assessment and concern does not coincide exactly with that of his colleague in the Group of the European People' s Party, Mr Karas.
Mr Evans is behaving more like an Anglo-Saxon lawyer, while Mr Karas has demonstrated the usual preoccupations of continental lawyers.
I believe that this reform is more along the lines of Anglo-Saxon law and, despite being a continental lawyer, I agree with it.
I am not so concerned about legal certainty as some people.
Nevertheless, it is true that what was acceptable twenty or thirty years ago is not necessarily acceptable today.
Today, the single market is a reality and the culture of competition is sufficiently widespread.
Change was therefore necessary.
It is no longer possible to apply competition rules which do not take account of the economic analysis and a consideration of the market' s power.
In the field of vertical restrictions, the new regulations on exemption by category and the guidelines for their application have been approved.
The time has now come to introduce reform in the field of horizontal restrictions.
In this area, the Commission is now presenting us with two proposals for regulations, one on research and development agreements, and the other on the regulation of specialisation agreements, accompanied by guidelines.
It should be noted, as the report does, that there is now an noticeable difference with regard to the treatment of vertical and horizontal restrictions since, in the case of vertical restrictions, there was a single regulation and guidelines which covered all the possibilities to which that regulation applied.
With regard to horizontal restrictions, however, there are guidelines which are, to a large extent, broader than the two specific aspects regulated by the two proposals for regulations.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists has presented Parliament with five amendments which express some of our concerns.
Of these, I would draw your attention to our concern at the fact that crisis cartels are not dealt with. They were included in the previous legislation and have disappeared here without sufficient justification.
I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the reform, the Commission will be able to focus on tackling the conduct of those who hold power in the market, because it is that conduct which is genuinely anti-competitive and damaging to the market.
I repeat that in this sense we are in agreement.
It seems that we will finally be able to say goodbye to an over-rigorous and over-formal approach and welcome economic analysis into European competition law.
Mr President, in the proposals which he has formulated in the report under discussion, our rapporteur, Mr Evans, is calling for the Commission to relax the competition rules for horizontal cooperation agreements between companies operating at the same market level.
It would therefore appear that the Commission has a keener sense of fair trading than the European Parliament, despite the fact that, logically-speaking, the opposite should apply.
It is the European Parliament which should be more sensitive to the social impact of competition policy. Especially as, even though we have the most stringent fair trading legislation, the real world in which we live is a world in which large monopolies abuse dominant market positions, in which mergers, take-overs and acquisitions by corporate behemoths are a daily occurrence, giving rise to monopolies of global proportions which almost always lay off thousands of workers and have a huge impact on employment and which then monopolise wealth-producing resources, markets and consumers.
It is precisely because the real world is thus that we should be more careful and stricter when it comes to ensuring that horizontal cooperation agreements are treated and controlled in the same manner as mergers and vertical restraints.
This being so, we are unable to vote in favour of the proposals calling for policy restrictions to be relaxed, as proposed by the Commission.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Evans on the quality and weight of his report.
I would also like to express the Commission' s appreciation of Parliament' s consistently constructive attitude to competition issues, which we consider to be an important tool in the framework of the social market economy to which Mr Karas referred, the ultimate aim of which, as Mr Berenguer Fuster stressed, is to protect the consumer.
Mr Berenguer has also grasped perfectly the line which the Commission intends to take, which is to focus more on economic analysis in developing competition policy, but, at the same time, as Mr Karas, Mr Evans and others have requested, we are endeavouring to provide the greatest possible legal certainty for businesses.
Today' s debate concerns a major aspect of our attempts to modernise competition policy.
On the one hand, the Commission has drawn up a revised version of the block exemption regulations on research and development and specialisation agreements, and, on the other hand, it has prepared draft guidelines on the applicability of article 81 to horizontal cooperation agreements.
In this way, it is the Commission' s intention to codify the relevant case law and working practice as they have developed on the basis the evaluation of individual cases over all these years, without making any major changes to the criteria for evaluating horizontal cooperation agreements on the basis of Community law.
These documents are therefore intended to clarify the criteria used to implement competition policy in this field, certainly not to alter them.
I would like to stress this aspect, because there has been some criticism of the Commission' s proposal that it is masking a thorough revision of the line taken regarding the horizontal cooperation agreements.
These allegations are completely unfounded.
It is generally understood that agreements signed between competitors are likely to restrict competition to a much greater degree than other types of agreement.
This is certainly the case where agreements between competitors are intended to set prices, divide up the market or limit production.
We are certainly not attempting to make anybody think that horizontal agreements, which have severely negative implications for competition, will in the future be regulated less rigorously.
However, in the absence of basic restrictions, it is necessary for the agreements to be examined in their economic context, so that it can be ascertained whether they would have a negative effect on the market.
There is, however, clearly a need to update and clarify the regulations on horizontal agreements for two fundamental reasons: firstly, because these regulations represent a response to the present economic reality, for businesses have to react to increasing pressure from competition and adapt to a market which is in a constant state of flux.
Cooperation can often be a way to share risks, save on expenditure, pool expertise and speed up the launching of innovations onto the market.
It is an important tool, particularly for small- and medium-sized businesses.
Consumers will benefit from these economic advantages, but only if effective competition is maintained on the market.
Our second reason for revising the legislation in this area is the fact that clarification of the norms is essential for the success of our undertaking to modernise competition policy, an undertaking whose scope the rapporteur, Mr Evans, has grasped fully, and for this I am grateful to him, as I am for his reference to state aid, which is another, no less important element of competition policy.
The line taken is similar to that recently adopted on vertical agreements, and primarily responds to two objectives: preventing the Directorate-General for Competition having to examine cases which have no bearing on competition policy, and enabling the businesses themselves to establish whether or not an agreement would restrict competition and whether it would be eligible for an exemption.
The draft resolution shows that Parliament supports the aims of the reform.
The questions raised by you and others contain extremely valuable suggestions.
I am now, already, able to inform you that I intend to incorporate the majority of these suggestions.
I shall, in particular, recommend to the Commission that it adheres to your opinion on three major points in respect of the block exemption regulations.
Firstly, the maximum duration of the exemption for research and development agreements should be extended beyond the current limit of five years.
However, a compromise does need to be reached between the businesses' interests in exploiting the results of their own research and the public interest, in guaranteeing competition on the new markets.
I shall therefore propose to limit the duration of the exemption not to ten but to seven years.
Secondly, the restrictions concerning the possibility of parties exploiting the results of research and development projects carried out jointly should be as few as possible, in order to encourage the movement of knowledge, which is instrumental in both technical and economic progress.
I shall therefore propose, on the basis of your comments, that, as a rule, these restrictions be allowed to intervene only where they are to be applied to businesses which are not in direct competition.
Thirdly, the transitional period should be extended.
In this we can take the block exemption regulations on vertical agreements as an example and set a period of 18 months.
Then, with regard to the guidelines, we will certainly be able to comply with your request to operate a clearer distinction between the guidelines for horizontal agreements and those for vertical agreements, and to be clearer in our handling of industrial supply agreements.
The Commission intends to adopt the definitive version of the block exemption regulations and guidelines before the end of the year.
This would avoid a legal gap forming after the current regulations expire, but it would also contribute considerably to keeping Community policy up to date.
Mr President, this debate has touched on a number of other important, interesting points.
I do not have the time to comment on all of them, but I would just like to make a couple of observations.
Mr Theonas, you raised the question of mergers.
The care with which the Commission has exercised its powers in the area of merger control cannot have escaped you.
As we are required to do by the regulation, we are adhering rigorously to the criterion of prohibiting mergers where they would lead to the creation or consolidation of a dominant position.
Often, this is not the case - there is no danger of it happening - partly because the businesses are aware of this requirement and propose remedies which can, on occasions, be extremely effective.
Mr Evans raised the question of trade supplies.
I agree that the treatment of industrial supply agreements needs to be elaborated in the guidelines.
This will be done in the chapter on production agreements.
Crisis cartels, Mr Berenguer, aim directly at reducing output and raising prices; they therefore always have a restrictive effect on competition.
That does not exclude the possibility of such cartels being exempt under Article 81(3).
It would, however, only be possible after an individual examination of the case and the merits of the agreement.
That is why it would be inappropriate to include these agreements in the guidelines.
Finally, how does this all fit into the broader modernisation effort?
First of all I can confirm to Mr Evans that I expect the Commission to be able to adopt a proposal for a regulation to reform Regulation 17 of 1962 before the end of this month.
That reform involves the elimination of the notification system.
This, however, Mr Karas, should not reduce the legal certainty for companies.
In order to ensure this, the Commission is clarifying its present substantive rules.
We have already done so for distribution - vertical agreements - and we are now doing it for horizontal agreements.
Our block exemption regulations and notices will give companies more certainty on the contents of our rules and in self-assessing their agreements in the spirit of an overall modernisation effort.
This cannot be considered a renationalisation of competition policy but, more than in the past, it will benefit from the cooperation of the national in the cooperation of the national competition authorities and the national courts in the general effort of applying EC competition rules.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m.
Environmental dimension in the development process
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0215/2000) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Parliament Delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the Commission' s opinion on the European Parliament' s amendments to the joint position of the Council on the proposed European Parliament and Council regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries (amending the Commission' s proposal) [C5-0283/2000 - 1999/0020(COD)].
Mr President, the regulation we are now to be discussing concerns the prior conditions for ensuring that, under the European Union's aid policy, better account is taken of the physical environment and of basic natural resources in conjunction with various development projects.
This is an important issue because we know that economic growth can often have damaging consequences for the natural environment, either when natural resources are exploited, in the course of industrial production itself or when products are used.
Environmental damage has harmful effects on public health. It is in danger of destroying biological diversity and may also entail damage which jeopardises the long-term productive capacity of natural systems.
When and if that happens, the health of our economies is also affected.
By thinking in preventive terms and by choosing methods and techniques which interfere with the environment as little as possible, growth can be combined with proper consideration for the environment.
That is important in our own countries, but we still have a long way to go throughout the European Union.
It is also important, of course, in the developing countries, especially in connection with the development cooperation initiated by the European Union.
The requirements for integrating environmental considerations include extensive method development work and demonstration projects, as well as education and training, both of the Commission' s staff and of affected personnel in the recipient countries.
The regulation we are discussing lays down detailed rules for this and makes a nice large sum of money available.
This matter has been debated by Parliament twice before.
At the last reading, there were significant differences between our own points of view and the proposal adopted by the Council.
Conciliation was initiated, and we are now seeing the result of this.
From Parliament' s point of view, I think we should greet the result of this conciliation with great satisfaction.
We have achieved what we were aiming for in a number of important areas.
Allow me to mention three important examples of these.
First of all, the budget is near enough double the size of the original amount.
We have gone from EUR 50 million to EUR 93 million.
Secondly, the degree to which the Member States were to be involved in the implementation itself was a major issue.
Parliament' s approach to this question was to opt for the least possible involvement, that is to say to make the Commission chiefly responsible for the implementation itself and to evaluate it subsequently.
The compromise we have reached means that there is to be joint decision-making only in the case of activities involving more than EUR 2.5 million, when active participation on the part of the Member States is actually required.
That is a good thing, in my view.
If, as it ought to be, our aim is to simplify the provision of aid, remove the bureaucracy surrounding it and, in that way, close the gap between promises and commitments, on the one hand, and the activities carried out, on the other, it is essential that the Member States should interfere less in operational activity.
With the conciliation we have achieved, we have taken a welcome step in that direction.
Thirdly, we demanded at the second reading that the regulation should not be limited in time, that is to say that this type of activity should be planned on a very long-term basis.
Now that the development process is to be evaluated after four years and decisions then taken about the future, I think, however, that we should be satisfied.
Once the evaluation has taken place, we shall have every opportunity to establish guidelines, and more detailed guidelines than today' s, for this important activity.
I therefore recommend that Parliament approve the result of the conciliation.
Mr President, this draft regulation is one of the first regulations in the sphere of development policy to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure.
The European Parliament has done justice to the weightier responsibility it bears by virtue of its increased decision-making powers.
Many people felt that this regulation should be passed as quickly as possible, which has meant Parliament having to distance itself from many of its proposed amendments.
The path we chose was undoubtedly the right one.
We were able to make a few improvements to this draft regulation.
One of the most important improvements - the rapporteur has already mentioned it - is that the potential activities provided for by this regulation are to be adequately funded.
It was a great achievement on our part to secure an increase in the funding from EUR 54.4 million to EUR 93 million - i.e. it was practically doubled - even though we know that we would need a much larger amount to do justice to the importance of this issue in terms of our common future.
But that would lead to a general political discussion, which would of course be beyond the scope of this regulation.
Our proposed amendments enabled us to make a number of changes to Article 3, which is concerned with the nature of the measures to be carried out.
I am disappointed that Parliament' s proposed amendment was not adopted, because it advocated dispensing with bank guarantees or credit safeguards if need be, in order to make the range of applicants and the target group as large as possible.
Despite everything, I believe this represents a great achievement on Parliament' s part, and also on the part of the rapporteur.
Mr President, eight years after the Rio conference, where the countries of the United Nations acknowledged that development and the environment were inextricably linked, the European Union is finally adopting regulations to ensure that the environment is integrated into the development projects of developing countries.
Although we have cause to congratulate ourselves on the financial contribution agreed in the course of the conciliation - and I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group - the budget in question is still modest, given the considerable needs and still greater expectations of the populations concerned.
Are we not merely salving our consciences by granting just a little more than EUR 15 million over a period of six years to developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and South America when we are aware of the social, economic and ecological conditions in these underprivileged lands?
This budget line, designed to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process, will be of no significance whatsoever if the environmental dimension is neglected in the case of other projects.
I would like to remind you that sustainable development which integrates the environmental dimension fully is still, more than ever, the only model of development able to meet the requirements both of the underprivileged countries of the South and the polluted countries of the North.
On behalf of the Commission, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, and the members of the conciliation delegation on having put together a compromise package which the Council has already formally adopted.
The Commission supports the proposed regulation currently before you.
It considers it a valuable instrument for carrying out strategic and pilot activities in the field of the environment.
It is, of course, a supplementary instrument to the others at the disposal of the Commission.
Fortunately, our activities in the field of environment and development are not limited to actions funded under this regulation.
We are mainstreaming the environment in everything we do.
Hence, we intend to use it in a strategic fashion focusing, in particular, on support for the various international environmental conventions.
Plans to finance projects which will meet the objectives of the regulation are already advanced.
Once it has been formally adopted and funds made available we will proceed to finalise agreements for their implementation.
However, time will be against us since we are fast approaching the end of the financial year.
Once more, I wish to thank Parliament for their work in ensuring the passage of this regulation and the interest that many Members have shown.
I am confident that the regulation will provide us with a useful tool for ensuring that the environmental dimension is fully taken into account in our development cooperation.
Sustainable management of forests in developing countries
The next item is the report (A5-0216/2000) by Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, on behalf of the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on a joint text, approved by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council regulation on measures designed to promote the conservation and sustainable management of forests in developing countries [C5Â­0284/2000 - 1999/0015(COS)].
Mr President, with this report on the regulation on the conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests and other types of forest in developing countries, and with the previous report by Mr Wijkman, Parliament is reaching the high point today, with the corresponding vote tomorrow, of its first exercise of its new codecision competences in the field of cooperation and development.
It has taken the procedure a long time to come to an end, since we have spent almost three years on the first and second readings and on the debate in conciliation.
As rapporteur, I would like to express my satisfaction that such a long period has been fruitful and has enabled us to reach an agreement on the text of the regulation which I am today asking Parliament to vote in favour of.
We started from very different positions.
Basically, the differences between Parliament and the Council concerned the budgetary funding of the programme, the timetable and commitology.
Parliament had proposed, in previous stages of the procedure, numerous amendments which the Council and the Commission have accepted and I must say - it is fair to recognise this - that the Commission' s management of the previous programme, its high level of execution and its good results, have meant that the rapporteur, with the support of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, has been able to persuade the Council of the need to maintain the programme with a sufficient degree of funding to guarantee its success.
The tropical forests and their various functions and usefulness to humanity can contribute to a large extent to the achievement of the Union' s aims, not only in terms of development and the environment, but also with regard to its objectives of fighting poverty and sustainable economic and social development.
With the regulation, the European Union provides appropriate financial and technical aid with a view to promoting conservation and the sustainable management of tropical forests and other types of forest in developing countries, so that the forests may play their role as generators of wealth and social development with the sustainable environmental criteria which is expected of them at local, national and international levels.
The regulation says that the sustainable management of the forests must seek to improve the living conditions and well-being of the populations within the limits of the capacity of the ecosystems, maintaining the natural heritage and its biological diversity.
This must be done by promoting the active participation of the populations which depend on the forests and the local communities in the creation of policies and planning in the field of development.
To this end, it is necessary to improve coordination and the flow of information between Commission projects - those that the Commission will present in the coming years - and those of the Member States, in order to achieve more coherent actions and therefore a more efficient use of resources.
In terms of the budget, we should be pleased that, after the restrictions which, in general, have resulted from the plans for reconstruction in Kosovo, we now have a contribution of EUR 249 million, having started with an initial Council proposal of EUR 9 million, for a period of 6 years, from now until 2006.
This will provide sufficient funding to fulfil the objectives, at least with the same efficiency with which they have been fulfilled during the period which is coming to an end now.
Nevertheless, in the field of commitology the differing positions of Parliament, especially the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and the Council are well known.
Our position is more inclined towards giving greater competences to the Commission in this area.
We have not managed to reach an agreement, since this agreement is waiting for the problem to be dealt with globally.
However, at least the Committee on Development and Cooperation can feel satisfied because, on this question of commitology, an agreement has been reached which will allow us to establish the necessary budgetary estimates and a precise timetable for maintaining up-to-date information on the strategic guidelines and the priorities for implementing actions for the coming years.
To sum up, Mr President, this is a sound agreement for a sound programme for the conservation of the tropical forests.
Mr President, not only is the present draft regulation on measures to promote the sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries, very closely associated with the previous regulation in terms of subject matter, the political pressure and the political arguments used to rail-road this regulation through as quickly as possible are also reminiscent of what happened the last time round.
In this case too, we opted for a conciliation procedure, notwithstanding all the prophecies of doom, and I believe we substantially improved the content of the regulation in the process.
The active participation of the local communities and those who are directly affected, in the development of the national forestry policy and development planning, is now one of the objectives of the regulation, and this represents a major step forwards in terms of content, to my mind.
Parliament has managed to secure adequate funding.
The Council' s proposal earmarked a ridiculously low sum of EUR 63 million for the period between 2000 and 2006.
Parliament demanded EUR 249 million for the same period and achieved it, making the point very clearly in so doing that it is unacceptable as far as we are concerned to play the reconstruction in the Balkans - as important as it is - off against EU development policy and development cooperation.
It is vital that the Commission reports back to Parliament annually on the guidelines and priorities it has worked out.
Together with Article 11 of this regulation, which lays down an annual reporting obligation in respect of financed projects and measures, this provides us with the basic tools we will need to draw attention, in good time, to disturbing trends.
Mr President, my feeling is that the conservation of tropical forests should certainly be brought about through funding, contributions etc., but above all - and this is why the report appealed to me - it should involve the participation of the local peoples, providing them with ideas for a future for the forest and genuinely sustainable forest management.
A few years ago, the magazine 'Nature' featured a study into a Peruvian forest and the best way to exploit it.
This forest, like all tropical forests, boasted remarkable biodiversity: it contained a good 270 plant species in a single hectare, whereas a European forest can have as few as six or seven species per hectare.
Now, this rich biodiversity - which, moreover, is not confined to plant species - has a financial consequence which is in itself truly impressive.
However, there are different ways of accessing this potential source of revenue: for example, it is possible to cut down all the trees and sell the wood, which would bring in FF 5 000 plus another FF 15 000 from using the land as pastureland - which is what usually happens - or for crops.
In this scenario, the land becomes poor in humus and desertification soon follows.
On the other hand, another approach could be to exploit the produce of the land, such as fruit and the produce of the underwood, and to operate a system of controlled tree felling, which would produce an annual income of FF 2 000. In this case, the income would be regular, practically perennial.
This is just one example to illustrate that I am a firm believer in the principle of providing services, technical information and advice on a modus operandi to these peoples, so that they can sustain their forests themselves, for I am sure that it is in their interest to operate in this way rather than conducting mass tree-felling operations and laying waste to vast numbers of these areas which are so valuable for our planet' s atmosphere.
I would like to end by quoting an aphorism from Chairman Mao' s Little Red Book - which, although it is no longer popular can still be useful on occasions. It reads: "Do not give a fisherman fish; teach him how to fish better" .
On behalf of the Commission, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for his work on this regulation.
I congratulate Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n and the other members of the conciliation delegation for their efforts to achieve a satisfactory conclusion on the tropical forests regulation.
The Commission supports the proposed text before you.
As with the environment budget heading we intend to use the tropical forests budget heading strategically and in coordination with actions funded under the other instruments at the disposal of the Commission.
At international level I envisage this regulation to be an important tool for the Community to promote the conclusions of the UN intergovernmental forum on forests.
This area, as has been clearly expressed in these contributions, is crucial for biodiversity, for climate, and for our conscience in handing over an Earth that has these qualities to future generations.
Anybody who has had the thrill of being in a real tropical forest will never forget the experience and we should certainly not deny our children that.
Once more, I offer my congratulations to Parliament for this successful conclusion and I also wish to express my appreciation for the input it has made during the first and second readings of the regulation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Complementarity on development cooperation policies
The next item is the report (A5-0227/2000) by Mrs Ferrer, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on complementarity between Community and Member States' policies on development cooperation [COM(1999)218 - C5-0179/1999 - 1999/2156(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the increase in poverty, despite the gradual growth of world GDP over recent decades, the current tendency of Member States to reduce the funds intended for official aid to development in favour of direct investment, of which only 1% goes to the least-developed countries - which increases the gulf which separates those countries from the rich or developing countries - and the conviction that the globalisation process may increase the difficulties of the poor countries, are all factors which demonstrate the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of policies on development cooperation.
In the field of democracy and respect for human rights we are also very far from the desirable parameters: coups d' Ã©tats, violence, wars and violations of human rights are still realities in the least-developed countries. We must therefore contribute to correcting this situation.
In this context, it is essential to strengthen the complementarity of policies on development cooperation implemented by the Community and the Member States.
Firstly, because complementarity enables us to take advantage of the synergy resulting from a coordinated approach in the actions to be implemented, not only by the European Union but also by all the international donors, which will improve the impact of those actions.
Secondly, because it contributes an element of added value to the Member States' interventions, which will help to optimise the resources destined for development aid and to achieve better results.
Thirdly, because it would improve the visibility of the European Union and make its development policy more credible, which will allow it to exert the political influence it deserves as the main provider of funds - let us remember that between half and two thirds of development aid comes from the European Union - and both the NGOs and the recipient countries would like this influence to be greater given that nobody is more sensitive than the European Union in the field of social justice and human development.
Lastly, improving complementarity is important because the Treaty on European Union clearly establishes that the Member States and the Community must coordinate their policies on development cooperation and harmonise their aid programmes.
That is why we must take a positive view of the Commission' s presentation of the communication on the complementarity of Community and Member States' policies on development cooperation, since the measures it proposes may contribute to removing the obstacles which hinder significant advances in this area.
In general terms, it can be said that the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and myself, are in agreement on the broad approach of the document and on the measures it proposes.
Nevertheless, I would like to make some specific points. The first is that I consider that the Commission should have taken account of the fact that complementarity is not an isolated element, but should rather be dealt with within a context of a global strategy which also addresses the issues of coordination and coherence, since coherence is inseparable from coordination and complementarity, and, without coordination, complementarity is not possible.
Therefore, I believe that, in order to really improve the impact of European development policies and safeguard the credibility of the Union, it would have been much more appropriate and would have made things much clearer if these aspects had been tackled jointly within the framework of the communication on development policy, since that would have better highlighted the essential and inseparable nature of these elements in relation to the formulation of a development policy in accordance with the Union' s objectives.
My second point relates to the very concept of complementarity, which must not be viewed as a protective principle for preserving the competences of the Member States in this field, but as a manifestation of a political will to unite our efforts to improve and contribute more effectively to implementing the objectives of our policies on development cooperation.
Furthermore, the need to ensure the unity, coherence and effectiveness of Union action in the field of external policy - which is also laid down in the Treaty - must extend to development policies, since these are an integral part of the Union' s external action.
The Commission should therefore take the initiative and make a qualitative leap in that direction in order to allow the European Union to establish its strategic priorities in the field of development aid.
Thirdly, I must say that it will be difficult for measures to strengthen complementarity, alone, to achieve the desired results.
For that, the political will of the Council must, as a precondition, make progress towards greater integration in the field of cooperation, because what has hindered the progress of complementarity has been above all the fact that the Member States define their development cooperation policies more in accordance with their geo-strategic economic interests and their colonial pasts than with the objectives of the Union in relation to development.
Lastly, we should repeat that, as well as the operative measures to improve the management of programmes, with which - as I have said - the Committee on Development and Cooperation is in agreement in principle, we believe that the Commission should take the responsibility for reflecting and making proposals, which is an essential requirement if the Union wants to direct aid not only towards promoting the economic growth of the beneficiary countries but also so that that growth will reach all sections of the population, thereby fulfilling its commitment to the development of peoples and, therefore, its commitment to peace, since, without development, peace will always be difficult to attain.
In any event, and to sum up, I would like to reiterate the timeliness of this communication - even though we would have liked it to have been part of a global package - and say how fitting the measures are and that, together with the measures also proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation in my report, we hope that they will help to guide our action, providing better operational management.
I should repeat once again that the Council must show signs of political will, without which it will be very difficult to make the principle of complementarity a reality.
Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on having produced a balanced report.
It is important that we recognise the role of the EU and the extent of its influence.
We demand coherence and coordination.
I would similarly like to say how satisfied I am that the importance of the work of NGOs, which work independently of governments, is being acknowledged and taken into account in development cooperation with the express purpose of strengthening civil society as a result of such cooperation.
I also think that the recommendation that coordination should take place within the framework of the strategies selected by the target countries themselves is a healthy approach to the issue.
When we speak of development cooperation, in the same breath it is a salutary exercise to remind ourselves that development cooperation is not an objective in itself.
The objective is for the less developed countries to be able to sort out their affairs themselves, take responsibility for their own development, and act as societies in a manner that is just. And instead of hindering these opportunities, we should try to help put things right.
At EU level, this means, for example, that our policy should not encourage countries to survive on the basis of just one product.
Only those countries whose economy is in decent shape can benefit from globalisation.
Those developing countries that struggle along on the basis of one product will run into difficulties.
At EU level, we must also see to it that our values are reflected in our policy on development cooperation.
Conditionality must have its place.
Thus, we cannot aid countries that show no interest in their citizens' human rights or democracy.
In other cases we have to confine ourselves just to humanitarian aid.
I would also say it was vital that the EU should have a human rights secretary, in the manner of the Ombudsman, whose job would include observing the human rights situation in the less developed countries.
At EU level we must really be aware of the political effects of aid, as we already know from experience that aid can be damaging.
In fact the risk is considerable.
We have to develop the sort of aid that by its nature prevents conflicts, and does not fuel them.
Aid must be directed in such a way that it brings benefit to the worst-off of all.
Crises caused by environmental problems must be able to be predicted, and aid should not be given in such a way that it stirs up conflict over natural resources.
We have to learn to recognise those societies in which the risk of violence is associated with state-induced terror.
In channelling aid we have to see to it that it does not prop up undemocratic state structures.
Through the conditionality of aid we can prevent corruption and the oppression of certain groups.
I know that the issue is not simple and that conditionality is an arduous and cumbersome exercise, but positive conditionality, as it is referred to, can achieve a lot. Experience has shown it.
For that reason the EU should not shy away from it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before this debate we would have liked to ask the Council a question on the policy of complementarity. We tried to, but we were unable to.
It has not been possible, and we regret this because the truth is, Commissioner, that on this matter you are not alone. There are also the Member States and the Council.
In any event, I believe that the report which Mrs Ferrer has presented this afternoon is a sound report and, as she too has said, we would have liked to have a joint text.
We are dealing with development policy in a piecemeal way and this prevents us from having an overview.
Her report can, however, be considered to be an important contribution.
This report is of an importance which transcends the material scope of development aid policy.
As well as being a requirement of the Treaty, complementarity between Community aid policy and that of the Member States, is an invaluable instrument for helping the Union and the Member States to progress along a common path in the field of aid.
We Socialists believe that development aid policy in general must be the flagship of Community external action and yet there is no such complementarity, apart from a few pilot projects.
We are failing to use a mechanism which would to such a large extent maximise the resources, which are becoming scarcer, dedicated to aid as the political result of a joint effort, despite the repeated requests of this Parliament and the repeated resolutions of the Council itself, which basically has ultimate responsibility in this area.
Complementarity is currently expressed in operational coordination on the ground and in the commitology procedure in Brussels.
With regard to the former, I have already said that it is only applied in certain pilot projects.
As for commitology, I will give you an example of how this is not working either: the Latin America committee has only met twice this year, instead of on a monthly basis which used to be the case and which would be necessary for it to work.
Some of the programmes approved by this committee, such as the regional programme for the reconstruction of Central America in relation to Hurricane Mitch, are still to be implemented.
There is a clear lack of political will to implement the measures which we decide on in Parliament, and that leads to inefficiency in the achievement of our political objectives, to a gradual paralysis of the functioning of the European institutions and to a bad image which, as the previous speaker said, is sometimes projected to the public.
Complementarity with the Member States, coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments must form the basis of development aid policy if this policy is to fulfil this Parliament' s minimum requirements in terms of efficiency.
There are problems with the diversity of instruments and the duplication of procedures, but the real problem is the lack of political will.
As has been said before, the States must overcome their individual tendencies - which often reflect their concerns about former colonial relationships or other factors - and commit themselves to a common European project.
If we do not adopt this policy, we will not be efficient in terms of development cooperation.
The Commission now has the opportunity to include these elements in its reform and the Council has the historic responsibility to involve itself in the definition and implementation of Community policies.
Both institutions can rely on the strong support of the Socialist Group in Parliament in relation to development aid policy.
The policy of complementarity between national and Community policies has a total of 16 players (15+1).
Coherence between Community policies and coordination between departments within the Commission are intended to create what we wish to be the Union' s development aid policy, with the aim of improving the efficiency of European aid by helping to optimise the use of resources, both human and financial, and to make the European Union more visible, thereby making it more efficient and giving it a greater presence in the international community.
We hope that all of this will be introduced with the reform and that we will have coherent, complementary and coordinated policies in order to achieve greater efficiency.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Ferrer' s report deals with the Commission communication on complementarity between Community and Member State policies on development cooperation.
I share her disappointment that we are discussing this in isolation.
Instead, we should be having a searching debate on a global strategy for our cooperation with the Southern countries, which involves the triptych of complementarity, coordination and cohesion, also known as the three Cs, where Europe continues to fail so miserably. This, in fact, also goes for the Member States, because the European Member States simply refuse to take these values on board and prefer to stick to their own neo-colonial ideas.
The lack of efficient Community development cooperation therefore serve the Member States as an excellent alibi for not having to attain complementarity, and certainly not coordination and cohesion.
Some Member States make the bold claim that the Community should not adopt development policy but should delegate everything to the Member States.
We certainly do not share this view.
Anyone who is genuinely concerned about fair-minded world relations in terms of development must admit that, all too often, the Member States' own strategic and economic interests prevail over development interests.
At best, they try to mitigate or alleviate the effects of economic policy pursued by the rich countries in the fields of globalisation, our need for raw materials, minerals, oil, etc.
There is no doubt that we want poor countries to be included in the general economic and cultural developments in the world in the interests of the populations concerned and not only in the interests of the industrialised world.
This is why we need to free ourselves from these neo-colonial dynamics and relations which feed dependency and destroy the environment.
We need to abolish poverty in the world.
This requires a global, multilateral strategy, which, first and foremost relies on the coordination of Member State and Community development policy in every country, in every recipient country and at international level.
This is more important than complementarity.
There is no doubt that a more coordinated policy would have a far greater impact.
The contrast between the high level of European aid, which accounts for more than half of all aid globally, and the little political impact, for example upon ending armed conflict and severe violations of human rights, is really poignant.
If coordination and complementarity were already in place in the recipient countries, donor countries would prefer to hoist their national flags there too.
Is the Council actually prepared to change the system of comitology?
This, in my opinion, is a sine qua non.
It will be a real challenge for the Commission to delegate EU responsibilites to our delegations based out there.
If this fails, then opponents of the joint development policy are bound to press for abolition full stop.
With regard to coordination at international level, we would welcome a European approach which can be different from that of the IMF and the World Bank.
We do not want to be an extension of the Bretton Woods institutions.
We want to play a leading role in the world.
This is why these Member States should stop telling their electorate that nothing in Europe ever works.
It is high time they acknowledged their own share of responsibility for these failures, but we should do the same.
Mr President, we share the rapporteur' s view that, pursuant to Article 177 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the European Union fulfils an auxiliary role in the field of development cooperation.
From this article, it is clear that there is no question of replacing the Member States' development policy.
The EU aid policy is determined by the fifteen Member States and financed by contributions from the Member States, as established in the EU Treaty.
In theory, this is a solid basis for a decisive and clear DC policy, with implementation to match.
In practice, however, both leave something to be desired.
The payments, for example, pose a problem.
On the whole, two visions are to be distinguished between in the DC Council: that of the Northern Member States, which consider DC to be a valuable area of policy and which are, by and large, of the opinion that the EU DC is lacking in terms of quality, and that of the Southern Member States which consider DC to be merely an instrument of foreign and economic relations.
These discrepancies are marginalised all too easily by the EU in the complementarity and coordination proposed by the rapporteur and the Commission.
The reason why the Council and Member States suffer from a lack of 'political will' , as highlighted by the rapporteur and Commission, can therefore be found in this fundamental difference in approach to development cooperation.
This is why at EU level, it is impossible to develop cohesive policy in this area.
Finally, the Treaty terms the EU' s DC as supplementary to the aid from Member States.
In our opinion, this means that the Commission should provide the added value over and above what the Member States can offer, such as granting emergency aid in emergency situations such as natural disasters and wars.
Long-term programmes, on the other hand, fare better within bilateral, often historical relations between developing countries and Member States.
In any case, the Commission should not act as the sixteenth bilateral donor, which is the case in practice.
The European Union could, however, help coordinate Member State aid and intervene if the Member States fail to take any action.
We therefore partly endorse the view that European coordination and complementarity are important, but we do not conclude from that that EU DC coordination adds something to what should be the actual objective, namely coordination which unites all relevant donors, preferably under the guidance of the recipient country or, if this is not possible, under the guidance of the UN or the World Bank.
We will take a stance to this effect in the discussion on coordination and complementarity.
Mr President, the fine report which my compatriot, Mrs Ferrer, is presenting us with today addresses a problem which has been highlighted on numerous occasions and, at the same time, the urgent need to resolve it and open up new avenues in the relations between the united Europe and the third world.
The problem I am referring to is the notable lack of harmony and coordination in development cooperation action and policy between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and between some of the Member States themselves, on the other.
What has been described and condemned by many authoritative voices and, in particular, by organisations that work in this area - and also by our own Parliament - is that over the years the different Member States have been acting independently in the field of cooperation, often according to individual national views and interests, sometimes honourable and sometimes less so, but in any event without any significant effort to be coherent and fairly distribute roles, not even in terms of providing mutual information and even less in terms of coordination.
To sum up, there has been no effort to act rationally and efficiently so that the available resources, which are always limited, are not wasted and instead yield the best possible results.
Furthermore, until very recently, the required effort has not been made to reasonably coordinate Community policy in this field with the policies that at the same time were being carried out by the 15 Member States, although this is certainly not exclusive to the area which we are dealing with.
It was truly regrettable to see how Community actions were being implemented, sometimes without even an awareness of what each of the Member States was doing in relation to the relevant countries or sectors.
The result was, and to a large extent still is, so far, disparate actions, overlapping in many cases, and even the duplication and incompatibility of what each of us is doing.
This is absurd and is something of a disaster.
This situation was naturally unsustainable and was one more problem to resolve, but that need has become all the more blatant and urgent given that the very process of European construction, the reforms and the progress of the Union, are making it essential that we act on the international stage as one country, with one voice, and given that it is an undeniable priority for the viability of our project that we implement a common foreign and security policy.
In our opinion, anything we can do in the field of development policy is but a substantial part of this foreign and security policy.
That is what Mrs Ferrer demonstrates, and the heading of her report highlights the key concept of complementarity.
This is not the first time we have discussed this issue in Parliament, of course.
The faults which we had noted were too obvious not to have been raised in previous debates.
Nevertheless, by taking account of a situation which is particularly pressing, but also particularly favourable, we are taking an important step forward and we are doing so at a time when both the Commission and the Council seem convinced that we have to adopt specific measures in order to leave behind the previous situation and produce the coherence which will enable the resources which Europe intends for development cooperation to be more substantial, in both qualitative and quantitative terms.
Furthermore, in this way, we will achieve for Europe a much more decisive role in the challenge, which is of such concern to us, of creating a fairer, more balanced and therefore more stable world.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the same line as my predecessors, because, unfortunately, we cannot conceal the fact that the public image of European development cooperation bears no relation to the enormous amount of financial support that the EU itself and its Member States gives to the countries of the south.
Although the EU is by far the largest donor, it comes off far worse in terms of people' s perceptions than do the large multilateral organisations, such as the UN and the World Bank.
Approximately 60% of all financial aid comes out of the European pot.
Complementarity, coherence and coordination are the notorious three C' s at the centre of the debate on European development cooperation.
The European Commission' s financial housekeeping, which revealed a considerable amount of unspent funds, played no small part in re-igniting the reform debate.
Theoretical transactions do little to help our case though.
Nor can it be denied that there have been successes that should be shouted from the rooftops.
Above all, it is practices that must change, which requires the necessary amount of political will on the part of all those concerned.
Take Mozambique and the deployment of ECHO, for example.
Right at the very start of the flood disaster at the beginning of February, ECHO rushed to the aid of the most vulnerable with EUR 750 000.
Since then, a further EUR 9.65 million have been made available as emergency aid, and EUR 21 million are to be provided in addition, to deal with the consequences in the medium-term.
There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too.
The European Union and its Member States have provided a total of EUR 85 million in aid, whereas the UN contribution brought the overall international package to only EUR 115 million, including the European funds.
What we are lacking is the aforementioned three C' s.
Coherence can only be achieved if strategies and measures are brought into line.
Complementarity and coordination are important pre-requisites for creating synergy.
The juxtaposition of multilateral and bilateral development cooperation, on the other hand - which is in evidence in countries besides Mozambique - leads to completely unnecessary frictional losses, as I saw for myself when I visited the country a few weeks ago.
Mrs Ferrer' s report contains a whole host of proposals and demands that deserve our unqualified support.
I would like to highlight three points in particular: complementarity, coherence and coordination must be brought together in one uniform strategy because they are interdependent.
The political leaders and the civil society of the partner States must have their decision-making powers strengthened, as must the EU delegation posts in situ, which is already happening with the elaboration of national indicative programmes within the scope of ACP cooperation.
This will also require there to be improved cooperation between the delegations of the European Union and the diplomatic services of the Member States, which is a matter for the Council.
We need to redouble our efforts, in order, not only to further coordination between the EU and the Member States in this sphere, but also with the international bodies.
Since we provide the lion' s share of the funding for development cooperation, we are also entitled to clear recognition on the operational front and in terms of public perceptions.
There have certainly been positive moves in this direction, but they must be developed, and consolidated in a definitive frame of reference.
At the same time, we must overcome the burdensome legacy of colonial history, or the geo-strategic interests of individual Member States.
The lack of political will on the part of the Member States represents the greatest obstacle to us being able to practise the three C' s satisfactorily, because they have no real interest in efficient, harmonised development cooperation, thereby tarnishing the European image and preventing us from optimising our potential as regards development policy, which reflects badly on the Member States themselves more than anything.
Those in the European capitals ought to learn that strengthening Europe' s standing can do the same for their own image.
I believe that complementarity and EU coordination are among our most important tools for increasing the effectiveness and impact of EU development cooperation on the ground.
I therefore welcome Mrs Ferrer' s report.
Parliament and the Commission share the same considerations and agree on the approach.
We agree that we now need to see results.
We need to increase internal EU coordination, country by country and sector by sector, following the 1998 guidelines on operational coordination.
We should help partner countries in their efforts and reinforce the role of EU coordination as regards wider global coordination between donors, whether they be the World Bank, United Nations organisations or bilateral governmental or non-governmental organisations.
The Commission has already taken the first step.
We have adopted a harmonised framework for the elaboration of the country strategy papers.
We will use this framework in future programming exercises.
The country strategy papers will guide us when reviewing our assistance programmes.
They will indicate how Community assistance fits in with what other donors are doing.
These country strategy papers are the first practical tool, not only for improved donor coordination and complementarity, but also for overall coherence of development cooperation policy with other EU policies.
The country strategy papers should also steer us in the right direction for achieving an optimum division of labour between the Commission and Member States.
Collectively, we should be able to respond to most of the essential needs of partners in the developing countries.
The move towards sector-wide programmes will greatly facilitate this process.
I also hope it will produce greater cost effectiveness.
However, if we are to succeed in this, our Member States must join forces and participate in this exercise.
The quantitative aspect of how much each and every Member State is mobilising and putting into this effort is also part of our collective success or collective failure.
Let me comment on some details of your report.
Firstly, I note that at several points in the resolution, the issue of complementarity is placed within a broader framework connected with a need for greater consistency between the various policies of the EU.
I agree.
This is the reason we speak about the policy of the three Cs: complementarity, coherence and coordination.
On coherence - which we have often discussed - we have now established the coherence focal point in the Directorate General for Development.
It has been operational since the start of this month and we are using it and we would like others to do the same whenever a problem seems to exist concerning coherence.
I should also mention that today is a big day for coherence in our development policy and trade policy.
The Commission, having talked about quota-free or duty-free access for essentially all products from least developed countries; has decided to drop the word "essentially" .
From today the Commission has a clear policy.
It is now up to the Member States.
We are offering, for all products, quota-free, tariff-free access for the least developed countries.
This is a very good decision.
Secondly, I welcome your wish to strengthen coordination between the Community and the Member States in international forums and at international conferences.
We, in the Commission, share your concern.
It is paramount that we improve the effectiveness and visibility of the EU at international level.
This has been demonstrated at several conferences: we work well together and we represent a constructive progressive force at global level.
I have been invited to participate in the development committee in the World Bank.
No Commissioner has tried that before.
Next May we are organising a conference with Unctad, in this Chamber, on the least developed countries and we are also organising a conference with WHO and UNAIDS on 28 September concerning malaria, HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis, the three major communicable diseases.
We also work well with our partners at multilateral level.
Thirdly, specifically relating to the recommendations of the motion for a resolution, I welcome your support especially on two essential issues: firstly, human resources and, secondly, the role of management committees in development cooperation.
The lack of human resources is a serious and real problem that for too long has been ignored.
It has come back to haunt us and now requires action.
We are continuing our efforts at the Commission to improve the effectiveness of our services.
We are radically changing how we do things but this is not enough.
We also need the human resources to match our programme resources and ambitions.
Your support here will be crucial when the budgetary decisions have to be taken.
As regards the Member State committees that work in parallel with the Commission in the management and implementation of the development programmes, we believe that their key role should be to discuss political priorities and overall strategy with us.
It should not be to micromanage the process or examine individual projects as is, unfortunately, still the case.
We need to find more effective ways of working together.
The support of Parliament is also vital.
It was said in the discussion here that some Member States want to dismantle what we do collectively.
I do not think this is the case.
In any case, Member States warmly welcomed the overall policy statement which is the basis for what we do.
We also have a clear commitment on the ninth EDF and the financial perspective.
Compared with any other major worldwide donors, the Commission - and what we do together in Europe - is backed financially in a much more predictable and solid way.
This also puts a heavy responsibility on our shoulders but, the basis is that we are not only the biggest but also the most predictable and stable donor to work with.
In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur again for her excellent work.
This is a very useful report and I am determined to move forward on complementarity and will use the new tools available: the country strategy papers, the new and improved programming systems and a more effective management of external assistance, which also includes greater responsibility for our delegations in third countries.
I am confident that the European Parliament will provide us with the necessary support in these endeavours.
I look forward to continuing to work with you in an open and constructive manner.
The reform process is now moving.
We know what kind of battles to fight and, with your support, we are also going to win them.
Today we can be proud that we are doing all this and, hopefully, tomorrow we will also have reason to be proud of how we are doing it.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Trade in goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0228/2000) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation No 3448/93 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products [COM(1999) 717 - C5-0095/2000 - 1999/0284(CNS)].
Mr President, the proposal for a regulation before us relates to the scheme specifically covering exchanges of non-Annex 1 products with third countries, the main provision of which is for the granting of export refunds in respect of incorporated agricultural products.
Annex 1 of the Treaty defines the list of products eligible for a COM under the CAP.
These are basic agricultural products and products that have undergone initial processing.
Non-Annex 1 products are those that have been processed a second time.
The problem which has now come fully to light and which the Community has to deal with as from this year is the fact that, because of the consolidations granted by the Community under the Marrakesh agreements, refunds are no longer sufficient in relation to needs.
The Commission cannot be said to have been overly imaginative in seeking solutions to this difficult problem, where a lot is at stake for our manufacturers and processors of agricultural products.
Other than simply withdrawing certain products from the list of those eligible for refunds and in that way causing difficult administrative problems for the sectors concerned, one solution alone presents itself, as usual: that of extending the system of active improvement which allows agricultural raw materials to be imported at the so-called world market price, as long as the processed products in which they are incorporated are re-exported.
No alternative solution to the system of refunds on agricultural products has been seriously looked into.
Other windows onto the subject, opened by certain Member States such as Germany and Austria, were immediately closed again, since any alternative proposal was declared out of hand to be incompatible with the constraints to which we have subjected ourselves under the GATT agreement.
In the circumstances, we obviously have to give primary consideration to the size of the sector concerned and to the volume of exports.
Rapidly increasing exports of non-Annex 1 processed products alone represent 25% of total exports of products from the food and agricultural sector as a whole, and 2.5 million jobs, widely distributed among the different countries of Europe, depend upon this single sector.
For these products, additional access to agricultural product refunds at least constitutes a partial, quick fix solution which, in the absence of alternative proposals, makes it possible immediately to guarantee the competitiveness of non-Annex 1 products.
The parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has maintained that the ways in which the additional agricultural product refunds were applied should be determined in such a way as effectively to enable companies to have recourse to these within the acceptable limits laid down by the supply balances. In this way, it would be possible to maintain a sufficient quantity of refunds for companies which cannot make use of these, either in order to avoid GMOs or because of the unavailability of raw materials on the world market or the lack of staff or appropriate infrastructures.
That said, agricultural product refunds present a range of risks and disadvantages.
First of all, a disadvantage in terms of principle: agricultural product refunds do, indeed, by their nature circumvent the Community' s expressed preference.
The European agri-foodstuffs industry ought to be encouraged to give preference to Community raw materials.
This implies that, despite the extension proposed to us, the agricultural product refunds ought definitely not to become a structural tool but ought to remain a residual scheme and a last resort solution, to be implemented only when there is a real shortage of refunds.
That is why we are proposing a series of amendments which ought to be taken into consideration overall to reinforce this residual character of the agricultural product refunds.
We believe that any extension to the agricultural product refunds should be subject to very strict supervision and follow-up.
That is why we are in favour of establishing quotas for the scheme.
That is why we are also proposing that, at the end of the first year in which the scheme has been implemented, the Commission should present the European Parliament with a precise interim report providing, in particular, an update on the situation regarding each COM concerned.
In that way, we shall have a tool of superintendence and control with which to ensure that agricultural product refunds are of limited availability, that the amounts concerned are no more than are really needed, that they do not have an adverse effect upon our own producers of raw materials and that they are not concentrated upon a limited number of COMs at the risk of destabilising these.
A second disadvantage of the system of agricultural product refunds is the particular complexity and the cumbersome procedures it imposes upon SMEs in particular.
The latter ought to be given easier access to these refunds, which remain more straightforward to administer, and, in this context, they ought to be exempted from presentation of certificates up to an adjustable ceiling of EUR 50 000 per year.
Bear in mind that the refunds, particularly for processed food products, are far from being reserved solely for large businesses.
They play an essential role where SMEs are concerned.
These, then, are the component elements of a genuine monitoring tool which we think it essential to implement in order to ensure that the new agricultural product refunds are operating in accordance with the objectives which justify our agreeing to them.
In the longer term, however, there will only be a lasting solution to the issue we are to deal with today as a matter of urgency if, when the WTO agreements next come up for renewal, Community negotiators receive clear instructions to the effect that adequate account must be taken of the interests of our non-Annex 1 products and that the close links forged by our processing industries with our producers of agricultural raw materials and their countries must be maintained and consolidated.
Mr President, the Commission' s plans to slash export refunds will cost the EU' s food and drink processors an estimated EUR 145 million per year.
It is particularly galling that the decision to impose these cuts was taken without consultation with this House.
Export refunds are not a subsidy.
They compensate the food and drink industry for sourcing their raw materials within the EU at higher prices than can be obtained on world markets.
It is astonishing that the Commission chose to single out German fruit yoghurt, Scotch whisky and pharmaceutical products for these cuts, apparently for no better reason than the belief that these are wealthy industries which do not deserve assistance.
Other sectors, such as pasta, confectionery and some dairy products that also receive export refunds, have escaped relatively unscathed.
This is deeply unfair.
The cuts are damaging to EU industry and they will destroy the competitive advantage of our agri-foodstuffs sector and they will destroy jobs.
The Commission' s scheme to compensate food processors for losing out on export refunds, by encouraging them to seek inward processing relief on a range of commodities from outside the EU, is both muddle-headed and inept.
Not only does the scheme encourage processors to import grain and other raw materials from outside the EU - once again to the direct disadvantage of our beleaguered farmers - but it also involves a mountain of red tape and bureaucratic complexity which will virtually exclude SMEs from this scheme.
The Commission must devise a new system.
Those food and drink exporters who through adding value to their products, constitute a vitally important part of the EU agricultural economy must receive alternative compensation exactly equivalent to the value of the export refunds they have lost.
To do otherwise will place EU food processors at a massive competitive disadvantage on world markets.
Export refunds are essential to ensure the international competitiveness of non-Annex - I processed food. In addition, the food and drink processors in the EU purchase around two-thirds of all their agricultural produce within the 15 Member States.
This deliberate attack on non-Annex - I export refunds further undermines our farmers who are suffering their worst recession in decades.
It is also a direct attack on the fastest growing export sector within the EU, our processed food sector.
We are committed to 36% reduction of export refunds over six years and we are nearing the end of that period under our obligations in the GATT Uruguay Round Agreement.
However, these cuts should not be targeted in such an arbitrary manner on a small number of industries, as the Commission has chosen to do.
Access to IPR offers only a very unsatisfactory and temporary solution.
I congratulate Mr Souchet in drawing up a good report in the face of Commission intransigence on this issue.
He is fundamentally correct in describing the Commission proposal as a temporary measure.
There is no doubt that the whole system now needs to be dismantled and rebuilt in a much more sensible and less complex manner, in line with our WTO and GATT requirements.
Mr President, this proposal relates to an extremely delicate area.
We simply have to note that, basically, the system of inward processing breaks with the principle of European preference or, if you like, the system of Community preferences.
This is a very delicate area and, furthermore, the system of inward processing, in its application, is extremely complex and slow and therefore harms numerous small- and medium-sized businesses.
In this delicate area, our decisions, as politicians, should be directed towards maintaining the competitiveness of the European food industry in the world and towards strengthening the close links between the processing industry and the producers of raw materials.
The greatest responsibility in this area falls to the Commission.
We require a creative and flexible Commission, capable of judging changes in the markets, measured and, at the same time, imaginative. We need a Commission which gives priority to the European farm model and the defence of small farmers, but the truth is that so far all the Commission has demonstrated in this area has been its opacity, its discretionary approach to legislation and very little else.
As for the European Parliament, Mr President, both the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development and its chairman, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, have worked seriously and prudently on this difficult report.
Mr Souchet has produced a wonderful report, and I congratulate him on his work as rapporteur.
He has been correct, specifically in his proposals to limit and rationalise the use of the system of inward processing by adapting it to the situation of the markets, the regulatory framework and the budgetary framework.
All of this is correct, as well as his demands for exemptions in favour of small exporters.
Many thanks, therefore, to the rapporteur and the European Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will improve its work in this area.
Mr President, the Commission is proposing changes to trade arrangements for processed agricultural products.
The purpose is to end subsidies and restrict them by means of a certificate.
There are two fundamental courses of development behind this: on the one hand, the pressures caused by the liberalisation of world trade on reducing export aid and, on the other, the EU' s internal budgetary pressures mainly associated with external relations.
The food processing chain and, ultimately, the farmers, are going to foot this bill.
Already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the European producer.
In addition, costs are rising thanks, for example, to higher fuel prices and increasing environmental and other obligations.
Profitability in production is shaky, and this rather pointedly begs the question as to whether agricultural production in Europe makes sense any longer.
Our committee and the European Liberal Democrats believe that the EU must safeguard the profitability of the production chain.
The Commission is proposing selective deterioration.
We are, however, in a position of constraint.
It may be necessary to act in this way, but certain principles have to be adhered to in this issue.
The changes must take account of small companies active in this sector of industry.
For example, in the country I represent large export companies simply cannot exist, owing to the country' s small population.
There should be some flexibility in setting the restrictions in respect of export aid procedures.
For that reason, the wording of Amendment No 8 is justified.
It provides a degree of flexibility, especially for small companies.
I would also like to make the comment that by replacing cuts in export aid with inward processing and additional procedures the effects will be unevenly spread, in that a heavy burden will fall on the remoter EU countries in terms of transport costs.
For that reason I agree with the rapporteur that, in the long run, these procedures will not work.
This is a question of temporary solutions only.
Our group supports the committee' s amendments.
Mr President, when the Commission' s proposal landed on the table we rubbed our eyes a little in disbelief.
'Active processing trade' - what on earth does that mean?
Once I had immersed myself more deeply in the subject, I was amazed to learn what this was all about.
It had been clear up until now: industry buys products produced in the EU and is then given export refunds in order to be able to compete on the international market.
Now the Commission is saying that there is no longer enough money, however, because we entered into a commitment in Marrakech and now we are going to have to rethink the situation.
Then they have a brainwave to the effect that industry will no longer buy agricultural raw materials on the EU market but on the world market instead, which the EU, for its part, will export its raw materials onto, and in dumping its goods will also be partly responsible for world market prices.
They think that industry will now be able to buy there, local products will stay where they are, and industry will then make refined products from the aforesaid local products and bring them onto the world market.
We were absolutely convinced at first that there was no chance of this working.
Then we gave the issue every attention in committee, but the view I have just described to you is that of the Commission.
Subsequently, we tried to discuss whether or not it would be possible to sell products produced within the EU at world market prices, as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries do, so that, at the very least, the products we sometimes have an abundance of - although we do not produce surpluses overall, there is an abundance of produce in certain sectors - could be reduced.
But no, they did not want to float this idea at the WTO negotiations.
An apparently elegant solution was being proposed, which undermined the WTO negotiations somewhat.
There is a passage in the explanatory statement of this regulation which states that the Community preferential arrangements must not be undermined, nor must there be disturbances to the European market.
When I buy products elsewhere, which are available here in abundance, then of course I cannot assume that there will be no disruption to the market.
It seems to be a compromise solution, and my group is unable to accept it in its present form.
I would like to offer my compliments to the rapporteur.
Mr Souchet is someone who can always be relied upon to speak up for agricultural interests. His approach may, from time to time, be a little on the traditional side for my taste, but I am full of admiration for him.
You have done your level best for rural farming in Europe, and that is the spirit in which we will vote for the proposed amendments that we put forward in committee.
We endorse your report, but we intend to reject the legislative resolution.
We had to draw the line at this point, at the very least, because, overall, we do not think it is a balanced and reasonable solution, and on the whole, we feel, and fear, that if this mechanism is implemented, prices within the EU will come under direct pressure once again.
We will lead the next discussion we have on prices and the next discussions we have about whether prices of our products within the EU are pitched too high.
But what we in fact need to discuss, is whether the sale prices on the world market call for a price discussion, because no one in the world can produce goods in an environmentally and socially responsible manner under these conditions.
Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, makes a number of accurate comments as regards the impact of the proposed amendments to Regulation 3448/93 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products.
If the proposed amendments are accepted and the inward processing arrangements are opened yet further, Community preference, which has already deteriorated, will no longer apply in practice and it will be more difficult to place processed Community agricultural products on international markets; small- and medium-sized units relying on Community agricultural produce and Community export refunds stand to lose and large processing units buying cheap raw materials from third countries stand to gain.
The brunt of this adverse impact will be felt in the Mediterranean countries, including Greece, because these are the countries which produce these products and most processing units in these countries are small- or medium-sized.
It would be an affront, having created such an unfortunate situation, if we were to accept the proposed amendments to the regulation, even on a provisional basis, i.e. until the WTO agreement is completed, on the pretext of safeguarding employment and the value added.
That is why, despite the fact that we agree with many of the rapporteur' s findings, we disagree with his conclusion on the opening of inward processing arrangements, even on a provisional basis, precisely because we believe that, under present circumstances, provisional measures will turn into permanent measures and will exacerbate the situation.
Mr President, according to this regulation, the Commission is stuck with a limited budget, and this is due to a complex of three reasons: firstly, the guaranteed prices for agricultural products of European origin; secondly, export refunds to companies which sell these agricultural raw materials in processed form on the world market; and thirdly, the agreements within the WTO.
Mr Souchet is right in pointing out that it is not so much the limited budget but rather the WTO rules which are playing tricks on the Commission.
In the case of shortages of raw materials on the internal European market, the food industry can import these from the world market without any import duty and under inward processing arrangements, as has been the case to date.
But the regulation changes the essence of inward processing.
A shortage of raw materials no longer justifies the use of inward processing, but rather financial motives, namely reaching the WTO ceiling.
Suppose there was a surplus of cereals on the internal market whilst the ceiling of refunds had been reached.
Inward processing would then open the door to cereal imports from the world market.
There is a very real danger that the relationship between the food industry and the farmer then changes from one of partnership to one of competition.
European farmers are not just producers of agricultural products; very often they also maintain our cultural landscape, but at a price.
We should be very much aware of that price, which is passed on to the food industry.
It requires creativity to find sound solutions for farmers and industry within the strict boundaries of the World Trade Organisation.
It is inevitable that some industries will lose their export subsidies in the process.
A number of industries process only a small proportion of their agricultural products into finished products.
It is unfair in my eyes that they should complain, especially in view of the high profit margins they submit each quarter.
Small exporters, on the other hand, deserve more protection.
We back the amendments which have their interests in mind.
Together with the rapporteur, we would call on the Commission to keep a close eye on the balance between agriculture and the food industry in Europe during the forthcoming negotiations within the framework of the WTO.
Mr President, the Commission' s proposal to reduce refunds for processed agricultural products and to make inward processing easier carries considerable risks. I shall highlight just three of them.
The first is that this proposal is not driven so much by the restrictions imposed by the WTO, but particularly by the well-known budget restrictions currently being applied in the European Union, specifically due to the need to reallocate means and resources to commitments that the Union has given in the field of external affairs, notably Kosovo.
These objectives are not under threat.
They will have to be addressed in a transparent way during the major debates on the European Union' s options.
What is not acceptable is that little more than a year ago, the Financial Perspectives up to 2007 were approved, and now, a few months later, resources that had been earmarked for agriculture are being withdrawn.
The second risk is that the increasing use of inward processing could put us in the extremely dangerous situation of no longer producing many agricultural products within the European Union, since it would be more profitable to import them in their raw state, process them and re-export them.
Only a few sections of society would benefit from this and it would spell disaster for agricultural communities.
In the long term, the European Union' s dependence on external supplies in a sector as strategically important as food production would make the Union as a whole extremely vulnerable.
It would therefore be a foolish mistake to think that the practice of inward processing could be a lasting solution.
The third risk relates to our negotiating strategy for the Millennium Round.
This week, the Commission has approved a document on the competitiveness of our exports, which reveals its fundamental position on the various types of export aid.
The Commission' s position is quite clear: the European Union will not in future accept reductions, within the WTO, only in support for export refunds - there will also have to be reductions in all types of support provided by our main competitors in the international markets, ranging from export credits to food aid and state-run businesses.
All this will have to be "put on the table" and reduced under the GATT rules.
The European Union' s stance on this issue is totally correct: all types of aid which have a similar effect must come under the WTO rules, not only the refund system used by the European Union.
It is in this context of external pressure that the European Union is applying in the framework of the GATT, that is, the WTO negotiations, that it seems to be a mistake to have presented this proposal at this time.
To conclude, I should simply like to thank Mr Souchet for the tremendous job he has done, which we greatly appreciate.
Mr President, in complimenting Mr Souchet on his work, I express my disappointment and concern with regard to the Commission proposal to reduce subsidies worth EUR 145 million per year to the food and drink industry.
This proposal has serious implications for Ireland' s dairy sector and will result in a serious loss of trade, particularly in the area of the reprocessing of dairy products.
I fully support the rapporteur in his proposals that the measure should only be introduced on a temporary basis and that aid should be introduced to cushion the effects on the sectors which are most affected.
I have given the example of Ireland' s dairy industry and would ask the Commissioner to examine the implications for this sector in particular.
I also support the provisions in Mr Souchet' s report which states that we must ensure respect for the European agriculture and food production model.
It is only right and proper that we negotiate a new regulatory framework for exports or products not covered by Annex I as part of the WTO Millennium Round.
Mr Souchet is correct when he states that the decision to cut export refunds for certain products is unacceptable because such arrangements originally contributed to the management of the internal market.
This situation in fact was validated by the World Trade Organisation.
I believe that the proposed opening of on additional facility for raw materials that have access to inward processing arrangements will not be sufficient to cover the food industry supply and export requirements.
Long-term, Europe needs to exercise greater vigilance in relation to world trade - which is now under consideration - and how decisions taken there impact on our processors and on our farmers.
There is sufficient evidence that our competitors in the world market, particularly the United States and New Zealand, are not always as committed to adhering to the rules as are the EU Member States.
With the proposed enlargement of the European Union to central and eastern Europe, we must take a strong hand in safeguarding our European objective which, of course, is to develop agriculture as a major and competitive player in world trade.
Already our competitors have demonstrated their negotiating skills in this crucial area of international policy.
Mr President, you really have to rub your eyes two or three times when you read what kind of proposal the Commission has come up with by way of a solution to these problems, which have been discussed time and again.
It is absolutely true what Mr Souchet, as rapporteur, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to say on the subject.
They have my unequivocal support.
On the other hand, however, there can be no doubt that the bottleneck in the budget and also the special WTO agreements represent a completely new challenge at the end of the day, particularly where export refunds are concerned.
Who would have thought, even as little as a year ago, that we would be facing this conundrum, and having to weigh up the interests of agricultural product processors against those of the farmers who produce the products.
If the Commission is now looking for a way to resolve this export bottleneck in products that are not covered by Annex I, then it is certainly responding to a need.
Yet there is not the slightest suggestion in the Commission proposal that the problems facing the raw materials producers, i.e. the farmers, have been registered.
I am in complete agreement with Mr Souchet.
Thank you very much for all the work you have put into the report.
He rightly complains that the Commission is offering no alternative courses of action.
One thing is for sure though, there must be no restriction in the availability of raw materials at competitive prices, and at the end of the day, agricultural policy cannot be devoted exclusively to the protection of the raw materials producers.
But then nor should the burden fall on one side alone in agriculture, or have to be borne by individual products.
There are agricultural products that almost pay for the export refunds themselves, at the end of the day, owing to contributions from the producers, i.e. the farmers.
Sugar is a case in point.
The farmers' contributions go into the general melting pot of the EU budget on the revenue side, and if export refunds are cut then these contributions will decline too.
As I said, sugar is a particular case in point.
I feel we must give special consideration to this issue, and give it priority where export refunds are concerned.
Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, on his report, because there was only one possible response to the Commission proposal, which was not a good proposal, and that was a powerful parliamentary response, which is what we have.
I am extremely pleased with it.
It is also providing us with the opportunity to examine the situation we currently find ourselves in, as we are being forced to adapt regulations on two counts, which means that we sometimes need to adopt working methods which are not our own.
The first point is agreements reached at WTO level and the second one could be the budget.
I would like briefly to explain both, starting with the WTO rules.
It is becoming clear - poignantly so - given the price level in the EU but also outside, that we still need refunds, and there is also an indication that the difference in power between producers and farmers worldwide and those who sell their products is still far too pronounced.
As long as this is the case, we cannot in fact do without refunds.
This will also need to be spelled out clearly during the forthcoming WTO negotiations.
The second point concerns the budget.
It does not seem right to me to use this in the argument regarding the refund regulation and processed agricultural products.
Why?
Because the European Union has, for a number of years, awarded refunds to Member States because it simply was unable spend it all itself.
Surely, this cannot be the argument.
Secondly, Parliament made it abundantly clear in its report on the 2001 budget, which was adopted in the Agricultural Committee, that there is extra scope within the framework of the financial agreements of Berlin.
In these agreements, a number of proposals have been made for a number of export certificates in order to solve this problem. For example, an extra five million has been proposed for cereals in the form of spirits, an extra ten million for cereals and rice, eleven million for sugar and isoglucose and eleven million for processed dairy produce.
So the money is available and the solution should thus be in sight.
The fact remains that the agricultural policy is, in principle, there for the benefit of farmers.
This is why it has been framed with the European rural areas in mind.
The fact that this regulation is necessary also illustrates the close relationship between the processing industries in Europe and the farmers.
In this sense, an interim regulation is essential.
But I should add that, quite clearly, we should drive home the message to the processing industry that, first and foremost, we rely on products which are grown within the European Union.
In addition, I should also call on the Commission to give due consideration to small- and medium-sized businesses.
In many heavily agricultural regions, jobs are already thin on the ground, so it is precisely those companies that should be able to cope with this type of regulation and should, in that sense, be given more attention.
On behalf of the Commission and in particular my colleague Mr Liikanen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Souchet, and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for the preparation of your report.
I hope that your deliberations will lead to a consensus that opens the way for a rapid implementation early in the new budgetary year.
We all agree on the need to promote the Union' s processed food industry competitive position.
Export refunds are an important instrument in sustaining the industry' s competitiveness by compensating for high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union.
However, both budget constraints and commitments under the WTO severely restrict available refunds that will no longer be sufficient to cover the industry' s export opportunities.
It is for this reason that the Commission has proposed, within a balanced package of specific measures, an additional facility of inward processing relief - IPR - that will help compensate for the industry' s loss of international competitiveness.
The Commission can agree with your proposed Amendments Nos 2, 6, 10, 13 and 15.
The Commission can broadly agree with the purpose of Amendments Nos 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14 but does not consider them entirely appropriate for a number of reasons.
For WTO negotiations, a specific mandate from the Council is required therefore the present regulation does not seem to be the appropriate means of determining the Union' s position.
This relates to the first of the amendments.
Furthermore, some amendments could entail an administrative burden related to implementation and control that would appear disproportionate.
This concerns Amendments Nos 3, 11 and 14.
The threshold for exempting small exporters from the export refund certificate system has already been increased to EUR 50 000, which concerns Amendments Nos 7 and 8.
The remaining flexibility under the 2000 budget has already been used, which relates to Amendment No 9.
Finally, the Commission is not ready to accept Amendments Nos 4, 5, 12, 16 and part of Amendment No 1.
As a general rule, the Commission does not support discrimination among individual products concerning the possibility of access to inward processing relief.
This relates to part of Amendments Nos 1, 4, 12 and 16.
Moreover, the use of C-sugar in processed products for export is not possible under current market organisation: this concerns Amendment No 12.
Operators importing products under the IPR do not receive any refund for the export of processed goods, so the assumption in Amendment No 5 is incorrect.
Mr President, permit me to address two comments to the Commission.
Firstly, the Commissioner said: in view of the "high prices of basic agricultural products in the Union" .
Perhaps the Commission could get used to the following version: in view of the "low world market prices caused by dumping" , because otherwise we risk creating the impression that the agricultural pricing system within the EU is pitched too high.
No, it is too low on the world market because farmers cannot produce at this price.
Secondly, this is a report according to Article 37.
We reserve the right - I will discuss this with the other groups - to refer this back to committee, because what you have said, your assumptions that is, will of course put paid to the efforts made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It is then highly likely that we will enter negotiations.
I am just saying this now to give you food for thought. The honourable Members here will then be able to make their feelings known in the discussions.
I just wanted to give you advance notice.
Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to do so.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 11 a.m..
Enforcement of civil and commercial judgments
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0253/2000) by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council regulation (EC) on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [COM(1999) 348 - C5-0169/1999 - 1999/0154(CNS)].
Mr President, I speak first on behalf of the committee and will speak later on behalf of my group.
In finally presenting this report to plenary on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee, there are many people I should and will thank, but there is one whose inspiration I would especially like to mention because I hope it will set the scene for our debate tonight.
As a young lawyer in London in the early 1980s, I was privileged to work with a then elderly German lady, who was one of those remarkable German-Jewish immigrÃ©s who came to London in the early war years and entered the English legal profession.
This amazing lady not only qualified as an English solicitor, having previously qualified in Germany, but, as a true European of her own generation, she also obtained a doctorate from the Sorbonne the title of which was the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments.
She inspired me with an interest in this area of law and as she gradually retired and handed over her practice, I became more and more familiar with the workings of the Brussels Convention as it came into force in the UK.
I hope she would approve of where we have got to today, and how the European Union is now able to allow lawyers to move and practise in other Member States by choice rather than force of circumstance and that by this regulation our committee will further assist a step forward in giving greater access to justice to our citizens across Europe.
I want to use this occasion to say something about the importance of what we are doing here.
The original EC Convention on Jurisdiction and Judgments of 1968 was an important landmark in this field of international private law, marking a departure from a previous patchwork of mainly bilateral treaties between various countries.
For the first time, by way of an intergovernmental convention, the EC gave itself a special, unique and comprehensive regime of recognition and enforcement.
We are now participating in the next important landmark in that process - seeing what was a convention become a Community act, a regulation, in one fell swoop bringing a previous area of private international law into Community law and more importantly into the internal market.
How fitting that it should be our committee, with its new competence in this legislature bridging the themes of legal affairs in the internal market, that should have had to deal with this new Brussels regulation.
The committee has been at pains throughout this process to point out and highlight the importance of the internal market dimension of this proposal which gives us a chance to ensure even more strongly than before that our businesses and citizens can have confidence that contracts and obligations they enter into across the Union will be upheld by a common framework of procedural law on jurisdiction and enforcement.
We are making progress towards a system of civil law and justice that will give ease and certainty of access across Member State boundaries, at last beginning to make a reality of the area of freedom and justice proposed at Tampere.
The issue that has, of course, taken most of the committee' s time and attention has been the fact that this proposal for a regulation has coincided with the growth of e-commerce which in itself offers enormous opportunities to business and consumers within the internal market.
The committee has, as the Commission will be well aware, grappled long and hard with the issues raised in Articles 15 and 17 of the proposed regulation.
That is to say where there is a dispute between a business and a consumer, whose court should the parties have recourse to.
These two articles, in whatever combination, have to be read together.
The Commission proposal in line with previous consumer protection legislation took the view in dealing with Article 15 that all such disputes should go to the consumer' s court whilst willing to defer to a general proposition that contracts concluded at a distance should fall under this category.
The committee has been searching for a way of protecting Europe' s growing e-commerce sector and especially small businesses from exposure to 15 different and diverse legal jurisdictions.
The committee has therefore opted by a small majority in favour of the option of Article 17a which modifies the general principle in Article 15.
This modification allows parties in a B to C contract to contract in favour of the seller' s jurisdiction.
This was felt to uphold the freedom of contract of the parties but addition there is another element to which I will now turn.
I believe the committee' s most fundamental contribution to this debate will be the introduction of the reference of such B to C disputes to ADR or EDR.
This has been generally agreed to be the best way to neutralise the difficult discussion about whose jurisdiction can apply.
There can be no doubt that the Brussels Convention made enormous strides in simplifying the jurisdiction rules applicable to cross-border disputes but they are still a lawyer' s dream and a litigant' s nightmare.
They have not created real ease of access to justice.
The opening up of a simple effective system of cross-border disputes is the committee' s goal in introducing the concept of ADR and we welcome the way in which this has already been picked up and worked on by the Commission.
There was also agreement in committee that in this evolving area we remain deeply concerned as to the impact of legislation on Europe' s e-business.
Therefore, in line with the E-commerce Directive, we have asked for a two-year review.
I have covered the main aspects.
I wish to conclude with a note of thanks to my colleague on the committee, especially to our chairman who I know feels as passionately as I do about this area of law, whatever our differences, but my biggest set of thanks must go to the committee secretariat and to Mr Robert Bray for all his help and advice throughout this process.
Mr President, firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur of her presentation for what is a very fair and balanced report.
On behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I am pleased to be able to deliver this opinion, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Hazan, who unfortunately cannot be with us tonight.
My committee considers it important to give a positive response to this Commission proposal, which strives to make the recognition and enforcement of judgments between Member States almost automatic.
Not only does this regulation build upon the judicial cooperation between the States it marks an attempt to put the citizen at the heart of the Europe - the citizen, not just big business, money brokers and others, with perhaps profit purely as their motive.
My committee also considers that the provision of the regulation which seeks to protect the weaker parties in a contract should be approved.
This will enable consumers, workers and insurers to be safeguarded by effective European regulations that can be automatically applicable across the Member States.
Following this logic, it seems clear to us that there are no legitimate grounds to exempt e-commerce transactions from consumer protection rules.
The rapporteur has referred to this, but e-commerce is an area which is set to grow.
To differentiate between the rights of those buying on line and those shopping in the high street would go against the valuable work that the European Parliament and the EU in general has already done in championing the rights of the citizens.
E-consumers, in common with all weaker parties to a contract and indeed European citizens in general, deserve and should be given the right to a fair hearing.
Finally, my committee welcomes the introduction of alternative dispute resolution procedures and hopes that this regulation can enter into force as soon as possible.
Mr President, please allow me to begin with a few words in my capacity as Chairperson of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
Rarely have I felt as proud of my position as I am today in relation to this report, due to the work that has been carried out in committee over the last year.
The fact that it has taken a year does not mean that Parliament has not been interested. On the contrary, there has been intense and fruitful debate between the members of the Committee, as well as people from the academic world and all the interested parties.
I warmly congratulate Mrs Wallis on having made this work possible, as rapporteur, and of course I thank the secretariat of the Committee on Legal Affairs for the work they have done and, in particular, as Mrs Wallis has also mentioned, the work of Mr Bray.
We have had disagreements, Mr President, but I am sure that whatever the result achieved in this House tomorrow, the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs will have moved this issue forward significantly.
I shall now continue, Mr President, on behalf of the PPE.
As you well know, and as the rapporteur has reminded us, the main question being debated deals with judgments by the competent court on contracts concluded with consumers on the Internet.
I would like to say once again how proud I am at the balanced and detailed nature of this report. It proposes pragmatic solutions, which are likely to increase consumer protection and at the same time allow businesses, in particular small- and medium-sized ones, which make up the social fabric of Europe, to offer their services and products to consumers resident within the internal market.
The internal market must be a genuine domestic market, both for businesses and for consumers.
As for the consumer, it is proposed that the scope of the special system be extended to those who sign contracts at a distance within the internal market with no distinction whatsoever between directed and undirected activities and, as the rapporteur has highlighted, it incorporates the extrajudicial resolution of disputes into the regulation.
With regard to the promotion of cross-border electronic commerce, it is proposed to allow businesses, under certain very specific and very restricted circumstances, to insert jurisdiction clauses which the consumer could accept.
Mr President, I am convinced that Parliament' s opinion will have a real impact on the Justice and Home Affairs Council.
In fact, as Mrs Wallis has said, Parliament has done what neither the Commission nor the Council has dared to do, which is to hold a realistic debate on the basic question, on the protection of consumers in the 21st century, not the protection of consumers in the 19th century, nor the 20th century, with all the interested parties and taking account of all the interests involved.
When we examine the history of this issue, we realise that the Commission, in making its proposal, has limited itself to a draft review of the Brussels Convention, carried out by a committee of experts before the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, i.e. when this was an intergovernmental matter, very close to international public law.
Furthermore, Mr President, that committee worked alone, with no transparency, with no interministerial consultations and without consulting the interested parties.
It is clear that the Justice and Home Affairs Council expected that, given the weak institutional powers of this Parliament in this field, even after Amsterdam, the final adoption of the regulation by the Council would be a mere formality.
The clear unwillingness of the Justice and Home Affairs Council to open a debate on this question indicates that in recent times Parliament has been subject to every type of pressure.
After more than one year of discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say simply that the arguments levelled against its report lack foundation and are more the result of intimidation and demagoguery than of basic reasoning.
Let us look at this briefly.
Some people are trying to politicise the debate, hoping that that will create a left-right division, trying to take the consumer hostage, saying that the report would prejudice their protection.
This argument is both demagogic and unjustified and is ultimately based an antiquated form of protection, which is ineffective and grounded in a nationalist view that runs counter to European construction.
The solutions that have been adopted offer much more protection than those proposed by the Commission or - and here I disagree with Mrs Wallis - those presented to Parliament, which in reality limit the protection solely to consumers targeted by an Internet site, by a business.
Pseudo-legal arguments have also been put forward, such as the supposed incompatibility with the directive on abusive clauses or with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.
Well, there is no incompatibility with that or with anything else and allow me to quote the report, issued by the SANCO Directorate-General on 20 September 1999, which says, and I quote in French because it is the only version that exists: "The jurisdiction clauses are therefore possible and legal, within the meaning of this proposal, provided that certain conditions are guaranteed" .
It continues: "It is therefore necessary for the consumer to be clearly informed before signing the contract" .
It is precisely for this reason, Mr President, that the Committee on Legal Affairs requires strict conditions of transparency.
It is therefore not true that this report goes against an intended Community objective.
Lastly, and perhaps this is the most cynical of the arguments, people say: "Well, this creates difficulties for small- and medium-sized businesses, but they should be insured" .
That is like saying: "There should not be firemen in towns or cities.
If a house burns down, the owners should be insured" .
We must create good legislation, which is balanced for everyone.
To end, I disagree with Mrs Wallis' solution, despite the fact that we have shared this adventure, because I believe that at the end of the day her solution does not offer more protection to the consumer, since it only protects the consumer which a company has targeted.
A lawyer could spend years and years pondering which jurisdiction should apply in the case of active or passive sites or directed or undirected activities.
In conclusion, Mr President, it seems to me that in this field of judicial cooperation Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that it will not accept being sidelined or manipulated by dogmatic arguments that represent purely nationalist interests.
Instead, by dint of its thorough work, Parliament has here a great opportunity to demonstrate that pragmatic and reasonable solutions can be found to rebalance this proposal whatever the result tomorrow in this House.
Mr President, we all know that the development of the Internet as a shopping channel can bring great benefits: new opportunities for small businesses, for Internet start-ups and opening up the single market to our consumers right across 15 Member States.
It can lead to lower prices for them.
It can lead to a range of choice and we all support that, but we also know from surveys by national consumer councils, particularly in my Member State, that consumers do not yet have sufficient trust and confidence in the new technology to shop on-line.
I am pleased to see that businesses recognise that consumer confidence is critical to the growth of this small-business e-commerce network.
They recognise it is a precondition for persuading the consumer to shop on-line and therefore our key objective has to be to encourage that trust and confidence which in turn will benefit business by broadening their customer and consumer market base.
It is regrettable that in committee this debate has declined in some ways to business versus industry.
Both business and industry can gain from a common sense approach to this.
We can only recognise the full potential of business-to-consumer e-commerce if sufficient trust and confidence is there.
The way to persuade those consumers to take the plunge is to ensure that their rights are intact and this has to include, in my group' s view, the right to take action in their own national court.
There is a view that consumers are only engaging in buying CDs, books, low-value items, but of course we know that e-commerce is taking off in such way that soon they will be buying financial services, they will be buying cars.
In my constituency they want to buy cheaper cars from France and the Netherlands.
These are serious amounts of money and, as we encourage more consumers to go on-line, we really must give them the right to sue in their own courts so that we do not expect them - particularly poorer consumers - to go to courts abroad.
In reality we know that regulating the e-commerce world in the interests of both business and consumers requires a more innovative approach.
It needs a fundamental legal framework with innovative, non-legislative solutions and that is why I support Mrs Wallis' proposals: looking at the potential of ADR systems, looking at trustmarks, supporting small businesses in voluntary codes of good conduct, and finding mutually satisfactory ways to solve disputes.
Internet service providers have a role to play in this.
America Online, for example, runs its own merchant business programme where it guarantees to support the consumer in getting legal redress from any of the businesses that use them as a provider.
The reality is that none of these systems, of course, are in place in Europe, nor are they even really developed.
Even in the US, where only 8% of websites have trustmarks, there are still considerable problems gaining legal redress.
ADRs, therefore, cannot be a replacement for legal remedy.
The consumer cannot be bound to lose his right to go to court by contracts, as inserted in the report that is before us from the Legal Affairs Committee.
More work needs to be done in the area.
We need to create trust but, until these new systems are in place, there is no reason why consumers should not enjoy the same rights on-line as they do offline.
I cannot deprive my constituents of their right to sue in their own courts.
They are entitled to their own system of justice and we have to continue to support that.
We do not support jurisdiction clauses because my group also believes that these are in contravention of the unfair contract term legislation, by causing significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under contract to the detriment of the consumer.
This we believe would create more legal uncertainty, more court cases, more money perhaps for lawyers, but that cannot be in the interests of business or consumers.
I am very pleased that in my country the CBI has backed Mrs Wallis' approach.
It is a sensible position in helping us to work with business and consumers that we can ensure that court action is only the last resort and we can find better ways to resolve disputes.
It is a matter of some regret to me that members of the Legal Affairs Committee seem to have forgotten that it is our committee which bears the responsibility for the legal protection of the consumer.
It cannot, therefore, be right that we respond to the challenges of the new world of e-commerce by seeking to limit or constrain those rights.
This will send a bad signal to consumers.
It will not support e-business development and it will mean that we will not develop the e-commerce business-to-consumer sector.
I appeal, therefore, for some common sense in this debate.
I know that no legislation is perfect.
We are all struggling in the e-commerce world to get legislation that is right, to get the right balance between self-regulation and a regulatory framework which gives minimum guarantees.
That is why I believe also that this two-year review clause is sensible.
It will allow us to look at legislation, how it is impacting on SMEs and now it is impacting on consumers.
The idea of setting up a case book and collecting evidence is an excellent idea.
We now have to work to find practical and effective ways to resolve disputes.
This cannot be at the expense of consumers.
The opinion on this report revolves around Articles 15 and 17.
I now speak on behalf of my group, in respect of the amendments tabled by them and other political groups.
The shared aim of all of us is to try to find a balanced way of protecting consumers and shielding SMEs from differing Member State jurisdictions.
This problem has been exaggerated totally out of proportion.
From the evidence available, such cross border B to C disputes are few and far between and the hope is that most of them will now be weeded out by ADR systems.
But, where they go beyond that, it is the consumer who is most disadvantaged.
The bigger businesses will be able to afford legal assistance.
The astute and sensible SME can insure for a modest premium.
That leaves the residue of unsuspecting businesses that may get involved in a transaction outside their Member State.
In these circumstances it is not unreasonable to build on the previous content of Article 15, use the concept of "directed at" , acknowledge that this is a concept also found in American jurisprudence and utilised by WIPO.
It is not simple but it has been used and there is no simple solution here.
This, in combination with a modification to Article 17, which allows freedom of contract to choose ADR but respects existing consumer rights in the form of the unfair contract terms directive, presents a much more workable, legally certain package that will promote confidence.
It is a mark of the balance that we have achieved in these amendments that they have won the support of the CBI in my own country and more than partial support from consumer organisations. They certainly prefer this package to the committee one.
What I did not refer to when I spoke previously was Parliament' s role in this legislative process.
We are consultees.
We know from what has been said on this subject by Commissioner Byrne that he will not accept the type of formulation proposed by the committee at Article 17a.
I believe that Commissioner Vitorino shares his view.
From the Council' s perspective, the UK Government expressed a similar view.
It seems unlikely that a French Presidency, which is highlighting consumer affairs, will take a different view.
We could say that, because we are only consultees, we can say what we like.
We are merely signalling a political direction but it is important that we should signal a legally certain and workable solution, not one that will create as many problems as it seeks to solve.
Parliament should behave responsibly as a grown-up legislator, not as a petulant child.
We have the opportunity to build on the already substantial achievements in the committee' s final report.
I hope that we will go further.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Wallis, for her persistence.
It has been a long and hard road.
The European Commission has made a proposal which would ensure that consumers would have the right to take action in their own national courts and legal disputes arising from cross-border e-commerce transactions.
Amendments from the Legal Affairs Committee before Parliament would take that right and make it subject to unreasonable conditions and I cannot support those amendments.
The amendments shift the balance in the report towards traders and away from consumers.
Consumers can agree - prior to the conclusion of the contract - that they cannot bring proceedings against the other party in the courts of the Member States where they are domiciled.
The main problem with this approach is that it assumes that consumers first read the small print in such contracts and, even if they do, that they fully understand the implications of agreeing to forego the right to sue in their own courts and the differences in relation to costs incurred, legal systems, the choice of language used and so on.
It is unlikely that the average consumer understands or is aware and we cannot agree to their full legal rights being abrogated in this way.
I agree with Mrs Wallis that Commissioner Byrne was right to say that he would not accept this, and I hope that Commissioner Vitorino feels the same way, because this would be a disastrous outcome.
The committee did, however, agree to take a coherent approach to the law relating to the internet.
Under the proposal, key information contained in the court files in the Member States would be copied, using a standard form, to a centralised database for on-line access by interested parties.
Such a system will also promote the convergence and coordination of the different national legal systems and enable parties to check on the status of trading partners and suppliers, especially in an age of on-line trading.
This European causebook is very much to be welcomed and I hope that we will be able to support this report.
I want to compliment Mrs Wallis on the preparation and the presentation of her report.
I broadly welcome this report and I want to focus in particular on Amendment No 20, Recital 26 (new), which states that the Commission will consider proposals for the establishment of a Centralised Electronic European Union Causebook and Judgment Registry Database.
This has been justified very clearly in the report.
It is pro-citizen and it is pro-consumer and I would strongly urge the Commissioner to consider this proposal favourably, particularly in view of the fact that it is so pro-consumer and pro-citizen.
I would strongly urge the Commission to consider it favourably as we now live in a global network with a global economy, global companies.
But we have yet to establish an infrastructure to enable the Brussels Convention, as amended and extended, to benefit our EU consumer citizens and to attract inward investment.
It is necessary to establish the causebook which has been inspired by a proposal from an Irish lawyer, Twinkle Egan who has worked diligently on this initiative for some years.
At the expense of repeating myself, this will ensure that it is to the citizens' advantage.
This system has the advantage of having already been vetted by many reputable institutions including the International Bar Association.
The system has the attraction of being capable, of extension, to synchronising the international legal system of the global world in which we now live and trade.
The system would enable citizens of the Community and others to have prompt and easy access to authoritative and up-to-date information in relation to the existence and progress of trans-border litigation in which they may have a legitimate interest.
This system would also provide efficiency in obtaining and enforcing judgments within the EU.
Mr President, we must take note of the immense amount of work put in by Mrs Wallis and her endeavours to preserve a certain balance in an extremely complex report, for we are attempting to define future scenarios which will be extremely important for all of us.
This evening's debate may appear to be very technical at first sight, but it does actually contain major political elements.
One of our tasks is to establish ground rules on the working of the market and regulating the relationship between two of its fundamental players: the service provider and the consumer.
It is too simplistic to say that we are protecting the consumer by laying down that the applicable law and competent court are in all cases, without exception, those of consumer's place of residence.
In reality, the market, especially the market of the new economy, is a complex environment where the commercial relations between the actors and the variety of different ways in which it is possible to conduct a transaction are driving out all inflexibility.
Any of us, while we are here in Brussels, could buy something from Hong Kong over the Internet and have it delivered to Buenos Aires.
To imagine that we can adopt a regulation laying down a fixed rule for establishing the competent court, the applicable law and the place of residence of the consumer does not, in actual fact, seem practical.
If the person buying the goods were resident in Italy, it could well be of interest, for it would probably be an improvement on our Stone Age legal system.
However, in our opinion, the market requires the rapid settling of potential disputes by the transferral of these disputes to alternative systems of justice where experts are called upon to find solutions.
Today, new players are emerging in the construction of international market rules.
Consider, for example, the influence of the large law firms and global players in international transactions.
It is they who introduce new rules and new ways of settling disputes.
Written law is increasingly being replaced by unwritten law, which interprets the flexibility of the markets and provides solutions to specific cases.
The globalisation of markets is producing a plurality of legal systems created by the same social groups which they are intended to serve.
They are an expression of the market's constant need to move forward and expand.
There is interaction between regulation and self regulation.
The principles of sovereignty and territoriality, on which the nation state is based are, in reality, dying out.
What can businesses do, faced with the handicap of rigid regulations, especially the small- and medium-sized businesses?
Either they do not operate outside their own country in order to avoid excessive legal expenditure, or they put prices up in order to offset the potential cost of disputes.
At the end of the day, the cost, in the form of reduced availability of goods and services and higher prices, is borne by the consumer, who is at the mercy of our regulations.
What is more, we would be holding back the economic development and increase in employment which should, apparently, come with the new economy.
This is what is being advocated today by certain sections of Parliament, whose amendments display a purely demagogic approach.
We do not support this approach, considering also that, in the directive on electronic commerce adopted a few months ago, we laid down rules governing the signing of on-line contracts and confirmed the validity of the principles of the internal market, rule of origin and on country control.
Therefore, my group fully supports the position of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - which tends precisely towards greater flexibility - and throws down one final challenge: legal solutions for the markets now require global responses, especially in the context of the regulation of the new economy itself.
Of course, the European Union does need to produce its own model, but we must be aware that, without an international agreement, it is unlikely to be very effective.
Mr President, Commissioner, unlike many other MEPs, I am not in the habit of routinely thanking the rapporteur.
I only do so when there is a reason.
Today, we do have reason for thanking Diana Wallis for displaying what has most emphatically been the patience of a saint and the stamina of an athlete in drawing up this report.
I want to emphasise that the majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports her and the amendments she has tabled on the Group' s behalf.
I also want to point out that the debate has been frustrating to some degree.
If the same energy had been put into developing confidence-building systems instead of into lobbying which has not always been very professional, I believe that a lot would already have happened to create the confidence and confidence-building systems which are required if consumers are to have the courage to begin trading.
One great merit of this piece of work is the importance which the rapporteur and Parliament attach to consumer-friendly dispute-resolution mechanisms and the pressure they have brought to bear in order to obtain these.
This is important, and I do not believe that the same weight would have been given to this issue if this work had not been done.
As has been repeated a great many times, the biggest dispute, as we all know, has been about which court is to have competence in matters relating to electronic commerce.
This is an issue which will set a precedent, and that is why we have seen such vigorous lobbying.
It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection, for example, with tax issues and cyber crime.
We must resolve the issue of which is to be the competent court.
I believe that there is a lot to indicate that, in the future, we must have clearer rules specifically in connection with places of domicile.
We cannot proceed as often on the basis of where events have taken place.
This also emerged yesterday from our seminar on cyber crime.
What is to be taken as the domicile address?
That is why it is important that we should establish today that it is the consumer' s domicile address which matters in the end.
Finally, I should like to ask those who are going to support the majority of the committee in the vote how they can look consumers in their own countries in the eye when the latter become aware that the view of the majority of the committee will, in practice, lead to their being denied access to their own courts.
I should like finally to strike a biblical note.
I once met an old man who said, 'I am in no doubt at all that, when I speak to my God, I can speak in my own language. I also hope, however, that the same will apply in the courts I may be called before' .
I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Mrs Wallis for her tremendous effort and work on this very difficult brief and I also want to support the call by my colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, and my other Irish colleague, Nuala Ahern, with regard to the establishment of a centralised European Union Electronic Database on case-law, put forward by Twinkle Egan, a barrister from Ireland.
However, when we look at the difficulties which have arisen with regard to this report, when we look at the disparate views - the so-called purists on behalf of the consumers or the other so-called purists on behalf of business and e-commerce - we sometimes forget that a lot of small- and medium-sized enterprises are consumers themselves, who will be trading with larger companies or larger suppliers and who deserve the same protection that I, "as an individual" or anybody else, as an individual consumer, would have.
Therefore, what is most of all required within the new framework is certainty with regard to the protection available and the responsibilities of the people who are trading on-line.
I look to other legislation to see what analogies or what benefits can be drawn from it.
Under the various insurance directives, for instance, non-national insurance companies are required to have an agent in each Member State to deal with insurance claims that may occur in that Member State.
Why not put in place a similar requirement on on-line trading companies?
Likewise, under the consumer credit directive, the provider of the service is required to inform the consumer of certain rights, certain entitlements, certain get-out clauses as well.
It is not difficult to transpose that kind of ideology into a direct consumer-service-provider relationship also.
That is why, more than anything else today, we need to put this regulation in place.
We do not need to defer it any longer.
We do not need to put any more mud into the water.
We need to enable Europe, which is lagging behind in e-commerce and Internet business worldwide, to put in place new arrangements with regard to creation of on-line business and the protection of consumer rights and also to ensure that Europe takes its rightful place at the top of the world trading system of Internet and on-line businesses.
That is why it is important that we should support the general opinion, agreed by the Legal Affairs Committee and as proposed by Mrs Wallis, concerning those areas over which there has been some conflict, I take note of what Commissioner Byrne said recently in his speech about the other opportunities.
No consumer, "as an individual" or as a company, can be denied the ultimate right to take legal action but that does not mean that this should be the first course of action.
There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level, which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because, as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening, there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes.
Finally, I would once again like to thank the rapporteur and the Commission representatives for their work and remind all Members that there is another way under the Brussels I Convention and we can put other mechanisms in place.
Let us agree on this report and then make changes in other areas as they come before us.
As Mrs Wallis knows only too well I have not agreed with a number of things that she has said during the time she has been rapporteur for this important report but I would like to put on record my appreciation for the very considerable work and effort she has put into what she has done for this Parliament.
As spokesman for the British Conservatives and the Legal Affairs Committee, I want to begin by endorsing the remarks made by Mrs Palacio, chairman of that committee.
The process of which this debate is a part is, as has been explained already, a component of the so-called Amsterdamisation of the Brussels Convention.
It is an unusual process but one in which Parliament has to give the message from its consultation that the Brussels Convention must not merely be transformed into a regulation it has to be brought up-to-date to meet the needs of the contemporary world.
The Convention itself is old: it antedates my own country' s joining the European Economic Community.
It goes back to an era before not only the Internet but even before the commercially available personal computer.
It is therefore tragic that the Commission and the Council have been so timid in getting to grips with the reality of the modern world for we are in a world which is moving away from that of national jurisdictions into the world of networks.
In the world of networks traditional jurisdiction-based disputes-resolution procedures are of no real help to consumers and traders when things go wrong.
It is for this reason that the jurisdictional aspects and arguments must be squeezed out of disputes.
ADRs which are a form of bona fide privatised law, agreed upon by the parties and legislators, must be the first and the main means of resolving disputes.
They cannot merely be the pre-trial steps before a disappointed consumer takes refuge in his own legal system for, if they become that, myriads of SMEs will boycott the Net for business, thereby reducing their own profitability and their contribution to society and the national exchequers.
It will seriously reduce Europe' s citizens' choices, thereby reducing their quality of life and standard of living.
I hear my opponents say: there is Lord Inglewood representing the forces of reaction, flying in the face of the Community' s honourable tradition of consumer protection and arguing at variance with the detailed terms of existing European Community consumer protection legislation.
Taking the latter point first, I argue in the way I do because existing legislation no longer meets the consumers' needs.
After all, a later statute succeeds its predecessors and, if the form of protection the consumer is given needs overhauling, earlier legislators cannot and do not stop the draftsmen and their successor legislators.
When it is time for change then it is the time for change and that time is now.
The world has moved on.
We have got to move on with it and nowhere is this more clearly seen than in the debate we have had about the so-called directed website.
Such a thing is a contradiction in terms since the Net is a shop window at every terminal link to the network and, to argue in some contrived way, that a site can be directed at some and not others is linguistically facile, commercially nonsensical and technologically illiterate.
We have an opportunity tomorrow to vote for the 21st century, its consumers, traders and citizens by voting for the committee' s report or we can look at the future and then turn our back on it and find superficial comfort in the last century by voting for the amendments.
We, in my delegation and in this group, shall be voting for the 21st century' s solutions to 21st problems and supporting the committee' s report.
Mr President, I respect your tenureship of the chair and I yield to no one in that, but I wonder how you can justify the fact that you indicate a time and then in the case of several speakers absolutely ignore it.
I do not cast any judgement over the previous speakers or the substance of their remarks, but, if people have been allocated a period of three minutes, to give them 50% more is insulting to those people who have spoken earlier and have kept rigidly to their time.
I wonder whether you could justify why you have decided to ignore the clock?
I have not ignored the clock and I am very concerned that some Members may be abusing my tolerance.
In general, Members have respected the time limits for their interventions and, in any event, they have expressed their points of view.
I accept responsibility for this anomaly, which is going to be positive since we are going to gain time - if we do not waste it with points of order - and it is not going to set a precedent.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, could I first underline the fact that Mrs Wallis has spared no effort in submitting this report for discussion.
The report, as it was approved within the committee, is in my view a fine example of a document which has struck a fine balance between the interests of all parties, both small- and medium-sized businesses and consumers.
It would be regrettable if this balance were to be disturbed by tomorrow' s vote, besides which, it is highly unlikely in my view that the Council would be able to agree on the tabled amendments.
Allow me to explain why.
The terminology, as it is currently before us, is clear.
We talk about 'contracts concluded at a distance' , terminology which, even to a lay person, is far more transparent than 'directed activities' , as is currently used in the amendment.
Let me illustrate this with an example.
If a French winegrower recommends his crÃ©mant in French, a French consumer may well enjoy protection under the Brussels convention, because the winegrower' s 'activities' are 'purposely directed in a substantial way' , but the English, Belgian or Italian consumer will not enjoy this protection because the activities were not purposely directed in a substantial way to those consumers.
This creates considerable legal uncertainty and will lead to various procedures having to be thrashed out before the courts where each case will need to be examined individually to establish whether the activities were purposely directed or not.
Secondly, it is crucial in my opinion that the report offers parties themselves the opportunity of building a competence clause into their contracts.
Contractual freedom is a fundamental principle.
If we deny a party contractual freedom and, with it, the constitutional right to go to court, I can foresee various procedures needing to be instituted on account of denial of justice.
In my view, the Brussels convention is of major strategic importance for the development of e-commerce within the internal market and it will also have a major impact on the success or failure of small- and medium-sized businesses.
I therefore hope that this report, as approved in the committee, will be adopted in its unamended form in the plenary tomorrow.
Mr President, as I have said in this Chamber on previous occasions, I have the privilege of working in a very interesting Legal Affairs Committee and being one of the few non-lawyers on the committee.
Diana Wallis as a distinguished international lawyer has been the ideal person to work on this very complex file.
I would like to thank her for the way she has done it and the way she has so freely shared her knowledge with us.
I have certainly learned a great deal from it.
I want to pick up on what is a central point for me: we are, as my colleague Lord Inglewood said, trying to reflect a new world in which we want small businesses to take advantage of the most powerful, international marketing tool that they have ever been offered.
There are many business that we want to use the network, the Internet, to sell to consumers all over Europe.
Many of those small business will have no experience of exporting, they will not have a network of lawyers, they will be uncertain themselves about how they are going to deal with consumer complaints.
The way that the committee has finally structured its approach strikes exactly the right balance.
Let us be clear, that what we have proposed in these alternative jurisdiction clauses is not something for the larger businesses.
Large businesses, even medium-sized businesses, will have offices all over Europe, they will have lawyers, they will be able to deal with consumers in that respect.
The basis of consumers being able to go to the court of their domicile to receive justice in the event of disputes still remains intact.
Listening to some of the speeches you have heard this evening, you would think that option was under threat.
We have had Mrs Ahern - I am sorry she is not here - saying it will be a disastrous outcome if the committee' s report is voted through.
I fundamentally disagree with that.
What we have done is offer small companies the alternative of doing something else.
They can offer consumers alternative jurisdiction but only under very specific conditions.
A double lock is built in there, because they must agree to incorporate an alternative dispute-resolution mechanism before they can use the alternative clause and the terms must also be made very clear to the consumer concerned before he accepts them.
Let us think about this on-line world, ladies and gentlemen, and those of you who have shopped on-line will know that you are offered the conditions and you must positively accept them.
You press the button, you move your mouse, you make a conscious decision.
How many of you, when you last had your gas or electricity bill, turned it over to look at the small print - the conditions?
How many of you realised that you were accepting them?
In the on-line world, we must think differently.
We are thinking in the old world here - some of our colleagues are thinking in the old world.
What we need to do tomorrow is to accept the committee' s report and move forward.
That is our role as a grown-up legislator: to think about new ideas, encourage change and not necessarily, as Lord Inglewood said, go along with an accepted wisdom that has been with us for many years.
About 18 months ago the Council of the European Union nodded through a draft of the new Brussels regulation which essentially rubber-stamped old principles supposedly in order to apply them to modern conditions, but without thought, without real discussion and without consultation, I hope, whatever the result of the vote tomorrow, that both the Commission and Council will take note of the very extensive discussions and debate which we have had in this Parliament, which have taken account of the concerns both of business and consumers.
I disagree with Mrs Wallis' suggestion that, because of some criticism from David Byrne of the result reached in the Legal Affairs Committee, we should give way now.
I would say it is our democratic duty to stand up for what we believe is the right solution for consumers and for e-commerce in the European Union regardless of whether that gives distress to Mr Byrne or not.
I would give my wholehearted support to the conclusion reached in the Legal Affairs Committee.
It is a common-sense balance between, on the one hand, protecting consumers and, on the other hand, ensuring that those same consumers have access to the low prices and wide choices that are available with the truly competitive market.
We have to decide, in a new era where physical location has become almost meaningless, where a dispute is eventually litigated, where a dispute is eventually solved.
To allow consumers and businesses the freedom to make that choice themselves is the most pragmatic and the most common-sense solution and this gives the maximum certainty both to business and to consumers.
It does not strip consumers of their pre-existing rights.
It gives them choices and it reflects their enhanced status in a new Internet world, which gives them more power and more choices than ever before.
If small businesses are driven out of the market because of the proposals from the Commission or if we adopt Mrs Wallis' amendments tomorrow then it will be consumers who suffer because it will leave them at the mercy of the large global players and it will deprive them of the low prices that they deserve under the new Internet economy.
Even more importantly, it will also threaten the new economy and the e-economy in the European Union.
We are sadly far behind the United States and, if tomorrow we support the amendments proposed by Mrs Wallis, we will stay far behind the United States.
