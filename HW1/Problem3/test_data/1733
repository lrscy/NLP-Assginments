The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded.
The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions on Chechnya:
B5-0037/2003 by Mr Paasilinna and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: non-extension of the OSCE mandate in Chechnya;
B5-0041/2003 by Mr Suominen, Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: non-extension of the OSCE mandate in Chechnya;
B5-0042/2003 by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party: Chechnya;
B5-0047/2003 by Mr Staes, Mr Wuori, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mrs Isler BÃ©guin and Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: the situation in Chechnya;
B5-0049/2003 by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left: the situation in Chechnya.
Madam President, unfortunately, the situation in Chechnya really has not improved, despite the efforts to persuade Russia to adopt a rational course.
We have repeatedly stressed that the fight against terrorism is an entirely justified, indeed necessary, fight.
However, in the case of Chechnya - and this applies to similar situations in the context of Iraq and other regions as well - we have always stressed that bombs, military aggression and military measures are unsuitable as a means of resolving the issue of terrorism.
For this reason, we also need to make it very clear to Russia that we are profoundly disappointed that Russia - which is and should be a partner of the European Union - has failed to pursue a rational policy aimed at combating the causes of terrorism as well as terrorism itself.
We are deeply disappointed that people are being forced to return to this unsafe country and that even the expellees are being forcibly repatriated.
We believe that every option must be exhausted to achieve a peaceful solution here.
One such option could be the referendum if it takes place under objective conditions.
The people themselves should have a chance to express their views, and I believe that it would do Putin's and indeed Russia's reputation good if Russia could revert to, or basically establish for the first time, a rational and peaceful policy on Chechnya.
Reports from Chechnya are still extremely shocking to us all.
Russian troops ride roughshod over the people in their fight against the rebel troops of the Republic of Chechnya.
There are people there living in extraordinarily wretched conditions, both within Chechnya and outside.
Those who have managed to flee are then forced to return to an area that is really impossible to live in.
Crimes by the military are inadequately prosecuted, and by bringing this resolution we want to protest against this.
Grozny is still extremely unsafe, which indicates that the fight against the so-called rebels in Chechnya has not yet come to an end by a long chalk.
Buildings are being blown up and the people the European Parliament delegation went there to open discussions with are all lying in hospital.
In that context, the best the Russians could do was to postpone the visit of the European Parliament delegation to Chechnya.
The official reason for this is perhaps odd, but we hear through diplomatic channels that this is on account of the fact that security there absolutely cannot be guaranteed, something which the Russian state naturally views as a scandal, which it is.
In that context the OSCE is regarded as a busybody whose mandate should rather not be renewed.
We also protest against that.
We definitely want the OSCE's mandate to continue, as the OSCE is absolutely necessary for the provision of aid and for political initiatives later on when observing a possible referendum.
Another busybody, Mr Erkel, who was the head of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres in Dagestan, the territory bordering on Chechnya, has been kidnapped.
We do not know by whom.
No ransom has been demanded.
It is therefore entirely possible that this man has been captured by the authorities themselves, as has happened in the past.
I have asked the Commission and the Council about this.
Fellow MEPs in various other parties have highlighted this and are completely behind it.
We want the Commission to make efforts to find out what has happened to Mr Erkel and to see whether it would be possible to obtain his release.
Anyway, the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view, and the resolution bears witness to this.
A white list for Chechen leaders, as has been proposed in an amendment, seems to us to be counterproductive, however.
It is restrictive, and our group is inclined to think that the Danish government pursued a very good policy on this point.
They did not need a white list.
Madam President, with regard to the Chechens, we risk being guilty of the same crime as European passivity towards the genocide of the Jews: the crime of indifference.
Indifference makes us accomplices.
80 000 people have died in Chechnya since 1999.
Hundreds of thousands have been made refugees.
Yes, we appreciate Russian cooperation in the fight against terrorism, but that is no reason to turn a blind eye to humanitarian atrocities by both sides in Chechnya.
The only way forward is negotiations for a political solution, a referendum and elections.
The OSCE mission must be allowed to stay as an aid to that process, just as the Russians are in Kosovo.
The Russians are trying to extradite Ahmed Zakayev, the envoy of the Chechen president.
The Danish Government refused, due to lack of evidence of his participation in criminal acts.
The British Government, now considering a similar request, should tell the Russians that, on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions in the EU, we recognise the considered Danish decision and refuse his extradition to Russia.
Otherwise there is no point in having this principle of mutual recognition of national decisions within the European Union.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is, I believe, the third or fourth debate on Chechnya in one year.
It shows how determined Parliament is not to remain silent about this war.
According to reports, our Russian friends are not impressed by this type of debate and are also not impressed by the resolutions we are adopting here.
I have always been taught that you must always tell your friends the truth, that you must not withhold anything.
If friends keep quiet in front of each other, they are doing the wrong thing.
I would like to send this message to our Russian friends.
The situation in Chechnya is bad.
Let us acknowledge that.
We all know that, and the Russians must also have the courage to acknowledge it.
Various fellow MEPs have already pointed this out.
People disappear, people are tortured and relief workers are kidnapped.
There is a real guerrilla war in progress.
A dirty war on the part of the Russians, but also on the part of the Chechen rebels.
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is terrible.
Yet the Russians are now trying to force these people to return to Chechnya.
We all know that this is not a good thing to do during the winter months and is in fact impossible.
The OSCE is being removed from Chechnya.
The Russians evidently do not want any busybodies there.
Just as they are actually preventing us from going there with a delegation.
They use what I believe to be specious arguments for this in a letter to our President.
The truth is that they do not have the situation in Chechnya under control at the moment and they cannot guarantee our safety.
We all know that our Russian colleagues are very dissatisfied with the resolutions we are adopting.
Nevertheless, the present resolution is very balanced. It is a resolution that shows that we in Parliament want a solution and that we really want to make a positive contribution to this.
I therefore call on our Russian colleagues to resume the dialogue with our Parliament in order to engage with us in an honest and proper way and to ensure that we can ultimately bring the two parties together with a view to reaching a political solution.
Madam President, please allow me, at the start of today's debate, to express my sympathy for the relatives of the victims of the terrorist attack on Grozny.
These crimes, which show utter contempt for human life, can never be justified and the perpetrators must be brought to justice.
Nonetheless, I appeal to those affected and the Russian Government not to retaliate with similar means but to seek a peaceful solution.
This attack on the civil administration clearly shows that terrorists are not interested in ending the conflict. On the contrary, their aim is the permanent destabilisation of the region.
I welcome the plan to hold a referendum in Chechnya in March. This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self-determination.
Wanting to encourage the refugees in Ingushetia to return home to Chechnya is the right approach, but it is fundamentally wrong to subject them to pressure.
First, the conditions for their return must be put in place.
People must feel safe, and they need housing, electricity and food.
The schools must be open and healthcare must be secure.
The European Union is willing to get involved here and provide humanitarian aid.
The Russian Government's decision not to extend the OSCE's mandate is therefore even more incomprehensible.
What possible political objection can there be to monitoring respect for human rights, providing aid for refugees, and supporting conflict transformation?
None, in my view, unless it is seen as intervention in a country's internal affairs rather than as an offer of help in a very difficult situation.
Or perhaps the Russian Government thinks that accepting help would be a sign of weakness, which it cannot afford for political reasons.
In my view, this would be a complete misapprehension, but it can be rectified.
As a member of the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation on Chechnya, I am disappointed about the cancellation of our delegation visit, which had been confirmed with the Duma.
I am disappointed not only because we naturally wanted to gain our own impression of the local situation - and viewed this as a contribution towards further mutual understanding - but also because a basic political question arises here which has been answered in the negative.
We were informed that the reason for the postponement is the fact that Ahmed Zakayev had been released from detention in a European country and Parliament had adopted a resolution on this issue.
I accept that the Duma has a different political viewpoint from our own.
However, I have a fundamental question. How can one hope to achieve a peaceful resolution to highly complicated issues in Chechnya through a process of negotiation with real opponents if one is incapable of accepting that a friendly institution may have a different political opinion?
Baroness Ludford, we must refrain, quite categorically, from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation.
Such comparisons trivialise this monstrous, state-sanctioned violation of human rights, which was unique in history.
Please do not make such comparisons again.
Mr President, for the third time in history, a systematic attempt at genocide is taking place in Chechnya. It is being committed by the Russian colonial power in order to safeguard its strategic interests and resources.
The fact that this is camouflaged as a war on terrorism - even if there is terrorism there - is simply a cynical distortion of reality.
This is why it is important that there should be unfettered access to the war region so that the facts can be presented.
We are currently witnessing a situation in which the Russian power is doing its utmost to ensure that this war fades from sight behind a wall of silence.
First of all, the Commission has so far been unwilling to visit the region.
We have discussed the matter time and again with Commissioner Nielson and urged him to visit the region.
It may be that some influence has already been brought to bear behind the scenes here.
Then we said that we as a Parliament wanted to visit the region.
Our parliamentary delegation was then prevented from travelling to the crisis region for a variety of completely threadbare reasons.
This was not just deplorable, to paraphrase the mild criticism voiced in the resolution before us. It was a scandal.
We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia. That means that just as our partner Russia has the right and the opportunity to travel anywhere in the EU to gather first-hand information, we expect to have the same free and unimpeded access in Russia's sphere of influence at any time, in line with all the international conventions which Russia has signed, not least in the OSCE and the Council of Europe.
The third attempt to construct a wall of silence around Chechnya was the ending of the OSCE mission and the ejection of an international organisation which had made a major contribution to ending the previous Chechen war through a negotiated settlement.
It was, after all, under the OSCE's supervision, that President Maskhadov was elected, and, as he is the only representative to have been elected democratically to date, we cannot deny him dialogue.
Then a German delegation led by Norbert BlÃŒm, the well-respected former German minister, was thrown out as well.
Mr President, I find this absolutely scandalous, and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far.
We must make it clear to the Russians that this cannot continue. We want to shine light into the darkness and we want an end to this war.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not believe that the current situation in Chechnya is very tense, as the compromise text says it is, but I believe that it is in point of fact extremely serious.
There are, on the one hand, several generations of Chechens who, to date, have known only war and violence and who may at any moment be led by the most extremist fringe groups to commit thoughtless acts of terrorism.
On the other hand, there is a veritable colonial war, conducted by the Russian army, which finds expression in systematic searches on a huge scale, human rights violations, assassinations, abductions and, above all, the scandalous acquittal on 31 December 2002 of Colonel Yuri Budanov, charged with the rape and murder of an 18-year-old Chechen girl.
In this context, it is pretty scandalous that a humanitarian worker should continue to be held prisoner.
I believe that double standards should be avoided.
If we receive President Putin, we must do something for the minister of health who has returned to Baku and whose visa has been taken away, for Ahmed Zakayev, to whom I spoke yesterday on the telephone and who is still under house arrest in the United Kingdom or, again, for the foreign affairs minister held without a visa in the United States.
These people must also be given the benefit of visas, for it takes two to make peace.
Mr President, unfortunately, we are partly responsible for the fact that atrocities and genocide are committed in other parts of the world, because the EU never seriously dares to tread on the toes of powers such as Russia, China, Iran or Israel.
It ought to go without saying that the OSCE should have its mandate extended, that international representatives should have access to Chechnya and that those who have committed serious crimes in Chechnya should be punished.
As a Dane, I should particularly like, however, to call for the two amendments to be adopted.
The EU did not lift a finger when Russia imposed sanctions upon Denmark after we had, quite justifiably, refused, as the only decent thing to do, to allow Mr Zakayev to be extradited as a terrorist.
This is the kind of situation that neither Chechen politicians nor the Member States should be able to bring about in the future.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, quite simply, that the text we are preparing to vote on is absolutely odious and despicable.
Mr Oostlander is not here for the moment, but our fellow MEPs who, for two years, undermined this Parliament's demands for Milosevic to be indicted are the same MEPs who, today, are conducting this would-be realistic policy towards the Russian Federation and Mr Putin and who, at every available opportunity, are concealing the reality of the situation in Chechnya, which is one of veritable genocide.
We say we are disappointed by Mr Budanov's acquittal.
I think that we should, at the very least, be extremely shocked.
We are sorry that we are not able to visit Chechnya. This visit has now been put off four times and it is two years since the European Parliament delegation was due to visit Chechnya.
We are mistaking, and losing sight of, all our reference points.
We forget that, during the years 1940-1945, there were acts of resistance in our countries targeted against the symbols of the occupying power, against Vichy, against Quisling and against those collaborating with the occupying power.
Today, it is the attack on the Grozny government headquarters - inconceivable though it would have been to someone such as myself, who eschews violence - that is an act of resistance.
Yet we accuse the Chechens, who are aiming at the very heart of collaboration with Moscow, of perpetrating terrorist attacks.
These are not terrorist attacks.
The attack was aimed at a cell of people working for the FSB and which was therefore a strategic target for the combatants or Chechen resistance.
We have completely lost the plot.
We are combining everything under the heading of terrorism.
That is extremely serious, as it is also extremely serious to advocate a political solution on the one hand and, on the other, to support a referendum organised by the occupying power; to advocate political negotiations while, in practice, prohibiting Chechen parliamentarians or Ministers from entering our territory to meet politicians from our own countries in the European Parliament, European Commission or European Council, on the pretext that it would be impossible for them to do so.
Now, we are very well aware that, under Article 14(3), we have been able to draw up blacklists of Yugoslav or Belarussian politicians and that we are able to draw up a 'white list' of Chechen politicians.
If we want to talk politics, we must do so with politicians.
In this context, we are really beginning to become the accomplices of genocide.
It is time that Parliament woke up.
Otherwise, we shall be embarking again upon the unspeakable things such as we have seen in connection with Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.
I think we have already paid a sufficient price for what was done there.
Mr President, the conflict in Chechnya was discussed in detail on 11 September at the last European Union Summit with the Russian Federation.
Unfortunately, the lack of progress towards peace forces us, once again, to focus our attention on the tragic situation that is devastating Chechnya.
We are all aware that, from the point of view of security, the situation has worsened since the last Summit in Brussels.
I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the Union's strong condemnation of the recent terrorist attacks, which cut short the lives of more than one hundred people and seriously injured many more.
The European Union takes a strong stance against terrorism, regardless of who is responsible and what their motives are.
Car bomb attacks, indiscriminate murders, kidnappings and other methods of terrorism can in no way be justified for any cause, however legitimate it may seem.
This is obviously entirely valid for Chechnya, but our conviction that the fight against terrorism cannot take place at the expense of respect for human rights is also valid.
First of all allow me to look specifically at the subject of human rights.
Non-governmental organisations of recognised standing continue to report serious violations of human rights committed in Chechnya by the security forces working on behalf of the Russian Federation.
The murders, torture, disappearances and other violations of basic human rights should therefore also be clearly and strongly condemned by the European Union.
What is equally serious is the lack of a clear will on the part of the authorities to deal with these violations.
The result of the trial against Colonel Budanov is not a positive sign, but quite the opposite.
Another negative event was the forced evacuation of the Chechen refugee camp in Akiyurt just before Christmas, which was also described by the European Union as a violation of the international humanitarian principle that displaced persons should be returned to their place of origin solely of their own free will, without the pressure that was applied in that case.
The European Union acted quickly to demand that the same thing should not happen to other similar camps, as it only leads to the suffering of the civil population.
People are displaced by the violence of war and terrorism, and until those things stop, they cannot return to their homes without their lives being endangered.
They should also have a minimum economic infrastructure, which they do not currently have, in order to continue with their lives.
I want to assure you that the European Commission is keeping a close eye on events and that it will take the necessary steps to prevent this from being repeated.
In fact, ECHO is planning a monitoring delegation to Ingushetia at the end of this month.
The European Commission is aware of the majority position of Parliament on these issues, and of its efforts to achieve the shared objectives that I have just mentioned.
In this sense, it is the Commission's desire and hope that the planned visit to Chechnya by the Parliament Delegation for relations with the Duma, which has again been delayed, will soon be able to take place, which will undoubtedly help to make the European Union's voice heard in the conflict in Chechnya.
Another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the European Union.
The Russian authorities are continuing to fail to provide the necessary cooperation in order for the non-governmental organisations distributing such aid to be able to deliver it to the recipients under good conditions, despite the repeated observations of the European Union.
Our humanitarian workers continue to face countless administrative obstacles preventing them from effectively doing their job.
What is even more serious is that the bureaucratic obstacles are endangering their lives and their safety.
In this context, I would like to point out that Mr Arjan Erkel, an employee of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃšres, was kidnapped months ago.
We have urged the Russian authorities, and we repeat that request, to do everything in their power to secure his immediate release.
If you will allow me, I would now like to deal with the central issue of the urgent resolution under consideration.
As you are aware, on 31 December, the mandate of the OSCE assistance group for Chechnya expired.
The lack of agreement on the content of the mandate for the coming year means that currently the team is being forced to take the decision to leave Chechnya.
The Russian Federation has so far maintained the position that the mandate of the assistance group for Chechnya should be reduced in order to exclude any political role.
This is a contradiction in terms given the highly political nature of the OSCE as an organisation for security in Europe.
The Commission understands that maintaining this group is not only appropriate, but also in the interests of everyone, and especially of Russia.
The same applies to the efforts made by the different bodies of the Council of Europe, which are also facing increasing obstacles to their work.
The work of these international organisations seems to be even more necessary at present when the Russian Federation has the firm intention to take a series of steps towards the political normalisation of Chechnya.
Therefore, the presence and assistance of the organisations would be the only way of providing that normalisation process with a level of democratic legitimacy.
Intensive negotiations are currently going on in Vienna with the aim of ensuring that the assistance group remains in Chechnya and the issue is being raised today in Athens amongst the political leaders of the Union and of Russia.
We hope that these diplomatic proceedings will enable us to achieve our objective.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the vote.
We shall now proceed to the vote on the final report on the agenda.
The rapporteur has made important observations about the social, economic and environmental fields of our fisheries sector with regard to fishing in international waters.
I believe it is crucial, however, that both the European Commission and the European Parliament, under the reform of the common fisheries policy, address the issue of how to comply with the provisions agreed on in the Action Plan of the Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg in 2002, in particular eliminating all subsidies to illegal, unsustainable and unregulated fishing and the need to recover endangered fish stocks by 2015.
The report that we are debating warrants our full interest because it presents practical solutions to the problems afflicting fishermen.
Concluding agreements with third countries provides the EU with additional fishing resources.
Through such instruments, the EU ensures work for its fishermen, resolves the problem of supply and plays its socio-economic role towards developing countries.
I therefore agree with the report, which aims to increase the EU's presence in regional fishing organisations (RFOs), and to conclude bilateral agreements and renew existing agreements.
We must conduct our external fisheries policy in a systematic and sustainable way.
I would ask the Commission to present a political strategy that enhances the international dimension of the CFP.
This strand of the CFP cannot be overlooked within the EU's external policy (CFSP) and in its international trade policy.
Lastly, I wish to take this opportunity to express my regret at the recent confrontations that took place in the Algarve between Spanish fishermen and the Portuguese maritime authorities.
Spanish boats that were in Portuguese waters illegally fishing bivalve molluscs were identified by the Portuguese Maritime Police.
The pursuit resulted in physical confrontations and injury to one of the authority's agents, requiring the intervention of a Portuguese navy corvette.
I would add that the Spanish offenders were caught using the suction method of fishing, which is totally prohibited in the European Union.
Despite having alerted the Spanish authorities, the Portuguese government has received no reply, which does nothing for the existing good relations between the two countries.
The purpose of the Community fleet's activity in non-Community waters is to supply the Community market, which has a shortfall in fishing products, and to preserve this activity in the Community's regions that depend on it, which tend, historically, to be least-favoured regions, lacking economic alternatives.
Despite the fact that Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos's report is an own-initiative report, it is to be hoped that due account will be taken of it in the Commission's presentation, which we hope it will give in the next few weeks, on its communication on the international dimension of the CFP in the context of the reform of this policy.
We hope, where this report is concerned, that the Commission communication will support launching the bases for a global analysis of the problems and needs of the European Union fleet in the territorial waters of third countries, focusing on two issues: how to achieve more coherent and more complete participation in the organisations governing international waters, in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Community; and how to secure a higher profile for the international dimension of the CFP within the Union's external policy.
It actually makes little sense to adopt measures such as abolishing structural aid or aid for scrapping vessels in the context of the CFP reform before defining the future EU position on the Community fleet.
Hence our support for this report, despite the measures already taken in this field by the Council.
We have reached the end of the agenda.
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
(The sitting was closed at 5.05 p.m.)
. (PT) We are all aware of the importance of the activity of the Member States' fleets in non-Community waters.
This is crucial for supplying our market, which has a shortfall in fish products and for preserving fishing in those EU regions that depend on it and which tend historically, to be least-favoured regions, which lack economic alternatives.
I have voted in favour of this report in order to convey this importance and to demonstrate my agreement with the analysis made by the rapporteur - I agree with many of the suggestions she has made.
To quote the introduction to the code of conduct for responsible fisheries, (28th session of the FAO Conference of 31 October 1995, 'Fisheries, including aquaculture, provide a vital source of food, employment, recreation, trade and economic well-being for people throughout the world, both for present and future generations and should therefore be conducted in a responsible manner.'
I would highlight the rapporteur's warning about the need to combat all forms of illegal fishing, her call for closer relations with the Mediterranean countries and her request for the creation of joint ventures with third countries to be encouraged.
The Commission still needs to clarify how it is going to secure a higher profile for the international dimension of the common fisheries policy within the Union's external policy.
It is also crucial that effective aid for the renewal of fishing fleets is maintained.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 16 January 2003.
Madam President, I should like to know whether a dress code has been introduced here in Parliament.
I am thinking of something that happened yesterday during a hearing concerning the Takeover Directive.
The Chairman of the hearing, Mr Gargani, asked the officers to ensure that all the men put jackets on out of respect for the experts present, as he put it.
Since my assistant had no jacket or tie on, he was asked to leave the hearing and was therefore unable to do his work, a fact I am very unhappy about.
I should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament.
For your information, I can point out that I am wearing neither a tie, shirt nor jacket.
As a matter of fact, I am wearing jeans, so I would ask you: do I have permission to be here as an MEP?
Mr Blak, I will make inquiries into that matter.
I note your upset with regard to your assistant.
Regarding the balance, you are welcome to be here, but after the sitting I would be happy to recommend you a good tailor.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always, it is a great honour for me to take part in a sitting of the European Parliament.
But although it is always a pleasure, I must tell you that today is also a moment of great concern for me.
(The President cut off the speaker.)
Mr Solana, I apologise for interrupting your introduction.
Colleagues, I think you have made your point.
I would appreciate it if you would put down your placards so that we can proceed with the debate.
(Applause from the right)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was saying that I am always happy to appear before you, but today I am doing so at a time when I am extremely worried.
The international situation is not good and the time has come for us to hold a debate within this institution to consider how the most burning issues currently on the international scene can be viewed, and if possible resolved, from a European perspective.
I have seen the placards that some Members of this Parliament have displayed very clearly, and I would like to say that unfortunately, or fortunately in other respects, I am talking to you from the point of view of an old Europe, because of my age, but also because of my affection for everything which is represented by the Europe of yesterday, the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow.
Mr President, do not imagine that I am so old, I am going to carry on working and pestering people for a few more years.
(Applause)
Mr President, in the short time available to me this afternoon, if the honourable Members will allow me, I would like to discuss four or five points which I believe are essential to a global understanding of the international situation.
The first is undoubtedly Iraq.
But I would also like to take this opportunity to debate with you, if only very briefly, the situation in the Middle East on such an important day as this, the day after the elections in Israel.
I also believe it would be a mistake not to say a few words about North Korea, given the dramatic situation at the moment, and I will end with a very brief comment on the operations the European Union is beginning to plan for the deployment of forces in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I will begin with the first point: the situation in Iraq.
As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the General Affairs Council is taking place this week and next week and they are going to be extremely important weeks in terms of finding a solution to the Iraq crisis.
On Monday morning, for the first time, there was a concertation procedure, in accordance with Article 19 of the EU Treaty, between the Presidency, the troika and the members of the European Union sitting on the United Nations Security Council here in Brussels at ministerial level.
This is the first time that anything of this nature has taken place; there had been many concertation meetings in New York, but there had never been a meeting here in Brussels at ministerial level of the two permanent members and the two non-permanent members of the Security Council together with the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and myself.
I would like to say very briefly that in the meeting there was general consensus at least on four essential points which the European Union wishes to defend in all fora.
I will run through the four points, although the honourable Members know them very well.
Firstly: we all have an interest in Iraq getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and this is something that all Europeans should agree on.
One of the most serious problems we are going to face during this century is unquestionably the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem, a serious problem for which a solution must be found.
Therefore, to try, by every means possible, and in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, to ensure that Baghdad gets rid of all weapons of mass destruction must be a priority for the European Union.
The second important point is Iraq's responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors.
You have good knowledge of the report which Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei presented the other day to the Security Council, and you saw them directly, because the President of the European Parliament had the opportunity to speak with the inspection chiefs by means of a videoconference with New York.
I also had the opportunity to speak with them subsequently, and I will therefore not insist on this since I am sure that the Presidency has informed Parliament in a clear manner.
The third point, which I believe is essential to point out, is that we must give all the necessary support to the inspectors.
The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community.
If they are capable of convincing the Security Council of the situation, I am sure that the Security Council will also convince public opinion of the current situation in Baghdad.
Therefore, whatever the implicit or explicit requests - and I insist, implicit or explicit - of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council, I believe Europe should help them.
And there are essentially three types of suggestions or requests that the inspectors could make to us, firstly: that they require more resources, more resources than they currently have, more inspectors and more logistical resources; secondly: they may need more time; and thirdly: they may need more information or more intelligence.
I believe that the international community should respond positively to these three requests from the inspectors. In other words, they should be offered resources, time and intelligence.
And the fourth point, which I believe is absolutely essential and which must be defended by the Europeans, is that the whole of this process relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and more specifically the issue of Iraq, must remain within the framework of the United Nations Security Council.
It must be carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is the institution which must provide the legitimacy for any action in relation to this issue.
(Applause)
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you are well aware of the differing positions expressed by various Members of the European Union, but you also know that there are not just the opinions of the leaders in the European Union, but we also have clear and convincing surveys of the thoughts of the European citizens.
I believe that the European citizens are clear about two things: one, that they do not want war; and the other, that they do not want dictators in the world.
And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population, of the citizens of Europe.
How to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community.
Our intention as Europeans must be to ensure that Resolution 1441, which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council and which was approved unanimously by the Arab League two days later, should become a reality and that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime can disarm without the need for military force.
Therefore, the countries of the European Union and all of us who serve the European Union will work with all our might, day and night, to try to prevent a conflict and to ensure that Saddam Hussein abandons weapons of mass destruction without our turning to military force.
As you know, a debate began today in the Security Council on the basis of the report produced by the inspection chiefs 48 hours ago.
Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it.
As you are aware, yesterday the President of the United States made an important speech.
I would like to welcome an expression, a phrase, an idea, which was suggested in this speech, which is the idea, the suggestion or the commitment that the Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, would appear before the United Nations Security Council to explain the information and intelligence in existence in those countries which have privileged information or privileged intelligence.
I believe and I insist that the centre of gravity of this process must continue to be the United Nations Security Council and I therefore believe it very appropriate that the information that certain countries currently have should be debated within it and that, if possible, that information should also be passed on to the inspectors.
You also know that there will be other consultations in the coming days ?
(Applause)
? and let us hope that the inspectors can have more time to continue their work and, if possible, as I said before, to complete their mandate in accordance with Resolution 1441.
Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is involved in this process: four Members of the European Union are on the Security Council, one candidate for membership of the European Union is on the Security Council and I am sure that the countries making up that Council will make every possible effort so that what we are saying here becomes reality in the coming days.
Since you have information from the President of Parliament on the conversation yesterday with Dr Blix, I will not say anything about the comments made and I will move on briefly to the second point I wanted to discuss with you, ladies and gentlemen, which is the issue of the Middle East.
Yesterday elections took place in Israel, and I believe we must learn at least three important lessons from these elections.
Firstly, the low turn-out.
It is surprising - or at least it surprises me - that in view of the situation we are facing in the Middle East electoral turn-out should be so low.
It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections. That is the first point to stress.
The second point to stress is the enormous, and very significant, victory of Prime Minister Sharon.
I would like, on behalf of all of us, to congratulate him on his victory and the victory of his party.
Sharon's victory is like none other of his previous victories.
And I believe we should say to Prime Minister Sharon, on behalf of the European Union, that at this time when he has enormous opportunities to form a coalition government, that he should form a coalition government that concentrates on resolving the problem of the war and finding permanent peace in the Middle East.
That is the demand that with respect I believe we should make of him since it has been demonstrated that a huge number of Israelis have voted for him.
The third issue we should highlight and on which we must draw conclusions is the heavy defeat of the Labour Party and the defeat of the Meretz Party.
The two great parties, which have historically defended peace, which have been the centre of gravity in terms of peace, have suffered damage.
We must analyse why this situation has come about.
It will primarily be their job to do this.
We have seen that the Secretary-General of the Meretz Party has tendered his resignation.
But, in any event, from a European point of view we must maintain our policy and our policy is still the one contained in the work of the Quartet and the one contained in the road map which was approved in Washington not long ago.
Once there is a government in Israel, we must mobilise all possible mechanisms in order to speed up a process which will lead to the road map becoming a reality and not just remaining a piece of paper.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have the obligation, as Europeans, to do everything possible to ensure that this process, which will begin following yesterday's elections, will be a process which leads to a good result, and so that the initiatives taken do not meet the same fate as previous initiatives, such as the Mitchell report or the Tenet Plan and other important reports which have been adopted but which have not been able to be implemented.
My appeal would therefore be that we should do everything possible to ensure that these documents do not remain simply documents in the archives but that they be implemented in reality.
Ladies and gentlemen, during the short time available to me for this first speech, I would also like to make one or two comments on North Korea.
Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in North Korea is serious.
It is difficult.
As you know, the decisions taken by the North Korean Government are serious decisions and I do not believe they are decisions which should only concern the countries of the region.
As I said at the beginning, I would insist that the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an issue which affects all of us, regardless of which part of the planet we are living in at this time.
And we must therefore involve ourselves to some extent in the issue of North Korea.
As you know, we hold meetings and telephone conversations practically every day with the most closely involved countries in the region: South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the United States, and in the General Affairs Council on Monday the decision was taken, if necessary, to send a European Union mission to North Korea to present our position and also to cooperate in finding a solution to this dramatic problem which, if things carry on as they are, could lead to the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction in part of the Korean peninsula.
Ladies and gentlemen, I will move on to the last point I wanted to mention this afternoon, which is the situation in the Balkans and specifically the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
As you know, at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance.
We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic.
The work is going well, the issues that have to be tackled with the Atlantic Alliance are making substantial progress, President Trajkovski of Macedonia has now accepted the presence of European forces from March and I believe we will be in a position to do that.
We also want to send a clear message to the countries of the Balkans; our strategy is not to abandon the Balkans.
Our strategy does not just consist of remaining there, but of them remaining with us, of offering the countries of the Balkans the opportunity to participate in the construction of a wider Europe, so that they may come ever closer to the European institutions and so that they may establish themselves firmly as the important countries they should be in that region.
The deployment of military force in Macedonia would be the second peace-keeping operation taken on by Europe, since, as you know, since 1 January this year, the European police force is deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a replacement for the police force which was there under the flag of the United Nations.
Therefore, in a relatively short space of time, we have been able to implement two peace-keeping operations in an area close to our hearts and close geographically to our capitals and to Brussels.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I do not want to expand any further during this first speech.
I know that the honourable Members will have plenty of questions to ask me.
But I would like to say that we are living through a relatively difficult time and I would go as far as to say that this is perhaps the most difficult time those of us in this parliamentary sitting, during this period of European parliamentary life, have had to live through.
It is essential that we Europeans remain strong, clear and tenacious in our positions in order to do everything possible so that this crisis, which currently has so many fronts and so many manifestations, is one that can be resolved through the good will of everybody by means of agreement, dialogue and diplomacy.
Force is the last resort.
Diplomacy must always be our method.
(Applause)
Mr President, since at the last session of the Parliament in Strasbourg I was able to spend an hour with the Foreign Affairs Committee discussing North Korea under the benign stewardship of my honourable friend, the Member for Westphalia, and since last week we were able to spend two hours with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy here discussing a wide range of issues, perhaps I could now concentrate on Iraq, bearing in mind the limitations imposed on the competences of the Commission.
I would like to make one remark at the outset: I think it is fair to say that, on the whole, since the Second World War, we have managed to create global institutions and international agreements which have helped make the world a much more prosperous and peaceful place.
I recall that, at the time of President Clinton's second inaugural address, he was able to boast that there are today more people living under democracies than under tyrannies; we ended the last century with a world which produced as much in two or three years as we had produced in the whole of the 19th century, with incalculable consequences for the living standards of most people.
This is not a bad record after a century which began so badly.
Plainly, not everything has gone so well.
Perhaps the greatest failure in trying to create a global rule-book has been our collective failure to establish an adequate regime for controlling and preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons - that terrible arsenal of unimaginable horror.
Today we face some of the consequences in three of the world's most worrying trouble spots: in Kashmir, in the Korean peninsular and in the Gulf.
How can we deal with these problems?
This was a point discussed in considerable detail in the Foreign Affairs Committee last week.
Clearly, we have to mobilise the greatest international commitment and the broadest authority for what we want to do.
That is why it must be sensible to base our approach in dealing with these problems on the moral and legal authority of the United Nations.
I think the whole of the European Parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that.
Everyone knows that, for years, Saddam Hussein has defied the authority of the United Nations over his manufacture, possession and use of weapons of mass destruction.
In addition, he has an appalling record on human rights.
In May last year, this Parliament adopted a resolution based on a report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne which outlined the clear evidence concerning the brutal and oppressive nature of his regime.
The report illustrated clearly how Saddam normally deals with Iraqi citizens, with his neighbours and with the international community.
We know, for example, that he has used chemical weapons on his own people.
After years of defying the authority of the United Nations, posing a threat to the region and to the whole world, he was given a final chance to cooperate in disarming his country by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441.
A team of 260 staff members from 60 countries, of whom 100 are UNMOVIC inspectors, has been working in Iraq since 27 November 2002 under Dr Blix.
Besides UNMOVIC, there is also the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team under Dr El Baradei.
Since the resumption of IAEA inspections, 139 inspections have been carried out on 106 sites, including two presidential sites.
I just mention, in passing, that anybody who has met the inspectors - for example, anybody who has met Dr Blix - will have been extremely impressed by the integrity and professionalism of those leading this UN operation.
I do not want to pronounce on the debate which is being held today in the Security Council.
As I am regularly reminded, the Commission is not a Member State.
We do, of course, contribute to the development of the common foreign and security policy.
We deploy the instruments within our competence to make it more effective.
Many of the issues we are discussing go to the heart of the debate about national sovereignty, which some appear to think has been solved by the proposal to create a full-time President of the Council.
While being clear about the limits of our role, let me however make a number of points.
First, it must be plain to all that the authority of the United Nations should be a paramount consideration.
The pity is that in the past we have stood by too often while the United Nations has been defied, thereby exposing ourselves to understandable charges of double standards.
(Applause)
Second, Saddam Hussein must work with the UN inspectors under Dr Blix to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction for which he has not yet accounted.
We should not forget that the issue at the heart of this crisis is how Saddam Hussein treats the rest of the world, not how the rest of the world treats Saddam Hussein.
(Applause)
We should not forget the sobering comment made this week by Dr Blix.
I quote: Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.
Third, if inspectors can disarm Saddam Hussein, that is preferable by far to any other imaginable cause of action.
(Applause)
Any sensible person should want this crisis to be ended peacefully, if it is humanly possible to do so.
It would be good for the United Nations if we could accomplish this task without casualty, collateral damage or the daunting consequence of military intervention.
It would also be good for Iraq, for the region and, I would argue, very good for the world.
But that does rather assume that Saddam Hussein will now work with the inspectors.
Unfortunately, we have little evidence even now that he has yet learned that he cannot go on defying world opinion forever.
I have always believed that the terms of the UN resolution obliged us to face two realities: first, we must make a serious effort to disarm through inspection; second, if the inspectors make it clear that this is a case of mission impossible, we cannot avoid facing up to the consequences.
The alternative would be the sort of humiliation that would make it more difficult to assert the authority of the United Nations in future cases.
I believe this to be an exceptionally serious debate and one which is going to have effects not just in this chamber but across Europe and the world.
It is going to shape the sort of world we live in and pass on to our kids and I do not think it is going to be helped by trading rhetoric.
Speaking like my youthful partner and friend, the High Representative, both of us have grown younger in these jobs.
Speaking like him as a proud citizen of old Europe - a part of old Europe which once had a spot of trouble with one of our colonies on the other side of the Atlantic - I have occasionally reflected that if King George had not played his hand so badly, if he had not made such a mess of things, then instead of fetching up as the last Governor of Hong Kong I might have finished up as the Governor of Arkansas or Texas, and then who knows what might have happened!
(Laughter and Applause)
Speaking as a citizen of old Europe, I would say that we need to remember that it is often wiser to raise a quizzical eyebrow than to return an insult.
We have to recognise that if we get this wrong and handle this crisis badly, the consequences could be profoundly serious and very long-lived: on the one hand, we could fatally damage the institutions of global cooperation and governance; on the other, we could make the world a much more dangerous place.
We could weaken partnerships between friends, exacerbate relations with the Islamic world and worsen the prospects for solving crises elsewhere, for example in the Middle East.
Our ability to work together in Europe is also clearly on the line.
Needless to say, the Commission will discharge its responsibilities as best it can.
While I do not believe it is helpful to go into detail about the planning we have done to cater for a serious humanitarian crisis - for example, I was discussing this last autumn in Jordan - I can assure honourable Members that we will react with the generosity for which the Parliament is ultimately responsible and with the commitment and professionalism that the Parliament would expect of us.
I make this point very, very strongly: it will be easier for us to act, should we be required to act, if we can do so with the authority of the United Nations covering our activities.
I think I owe it to all those who work for the European Commission in the front line in providing humanitarian assistance, and to those who work for non-governmental organisations, very often in dangerous circumstances.
If we have to talk in the future about humanitarian activities and about what is described in the jargon as the humanitarian space, then I say strongly to this Parliament that it is far easier and far better to have UN authority covering that humanitarian space than to go ahead without it.
(Applause)
Earlier I mentioned speaking in the last Parliamentary session on North Korea and I will not repeat all that I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee on that occasion, but I do recognise the seriousness of the situation in North Korea.
I was in Pyongyang with the High Representative and the Swedish Prime Minister almost two years ago.
I think that we played a useful role, without exaggerating what we were capable of doing.
In my judgment, the only way this crisis can be resolved is through diplomacy, through expecting more of the DPRK, on this occasion in relation to nuclear promises in response to a greater commitment by the international community to welcome North Korea into the real world.
Since I think it is only through diplomacy that we can actually resolve that crisis, I do think there may be a role for the European Union to play in the coming weeks.
That, I am glad to say, was the decision reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday and Tuesday.
I am sure this will not be the last occasion on which we debate soberly these difficult issues, soberly but with a passion which I hope will be sometimes constrained in its rhetorical expression by the grave and serious issues that we are discussing.
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to decide between war and peace, we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness, but also with confidence in ourselves.
The wisdom of old Europe, this continent of ours, lies in its capacity for repeated renewal, and we should be telling all those who cast doubt on our credentials, that the policy of uniting Europe is the greatest peace movement on the European continent - old, yet ever renewing itself - and that perhaps other regions in the world will find it an example of peaceful coexistence.
What I ask, ladies and gentlemen, is that we should respect each other's points of view.
It is certain that we will come to different conclusions on one thing or another, but each of us expresses opinions founded on his or her own convictions, and then we have to see to it that we take the right path.
It is quite clear to us in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats that we have to make every conceivable effort and attempt to secure world peace and peace in the Middle East - in so far as this is the nub of the problem.
That must be our concern; it is that for which we must work, and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it.
Ladies and gentlemen, even if the use of force in the form of warfare may never be more than the last resort, and though our endeavours must be guided by peace, we have to deal with the facts as they are presented to us.
What we have to deal with in Iraq is a criminal system under a dictator and tyrant alleged to have weapons of mass destruction at his disposal - and that is the problem.
He is a mass murderer and a war criminal, who, as Commissioner Patten has mentioned, has, in particular, used chemical weapons against his own people, against the Kurds.
In 1980, he declared war on Iran, and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait.
I take a thoroughly critical line on the United States too, but, ladies and gentlemen, if the United States had not, at that time, led the coalition that liberated Kuwait, might this same dictator not have been able to include the other Arab countries in his expansionist designs?
That, too, is something we must bear in mind today.
His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence, murder and terror.
Ladies and gentlemen, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime are a menace to the region as a whole and to the international community.
Whatever the need to be frank when talking to our American friends, it has to be said that the heart of the problem is not the USA, but Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad.
(Applause from the centre and the right)
Ladies, gentlemen, friends, because Iraq, with which we find ourselves dealing in the present situation, is an Arab country, we are also saying loud and clear to the Arab and Muslim world that we want cooperation, we want partnership, and we want friendship - if at all possible - with all Arab and Muslim states, and this must be one of the key fundamentals of European Union policy.
I wish to extend warm thanks not only to Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, but also to all those who are working hard in these difficult days and weeks, and I wish to thank the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, for facilitating yesterday's discussion with Hans Blix, from which I learned a very great deal.
We agreed that this discussion would be confidential - it could scarcely have taken place had we not done so - but I agree, and our group agrees, that many years have passed since 1990, in which the international community has taken no real action against Saddam Hussein, and so, if we are to achieve the peaceful solution for which we hope, we have to keep up the pressure of recent months, which he is now coming to feel.
This has to be a window for peace; it must also mean - and it is to be hoped that it does - that our American partners and friends have not yet decided on military action against Iraq.
We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution, which must be reached through the United Nations.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must also, however, keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved.
The discussion we had with Dr Blix yesterday touched on this.
Logic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be.
It is far more logical for the Iraqi regime to do as Resolution 1441 requires and actually open the gates, so that Dr Blix and his team do not have to virtually grope their way through Iraq with a glimmering lamp. On the contrary, as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 1441, what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad.
That is what we have to insist on, ladies and gentlemen.
We hear the President's White House spokesman saying, 'either he disarms or he will be disarmed', and so we urge Saddam Hussein to delay no longer in playing his part in this.
Let me quote Hans Blix, who said, on one occasion, that 'it does not, to date, appear that Iraq has really accepted the demand for disarmament', and on another, that paragraph 9 of Resolution 1441 requires that cooperation be 'active'.
Simply opening doors is not enough.
There are questions that Hans Blix has raised, and which we also have to put before the public: what about the anthrax, which is a biological weapon?
What became of the 8 500 litres of it?
What about the VX, a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done?
If Iraq really has disarmed as it claims to have done, it would have been right and proper and in line with international law for this to have been done under UN supervision, as prescribed by the documents and the resolutions.
I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks.
Ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council of European Union Foreign Ministers decided, quite rightly, to call for complete disarmament, but we have to take the middle way - and everyone knows the difficult position Europeans are in.
Our slogan cannot be 'right or wrong, always America!'
That is a road down which we cannot go, but neither can we go down the road of saying that, no matter what Iraq's response may be, the Iraqi dictator will go unpunished, and that we will not play our part!
To do so would be like saying to someone bent upon murder, 'please don't commit murder, but if you do, there will be no criminal proceedings anyway'.
That is why we have to keep up the pressure!
What we demand of the US Government is that, if our American partners and friends have intelligence derived from secret service operations, this must also be laid out to public view in the Security Council, so that we may really be in full possession of the facts.
People have to be informed, and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses.
We want to achieve this through the United Nations, and we want to achieve it by peaceful means!
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to say first of all that we are against war: no to war and no to dictators, and that means we must work actively within a multilateral framework to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.
The debate we are holding at the moment with our most important ally, the United States, revolves, rather than around the fundamental issue, around counter-productive methods and - as ex-President Clinton quite rightly said ? on erratic methods.
Why?
Because ten years ago, when we were in a coalition with the United States in the Kuwait war, President Bush Senior said that the Iraqi people would sooner or later topple the dictator.
Ten years later, we must recognise that sanctions have not weakened Saddam Hussein and that we are still dealing with the same issues in relation to weapons of mass destruction.
We must therefore say that we are in favour of a clear policy of applying pressure on the basis of the Security Council's resolutions.
War is not inevitable.
We must work on the basis that peace must be given a chance, but we must not be hasty and of course we must not create situations which may be entirely counter-productive.
Hence our opposition to a preventive attack and our support for negotiations within the framework of international law.
Mr President, a unilateral intervention, without the support of the UN, would have devastating effects throughout the Middle East, leading to more suffering, more radicalisation of Arab public opinion and would jeopardise the spirit of coalition in the fight against terrorism.
And since Mr Solana is going to congratulate Mr Sharon on having won the elections in Israel, I would ask him to add something else, and that is to tell Mr Sharon to stop spurning Europe and to take account of our will for peace and cooperation.
Secondly, Iraq must comply seriously with the inspection requirements and I would like to thank the President for quickly accepting my proposal to hold the videoconference.
It was very interesting.
Yesterday we spoke with a European citizen who was proud to be one, Dr Blix, who asked Europe to take a more active position and who also explained to us, although he did not ask for it, that if the inspections could continue for two more months, as proposed by Mohammed ElBaradei, the Egyptian expert, results could be achieved.
I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action.
Our approach should be the one the President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Papandreu, was able to outline at the General Affairs Council on Monday, in the face of the self-flagellation we always indulge in, by means of an agreement with the four member countries of the Security Council and with Bulgaria, so that there may be a European position which supports the work of the inspectors and so that those inspections may continue.
I would also like to point out that Dr Blix also told us that between 1991 and 1998 the inspectors were at work.
If they were working for eight years, why can they not work for two more months?
Nobody understands this, and neither do they understand why President Bush is offering evidence now, two months later.
Why did he not do so before?
We must all work as faithful allies and with regard to the statement of Defence Secretary Rumsfeld, who spoke of the old Europe, I must say that those people in our continent who have spoken of a new Europe are the ones who have caused endless disasters in our continent.
We are not in favour of a new Europe, we are building a united Europe, and that is the aim of our political action.
And, Mr President, please allow me to refer to an important aspect of the issue on which I would like to hear more clarifications from the representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission.
It concerns the risks of humanitarian disaster, not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East, with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons at least: who will pay for that?
Do we have measures to deal with it?
Has the UN considered this?
This is an important issue, as is the economic situation, and not just that of Europe.
The price of oil is going through the roof; it is worrying that the United States' world map of priorities always coincides with the countries which have significant reserves of oil.
This is not the way to build a future for humanity, and we must also declare ourselves clearly in favour of not having to face an economic disaster.
Finally, Mr President, we have the right to know whether weapons of mass destruction really exist.
To this end, we need more proof and more evidence and they will be obtained through continued work.
The debate is not only on the timetable but on how to move forward in order to prevent war.
And finally, Mr President, please allow me to use a quote in English from a great American, Mr Madison, who in 1792 said:
Mr President, with four Member States on the UN Security Council, including the chair, the EU should have the opportunity for real influence over current events and it would if it spoke with one voice.
I wonder if Mr Solana would confirm that the meeting of four Security Council members, convened by the Greek Presidency ahead of Monday's General Affairs Council, was intended to achieve a single EU position?
Will such meetings become regular events?
Or was it simply an attempt to stitch up the outcome of the Council without consulting the remaining Member States?
Perhaps I could also ask whether, in the regrettable absence of a coherent EU strategy in the run-up to a possible conflict with Iraq, he would undertake to ensure that the EU starts work now to plan a post-conflict strategy in the region?
When we last debated the situation in Iraq in early September, the world seemed on the brink of a unilateral military adventure led by the United States.
Our main concerns then were to prevent the credibility of the United Nations and of international law being undermined by a pre-emptive strike not authorised by the UN, and to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq.
We may be the old continent but we remember our yesterdays rather well and our experience of war has been very different from that of the USA.
In the event, the United States did go the UN route last autumn, and secured a unanimous vote for a tough Security Council resolution.
The UN weapons inspectors have been readmitted to Iraq and are doing a professional and thorough job.
So we Liberals salute the efforts of Colin Powell, Hans Blix, Mohamed Elbaradei and others for reinforcing the multilateral rule of law.
Now that we are engaged on the proper path of international cooperation, we must make every effort to preserve that unity.
However, following the presentation of Dr Blix's report to the Security Council, there is a new danger - a danger that the credibility of the UN and international law risks being undermined, not by unilateral US action, but by the failure of the international community to ensure that Iraq rids itself of weapons of mass destruction once and for all.
Dr Blix's report to the UN provides a damning if not yet conclusive account of Iraq's failure to cooperate fully with the UN weapons inspectors.
Saddam Hussein is required by UN resolution 1441 to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
Instead, we have seen half-truths, prevarication and evasion.
Dr Blix has opened the case for the prosecution with powerful arguments, though the evidence he has presented does not yet provide proof beyond all reasonable doubt.
That is why Liberals in this House insist that the inspectors be allowed to continue their work.
Dr Blix raises many disturbing questions in his report.
Saddam Hussein clearly has a case to answer.
A peaceful resolution to the crisis is still possible provided that Iraq now demonstrates a real willingness to cooperate with the UN in disarming.
But with the inspectors due to report again on 14 February, there is little time left to him before the court of the international community has to reach a verdict.
For Liberals, war will always be a last resort; recourse to military action means that the instruments of international governance in which we invest such high hopes have failed.
But equally, the international community has to stand ready to enforce its will, or the rule of law will be flouted.
And there is plenty of evidence that Saddam Hussein is in breach of international law, most notably of the UN Convention on Genocide for the murder of half a million marsh Arabs.
So let us forget talk of allowing Saddam Hussein to slip off quietly into the night for a comfortable exile in a third country.
He is a war criminal and he must be brought before the International Criminal Court.
To those Members who intend to convey to Saddam Hussein the message that impunity in exile is an acceptable way out, I say, to borrow the phrase of the anti-war coalition: not in our name.
And I invite them to search their consciences.
Is the best way to advance the cause of peace really to travel to Baghdad for a photo opportunity and risk being manipulated by the Iraqi regime?
Dr Blix told us yesterday that if Iraq chooses to cooperate, the inspectors can complete their work very soon.
The inspectors must be given more time but if Dr Blix reports on 14 February that Iraq has failed to provide answers to his questions, and if the Security Council therefore determines that they are in material breach of the resolution, then the international community has a responsibility to act.
If Iraq does not seize this final opportunity to cooperate, we must act together through the UN to enforce resolution 1441.
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, we are on a knife-edge.
On the one hand, the Security Council has given the inspectors the green light they wanted to continue their mission in the short term; on the other, the US-British armada in the Gulf is increasing in size by the day, much like the pressure to launch a military attack.
In this context of great tension where the stakes are so high, any ambiguous political words or action on the war, but also, where applicable, any absence of initiative against the war, actually constitute an advantage for the most aggressive and unilateralist government the United States has ever known.
A builder's work can be recognised from its foundations, and, in the same way, Europe's ambition on the global stage can be measured in a critical international situation.
Mr Solana, you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen, or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council.
This does not merit such rejoicing.
The declaration had only just been published when London and Madrid, in particular, were already stripping it of its substance by stating, respectively, that there was a flagrant violation of resolution 1441, and that the extension of the deadline granted to the inspectors should be as short as possible.
Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix's report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention.
Everything seems to imply that, in the eyes of some, it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able, overall, to access all sites easily, to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days.
Or if Mr ElBaradei thought it were possible, and I quote 'within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme'.
Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified.
We will not, however, achieve this through bombs and blood.
We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work.
Beware of playing down war!
Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable!
Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted, with little or no reaction, from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years.
He does not deserve congratulations, Mr Solana.
We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy, including for the Israeli people themselves.
What did Europe have to say about George Bush's new strategic doctrine, published on 20 September last, which magnifies, and I quote, 'the unequalled strength' of the United States and emphasises, and I quote once again, their determination 'to act alone, if necessary [?] pre-emptively' in order to 'further freedom's triumph'.
What does Europe have to say now in response to the irresponsible statements made by the Secretary-General of the White House last Sunday, implying that the United States would not rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case of conflict in Iraq.
Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq, throughout the region, and all over the world.
We must listen to public opinion.
(Applause)
Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war.
There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany.
Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening.
On the other side of the Atlantic, a movement unprecedented since Vietnam is gathering momentum, based on the slogan, and how clear it is: 'No blood for oil'.
(Mr Le Pen: It sounds like Europe in 1938!)
Calm down!
We are not interested in hearing what you think about it.
My group would like to be able to state these values, state these requirements in Iraq itself, without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, Mr Watson, quite the opposite - nobody, furthermore, will find in my entire political history the slightest leniency towards this dictator, nobody, which is not the case of certain right-wing governments - ...
(Applause)
... without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, therefore, and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years.
That is why my group is unanimous, as are my Green and socialist fellow Members, and even Members from other parliamentary groups, in suggesting that a delegation of Members should go to Baghdad from 2 to 6 February.
There will be more than thirty of us.
In the same vein, my group suggests sending - and will do so - a delegation to the United States.
In Baghdad and in New York or Washington, we want to defend an idea of Europe, Mr President, in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes.
We must not let them down!
(Applause)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we run the risk today of repeating ourselves.
Personally, I would like to make a suggestion.
Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator.
Those who were communist no longer are, and are not defending any communist dictatorships.
I also think that none of those who visited Saddam Hussein to deliver nuclear power stations to him, or, for example, like that young American who was close to the Secretary of State at the time, going by the name of Mr Rumsfeld, to deliver chemical weapons to be dropped on Iran, would now do what they did at the time.
We should take note of this, but the problem lies elsewhere.
The problem is the credibility of an international institution when it comes to imposing something defined intelligently by a German sociologist: 'Make law, not war'.
The problem today is knowing whether we are capable of imposing international law.
In this situation - as Mr Patten and Mr Solana have said - the argument is this: if Iraq does not cooperate, we shall have to force it to disarm.
You are therefore advocating military intervention in the short or medium term.
I believe that, within the context of international order, we must define those situations in which we should fight dictatorships and those in which we should use diplomatic means.
I am indeed saying that I, who, often against my group or other groups, have defended and still defend military intervention in Kosovo and Afghanistan.
I also believe it was right, once again against the majority of my group, to intervene when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, but I believe that today, Saddam Hussein has not been so weak for ten years or so.
He is a bloodthirsty dictator who is weak and who is now incapable of attacking other countries.
That is the distinction in the fight against dictatorships: those which act against other countries and those which do not.
In fact, with regard to butchery, ladies and gentlemen: four million dead in Uganda, with machetes, not with weapons of mass destruction, they killed each other with machetes.
What did we do?
Who intervened to stop this bloodletting?
Nobody!
Nobody intervened!
So, let us stay calm.
We have seen millions of deaths, blood, and nobody was interested: there was no oil.
We took years to intervene in Bosnia: there was no oil.
So let us moderate our great speeches on dictatorships, and murders, and dying children.
There is a problem, however.
Iran now possesses missiles.
Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal.
Iran could now attack Israel, Europe, Greece and reach these regions.
Is anyone suggesting a military foray into Iran?
Obviously not!
That would be too dangerous.
Today, North Korea has said it wants to produce nuclear weapons.
Is anyone suggesting military intervention?
Of course not!
That would be too dangerous.
With the arguments developed with regard to Iraq, we are creating a programme of nuclear proliferation.
We are telling dictators to possess weapons of mass destruction so that nobody attacks them!
That is the truth.
That is why we must step back.
Fine, the Americans and the English are surrounding Iraq, so Iraq cannot move.
So we have time.
We can wait a year.
We can say that the soldiers should stay where they are.
At the same time, however, let us show the world what we are capable of.
Let us solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem while still threatening Saddam Hussein.
Let us change the agenda and our priorities.
That said, let us not fool ourselves, if the inspectors are there now, it is because the soldiers are present.
Let us take advantage of this situation, however, to contain the problem and avoid making war.
At the same time, let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East.
I believe that Ariel Sharon will form a coalition forcing him to negotiate with the Palestinians.
First of all he must be forced to let the Palestinians elect their own representatives so that they can negotiate with the Israelis.
Let us change the agenda.
Let us find a solution to the Middle East and you will see that the Arab masses will applaud us if we have to sort out Saddam Hussein.
If initially, however, we first sort out Saddam Hussein, perhaps for oil, without having taken and carried out any initiative in the Middle East, we will not be credible and we will not create greater justice in the world.
So, 'make law, not war', change the agenda, give us time, stay there for a year or two.
We will disarm Saddam Hussein, but first of all let us find a solution to the Middle East.
(Applause)
Speaking time does not stretch to two years, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Mr President, in our opinion, the essential question now in relation to the Iraqi crisis is how the international community should act in the face of the threat from a dictatorial regime that might or might not have - this is what is being investigated - the capacity to develop or acquire, when they only have access to scarce technical and financial resources, weapons of mass destruction, be they biological or chemical, likely to endanger regional safety and world peace, and potentially to use or supply these to others, particularly terrorists.
The question is how to deal with an undemocratic regime that has breached and continues systematically to breach its international commitments and obligations within the United Nations. This is also a regime that has imposed all kinds of constraints on its people, demonstrating total contempt for their most basic political, economic and social rights.
Having said that, the issue is not, as some have said, America's control of Iraq's oil resources, even if Iraq does have the world's second largest oil reserves and on top of that, its crude oil is of the very highest quality.
This is not the issue, because if it were, we would clearly have to acknowledge that there are also European interests in this area.
In fact, the European Union is already seeing many Iraqi oil transactions taking place in euros and, due to their volume, these transactions contribute considerably to the strength and stability of the European currency as a means of international payment.
To take just one example, we could mention the contracts that Russian oil and gas companies have signed with Iraqi companies, which, according to the press, total 40 billion euros (not dollars).
Mr President, when we criticise a policy, we must come up with alternative proposals and solutions.
We cannot simply oppose options that some consider to be warmongering; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side, in the shape of someone who, in the past, has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future.
We are the first to say that the solution to the conflict must be sought up to the last minute through peaceful and diplomatic means, but we also maintain that the international community, under the auspices of the United Nations, must maintain a firm attitude that leaves no room for doubt as to the need for the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and extremely soon with the UN inspectors. If they do not cooperate, they will have to face other means being used to make them do so.
As a matter of fact, it is worth asking whether dictators who generally rule without any constraint and particularly without the democratic scrutiny of their public, only understand and respect the language of diplomacy, the language that has always been used, as Javier Solana said, when it is backed up and given credibility by the means of coercion available to it, the last resort, as he also said?
We support the work of the UN inspectors and hope that they are given all the means and all the information necessary to conclude their task, and I mean all information, even information already available to other countries.
At the same time, however, we must issue a warning about the need to prevent the Iraqis from indulging in time-wasting manoeuvres in order to put off complying with the UN resolutions without good reason and to ensure that the current status quo remains in place.
Mr President, we make a clear distinction between Iraq's totalitarian regime and its people.
As I said, the Iraqi people have been the main victims of the oligarchy governing them and which uses them to achieve its own ends.
This is precisely why we are calling on the international community to unite on the fundamental issue, for the transatlantic relationship to be strengthened, for the conditions to be established to ensure that we do not see the inspections blocked, constraints put on the evidence given by scientists and officials linked to Iraq's nuclear programmes and that this game of hide and seek with arsenals of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein's supporters is brought to an end.
If we achieve this, if we unite on the fundamental issue, the conditions might then be created for beginning the process of democratisation in Iraq and for enabling its people to enjoy the advantages of peace.
Political torment plagued Europe in the last century.
The ideologically 'legitimised' obsession with power on the part of dictators created millions of victims.
They certainly did not spare their own citizens.
Is the parallel with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein not obvious here?
We should therefore be talking about 'liberation' and not 'war' in respect of Iraq.
At least that is how Saddam's living victims see it.
Sadly enough, they cannot count on the unanimous support of the Member States of the European Union in this regard.
In fact the opposite is true.
The concept of the containment of Saddam's reign of terror is evidently being fostered in the European Union despite all the extremely negative experiences with Baghdad's Ba'athists over the past 10 years.
Today this strategy is being continued in the European desire to extend the UN inspections in Iraq.
That Saddam is again flouting a compulsory Security Council resolution does not spoil the European illusion of Saddam's total disarmament.
It is first and foremost the inhabitants of Mesopotamia who are the ongoing victims of the international community's failure to appreciate the true nature of Saddam's 'Republic of Fear'.
Do the Member States of the European Union want to have this on their consciences, particularly given their own painful experiences during the last century?
Furthermore, Iraq under Saddam remains a permanent potential threat to the entire Middle East, not least on account of her oil reserves.
Desperate diseases need desperate remedies, as the saying goes.
War is awful, but the consequences of an overly tolerant attitude may in time cause more devastation.
Recent European history should show government leaders their responsibility in this regard.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone here is talking about the Iraqi crisis.
There is no Iraqi crisis, but an extremely serious international crisis deliberately created by the Bush administration.
It is not the dictator Saddam Hussein who is the warmonger.
The warmonger is Bush, the democrat.
Iraqi aircraft carriers are not manoeuvring along the coasts of New England, nor are Iraqi marines taking up position in Mexico, Canada or Cuba.
It is the Anglo-American armada that is reviving gunboat diplomacy in the Middle East.
Why was the alleged need to disarm Iraq not brought to light before the election of Bush junior?
Nobody honestly believes that Iraq, a small country with twenty million inhabitants, surrounded by hostile or suspicious countries, whose army and economic infrastructures were levelled by Desert Storm, whose people have been ruined by ten years of Anglo-American bombing and by an embargo which has killed, amongst others, over a million children who have died from poverty and hunger; nobody believes that this small country, monitored by satellites and by spy planes, by the UN inspectors, could have assembled an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and threaten world peace.
Furthermore, this is the gist of the report by one of the main UN inspectors, amongst others.
Was Saddam Hussein not already a dictator when he received weapons of all kinds from the United States, Europe, France, and even Jacques Chirac?
I am thinking of the nuclear reactor at Osirak which was destroyed by the Israelis in an aerial attack during peacetime.
Please, let us not be hypocritical!
Let us stop acting out humanitarian indignation.
The United States, whose oil stocks will be used up in ten years' time and which consumes one quarter of the 3.5 billion tonnes used by the planet, and which, furthermore, cannot allow the price per barrel to exceed USD 30, wants to make war to take Iraqi oil and control oil in the Gulf.
It is the American giant, the super-power with 80% of the weapons of mass destruction in the world, and, amongst others, 8000 nuclear warheads, terrifying weapons, which, moreover, it is the only country in the history of the world to have used, that wants to make war.
Mr Solana wants to disarm Iraq and hunt down the dictators of the world.
The latter point constitutes a huge programme which would oblige the United States to attack many of its allies.
With regard to the fight against international terrorism and pursuing it in the places in which it prospers, the Americans could start by bombing London, which is the main place where this type of thing goes on.
Deep in your conscience, you think that the Americans are also working on behalf of Europe, and that is why, eyes lowered, you will allow them to commit the first great crime against humanity of the twenty-first century.
You have waited thirty years to discover that Saddam Hussein used poison gas against the Kurds.
Well, there was a precursor: in 1920, in Kurdistan, in the form of Winston Churchill!
In terms of mass destruction, do you think that the powers in question have never used them and can therefore preach to the world about international morals?
, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. (DE) Mr President, representatives of the Commission, Mr Solana, I believe that both you, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten have made it clear that the European Union has achieved a number of foreign policy successes of which we should remind ourselves at the present time.
For if you add up the number of operations the European Union has mounted in Bosnia and in Macedonia, and consider the great burden that European forces in Afghanistan are taking upon themselves, as well as the fact that the European Union devotes three times as much of its budget to overseas aid as does the United States of America, all these important factors are, in my view, things of which old Europe can be proud.
At the same time, we should also remember that the achievements that this month has seen - the eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union and the consequent extension of the zone of stability and democracy - play a decisive part in making the world more peaceful.
The primary motive for the enlargement of the European Union is that it will extend the stability zone.
I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach.
Hitherto, admittedly, we lacked the ability to speak with one voice when it came to issues of war and peace, a defect dating back as far as last summer.
For if one says that he will join in whatever happens and another that he will not under any circumstances, that makes it difficult to find a middle way, but thank God we have found the essentials of one with help from the French President and from you, Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten.
Ladies and gentlemen, it must also be clear in this context - if we are honest with ourselves - that if we are to get our voice heard everywhere, be it in New York, Washington, or Baghdad, it will only be by attempting to work out a common position based on the knowledge that this is the only way.
This is the road we must take, rather than following others on their celebratory processions, whether these be to Baghdad or to Washington.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that we should now press on with the endeavour that the Council has - God be thanked - set in motion this week, which, for the time being at least, gave us a halfway reasonable position, with the multilateral approach being particularly valued and preferred, and with the attempt being made, within the UN framework, at finding a peaceful solution.
It must, however, be made clear that this must be kept up to the very end.
This is a consensus that does not just last for eight days, but one that must be made to work.
Ladies and gentlemen, any consideration of these matters must of course have as its starting point the view of the international community - expressed, for example, in Resolution 1441 - that Iraqi disarmament must take place, and that Saddam Hussein must play an active part in it.
Dr Blix, for example, has stated that these conditions have not been met, and so it is a good thing that the efforts of many have gained us a breathing space, time that must be used to find a peaceful solution, by which I mean the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction - insofar as they actually exist - and the disarmament of Iraq, thus enabling the will of the international community, as expressed in international law, to prevail.
However, ladies and gentlemen, Dr Blix's inspectors need to have the same information as is held by those who claim they were already aware that there was something there and that they would at some point present the facts to the public.
In my view, Dr Blix should be told the facts right now, for how are we to explain to the public that a war is inevitable if we do not tell even our allies' inspectors the whole truth, thus enabling them to find what they are looking for?
It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here, one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come.
It should not, however, be forgotten, when considering this issue, that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer.
Baroness Nicholson and I were in an Iranian camp for Iraqi refugees, and I have seen how people had to live there, having been driven from their homes and tormented by Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons.
The depiction of Saddam Hussein as someone who represents no real danger does not strike me as credible.
Ladies and gentlemen, we should also be clear in our own minds about the real menace of weapons of mass destruction when they are in the hands of people such as Saddam Hussein, particularly if he is to emerge from this conflict as the victor, with all the resulting effects on the region's morale.
We should also be stating what is to happen once the war is over.
What form is political reconstruction to take?
For how long will Western troops have to remain there?
To what extent does this relate to the creation of a new order in the region as a whole, what sort of new order will that be, and at what cost?
To date, I have heard no answer to these questions, and I believe that if you are going to go into something, you have to think about how you are going to get out again.
Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will begin with a quotation, one which sums up like no other statement our position on the war against Iraq: 'A preventive war is an act of aggression, and cannot be described as a just war in self-defence.
For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack, but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent.
Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law's prohibition of force, promote political instability and, in the final analysis, shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.'
And elsewhere in the same statement: 'Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law.'
These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued, on 20 January of this year, by the Conference of German Bishops.
As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops, I have to do so, and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them.
All the time I have known you, Mr Solana, I have regarded you as a great optimist, so when you say, as you have done today, that the political situation is bad, then the political situation is very bad.
Donald Rumsfeld, the American minister for war, spoke of 'old Europe'.
All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe, and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part, had he not drawn the distinction between us and the 'new Europe' - those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld's and who think along the same lines as he does.
President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week, 'If it is President Bush's vision, it is mine!'
The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose, but there is no doubt that the Polish government - like all the governments of the other candidate countries - is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union, to which they want to belong.
The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union, and we wish to welcome them, but, when it comes to issues of war and peace, preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law, we expect them to be solidly alongside us.
Mr President, Mr Solana and Mr Kinnock, it is very good that we are having this debate.
It is a very complex issue, and developments are taking place so quickly that the situation is changing almost from one day to the next.
This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really appreciates the efforts you are making, Mr Solana, towards uniting the EU around a single policy.
The Greek Presidency shares this ambition.
It is no easy task.
At the same time, it is very clear that the EU is not united.
In all facets of the Iraq issue we have heard differing views from different capital cities.
I dare say that it has never before been so evident that the EU has failed in developing a common foreign and security policy.
For all the fine words and the rhetoric, we stand empty-handed; which is terribly tragic.
It might be possible to compensate for this if we start now to make attempts to reach agreement on a strategy for what we want to see happening after Saddam Hussein, whether or not there is a war.
What should be done with Saddam Hussein?
What role should the EU play in the reconstruction process?
How could peace, freedom, democracy and human rights be guaranteed for the people of Iraq, who have suffered for so long?
How is the EU to help in improving the humanitarian situation, and how prepared are we to help the neighbouring countries with the refugees who are already pouring out of Iraq?
It goes without saying that we all hope that a war can be avoided.
It is obvious that the inspectors, under the leadership of Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, need more time.
Iraq and Saddam Hussein are playing games with us; one cannot help feeling that they have something to hide.
Iraq must pull itself together.
It is Iraq's own responsibility, not that of the UN, to prove that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country.
The question of war or peace lies in Iraq's own hands.
Our view is that the inspectors need more time, a view expressed by many others here.
When they report to the Security Council again in a few weeks' time, it will be the UN Security Council that will take decisions on what is to happen next.
Any decisions on a military strike, which might unfortunately be necessary, must be taken by the UN.
A unilateral US strike would be extremely unfortunate, not only with regard to its consequences for the region, but also because it would harm transatlantic relations a very, very long way into the future.
Lastly, I must express my regret that individual MEPs are going to Baghdad on their own initiative.
I am convinced that they are doing so with good intentions, but this will be exploited by the Iraqi dictator to reinforce the image of disharmony in the international community.
Those who go there cannot influence Saddam Hussein: he has not shown himself to be open to argument.
Instead, they run the risk of becoming his hostages and getting in the way of the work of the inspectors.
It is of course up to individuals whether or not they decide to travel, but the European Parliament is in danger of looking extremely ridiculous on the international stage.
I would advise strongly against making this journey.
Mr President, I too am inclined to think that we should take a little look back in time.
Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein?
It was the United States, and they used him in the war against Iran.
When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people, the United States was informed of the fact.
An American attack on Iraq would not only be an attack on an individual country. It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system.
That is why it is important for Mr Solana and Mr Patten to call upon all the Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder in the EU on this matter in order to safeguard international law and to ensure a future for the UN.
I think that Great Britain and Spain, specifically, should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war.
It would not of course be a war to disarm Iraq and introduce democracy there.
Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shia Muslim government in Iraq, reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran?
Is that within the bounds of possibility?
Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence?
Certainly, not much importance can be attached, then, to the talk of democracy.
If the intention is to disarm Iraq, then that is the role assigned - rightly - to the weapons inspectors.
If the desire is to disarm Iraq, it is a question of supporting the work being done by the weapons inspectors and Hans Blix.
There is of course also the alternative of strengthening democracy in Iraq by removing the sanctions, other than those concerned with chemical and other weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In that way, it would be possible to strengthen the Iraqi people and the democratic forces in Iraq, as well as democracy and peace for all of us.
We also have another task. It is to ensure that the whole region is inspected and that we obtain a policy for disarming it: not only Iraq but also Iran and Israel.
In conclusion, I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war.
I believe that the way forward is through democracy, development and cooperation.
Mr President, it is chilling to see how the preparations to invade Iraq have gathered pace, despite the extra time given to the weapons inspectors which, of course, we all welcome.
We are seeing a situation where the most powerful country in the world has made clear its determination to wage war against Iraq, with or without United Nations backing and whether or not the weapons inspectors find any weapons of mass destruction.
A pre-emptive attack like this would set a new international precedent that has no basis in the United Nations Charter.
Such a war on Iraq would be immoral, unjustifiable and illegal.
It would make the world a much more dangerous place, causing more resentment and fuelling more terrorism.
The victims, as always, would be the innocent civilians: the hundreds of thousands of men and women and particularly the children who have already suffered years of oppression, hardship and sanctions which have put them under the complete control of Saddam Hussein.
There is already a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and now the people are being threatened again.
Britain has already announced the deployment of some 30,000 troops and the United States 130,000 troops which are being mobilised in readiness to attack.
Opposition to this war is growing with every day that passes by groups of people of all ages, from all walks of life, and on 15 February 2003 there are going to be peace demonstrations right around the world.
Those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war.
I have received many letters from Wales and from other countries asking the European Parliament to do everything that it can to try and stop this war.
Peaceful means of solving the problems have not been properly explored, let alone exhausted.
It is tragic that if a fraction of the effort made by the United States and the United Kingdom to kindle their support for war had been put into bringing peace in the Middle East, we would live in a much safer and more peaceful world.
Mr President, all statements - from any government or any government representative - seeking to point out differences between positions or diplomatic shortcomings are unwise.
Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or, at least, homogeneous positions.
I therefore regret that, instead of working towards a European position or, at least, mediation through a Council meeting, we have split up and established unilateral parameters and positions which do nothing to further either the cause of peace or the development of a common foreign policy, and a common foreign policy is one of the goals towards which the Convention is working.
The United States is not the only guardian of peace and justice, nor is it the only country qualified to declare war should that prove to be necessary and unavoidable in the interests of the common good.
The contrasting statements which have been made in recent days promote the cause of the dictator, Saddam Hussein, rather than the development of what is a problematic peace process.
I therefore, Mr President, call upon the Council, working together with the other European institutions, to concentrate on creating a climate of more serene cooperation between the countries of the Union, so that we can unite in an agreement and address the increasingly serious problems before us every day together.
I would like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the mediation initiative he has undertaken in the last few hours and I hope that everyone will work for peace, just as we must all strive to combat terrorism and dictatorships, even if that means declaring war.
Mr President, no one should be in any doubt that I shall celebrate on the day that Saddam Hussein's regime of terror comes to an end. I do not, however, believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem.
President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil. I, for my part, do not.
I am convinced, rather, that Mr Bush's, Mr Cheney's and Mrs Condoleezza Rice's interests in the oil industry are significantly greater than their concern for the well-being of the Iraqi people.
Nor do I entertain any doubts that a war would be a unique opportunity to test approximately 20 new weapons systems, as well as being good for the American arms industry.
Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions. So must Israel too, moreover, and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU.
All methods other than war must be tried and, if war is unavoidable, it must be backed up by the UN and supported by powerful forces in Iraq itself.
Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons.
Iraq does not constitute any immediate threat, either to its neighbours or to the global community.
A war, on the other hand, could have completely unpredictable consequences.
It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism.
There has been no success in improving the lives of the Afghan people, and there would scarcely be any success, either, in improving the lot of the Iraqis.
The same applies to the sanctions against Iraq, which have merely made it easier for Saddam to oppress his people.
At a time when people's education is largely left to mullahs and the indoctrination they practise, what, I wonder, would happen if the United States were to use only 10% of the money expected to be spent on the war on providing the Arab world with, for example, free schools?
That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution.
War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution.
Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone seems to be for peace, saying 'No to war'.
Can you see anyone saying 'Yes to war'?
Everyone - the Pope, the antipope, the communists, the fascists, everyone - is saying 'No to war'.
What is the alternative to 'No to war', however?
Specifically, it is the risk of war breaking out - which you have mentioned - in 15, 20 or 30 days' time.
What a wonderful success for the European Union: it would appear that the European Union has, at last, achieved agreement on a practical matter, if I am not mistaken, in calling for the inspectors to be given a few more weeks, for them to be given a little more time, a little more money, resources and a little more support.
Later on, however, after 20 days, will there be a different strategy?
What will Europe propose?
The alternative to the destruction we call war - how do we, how do you see it?
There is an alternative, and it is not peace: peace is what we have at the moment.
For the time being, we are not at war, as you say, as my friend, Mr Le Pen, says, for whom the value of freedom and the value of fundamental human rights do not exist.
That is his opinion!
We all know the sorts of things that Mr Le Pen can say and the meanings that can be inferred.
You can all go together: Mr Le Pen went to visit Saddam Hussein 12, 13 or 14 years ago with Mr Fini; now you can all go together.
I can see some logic in all this.
We radicals have presented a proposal. In the space of four days, we have received approval from 66 countries.
In Italy, to date, we have received approval from 57 Members of Parliament, half of them centre-left and half of them centre-right, including the former Prime Minister, Mr Andreotti, and other important figures who support this proposal.
What are we suggesting?
What proposal are we now submitting to you too?
The alternative is called 'democracy', the alternative is called 'law' and 'rights', the alternative consists of enforcing written international law at last - for, although it is in force, it is not being enforced, as often happens in our country - that international law which, all things considered, has now identified a kind of subjective right to freedom and democracy belonging to the people living in this country, and by 'this country' we mean the world.
We have the chance to choose what the European Union wants, to choose whether it wants war or not, whether it wants Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq - for, whatever Mr Watson may say, he will leave accompanied, he will essentially have safe conduct as far as his place of exile, and, moreover, I would advise Mr Watson to read the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, from which he will learn that, in any case, Saddam Hussein cannot be prosecuted in this situation - but what we can and must do is realise that the UN and the Security Council have a duty to act.
It is not a question of changing the dictator but of changing the regime.
That is what is needed in this part of the world, where the gun held to Saddam Hussein's temple, for better or worse, now gives him the chance to make a limited choice between falling in a coup currently being plotted by his closest friends, shooting himself, committing suicide in a bunker, dying in a massacre or leaving the country, as many dictators have done, and being taken to live in exile somewhere else.

This is our proposal, the alternative to war, as I have told Mr Cohn-Bendit too, and, more specifically: 'temporary government' - in inverted commas - by the UN for two or three years until fundamental rights are established in that country - using Amartya Sen's economics and other methods; there have been temporary governments in Japan, Germany and other places - governments with the task of restoring to the Iraqi citizens and the Middle East the rights which have been taken from them through violence.
This is our proposal, and may the others rest in eternal peace.
I believe that we are choosing something different: living in freedom, according to the law, building a life which is worthy of being lived and consists of more than just constant dread of the terror of death.
Mr President, I would like to join several other speakers in expressing satisfaction at the conclusions of the General Affairs Council and praising those people who have been involved in this agreement.
But we naturally hope for more and we therefore ask that work continue in order to achieve a fundamental consensus between the European Union's current four representatives on the United Nations Security Council, in the hope that the four will act, at least, in a coordinated fashion.
But I believe that that consensus demands at least two things: the first is not to publicise unilateral positions but to debate them with our partners and the second is to be loyal - but not copycats - to our natural allies.
Because although it seems obvious, we must remember that in this conflict the person who is threatening world peace, failing to comply with international law and presenting us with the real risk that international terrorists may acquire chemical and bacteriological weapons is Saddam Hussein.
And it does not take any great feat of memory to conclude that the only language the Iraqi Government understands from the international community is firmness.
And this firmness is not credible if we say beforehand that in no event, whatever happens, can the use of force be justified, as the President of my group quite rightly said.
This is not pacifism, it is demagoguery and irresponsibility.
In order to genuinely work for peace, what we have to do is act decisively against violations of international law and against repeated non-compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations.
We believe that the European Union should continue to explore all political and diplomatic avenues in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner, with our allies, as is natural, and also, and in particular, with our friends, the Arab nations.
I would remind you of the unanimous support of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council for Resolution 1441, because this is not a religious conflict or a conflict between civilisations - incidentally, it would be good to take this opportunity to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean relations.
In order to be credible, the European Union must be prepared to make its contribution to guaranteeing and preserving international peace and security.
The inspectors' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441.
They are not being given the required assistance to carry out their work and they are not being given the evidence to show that weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, and the simple fact that terrorist groups may acquire these weapons should be cause for alarm on the part of the international community.
The Iraqi regime today has a new opportunity; let us pray that it takes that opportunity and that we can all prevent anything worse from happening.
But if the Iraqi Government persists in ignoring the requirements demanded of it, not for just a month or two, but since April 1991, when Resolution 687 was adopted, democratic parliaments such as the European Parliament must demand of the executive powers that they meet their responsibilities.
Democratic and responsible governments must not make decisions on the basis of opinion polls, which are variable, but by informing the public, engaging in political debate but defending the higher principles at stake, such as international peace and security, not the price of oil.
And periodically, by means of democratic elections, the citizens will judge whether the governments, and also the oppositions, have made the right decisions.
Mr President, 72% of my compatriots are against a war in Iraq.
They have not yet seen any convincing evidence.
They are concerned about the human suffering, the increasing South-North divide that will increase hatred amongst people and hinder democratisation and solutions in the Middle East.
The fear is that fundamentalists of all hues will use and abuse the opportunity to determine our world agenda, which will result in the opposite of world peace, stability and justice.
In a world in which oil prices are rising and the chance of peace is falling, it is the developing countries with no oil that are the main victims.
The gap will grow.
The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined.
Whoever tries to oust Saddam through war without convincing evidence, without a UN resolution and therefore without public opinion on their side, is undermining the international rule of law.
Europeans are not at all convinced.
That is why the European members of the UN Security Council must exert maximum pressure on Saddam to answer Blix's questions without making the mistake of falling into an unregulated and improper war.
Germany, Britain, France and Spain must all listen to their people and not to the fundamentalist Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in George Bush's circle.
There have fortunately been many protests from the American people, and a large number of Democrats have rejected the logic of inevitable war.
We are looking for allies among the American people, the majority of whom are not in favour of a unilateral war.
We reject the logic of inevitable war.
The dictator Saddam must fear the wrath of the whole world, but this must be aimed at allowing him to cooperate peacefully in finding answers and not in another Bay of Pigs or another Tonkin incident.
And if Bush ultimately comes up with the evidence which he has been repeatedly promising us and which Blix has also urgently requested, that is not a reason for war but, on the contrary, to inspect through the UN and then to tackle and eliminate the problems.
The power of a united Security Council must bring Saddam to his knees, and we must take time to do that.
We have the time, Saddam does not.
A war without convincing evidence or a UN resolution would be an admission of weakness and would really play into the hands of the Saddams of this world.
Let us Europeans, via you, Mr Solana, the 15 Member States and the Security Council, build on our European peoples' desire for peace.
That is true wisdom.
Mr President, resolution 1441 is very clear.
It declares in paragraph 1 that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under the relevant resolutions including resolution 687 of 1991.
Resolution 687 of 1991 details the United Nations' demands of international monitoring, inspection and verification of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.
It imposes sanctions, except as regards medical and humanitarian supplies, to ensure compliance.
It places a clear prohibition on the commission of, or support for, acts of terrorism.
It demands the restoration of Kuwaiti prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property and it warns of grave consequences which would follow Iraq's continued use of weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq is indeed guilty and in breach on all those counts.
For example, it supports terrorists such as the MKO (Mujahedin-e Khalq Organisation), proscribed on the European Union list of terrorists.
It trains, arms and sends out that terrorist group and has done so for a long time now.
Possibly also, through war in the north of Iraq, we are discovering its links with the Al Qaida network of international terrorists.
I turn to weapons of mass destruction.
I have talked in earlier debates of the use of mustard gas in the marshes in 1996 and of the victims I saw.
Mr Brok, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, mentioned our mission to Iran, during which we talked to a few of the tragic people who had suffered the consequences of that misuse of weapons of mass destruction, with Kuwaiti prisoners of war still being hidden and property still not returned.
Despite these breaches, resolution 1441 gives Iraq one final chance, a slender window of opportunity that it seems to be refusing to open.
Resolution 1441 calls us also to witness and to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people.
The resolution points to the prolongation of the crisis of humanitarian dimensions as the consequence of Iraq's refusal to implement resolution 687 and others.
What are the consequences?
Millions of refugees.
Iran has borne a major burden, Jordan has large numbers, Syria enormous numbers too and Turkey also, not to mention other countries in the region.
We have a relatively small number in the European Union.
Hundreds of thousands, yes, but not the four and a half million that are in the region.
These refugees are alive; others have been tortured, killed or imprisoned and have no freedom of speech.
Saddam is indeed dangerous to the region and beyond, and dangerous to his own people.
If he retains his power, we cannot be sure in the future that he will not once more go back to spending three-quarters of his gross national product on weapons, 15, 16, 17 billion dollars' worth of new weapons in the region year on year.
That is the threat he poses to the region, and he has instruments which will allow him to put those weapons of mass destruction beyond Iraq's national borders.
Resolution 687 had an overall objective of restoring international peace and security in the region.
I believe that the United Nations' will is now to secure that goal.
Our unity as a European Union should be deployed in support of their efforts.
Mr President, may we ask what Mr Solana and Mr Patten are doing to translate into action their professed will to avoid war, beyond reassessing the need to disarm the awful Iraqi regime, beyond formally relying on the Security Council to do so or even trusting Mr Powell to testify as an eye witness that Bin Laden has been bedding with Saddam Hussein?
The problem is that the decision to bomb Iraq into a morgue unfit for the dead was taken a long time ago on the Potomac.
People all over the world have understood this and are angry and are mobilising against it.
It is all very well to say that we must announce the role of the United Nations.
But, may I ask, who is demeaning that role and proclaiming every day that, with or without the United Nations, war will be unleashed, probably by 6 March 2003, whatever the Security Council may or may not say?
Regarding solid evidence, we do not know for sure if this bloody dictator still has these awful weapons and neither does Dr Blix.
What the United States is asking from Saddam Hussein, however, is not to prove his innocence but to provide evidence of his own guilt, that is, to put his own neck in the noose to be hanged or be bombed to smithereens.
If this were a criminal case, it would be thrown out of any court in this world.
So, to adapt the words of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, there is quite a lot of ambiguity, obfuscation and the undeclared will to follow the warmongering lead of Washington, hoping only that the United Nations will provide the desired fig leaf.
This, we must say, probably for the last time, is a defining moment for Europe.
This Union must reclaim the moral and rational initiative and, first of all, save itself from some of its leaders.
Mr President, Mr Solana, at this stage in the debate, it is difficult not to repeat what other Members have already said.
I hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups, as well as on a number of amendments.
I would simply like to repeat that, in fact, in listening to you, in listening to my fellow Members, I think that one of the starting points of our thinking is the will, which has been widely confirmed by many of our citizens, to reject military intervention, whether or not it is supported by a United Nations resolution, incidentally.
I believe we must ask ourselves the searching question: why, in the fifteen countries of the Union, are we seeing such a vehement rejection of war?
The reasons have already been partly cited.
First of all, there are no determining facts to explain why Iraq might be more dangerous today than two years ago.
I am nevertheless surprised that Mr Bush suddenly decided that 5 February will be the date on which he will be able to provide proof that he has probably possessed for a long time.
Next, and without wishing to be anti-American, I think that the people of Europe vaguely dislike a single government deciding the priorities of the international calendar, however powerful this government considers itself to be.
It is clearly because of that, and we agree, that we would like to see increased power for the United Nations and for the European Union as a world player, but also to set another agenda.
In this regard, I believe the president of my group, Mr Cohn-Bendit, spoke brilliantly; I think he is right: we need to defend other priorities.
Naturally, it is easier said than done and it depends a great deal on the Arab, Persian and Turkish societies in the region.
We also have our share of responsibility, however.
I would like to return to the matter of the embargo to conclude.
The embargo is helping the dictatorship.
It is killing the Iraqi people.
I believe we should, and you are probably doing this, inform the Iraqi opposition by all possible and imaginable means that, of course, Saddam Hussein must respond to the questions of the UN inspectors, but that if changes were to take place in Iraq, we could help them by lifting the embargo, solely, of course, on non-military goods.
I believe this message must be stated more firmly and should be conveyed through the appropriate diplomatic channels.
Mr President, we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people.
But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world, and making their voice heard, consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large.
There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors.
I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq.
Washington's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
We all know what those prisoners are suffering.
There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq.
The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth.
Make no mistake, this war is about oil.
We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction.
I say to Mr Bush: pull my other leg!
Just look at the United States' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
The European Union is footing that particular bill.
Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever.
In my view, the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Without the agreement of the UN Security Council, this war would be a breach of international law, would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral.
More than 80% of European people are against war in Iraq.
Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war.
So much for democracy.
I believe that, after Iraq, the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil.
Truly a war of civilisations.
May God helps us all!
Mr President, there is essentially nothing surprising about the situation today.
It is no surprise that the United States have what could be called a need for war, simply because empires can only live through and in a state of war.
Nor is it surprising that they need to invent pretexts.
Nor is it surprising that Europe, in the face of this, is ludicrously divided.
Nor is it surprising that France, in Europe and throughout the world, symbolises resistance to imperial terrorism.
Of course, we are well aware that this empire needs wars, just like any other empire since the beginning of time: war in Kosovo in 1999, in Afghanistan in 2001, in Iraq today and soon, perhaps, also in CÃŽte-d'Ivoire - where this would supposedly be to defend the country against France.
It needs wars for various reasons, for oil, naturally, since oil is so very necessary to Bush's oil consortium, but also for economic reasons.
The American economy, as we are forever being told, is on hold and this situation is decidedly bad for growth.
In this cruel system, the boost to the economy comes at the price of several hundred thousand deaths.
Once again, nothing surprises us any more.
Nor should we be surprised at Washington's pathetic need to disguise its crimes.
What is surprising, however, is that we still take them seriously.
The argument concerning weapons of mass destruction, for which we have not the slightest proof, is no longer valid, and has not been valid for a long time in the eyes of public opinion in the greater part of the world.
Lest we be accused of anti-Americanism, I would recall what was written by Scott Ritter, an American citizen and member of the first inspection mission halted in 1998 by a first, or second, or third American war.
He wrote quite simply that Saddam Hussein cannot have kept the slightest usable chemical weapons programme after the first inspection mission.
I do not have time to explore the other points, but it is also unsurprising that Europe is divided.
Some Member States feel more like members of the federation of the United States than of the European Union. One example of which, but not the only one, is the United Kingdom, the reason for whose membership of the European Union is hard to fathom.
Then there are others who, like France, retain the idea of a world organised into nations.
It is not surprising that France should remain the symbol of resistance to imperial violence: this is its age-old vocation and the vast majority of its people today strongly support the President of the Republic in carrying out this age-old duty.
Mr President, we all know that pacifism has often been the worst enemy of peace: Munich remains in all our memories.
For now, however, the observation that we must make following the inspectors' report is that Iraq has not clearly refused to implement resolution 1441.
Without any genuinely new information, and we shall see whether the US Secretary of State is able to provide any, nothing therefore currently justifies the Security Council adopting a new resolution authorising the instigation of military operations against Baghdad.
In order to be able to justify the international community's move to the second phase of action, the elements of proof would have to be equal to the seriousness of the accusations.
Until now, however, no proof has been provided, whereas substantial grey areas remain.
In this context, the instigation of a war, bypassing the Security Council, against a State that now appears to comply with the decisions of the international community would undoubtedly have effects contrary to those desired.
By placing Saddam Hussein in the paradoxical position of persecuted innocent in the eyes of developing world opinion, he would inevitably relaunch the very Islamic terrorism that we have undertaken to eradicate.
In the current conditions, Mr President, the cure would therefore be worse than the disease.
Mr President, today's debate is probably the most important of all the debates in which I have had the honour of taking part since entering this House.
I believe it concerns the very future of the European Union in its legitimate ambition to take up the position expected of it by the world on the international stage: a Europe allied with the United States to defend our common values, but not necessarily in agreement with all their positions.
We know that, in order to do so, Europe must succeed in speaking with a single voice and we are working continually within this House and within the Convention to achieve this.
We are forced to note, however, that, with regard to Iraq, voices are currently divided between those who are opposed to any kind of military action or threat; those who, alongside the Americans, seem determined to take military action in the next few days and those, myself included, who are a majority within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who ask that we only resort to war when we have exhausted all diplomatic means of persuading Saddam Hussein to give in and of forcing him to abandon all his projects for the development and production of weapons of mass destruction.
To all those who reject any idea of military action, to those who say 'never again' to war, I would like to say that I respect the generosity of their commitment, even though I do not share their angelic vision of a world entirely without weapons, where universal peace could be established, where all violence could cease for moral reasons, and not simply because of a fear of retribution.
I would like to remind all those people of the unfortunate experience of Kosovo, where Europe was unable to oblige Milosevic to end his ethnic cleansing policy because that dictator, who had always known how far he could go before going too far, did not believe in the political will of the European Union or in its ability to implement it within the alliance.
Today, we are all in agreement in condemning Saddam Hussein, not only for the risk he represents in relation to international terrorism in the production and distribution of weapons of mass destruction, but also because of the cruelty of the regime he imposes on his people.
We believe, together with the United Nations Security Council, that he should realise that he can no longer prevaricate and that he must now, in the next few days, provide proof that he is resigned to disarming and has resolved to do so, or he will have to face a war which he has no chance of winning.
To those of my fellow Members who are determined to go to Iraq to send a different message and ensure that there will never be a war, I would therefore say here, rather solemnly: take care that you yourselves, in encouraging him in his extremism, are not responsible for the fact that the international community might have no other option than the use of weapons to impose the implementation of the will it has been stating for years.
I would now turn to all those who think that all the elements are present to authorise the immediate deployment of armed intervention, with no need for a new United Nations Security Council resolution and I would say to them: public opinion does not agree with you on this point since it is demanding proof that this action is unavoidable and a guarantee that it will be carried out in compliance with and in defence of international law.
Colin Powell must provide this proof to the Security Council and a delegation from Parliament must go to New York on Monday to give the matter the serious consideration it deserves.
If this proof is provided, I have no doubt that the United Nations Security Council will not fail to draw the appropriate conclusions.
If the proof, however, is not yet sufficient, then the United Nations inspection mission must be given the time it requests to try, again, to avoid a war.
That is the essence of the proposal for a resolution by our political group and the joint resolution that will be presented tomorrow.
You will understand, however, after what I have just said, that we must not in any way give the impression that we are excluding the possibility of military action.
That would be totally counter-productive and that is why we have tabled several amendments to the draft joint resolution, the most important of which concerns the current wording of Article 3, which some people could interpret that way.
As I believe, together with the majority of my fellow Members, in the importance of this joint resolution, which must show the world that, at least within the European Parliament, the voices of Europe are in harmony, I sincerely hope that, taking account of the amendments we are proposing, this resolution will be able to win over the votes of as broad a majority as possible.
Mr President, High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, I shall, of course, be voting in favour of the resolution that has arisen out of the agreement between various parliamentary groups.
This is a possible compromise, but I believe it to be inadequate.
The doctrine of a preventive war to protect the vital interests of the United States is unacceptable.
The Pope has said this and felt obliged to condemn such a doctrine because it contravenes international law and the United Nations Charter.
This doctrine should, therefore, be expressly criticised and rejected by the European Parliament.
Furthermore, the 'erratic' policy of the Bush administration - as Bill Clinton called it, and erratic is the least that can be said about it - conceals the monstrous concerns of a new strategy to control oil in the Middle East and has provided cover for the real and unacceptable State terrorism taking place; the terrorism perpetrated by the government of Ariel Sharon.
I am saying this on the day following Ariel Sharon's victory in the Israeli elections, which will, in my opinion, have tragic consequences for Israel.
I very much hope that I am mistaken, because I consider myself to be a friend of the Israeli people.
Yesterday's speech by George Bush was once again extremely arrogant and without any real foundation.
He clearly wants war at any cost, for reasons of his own and to protect the interests of the United States.
The existence of weapons of mass destruction, an accusation that President Bush is levelling - so far without any convincing evidence - at the dictator and murderer Saddam Hussein seems simply to be a pretext, ignoring Kim Jong-Il, the Korean dictator - who does indeed have atomic weapons - and all the other dictators in the Middle East.
I wish to conclude by praising the courage and political clear-mindedness of the French and German Governments for having condemned war against Iraq without the express authorisation of the United Nations.
We, and I, as a Member of the European Parliament, are proud of the 'old' Europe.
All the European governments, in my opinion, especially those of the Fifteen, should uphold this position.
Telling the truth is the best way of demonstrating our friendship and respect towards the United States of America; the America of the pioneer spirit and of idealism, not the America of self-interest and dirty deals.
Having listened, Mr President, to the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday and Mr Solana and Mr Patten today, it seems to me that they are engaged in a painful struggle to keep their options for war open while, at the same time, entertaining what can only be described as downright opposition on the part of our citizens to the prospect of war.
The European Union's famous common position is basically a manifesto for war; that much is clear from the fact that Blair has signed it.
If the European Union were against war with Iraq, it would exercise its veto in the Security Council.
Its Member States would not be sending frigates to the Gulf and would not be accommodating US demands.
They would be abiding by the principle of the UN, which precludes military action except in self-defence, which does not apply here.
The European Union is therefore merely stalling for time so that it can finish haggling with the USA for control of Iraq's oil fields.
This is what this is really about, if the truth be told.
If Iraq had no black gold, frankly no one would give a damn.
Its supposed weapons of mass destruction are just a pretext.
There are countries in the world, such as India, Pakistan and Israel, that possess weapons of mass destruction, and there are countries, like the USA, that produce and sell and use them.
We Communists have no time for Saddam Hussein's bloody dictatorship.
We have a score to settle with him because our thousands of Iraqi comrades were his first victims.
However, whether or not he should remain in power is a question only the Iraqi people can answer and it is our duty to offer them active political solidarity.
Just as in the last war and during the embargo on Iraq, this war will have disastrous consequences for the long-suffering Iraqi people.
And as things now stand, it will have dramatic consequences - including economic consequences - closer to home.
What we must call for, therefore, is for this criminal war to be averted at all costs, with or without a UN resolution.
Yes to the peaceful resolution of international problems.
No to any move to accommodate the sabre-rattling president of the United States acting as the mouthpiece of multinational interests.
We must express our solidarity with the American people, more and more of whom are raising their voices in protest against this war.
Mr President, some time ago, Scott Ritter, the former weapons inspector, paid a visit to the European Parliament.
He asked us to travel to Iraq to support the weapons inspections.
He believed that would show not only the USA and the world at large, but also Iraq, that the weapons inspections are not something thought up by the USA, but the only way to achieve peace; and it would show that the weapons inspectors have strong support, even among us pacifists and opponents of war.
At a video conference yesterday with the chairmen of the political groups, Hans Blix confirmed that he too believes that there is something to be gained from Members of the European Parliament travelling to Iraq and clearly expressing their support for weapons inspections to the Iraqi leaders.
Against this background, it is very sad to listen to attempts by the Liberals to malign and cast suspicion on the 30 or so Members of the European Parliament who have decided to travel to Iraq with a view to promoting peace.
It is easy to sit in safety back home in Europe and pour scorn on those of us who, out of desperation in the face of the risk of a large-scale war, are trying to make at least a small contribution.
I think that is very sad.
