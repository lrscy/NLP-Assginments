That is not to say that the situation is easy or very nice, but let us be as responsible as possible in the present circumstances and let us be sure that we have this dialogue - between ourselves, certainly, and with our partners.
It is inconceivable that we could do things that would be contradictory to our partners' wishes.
It will not work.
Madam President, I do not want to bore you by restating what we have said, but together we are saying to China that we are not satisfied with the present situation.
We are, certainly, echoing what has been said by our Japanese friend, that the markets are not fully recognising their present fundamentals, and, as regards the United States, we said together that we noted that the Secretary of the Treasury and the monetary authority had said that a strong dollar vis-Ã -vis the euro was in their interests.
I shall not say anything else on that point, but we have to know exactly what the situation is.
I come now to the last point, which is also an important one: independence.
I noted with great attention the fact that all governments in Europe have said that they would fully respect the independence of the Central Bank.
Jean-Claude Juncker, on behalf of the Eurogroup, said that a moment ago.
Independence is in the Treaty and is the absolute key for credibility.
How could we be credible over the next 50 years if we were not deemed independent by all those who are taking decisions - here in Europe, in New York, in Tokyo, in Singapore, in Hong Kong and elsewhere?
They trust us because we are independent, but independence is not only based upon full respect of the Treaty by our partners, the executive branches, it also depends on us.
I wanted to say, on behalf of the Governing Council - if I could I would say it in several languages to make sure I was well understood! -
(FR) I will preserve most firmly the independence of the ECB in all circumstances.
My 18 colleagues and I intend to adhere strictly to the Treaty on this point, as on all the others.
It will be about the Treaty, the whole Treaty, and nothing but the Treaty.
(DE) As President, I am firmly committed to maintaining the ECB's independence in all circumstances.
My 18 colleagues and I intend to adhere strictly to the Treaty, the whole Treaty and nothing but the Treaty.
Member of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, I would like to end this very interesting debate by making a very brief comment on the application of the Stability and Growth Pact, because in this debate - as in many other debates that we have held inside and outside of this Parliament - some people are calling upon the Commission and the Council - upon the Commission in particular, and quite rightly - to apply the Pact firmly.
And I entirely agree.
The Commission and myself intend to propose to the Council that the Pact be applied as it stands, as it has been agreed.
So a firm application, without exceptions, without breaking any rules, which does not mean a rigid application.
We have had bad experiences when firmness has been confused with rigidity.
Firmness does not mean rigidity.
Firmness means rigour, and rigour, in the face of different and difficult situations, requires a combination of firmness and flexibility if the aim is to achieve the results of budgetary discipline, which is a necessary condition for economic growth.
I now come to my second consideration.
Some of the honourable Members have referred to other efforts that we need to make in order to sustain growth and prolong growth and employment.
We must carry on developing the internal market, and there will be a debate on that before the end of this year.
The Commission has promised the Council that it will present an analysis on the functioning of the internal market and how we believe it should continue to develop.
This is an important debate which is going to follow on from debates such as those that have been held in this Parliament and in the Council on the Services Directive - and we will now have to see how it is applied - a debate that is linked to the increasing integration of financial services, which is crucial in terms of improving the functioning of the Eurozone in particular.
We must carry on talking about the Lisbon Strategy and over the coming months we are going to discuss the review of the integrated guidelines, of the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines.
The structural reforms within the context of the Lisbon Strategy are beginning to bear fruit.
The good results, the wonderful results in employment terms, that the President of the European Central Bank has just mentioned, would not have been possible without the labour market reforms that have been included within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, and neither do I think - although we do not yet have all of the analytical elements in our hands - that it is going to be possible to explain some of the productivity improvements over recent quarters without relating them not just to the economic cycle but also to certain reforms in the product markets, in the services markets, to certain processes, or without the, once again, firm and rigorous but not blind application of the competition rules that the Commission has to oversee in particular.
My final comment, which has been mentioned on several occasions and to which Mr Juncker has already replied, relates to the issue of wages.
I have mentioned it here in Parliament on several occasions, and in discussions outside of it.
I entirely agree with the position laid out by Mr Juncker.
Wages must develop in line with productivity.
While there are improvements in productivity, those improvements must be reflected in the development of wages.
We cannot recommend the negotiation of wages in line with productivity when productivity is not growing and then forget that recommendation when productivity increases.
My feeling is, however, that at the same time we cannot forget the need to moderate the development of wages, not to lose competitiveness and, in the case of the Eurozone, to analyse very thoroughly the reasons for, and alternatives to, the divergent development of unit labour costs between Member States of the Eurozone that can create significant problems in terms of the functioning of countries that are losing competitiveness by this means.
I therefore suggest that we expand this debate a little further.
We must not just focus on wages but also talk about the development of inequalities, because - and I shall link this to the final idea I wish to mention in this debate - the citizens' perception of the euro is a significant element of their perception of Europe and the idea of Europe.
Perceptions of the euro are undoubtedly affected by the citizens' perception of economic development, and we must tell them the truth.
When the economy is going badly, we must say so, but when the economy improves, we must also let that be known.
We must not forget that now that the economy is improving, we must also communicate those improvements to the citizens, whose individual economic situations do not perhaps provide them with a view of the overall development of our economies.
However, that perception of the economic situation, of the effect of European integration, of economic and monetary integration, on individual economies, is also affected by uncertainty about the future, uncertainty about the future of social protection systems, uncertainty about the consequences of globalisation and ageing of the population, and we must respond to those uncertainties without jeopardising the foundations of the Economic and Monetary Union that we have been analysing today.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 12 July.
Palestine (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Palestine.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to tell you that the Council sincerely wishes to debate with Parliament the dramatic events that took place in Gaza last month, as requested at the plenary session of 19 June.
The Council and the Commission reacted promptly, as was made clear in the Council's conclusions of 18 June, which stated that we will not abandon the ordinary people of Gaza.
Every effort is being made to ensure that humanitarian support reaches Gaza, namely our efforts to provide finance and to ensure by political means that Israel allows humanitarian convoys to enter that territory.
We are also keeping our border assistance mission at Rafah on standby.
If all parties can reach agreement on the reopening of the mission and if conditions on the ground permit, the EU will once again continue to support the proper operation of this crossing-point between Gaza and Egypt.
We support the emergency Government of Prime Minister Salam Fayad.
Relations between that Palestinian Authority Government and the EU were immediately normalised.
Israel also has specific obligations. It must act in the same way and finally make available all Palestinian tax and customs revenue, and facilitate access to, and movement around, the West Bank and Gaza, to enable the Palestinians to trade.
Above all, Israel must contribute to the credible peace process which Palestinian leaders such as President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayad are working to develop.
That would be an enormous help.
The appointment of Tony Blair as the new envoy of the Quartet leaves no doubt that the international community continues to be actively involved with this issue.
We are delighted that the former British Prime Minister has made himself available for the task and we sincerely hope that his work will help to strengthen the EU's role in the peace process.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, since the last debate in this House, the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory has profoundly changed.
There are several developments that we should welcome.
Israel has finally resumed the transfer of tax and customs revenue, the European Union has decided to normalise its relations with the Palestinian Authority and there is now a new Palestinian Government headed by Prime Minister Salam Fayyad.
After a three-month interruption, the bilateral meetings between Abbas and Olmert have resumed.
Finally, like many others, I was delighted to hear that the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston had been released after more than three months in captivity.
On the other hand, after the Gaza takeover by Hamas, there is now a high risk of separation between parts of the Palestinian Territory.
The people of Gaza are being isolated from the world, and the tensions between the Palestinian factions have never been so high.
The creation of a viable Palestinian State is, at least, at risk.
We must continue to work on the development of a political perspective in order to provide peace and prosperity for the region.
I hope that the upcoming bilateral meeting between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert, which, it is to be hoped, will take place on 16 July, will help to frame a credible political perspective for the Palestinian people and that it will pave the way for their joint meeting with the Quartet later on.
I hope that the Quartet can continue its cooperation with the Arab partners, and I look forward to the upcoming meeting of the Quartet, which will most probably take place next week, when all these issues can be discussed.
I welcome the appointment of Tony Blair as Quartet envoy, which will certainly further dynamise our role in the Middle East peace process.
He can become a new vector of progress along with the Arab Peace Initiative.
I will, of course, provide him with every possible assistance, as we did for Jim Wolfensohn, including the staff for his team in Jerusalem.
With regard to assistance, the Commission has been quick in reacting to the new situation.
I received a letter from Prime Minister Fayyad, which describes his priority needs.
We are ready and are, of course, already mobilising our assistance to provide support to the new Government.
The Quartet and the General Affairs and Foreign Affairs Councils have endorsed the extension of the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM) until the end of September.
In order to fund TIM operations in the third quarter, we have sent a request to the budgetary authority for a transfer of EUR 80 million.
I am delighted, and I thank you that the Committee on Budgets has this week agreed to this transfer.
We are now able to provide support, through the TIM, until the end of its extension.
Direct financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is already being prepared in the form of a scheme to reimburse private sector arrears, as Salam Fayyad has asked us to do.
This would have a doubly beneficial effect on the financial situation of the Palestinian Authority and of the Palestinian private sector.
We are identifying some funds for this.
The Commission has resumed its long-standing efforts to build the institutions of the future Palestinian State.
We are also providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance.
A project to assist the Ministry of Finance in the area of internal control and audit has just been launched, and we will launch two more shortly.
One is the management of customs, and the other the management of tax revenue.
Finally, a few words on Gaza.
We will not, of course, abandon the people of Gaza or the goal of a viable Palestinian State.
We are providing humanitarian and emergency assistance to the people of Gaza, and ECHO partners are working on the ground.
The TIM is delivering social allowances and fuel.
However, the situation may deteriorate further because access to the Gaza Strip is still a problem.
Therefore, we have to work even more with the Egyptians and the Israelis in order to open the Rafah and Karni border crossings.
Their continued closure impedes the effective passage of humanitarian personnel and goods and it is to be hoped that this will not have devastating consequences for the economy of the Strip.
Finally, border crossings have to be open both for humanitarian access and commerce.
If the economy collapses, there will be serious implications for the security of the whole region, for the future of the Palestinian State and, indeed, for the Commission budget.
We should not let the population of Gaza become 100% dependent on external aid.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, tomorrow Parliament is set to adopt a new resolution, which has achieved consensus on the basis of the usual procedures, on the Middle East situation.
In addition, however, Mr President, there are two points that I should like to raise in this speech.
The first is the appointment of ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair as special envoy for the Quartet.
Apparently, and this is a question I should like to address to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, one of the tasks of this post will be to ensure that funds from the international community for the region are used properly.
The second point I should like to raise, Mr President, is the letter signed by 10 foreign ministers, including the Portuguese foreign minister, who is also the President-in-Office of the Council.
This letter has been roundly criticised by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

This letter says that the Union suffers from a lack of conviction in its Middle East policy; it makes the damning assertion that the roadmap is finished and that we all share responsibility for this state of affairs; and it suggests that the conditions imposed by the EU and the international community as a whole have served to exacerbate the situation.
I should like to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council if, as I believe to be the case, it agrees with these statements.
I should also like to know if they were just personal remarks from the Portuguese minister, or if they were made on behalf of the EU.
Lastly, Mr President, I should also like to ask about the letter's proposals, namely an international conference on the Middle East situation and the mobilisation of an international force such as NATO, or under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, charged with upholding a cease-fire and keeping the peace.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, many crocodile tears are being wept over the situation in the Middle East.
Yet we should have known that it could very easily reach this point.
Of course, it was impossible to predict just how far the political forces in Palestine would go down the road of self-destruction, but how much support has Israel shown for President Abbas over the past few years?
When did we raise an outcry because of the lack of support for Mr Abbas?
Where was the European Union's visionary and independent strategy?
And why, President-in-Office, Commissioner, are we simply ignoring Mr De Soto's criticisms of the Quartet's policy?
Is it because we have a bad conscience?
Is it the fact that something has gone badly wrong here?
Because, Mr Salafranca, we have to admit that something has gone very wrong.
I do not want to stir up past history however, because we need to look to the future.
What needs to be done?
Recently my group held a conference on the Middle East, chaired by Pasqualina Napoletano, and our findings were similar to those of the ten foreign ministers who recently stated their position in an article.
I would have liked to see all the foreign ministers involved.
We need to support the Abbas/Fayad Government actively, at least for now.
But we should not believe that any such support would mean that the problems with Hamas had been solved nor that the Hamas problems can be resolved by military means - namely by arming President Abbas' troops, as some people believe.
That is most definitely not the way to win the hearts and minds of Hamas voters.
As a starting point for the negotiations, Israel must at last recognise the 1967 borders - admittedly, that will delay some things.
We need a comprehensive discussion of all the issues, from allowing exiles to return through to the wall.
These matters will not be resolved easily, but they need to be discussed openly and honestly.
We also need to incorporate the Arab Peace Initiative if we are to achieve genuine peace between Israel and her Arab neighbours.
Our objective must be to prevent violence, but we have to be fair.
If we require one side to renounce violence, then we should demand the same from the other side, which has not been the case in recent months.
Let me say a few words about Tony Blair and his mission: we would have been happier if Tony Blair had pursued an active, progressive and successful Middle East policy during his ten years in government.
There was no evidence of any such policy.
Perhaps Tony Blair will now break loose from some of the ties that bound him - cross-Atlantic ties and others - and will be able to take on a different role.
If that is the case, it will be very welcome.
We wish him all the very best in his efforts for the region, but he will have to work hard to pursue a new and different policy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the previous interventions have already clearly demonstrated that our attitudes have changed considerably towards the situation in the Middle East in general, and the Israel-Palestine issue in particular.
I too will bear witness to this, but what I will not do - unlike some - is to distance myself, as it were, from these attitudes, because I, also on behalf of my group, actually feel partly responsible for everything that has so far come to pass - or not, as the case may be.
It would be too easy to say: it is they or them and we are the good ones, because we know what should be done from now on.
I think we are all partly responsible for the course of events, for some countries failing to act or others acting too late.
Whichever way, what happened in Gaza looked like a total deadlock, but has, at the same time, led to a number of developments that represent windows of opportunity, as it were.
These include the courageous stance by the President of the Palestinian Authority and the Prime Minister, the fact that talks have been resumed with Israel, the freeing of Alan Johnston, which is, of course, a cause for delight, and the release of a number of Palestinian prisoners.
We would want to see more people released, though.
Equally hopeful signs include the renewed initiative of the Arab League, which is crucial, and the evidence of willingness on the part of Egypt, Jordan and other Arab countries to step up their commitment considerably, to get much more involved in further talks.
This does not mean, of course, that the situation in Gaza is not wretched for those involved.
This is why I welcome the Commission's renewed initiatives, as I do the fact that Israel, even though it has waited for far too long, has actually made a start on transferring taxpayers' money to the Palestinian Authority.
I should like to conclude - because I want to respect your request to keep to my speaking time, Mr President - with an appeal to us all, namely for us now jointly to muster the political courage to show determination in working towards the solution with which we are all familiar: two viable states that live peacefully alongside each other within internationally recognised borders.
If we can muster this political courage, all of us, and put our minor and sometimes major differences to one side, then the sun may yet dawn in the east.
thar ceann an GhrÃºpa UEN. - A UachtarÃ¡in, cuirim fÃ¡ilte mÃ³r roimh an sceÃ¡l gur scaoileadh an t-iriseoir, Alan Johnson, Ã³n BBC saor Ã³ Gaza tar Ã©is dÃ³ a bheith gafa le ceithre mhÃ­ anuas.
TÃ¡ Ã¡thas Ã³ chroÃ­ orm go bhfuil sÃ© saor agus go bhfuil sÃ© sa bhaile anois lena mhuintir agus lena chairde.
Cuirim fÃ¡ilte freisin roimh shocrÃº rialtas Iosrael an deireadh seachtaine seo caite 250 prÃ­osÃºnach a scaoileadh saor.
Ach tÃ¡ cÃºrsaÃ­ daonnachta in Gaza dona go fÃ³ill.
Caithfear ord agus eagar a chur ar an solÃ¡thar bia atÃ¡ ag dul isteach go muintir na PalaistÃ­ne.
NÃ­or cheart cead a thabhairt d'ÃºdarÃ¡is Iosrael cosc a chur ar an mbia ag teorainn Gaza agus Iosrael.
The biggest problem facing the people of Gaza is a humanitarian one.
The fact that Hamas now controls Gaza and Fatah controls the West Bank does not help the Palestinian cause one iota.
This means in essence that the Palestinians can be accused of speaking in two different directions at the same time.
In other words, Israel can hide behind the fact that the Palestinians are divided and that they are not now speaking with one voice.
I also believe that the European Union is in a very strong position to act as an honest broker on many political issues in the Middle East.
In fact, Europe must engage politically to a greater extent so as to ensure that civil war is avoided.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, you have appealed, Mr Antunes, together with nine of your colleagues, for a new approach in Palestine.
That is a good starting point.
The report by Mr de Soto, the United Nations Special Coordinator, roundly criticises the strategy of the Quartet, and does little for the reputation of the Union itself.
The Union's strategy has not been able to encourage the normalisation of Hamas in the political arena, or Israel's compliance with its international obligations, or the Palestinians' efforts towards unity.
The disaster, today, is human; it is economic and social; it is political.
What new approach should be developed, then?
The European Union, Commissioner, is not a charity.
It must commit itself politically and, in the first place, offer a credible prospect of the conflict's being resolved once and for all.
The potential of the peace plan presented by the Arab League must be totally exploited to this end.
The Union must commit itself to an international peace conference involving all the parties.
It must do so resolutely, even if it means taking the Quartet firmly by the hand.
Every channel must be used by the Union in order to put the Israeli authorities in a position to meet their international obligations and to obtain tangible results in the field of law, for the benefit of Palestine's civilian population.
The Union should assume its responsibilities at the Rafah border crossing and denounce, if need be publicly, the obstacles preventing it from carrying out its control mission.
The blockade on the Gaza Strip, which creates conditions conducive to an explosion in violence and which has been followed by a show of strength by Hamas, must be lifted.
The movement of persons and goods, between Gaza and the West Bank, and between Gaza and Israel, must be re-established.
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that, in a case such as this, the Union should propose to its partners that they examine the appropriateness of having an international force, so that peace is given every chance.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I really hope that Tony Blair is in a phase of redemption after his sins concerning the Iraq war and that he can help to bring peace and justice to the Palestinians and peace to the Israelis.
I am therefore truly grateful for the input provided by the ten European Foreign Affairs ministers who gave Mr Blair four fundamental points on which to work.
These are urgent and truly tragic points.
In order to help Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian people and Israel, I believe that it is truly vital to negotiate an agreement of resolution and to end a brutal military occupation that has lasted over 40 years.
This is fundamental, but the crisis is equally fundamental.
As the European Union we have responsibilities: to reopen the Rafah crossing, where there are 6000 persons without shelter, without anything, unable to return home.
We must ensure that the EU BAM works.
With regard to political prisoners, it is absolutely vital to free Gilad Shalit but also the Palestinian political prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti, who could act as an element of unity both in political terms and for peace in the Middle East.
Please allow me to express my and our group's satisfaction with the motion for a resolution we are going to vote for tomorrow.
To our satisfaction it does not criticise the Quartet as was perceived by some political groups.
On the contrary, it expresses support for its future intensified action.
The motion for a resolution clearly expresses full support and understanding for the extraordinary decisions taken by Mahmoud Abbas.
The resolution will take note of confidence-building talks between Salam Fayyad's government and the Israeli Government, as well as the renewal of security cooperation.
We welcome the decision on taxes and revenues as well as the start of the release of political prisoners by Israel.
Nevertheless, Mahmoud Abbas must go for real democracy, for political party congress and for work with young Fatah.
Israel should seriously consider the lifting of roadblocks as was the state before December 2000 and stop the extension of settlements.
Egypt should be part of the solution to the Gaza problem.
Sending international forces to Gaza would be an incredible risk to all of us, and for the European Union the composition of the proposed international conference should be a matter of great concern.
Syria should be held responsible for its external action.
Only then can it be part of the dialogue and the solution.
We try to help those in the West Bank, Palestinians, as much as we can via financial help and in every other way.
Nevertheless, 90% of those in the West Bank are peasants, the Felaheen.
They depend on agricultural exports.
We urge Israel to open the flow of goods, and my question is, how does our agriculture hypocrisy work?
Are we ready to open our markets to Palestinian West Bank agricultural products?
I thank the Commissioner and colleagues across the House for the support they have expressed for Alan Johnston, whom we are all glad to see released and safe at home in my constituency in Scotland.
However, that is one bright spot amid a sea of pain, and we must recognise our own part in that failure.
I agree with the Commissioner that, at long last, there may be some scope for optimism.
However, when I, Mrs Morgantini and others were in the West Bank and Gaza last year it was clear then that EU policy is a sticking plaster, not a cure.
The Quartet is discredited in the eyes of much of the Arab world. It is certainly discredited in the eyes of many of the Palestinians.
The EU should step up to the plate and provide real leadership and clean hands.
I echo the scepticism of colleagues on the appointment of Tony Blair as envoy.
Speaking for once as a British Member, the idea that that deeply compromised individual can credibly represent peace to the Middle East fills me with dread.
This is important, because we only need to look at the bomb attempts in Glasgow and London to see that the consequences - direct or indirect - of our continued failure in Palestine will haunt all of us.
(EL) Mr President, unfortunately we do not have time to analyse the situation in Palestine.
We are in the European Parliament and we are being called upon to give immediate replies to a extremely urgent and complicated issue.
I shall therefore only comment on four important points:
Firstly, the European Union is responsible for the present situation, because it did not support the national unity government.
Secondly, the solutions and acts we have seen recently on the part of the Quartet and Israel may appear on the surface to support President Abbas, but they place before him more obstacles to a viable solution to the problem of the de facto partition of Palestine.
Thirdly, I call on all parties to work hard for unity, because it is the only way we will get out of the crisis.
Fourthly and lastly, there is the question of the humanitarian situation, which is tragic both in Gaza and on the West Bank.
In Gaza especially, measures must be taken immediately for the economic and social viability of its inhabitants.
To close, I should like to put a request to the Council and the Commission: at some point, even if unity is found between Hamas and Fatah, you must decide on the Union's future policy in this sector, where the mistakes of the past must not be repeated, with the European Union negotiating selectively with half the government and pointedly ignoring the other half, regardless of whether the entire government was the outcome of free and democratic elections.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we, in the world's village, Europe, are expressing dismay today because, in the square, close to our borders, human beings are slitting their throats.
Instead of taking action, we are crying and shouting like old women.
That is called failure to assist a person in danger, a crime that is punishable by law.
A great wise man once said that saints and prophets are worth more than artists, men of letters, statesmen, soldiers and tradesmen.
But where are the wise men and the prophets today?
We need a new Saint Francis of Assisi.
He also lived during an era of crusades, but he was interested in others, in those against whom the crusaders were fighting.
He did everything he could to go and see them.
Finally, during the fifth crusade - during the siege of Damietta in Egypt - saddened as he was by the behaviour of the crusaders, he said 'I have seen evil and sin'.
Deeply distressed as he was by the sight of the dead on the battle fields, Saint Francis crossed the frontlines.
He was captured, chained up and taken to Sultan Saladin, who was born in Tikrit.
The meeting must have been very special because, after a conversation that continued long into the night, the Sultan let Saint Francis return the next morning, safe and sound, to the crusaders' camp.
I hope that each one explained his reasons to the other, that Saint Francis spoke of Christ, that the Sultan read some passages from the Koran and that, in the end, they came to an agreement on the message that poor Saint Francis of Assisi used to repeat everywhere: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself'.
Tony Blair was one of the crusaders in Iraq.
Can he become the Saint Francis that Europe needs in the Middle East?
Mr President, the Palestinian question, and Palestine's relations with Israel, not only split families, but political groups in this House and in other assemblies around the world - and, indeed, institutions.
One of the dilemmas for today is those very institutions that we represent here, and our part in the Quartet in recent years.
Some hope that the appointment of Tony Blair, with his very specific role in relation to the Palestinian people, might revivify that process.
I do not know.
I think what is important is that the values that gave rise to the European Union itself should continue to inspire people across the Middle East, but especially in Palestine and in Israel.
Like others, I rejoice at the release of Alan Johnston.
I am a patron of the BBC World Service Trust.
He was reporting from Gaza when elections were held that led to the election of Abu Mazen in January 2005, followed in January 2006 by the election of a Hamas-led Government in Palestine.
The dilemma for the democratic nations - what used to be called 'the West' - was whether or not to recognise that Hamas Government.
Well, we know what happened, and the consequences still face us today.
I wonder whether the European Union can genuinely feel satisfied that it has played an adequate role in this period.
I am pleased that the European Parliament is now discussing the setting-up of a working group in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, something I first proposed two and a half years ago.
I am pleased that we are hosting a United Nations Conference at the end of August, but I still think that there is work to be done, intensive work by the parliamentarians of Europe, working together with the elected parliamentarians of the Arab world - which includes some we might not normally want to do business with.
We have to face things in a different way in the future.
Mr President, it has been said that there are five intertwined crises in the Middle East.
We can see that Iran has a hand in all of them.
Gaza may be controlled by Hamas, but Hamas is not its own master: there is a veto in Tehran.
Perhaps, therefore, it is more accurate to say that there is just one conflict in the Middle East, and that is between extremists and moderates.
We have an obligation to encourage and support the moderates.
There is a danger that some regard Hamas as some sort of social service with attitude.
This would be a profound error: Hamas is essentially a terrorist organisation.
Its power comes from intimidation and murder and it wants to impose its own distorted view of Islam on a frightened population.
I remember only too well the plea made by the internationally renowned Palestinian, Dr Hannan Ashrawi, at the time of the legislative elections 18 months ago. She said: 'We must defeat the forces of darkness'.
The people of Gaza cannot really express themselves freely.
Meanwhile, Israel is under constant attack and, yesterday, mortar bombs were fired from Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing, a route for humanitarian aid from Egypt to Gaza.
Let us not forget that, while we are delighted and relieved at the release of Alan Johnston, Corporal Shalit was abducted a year ago, and we know nothing of his situation.
Members of his family were in Parliament yesterday.
So what is to be retrieved from this confusing and dangerous mixture?
For its part Israel has acted with restraint: it has recognised the government of Salam Fayyad, it has released hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, it is transferring some USD 400 million in tax receipts paid by Palestinians, and it is actively engaged in talks with the leadership of the PA.
However, it will take a third party - Arab or possibly European - to make real progress.
The Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 still offers the most promising way ahead and I am sure Israel recognises this.
Just as we must support the forces of moderation and oppose the terrorists, so moderate Arab governments must be willing to engage more actively and flexibly in the peace process: politically, economically and financially.
It is in our interests - and theirs - that they do so.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, thank you for your understanding.
The European Union must support the pragmatic forces within the Palestinian camp, which means that aid and resources should be shipped to the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank, but not to Hamastan in Gaza.
We must also insist on the Israeli authorities transferring any customs revenue to the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank and on the restrictions with regard to the movement of people between the West Bank and Israel being relaxed as much as possible.
It is indeed of huge importance that the influence of Iran be restricted.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Mr President, allow me firstly to greet Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, and also to draw your attention to her first speech, which was very clear and illuminating on the action the EU is taking in Palestine, under the authority of the Commission, a speech for which I am most grateful.
I should like to mention briefly two questions raised here by Mr Salafranca, the first regarding the appointment of Tony Blair as envoy of the Quartet, and the second regarding the letter signed by ten EU Foreign Ministers.
I think we should be delighted with Mr Blair's appointment, firstly because he is a European, secondly, because he has been President of the European Council, and thirdly because he is a politician of extraordinary experience in international affairs, and partly also because he is a man of conviction.
I therefore consider that the Quartet, the EU and all of us as Europeans stand to gain from this appointment, and we should give him all the assistance we can.
His mandate is defined and well-documented, and Mr Blair will naturally act within the limits of the mandate conferred on him.
Obviously, we hope that his work will benefit the peace process in the Middle East and we wish him well in his mission.
With regard to the aforementioned letter, I have to say that it was drawn up and signed in the context of a specific informal group of ministers, and the Portuguese Foreign Minister signed it precisely in that capacity.
If you look at the letter, it does not say Luis Amado, Foreign Minister to the President of the Council of the Union, it says Luis Amado, Portuguese Foreign Minister, and it was exclusively on that basis that the letter was signed.
We may or may not agree with its contents or its wording, but there is one thing I think is important.
In spirit at least, the letter draws attention to the urgency, the complexity, the need for the EU as a whole to play a central role in resolving this conflict, in resolving a conflict that began 40 years ago, and thus to respond to the call made by many Members in this Chamber for the EU to endeavour as far as possible to play a decisive role in the matter.
I have to say, honourable Members, that in our Presidency we shall seek, in cooperation with the Commission of course, to work as hard as possible to ensure results, and to ensure that the peace process in the Middle East moves forward, that it makes positive progress.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, I will be really brief.
We must take from this discussion the positive elements in this very difficult peace process and try to put the puzzle together in such a way that there is a step forward.
I hope that the next meeting of the Quartet, where, I think, the political horizon and the political settlement will at least start to be mentioned, will be such a step forward.
Secondly, I would mention all the daily improvements for the Palestinians: the mobilisation of international assistance, the institutional and governmental needs of the Palestinian State and the plans to promote Palestinian economic development.
In this respect, we are also ready to revive our interim Association Agreement with the Palestinian Authority, which, among other things, provides for the importation of agricultural products from Palestine - although, of course, on the basis of a quota system.
We all try to do our best, but it also depends on the political will of both sides, which, unfortunately, we cannot substitute for.
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 12 July 2007.
Situation in Pakistan (debate)
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Pakistan.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Mr President, honourable Members, I welcome the opportunity to speak here about Pakistan, undoubtedly a very important country which, as it happens, does not always receive the attention it deserves.
I know that some of the honourable Members consider relations with Pakistan to be of particular interest, so I am delighted to be able to set out the Council's position on the country and hear your opinions.
The situation in Pakistan is developing rapidly in the run up to the elections and we hope that cooperation with the European Parliament will remain good over the coming months.
The EU a long history of relations with Pakistan, dating back to 1976 when our first cooperation agreement was set up.
Unfortunately, for a number of reasons lasting recent years, relations have not been as close as either side would have liked.
It was for this reason that in 2005 the EU embarked upon a review of its policy towards Pakistan, since the Council recognised that certain issues in the country were posing challenges.
It was also firmly agreed that the only effective policy would be resolutely to maintain regular contact with the Pakistani government.
From this decision came the joint EU-Pakistan declaration, adopted in Berlin on 8 February.
Thus, our political dialogue was formalised and the way was open to implement the 2004 cooperation agreement, also known as a third generation agreement, in full.
As a result, relations between the EU and Pakistan have been operating on a new footing since the beginning of this year. It is our hope that this will contribute towards better understanding between the two sides.
This is a step forward in a long-term process to establish cooperation that we hope will be fruitful. It is also an acknowledgment of the importance that the EU ascribes to Pakistan as a partner country.
At the same time, although we have defined our long-term direction, there are some matters that must be dealt with in the short term.
We know that Parliament has certain concerns regarding recent events and we share some of these.
All our attention over the last week has been focused on the fighting around the Red Mosque in Islamabad.
I do not want to get into a discussion as to what gave rise to the current situation.
Rather, I would like to commend the government on its decision to face up to those who preach intolerance.
Naturally, we would all have liked to see a peaceful outcome to the impasse but the fact that the government took a stance against radical extremism is important.
A distinction must be made between those who preach violence and those who demonstrate peacefully.
The Council was extremely concerned about the violence that broke out in Karachi in May.
It is essential that everything possible is done to prevent the same thing from happening again.
The Council is monitoring the situation in Pakistan closely through its permanent contacts with EU embassies in Islamabad.
We hope that all sides will show restraint and, in particular, that the force of law and order will act proportionately and use as little force as possible when dealing with civilians.
The Council is also following the case of Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry very closely.
It is important that the legal proceedings against Mr Chaudhry are handled fairly with no undue interference.
The media must also be free to carry out its mission of informing without suffering intimidation.
In general, it is the EU's desire to see Pakistan continue along its path towards informed moderation, respecting international norms where democratic principles and the rule of law are concerned.
This is the understanding upon which our relations are based.
As Article 1 of the 2004 cooperation agreement states, respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an essential element of the agreement.
We intend to work on this basis.
The general election means that Pakistan is faced with a choice in 2007.
The EU fully supports all steps taken towards a sustainable democracy in Pakistan, the strengthening of its democratic institutions and good government of the country.
The EU considers it important, therefore, that Pakistan's next elections be free and fair.
We consider it equally important that the next President of Pakistan be elected in accordance with the law.
The salient point is that the government must be given strength arising from democratic legitimacy.
This will be needed if it is to rise to Pakistan's many challenges.
Member of the Commission. Mr President, we have all witnessed, as the Council President has just mentioned, the events around the Red Mosque in Islamabad and the latest reports say that most of the compound has now been cleared and that the operation has entered its final stage.
I sincerely hope that no more lives will be lost.
It has come as a shock to me to see these scenes take place in the very heart of the Pakistani capital with hundreds of men and women involved.
It is very regrettable that those who continue to resist did not, as Mr Lobo Antunes said, accept the peaceful solution.
I very much appreciate the patience shown by the government in trying to reach a negotiated solution in order to avoid bloodshed, especially as children have been forced to stay behind in the mosque against their own will and that of their parents.
What this episode has clearly demonstrated to the people of Pakistan and to the wider world is what dangers religious fundamentalism and intolerance can pose for us and for what is essentially a moderate and peaceful society.
Over the last couple of months the students and clerics of the Red Mosque have in effect tried to take the law into their own hands.
I firmly believe this is not the direction in which the people of Pakistan would like their country to move.
The government is right to address this phenomenon in a decisive manner.
Other events, including several recent bombings in North-West Frontier Province and last Friday's alleged attack against President Musharraf's plane, clearly show that Pakistan needs to remain vigilant and determined to ensure that terrorism and extremism will not succeed.
EU policy is to stay constructively engaged with Pakistan.
Key objectives of our engagement are to promote regional and internal stability, to encourage democratisation and to support Pakistan in consolidating its position as a moderate Muslim state.
I am pleased to inform Parliament that, on 24 May, we held the first Joint Commission under the third generation Cooperation Agreement in Islamabad.
The meeting was a useful opportunity to open new ways for cooperation with Pakistan, for instance, by setting up a sub-group on governance and human rights as a forum for a more intense dialogue in this area.
We have also significantly increased the volume of our cooperation with Pakistan to EUR 200 million over the next four years, notably in the areas of rural development and education.
In so doing, our aim is to contribute towards a more prosperous and stable Pakistan.
Pakistan's political environment is currently characterised by uncertainty.
The country is rife with speculation on possible electoral scenarios.
One such scenario is based on President Musharraf's announced plan to get himself re-elected by the sitting assemblies in advance of the parliamentary elections.
Another is a possible arrangement between the President and the opposition parties which could result in early parliamentary elections and Musharraf's possible re-election by the new assemblies.
As Pakistan approaches crucial parliamentary elections later this year, I believe it is necessary to continue to place emphasis on the importance of strengthening democratic institutions and building a more inclusive political process.
As you are aware, Pakistan is a priority country for a possible EU Election Observation Mission.
I will carefully assess the findings of the exploratory mission sent last month and will then take a decision on whether to deploy a mission in due course.
I think there are serious concerns about the way the electoral rolls have been prepared.
Several million voters appear to be missing from the list and serious action should be taken urgently to rectify this.
In conclusion, we need to assess carefully whether it would be advisable to deploy an Election Observation Mission in a context in which there are some serious concerns, which I highlighted, about the conditions for democratic elections, and we need to keep developments under review in the coming weeks and months.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I have been a critic of Pakistan's government for some time. From the toleration of nuclear proliferation by A. Q. Kahn, to the appalling treatment of religious minorities.
I have also been sceptical at times as to the real determination of President Musharraf, ostensibly our ally in the war on terrorism, to really stamp out radical Islamist Jahadis and stop youngsters, including EU citizens, being educated in the hardline Deobandi madrassas.
We now witness the bloody storming of the Red Mosque, where armed Islamists were holed up with women and children.
Musharraf stated the militants were linked to al-Qa'ida.
So why was this matter allowed to fester since January as the security forces ignored the illegal occupation of land, the stockpiling of weapons and the abduction of women into the mosque complex?
Was this in order to engineer a bloody showdown?
Or to demonstrate the risk posed by extremists and prove the President's anti-terrorist stance to the West, which has been more critical recently, with claims now that the all-powerful Pakistani Military Interservices Intelligence Agency has been secretly helping Taliban forces regroup in the border areas with Afghanistan?
It is also alleged that Abdul Aziz, the cleric leading the Red Mosque militants, had family links to the ISI.
For sure this crisis is a welcome distraction for President Musharraf, under pressure now for dismissing his Chief Justice, attempting to justify five more years in power and keen, of course, to retain the pervasive influence of the Pakistani army.
The EU should rightly fear instability in an Islamic state with nuclear weapons, and I now call on President Musharraf to allow two former civilian secular Prime Ministers to return from exile and campaign in democratic elections against dangerous extremists and help build a tolerant and democratic country that can survive President Musharraf.
on behalf of the Group PSE. - This is an important and timely debate.
It is interesting that there will be three UK speakers, but that reflects the communities we represent.
We know that across Europe many people are concerned about the situation in Pakistan and the uncertainty that surrounds President Musharraf at the moment - his future - and we recognise that is linked very much to the future of his country.
I do not intend to be as critical as Dr Tannock, but the motion for a resolution we have put down is expressed in a spirit of concern, because many of us have visited the country - we have met the President both here and in Pakistan - and we wish Pakistan well.
We recognise the very real challenges that Pakistan faces, not least in the very hard task of facing terrorism on its own territory.
We respect the international role they have played in the fight against global terrorism.
We give them credit for what they have done already and we pledge support for future efforts.
However, the fight against terrorism cannot be used as a smokescreen to cover malpractice or wrongdoing.
The Commissioner spoke about the serious incident at the Red Mosque, as indeed did Dr Tannock, who also referred to the suspension of Chief Justice Chaudhry and what followed on from that.
I want to pick up on the elections, which the Commissioner and Mr Lobo Antunes both spoke about.
The Council representative said that we support steps to sustainable democracy - and of course we do.
I recognise and welcome the Commissioner's commitment to a subgroup on governance and human rights for Pakistan.
I want today to urge President Musharraf to ensure that these forthcoming elections not only take place but that they do so in an environment that will be conducive to ensuring that a clean bill of health can be given to them by any international observer mission, whether it is one sent by the European Union or anyone else.
This is vital for the credibility of any president of Pakistan, or any government or, indeed, any government anywhere.
Specifically, I hope that the preparations for those elections ensure that they are conducted properly, and that includes allowing more women to stand for election.
As the Commissioner said, the electoral roll must not just be above scrutiny, it must be so that people do not feel that they have been left out.
We need a free and open press in an election, where journalists feel safe to say and write what they want.
I hope that in the interim period, whilst the election is taking place, the interim government will be genuinely neutral.
Pakistan is a large country with a proud people and a far too troubled history.
I am sure I speak for all in this Parliament when I say that the European Parliament stands ready to do all it can to support Pakistan in difficult times to allow it to grow and support it as fully functioning and peaceful democracy.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - The unfolding and tragic events at the Red Mosque in Islamabad show that Pakistan faces a clear and present threat from extremist ideology.
They are a danger to the majority of moderate Pakistani people and to NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan.
The knock-on effect that these events have had in Peshawar, Balochistan, Waziristan and Bajor illustrates the footholds that the extremists now have across many parts of the country.
Yet the popular condemnation by the majority of Pakistanis of the violence of the militants shows that extremism remains a fringe minority activity in Pakistan.
It is this majority moderate core that the Government must embrace if it is to develop a broad-based political consensus.
The EU's relationship with Pakistan is based on a commitment to democracy, peace and stability, trade and development and respect for human rights.
This year, the Council and Commission have taken significant steps towards strengthening that relationship and we must continue to exert our influence as a key donor in the region to improve the lives of the Pakistani people.
The EU must continue to support health and education projects in Pakistan so that the poorest people will have a genuine alternative to the madrassas.
We must insist that the Government respect the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law and the human rights of the Pakistani people as the country moves forward to democratic elections.
We must condemn all attempts to stamp out free speech and media freedom and we must stand in solidarity with the entire legal profession of Pakistan when we deplore the suspension of Chief Justice Chaudhry.
Ultimately, the European Union must send a clear message to the President that the transition to civilian rule through free and fair elections is ...
(The President cut the speaker off)
in writing. - I am deeply concerned that Pakistan's fragile democracy is in peril.
The dismissal of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and resulting media clampdown does not bode well for having free and fair elections.
There are many reports of official and unofficial acts of intimidation against members of the legal community and abuse of the Anti-Terrorist Act to persecute political opponents.
I have been informed by Pakistanis that moderate political parties, journalists and civil society are being marginalised, whilst the extremist groups are being empowered to have a greater influence over its society.
I very much regret that recent unrest has seen the loss of civilian lives and would urge President Musharraf to ensure that the Pakistani authorities fully respect human rights.
Furthermore, I would request the President to abide by the assurances that he gave to the EP Delegation during the December 2006 visit to Pakistan, about the transition to civilian rule and to agreement on building up democratic institutions and most importantly the assurances he gave us on media freedom.
I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to make a strong representation to Pakistan on restoration of democracy and respect of human rights.
Future agreement on Kosovo (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the future agreement on Kosovo.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Mr President, honourable Members, a brief statement about Kosovo.
Significant progress has undoubtedly been made over the last years with regard to stabilisation in the Western Balkan area.
However, a key challenge still remains for this progress to be consolidated: the conclusion of the process to determine Kosovo's future status and the implementation of the result with a strategic objective.
What is needed is a timely and sustainable resolution that lays the foundation for a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo, committed to establishing the rule of law and promoting regional stability and the region's European perspective.
The determination of Kosovo's status is a crucial prerequisite to consolidating stability in the region.
The EU has invested a great deal in the Balkans in both economic and political terms, so we have no wish to see the region destabilised once more.
As it is a European region, the European Union should be at the forefront of attempts to resolve matters relating to Kosovo.
Consequently, a solution must rapidly be found via the United Nations Security Council.
The status quo is not sustainable.
In accordance with the declaration of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxemburg on 18 June, the Council confirmed its support for special envoy Martti Ahtisaari and reiterated its position that his Comprehensive Proposal constitutes the basis for settling the status issue by means of a new resolution by the United Nations Security Council.
The European Union remains entirely committed to ensuring the timely adoption of such a resolution by the United Nations Security Council, which will also serve as a basis for the international and EU presence.
A continued united stance by the Member States, in addition to a firm and coherent approach to Kosovo, will be decisive in achieving this objective.
The Council also reasserted its conviction that the resolution of this question is entirely unique and does not establish a precedent.
The EU continues to be available to play an important role in implementing the resolution of Kosovo's future status.
Our planning on the ground is well underway and has been undertaken based on the global approach adopted by the Council in December 2006, and on the assumption that a new resolution conferring a clear mandate on the EU will be adopted by the United Nations Security Council.
We are determined to guarantee a successful transition and to this end have been working in close collaboration with the United Nations Mission in Kosovo, which has given assurances that it will fully maintain its operational force until its mandate expires.
Member of the Commission. Kosovo's future status is the last remaining status issue that resulted from the break-up of Yugoslavia.
It is vital to get movement in the UN Security Council at this stage.
The Security Council members need to carry their responsibility for resolving Kosovo's status and set up a multilateral framework giving the whole region a sustainable outcome.
I call on Serbia to play a constructive role in the next phase of the process.
I call on all those involved not to pursue unilateral actions, whether declarations or veto threats, which would only harm the interests of us all in a stable region that can fully become part of the European Union.
In March you adopted a resolution on Kosovo here in Parliament.
In my view our institutions share much common ground.
You took the view that the only sustainable settlement is one that respects all communities, helps Kosovo's economic recovery and provides an international presence to safeguard the interests of all ethnic communities.
In June, the Council confirmed the EU support for UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari and his comprehensive proposal as the basis for the settlement of Kosovo's status and a new UN Security Council resolution.
We support the proposal as the best possible available compromise that can ensure that all communities have a future in Kosovo where democracy and the rule of law can take a firm hold.
The key elements of this proposal are the building blocks of any modern society.
They include the protection of the rights of communities, protection of cultural and religious heritage and basic constitutional and security provisions.
All these are vital for a democratic and multiethnic Kosovo.
In a nutshell, we must do three things now.
Firstly, we must settle Kosovo's status without unnecessary delay.
Secondly, we must preserve the essence of the current settlement proposal and thirdly we must further support Kosovo's European aspirations and progress towards the European Union.
As Commissioner, I have already opened up several instruments under the stabilisation and association process.
The Commission engages in a regular dialogue on reforms.
We provide generous assistance.
We monitor progress on the basis of European partnership, and we have opened up regional cooperation activities with Kosovo.
Delaying the process for delay's sake is a potentially dangerous exercise.
It can hardly merge the diametrically opposed positions on status, but it could increase the risk of instability on the ground.
Hence, we must show the Kosovars that there is movement and that there will be a solution.
We must not allow the hardliners to gain the upper hand.
The Balkans and Europe would suffer the consequences of such a development.
Kosovo is indeed a profoundly European matter.
We have much at stake to achieve a sustainable settlement.
As you said in your March resolution, finding a solution on the basis of Mr Ahtisaari's proposal is of the greatest importance for the stability and further development of the entire region.
Both Serbia and Kosovo are due to become part of the EU, like their neighbours, since the future of the Western Balkans lies in the EU.
Indeed, neither Russia nor the United States is as directly affected by what happens in the Balkans as Europeans are.
It is Europe that would pay the price if the status process failed, and therefore Kosovo's status should not be settled by unilateral declarations or unilateral veto threats, but by effective and responsible multilateralism.
A sustainable settlement is indeed best achieved by a managed and multilateral process.
Let me close by reiterating that delaying the status process for delay's sake will get us nowhere.
It would only risk instability in Kosovo, prolong the agony in Serbia and delay the region's movement towards the European Union.
This is the time, therefore, when Europe, the EU and its Member States, must show leadership and help bring a sustainable solution to Kosovo.
We owe it to Kosovo. We owe it to the Balkans and we owe it to Europe.
Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for being so clear.
Yesterday, the new UN General Secretary also stressed that the continued failure to resolve the status issue constitutes a serious threat to peace.
If Kosovo, where 90% of the population is Albanian, does not finally get what it deserves, namely independence under international supervision, then economic instability and political unrest could ensue.
It is high time that we took a pragmatic line.
Seventy-five per cent of this House voted in favour of the Ahtisaari plan.
We made it clear that we favour independence under international supervision.
The Commission, most Member States, and also the USA, have taken the same line.
So it is high time that we put an end to the deadlock in the Security Council.
Russian and Serbian nationalism can no longer be allowed to delay a peaceful solution that will give the Serbs in Kosovo extensive, internationally-guaranteed rights that are far better than those accorded to other ethnic minorities in other European states.
Now is the time to push forward with a solution, not least because our vital EU mission needs both a stable international legal basis and broad acceptance among the Kosovans if we are to avoid being seen as an occupying power.
It is therefore essential that we push ahead, with a view to achieving a long-overdue political solution.
Mr President, I would like to make it clear that we are not willing to allow the West to fall into the trap of allowing the Serbian constitution to make territorial claims on Kosovo and the Russians to say they will veto resolutions until Serbia agrees - which it will be unable to do because of the constitution approved by a dubious referendum.
An artificial barrier is being created that represents a serious threat to peace.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate is not being concluded as speedily as some might wish.
I can see the risk referred to by the Commissioner, but I also see this as an opportunity.
We should use this opportunity, rather than always looking at the negative side.
What do we want?
We want to send a message to Serbia through a Stabilisation and Association Agreement and by reducing visa restrictions - provided Serbia cooperates with the ICTY - to say that the country is welcome in the European Union, and we want to see an end to this constant self-flagellation and inferiority complex.
Secondly, we want a new status for Kosovo on the basis of Mr Ahtisaari's proposal for a resolution.
I am not saying that we would not be willing to accept some changes, but that requires talks, and the Serbian and Kosovan representatives must be willing to talk to one another.
I do not think that they will agree, but they should at least clear up those points that can be cleared up.
Both sides need to act responsibly, because they are still going to have to live alongside one another in the region in future, particularly if they want to be part of Europe.
There is no room for a threat to stability.
So I fully agree with the Commissioner that we cannot defer matters just for the sake of it; instead we need to make good use of our time.
I am delighted that the Prime Minister of Kosovo has said that he does not want to take any unilateral measures in the coming months.
That is more than some speakers in this House.
I am also very pleased to hear, if it is true, that the USA will not support any such steps, since the European Union would be the primary victim.
We call on Russia to abandon its veto and its blocking of the resolution.
Russia cannot gain anything for Abkhazia and Transnistria that it has not already obtained through military force.
What we are trying to do now is ensure a peaceful transition.
It is also in Kosovo and Albania's interest to tie Serbia into the new status as tightly as possible and to send Serbia a clear signal from Europe.
Albania and the Albanians in Kosovo could not ask for more.
Mr President, I was unable to hear the Commissioner's speech because I was engaged in other parliamentary business.
From what I have heard, however, I very much share the view that, on the one hand, time is running out, but that, at the same time, we do not feel under pressure whereby if we do not take a decision today there will be violent conflict on Europe's doorstep, which is what some would have us believe.
In this regard, the statements made by the Prime Minister of Kosovo are most welcome and should be received positively.
Firstly, I feel that efforts must be made to understand Serbia's position and to send out a message of respect to Serbia, one of respect for its history, its present and its future.
It is obvious that Serbia must be required to cooperate closely with the Court, but it is also clear that some messages from the EU run the risk of being taken in Serbia as disrespectful.
Secondly, there is one thing that I should like to see addressed, at least on the EU's part and that of all actors with a stake in Kosovo's legal and political future, and that is Kosovo's economic situation.
Listening to some of the rhetoric, one may be forgiven for thinking that only a declaration of independence, only a UN resolution establishing Kosovo's legal future, will create wealth in Pristina, provide jobs for thousands of people in an area with over 50% unemployment and create the kind of economic stability that will bring investment.
This is not true.
What is lacking is an economic plan for Kosovo.
A Kosovo without economic viability, ruined and with 70% unemployment will remain a tragedy for us all.
Now is the time to think about this, now is the time when we can exert some influence, which should not in my view be conditional on such independence; rather, we can help Kosovo's economic structures, whether or not we see an independent Kosovo in the future.
This is the EU's responsibility, which I do not feel it is exercising.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office for their comments.
Martin Luther King said: 'Peace requires not only the absence of violence but also the presence of justice'.
If you think about the tragic history of the whole Balkans region, one of the aspects that had been missing for so long was this idea of justice.
There can be no peace without justice.
In Martti Ahtisaari's proposals we have an opportunity to take that big step, to take that jump, to find not just the peace but also the justice within it.
In an ideal world it should have been left to the people themselves to solve the problem, but they could not find the capacity at the time to come together and find the solution, so one had to be proposed to them.
This is our best opportunity to try to find a long-lasting and just peace settlement between the different traditions and the different peoples there.
It is essential that, not only in presenting a new opportunity to Kosovo, we also take into consideration the unique and special concerns that Serbia has.
It is important that we have a dialogue not only with Kosovo but also with Serbia, to give them the encouragement to move forward and to find a new path in the nation-building process.
As well as that, from my own experience in Ireland, over the last 10 years the one key element with regard to the solution of conflict and of discrimination and of hatred, is dialogue.
Get the sides talking, keep them talking.
As slow and difficult as that is, it is the only way to find the just solution to this problem.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, anyone who has closely followed recent statements by the EU representatives on Kosovo, and particularly on the role of the EU in future, is bound to be left confused.
Of course, everyone is trying to put together the various pieces of the jigsaw in New York: how can we secure a resolution by the Security Council.
In other words, how do we prevent a Russian veto?
Of course everyone is doing what they can to guard unity in the European Union, and of course we urge the Kosovans to remain calm.
So far, everything is clear.
What, however, will be the precise role of the EU in the near future, and when will the EU be fulfilling it?
A random selection from newspapers over the past few days tells me that, according to Cristina Gallach, spokesperson for Mr Solana, the EU will face up to its responsibility and take a decision about Kosovo if Russia continues to say 'no'.
In other words, even if we do not get a resolution, the European Union will take action.
On 10 July, Mr Solana stated that it is impossible for us to send a mission without a mandate, and this is why we expect a resolution.
According to an anonymous EU diplomat on that same day, the EU is hopeful that the new UN resolution will allow for an extensive mission to be sent, even if the future of the province remains unclear.
In other words, a mandate will be granted, but there is no need to say anything yet about independence.
Commissioner, Council, I would urge you to tell us finally what a resolution should contain as a minimum in order to spur the EU to send a mission to Kosovo in the short term.
In fact, when will we be discussing the sending of a mission?
Originally, it was the intention to do this four months after a resolution.
Is the EU now prepared to send a mission even though there is not yet any news about independence?
I would appreciate some clarity on this, which you owe us and the voters alike.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, to be brutally frank, it is pretty clear that we have now reached a stalemate.
Serbia and Russia have both declared that they will not accept an enforced independence, and Mr Bush has since said that he wants Kosovo to declare its independence unilaterally.
So the European Union has a key role to play in the current situation.
There is however a whole range of unhelpful input, such as Mr Barroso's comments comparing the European Union to an 'empire'.
That may be borne out by some elements, but is not very helpful in the current situation.
The EU is an interested party itself and wants to make Kosovo a virtual UNMIK protectorate.
It is quite clear that the original Ahtisaari plan will not happen, and everyone needs to take a deep breath and accept that.
An internationally valid solution is needed, where Serbia also agrees to the whole package.
We in the European Parliament urgently need details of the planned CFSP mission in Kosovo.
We have not yet received the information, and we urgently need it.
(PL) Mr President, today we are debating the territorial integrity of Serbia and the future of the Kosovo region where every day fundamental human rights are being broken.
The Serbian population faces a humanitarian crisis, while the common Christian heritage of Europe is being subjected to systematic destruction by Islamic terrorists.
I am surprised how often the events and the current situation in Kosovo are presented to international opinion in a biased way which is damaging to the Serbs.
The unprecedented plan to grant Kosovo independence means destroying the territorial integrity of Serbia and further escalating the conflict.
The decision to separate Kosovo from Serbia threatens stability throughout the European continent, which may have a domino effect in many other ethnically disputed parts of the continent.
What concerns me is that the authorities in the European Union wish to take sides in this Balkan conflict without having either the right or the mandate to do so.
It is clear that the future of Europe and the world should be decided by sovereign states and peoples at international forums such as the UN.
For this reason, I also thank Russia and those countries on the forum of the UN Security council who oppose the displacement of borders in Europe.
I thank you.
(SK) The international community is facing an extremely important task.
A decision must be taken on the future of Kosovo and the coexistence of different communities in the region, based on the principles of equality.
The eight years of stabilisation and the search for the most appropriate solution have culminated in the comprehensive proposal from Mr Ahtisaari, which offers an opportunity for a peaceful future for Kosovo.
This, however, requires a unified approach from the entire Union.
Hindering the solution could generate dangerous tensions, even warfare, in the region, which is something nobody wants.
We are fully aware of the fact that the controlled sovereignty of Kosovo with a permanent international presence may only be instituted subject to a final decision of the UN Security Council.
The dismissive attitude of Serbia, stubbornly supported by the Russian Federation, must not erode our resolve.
In the given situation, we must always act on the basis of a rational assessment of the causes of this complex problem, which go back eight years, to the time when international forces assumed administration of this territory following the bloody events there.
This specific situation and ensuing developments have demonstrated that the integration of Kosovo into Serbia is unrealistic.
Serbia has de facto lost any entitlement to this territory.
Despite the concerns of some European politicians and Member States of the Union, e.g. the Slovak Republic, where a schizophrenic state of mind has evolved in connection with the Kosovo problem, I am convinced that this solution will not establish a precedent for other countries.
The initial situation in Kosovo was atypical and non-standard.
A very important component of stability in this region is the creation of a community of equal citizens, granting minority communities a legal system which would enable them to preserve and develop their identity.
In the case of the Serbian community, this means extensive autonomy.
It is essential to expedite the decision-making process in the UN.
Only stability and peace in this region may secure the prospect of the Balkans, and specifically Serbia and Kosovo becoming part of the European Community..
(NL) Mr President, I will endorse what Mr Swoboda said before me.
I think that the delay that has been agreed upon with the Security Council offers scope for yet another all-out effort to reach agreement within the Security Council.
In fact, an agreement such as this is the basis for everything: for unity within the European Union, for the EU's future operation in Kosovo, but also for keeping together the region of former Yugoslavia.
In that sense, it is also important to show the Serbs - even though we support the proposals by Ahtisaari, because they form the backbone of what we want Kosovo to achieve - that we are willing to make another serious attempt to sit down and talk with them about what may still change, about the kind of concessions that are still possible.
We should not leave the new Serb Government out in the cold, because it is important, as before, to maintain good relations with that country.
Whilst I am pleased that, over the past few weeks, Commissioner Rehn has made good progress in the contacts, relations and negotiations with the new government, it is important not to confuse progress in relations with Serbia with the Kosovo issue.
In short, an all-out effort is called for to still reach consensus, and perhaps at the end we may reach a sound agreement to disagree with our Serb partners in the region.
(NL) Mr President, even in the autumn of 2006, it became evident that the Ahtisaari report would favour independence, with special measures to protect Serb and other minorities.
It also became clear that Serbia would refuse to agree to this, and was counting on a Russian veto in the UN Security Council.
Since then, the question has been raised whether such a veto will lead to a unilateral recognition of Kosovo as a state by other states, including the United States and the EU Member States.
This is the controversial model by means of which, in 1992, independence of Slovenia and Croatia was recognised by Germany prior to any European or international decisions.
Do you assume that, if necessary, this model will be used once more?
Could the application of the controversial model be prevented if the region north of Kosovo's Mitrovica, where the Serbian inhabitants of Kosovo are concentrated, were to be handed back to Serbia?
Is, in that case, Serbia's and the Russian Federation's blessing still to be had?
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we had really hoped that by now Kosovo would no longer be an international issue, and that the politicians would have been able to take over responsibility themselves.
Unfortunately President MiloÅ¡eviÄ's legacy lives on after his death and is putting a great strain on the democratic government in Serbia.
In 1996, I demonstrated against MiloÅ¡eviÄ in Belgrade together with the members of the current government, and I could wish for nothing better than for this government to be the one to bring Serbia into the European Union.
I also experienced the apartheid imposed in Kosovo by MiloÅ¡eviÄ from 1989 until the NATO intervention.
It saddens me that far too much nationalism still creeps into discussions in Serbia.
If Belgrade were truly concerned about the quality of life for Serbs living in Kosovo and not about the loss of territory, then Belgrade would approve Mr Ahtisaari's plan.
It gives the Serbs in Kosovo a degree of self-determination that other minorities in Serbia and the Balkans can only dream of.
If UNMIK leaves now and we cannot fill the vacuum created by the absence of a Security Council resolution, we will be faced with a hopeless situation.
Commissioner, you have not provided any answers on this head.
As so often in the past, it seems that Europe is not actually willing to take the necessary action in the Balkans.
This indecisiveness is a major problem and will create huge difficulties.
It is not in our interest to keep on putting off the Kosovo issue to another day.
The collateral damage of our failure to act will be immense.
Like many other states, Russia was part of the Contact Group.
So Russia is fully aware that there have been no talks between Belgrade and PriÅ¡tina.
It is unrealistic to call for negotiations now, after rejecting Mr Ahtisaari's proposal and refusing to adopt a Security Council resolution.
So I urge this House to follow the Commissioner's lead and do everything possible to accommodate Russia's interests, which have nothing to do with Kosovo or Serbia, so that this issue can be resolved.
(HU) A settlement that rewards the Albanians and reserves only punishment for the Serbs will not be durable.
The EU is caught in a trap, hostage to the poor Russian-American relations, hostage to Russia's growing power politics.
We cannot give in to Russian blackmail, but without Russia there is no good or enduring solution.
We cannot give in to Albanian blackmail either, because without EU help, Kosovo is not viable as an independent country.
Serbia lost trustworthiness over past decades, it lost Kosovo through its action against the Albanians of Kosovo, and as a result, Kosovo's independence is inevitable.
This matter has to be discussed further, however; unilateral steps must be avoided at all costs.
The Ahtisaari plan is good in part, but not sufficient.
Its part about minorities is good, and so is territorial autonomy, yet at the same time, the whole of Europe is beholden for having failed for decades to clarify questions of national self-determination and territorial autonomy.
These must be spelled out.
President-in-Office of the Council. (PT) Mr President, allow me firstly to greet Mr Rehn, as I did not have the opportunity during my first speech and would like to do so now.

I should like to made four or five brief observations.
The first is to reaffirm what I said in my first speech: that simply maintaining the status quo in Kosovo is not sustainable; we must make progress.
We are convinced that to maintain the status quo would be a huge mistake for which we would have a high price to pay.
Secondly, as a number of honourable Members have already said here, it is fundamental that the European Union maintains a united stance; in other words, the Member States must remain united with regard to the Kosovo question.
We made this appeal on a number of occasions as a Member State and now, during our Presidency, we naturally reinforce it.
We have no desire to see the EU divided once again, especially over a fundamental issue that, into the bargain, is happening on European territory.
For this reason we have always appealed to the EU and its Member States to remain united in the search for a solution to the impasse in Kosovo.
Thirdly, we believe that we should continue to make every effort on the diplomatic front with the United Nations Security Council towards obtaining a new Security Council resolution on Kosovo.
This resolution, as I have said, serves as a basis for the international and European Union presence in Kosovo.
We must step up our efforts, and, within the sphere of its competence, the Presidency will continue actively to seek agreement in the Security Council on this new resolution.
Finally, we see very clearly that we must offer the Western Balkan countries, and Serbia in particular, a genuinely European perspective, since Serbia meets all the required criteria and conditions for this European perspective.
We were pleased at the decision to re-open negotiations with Serbia with a view to a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU.
We believe that this is a crucial step.
Ensuring the European perspective for Serbia is of vital importance because it is a vital factor in the stability of the whole of the Balkan region.
Member of the Commission. I shall start with Serbia.
Serbia has a tangible European perspective, with the ultimate goal of EU membership once it meets all the conditions of EU accession.
That is our point of departure in our relations with Serbia.
After the new democratic government - which is Europe- and reform-oriented - was formed, and after this new government made a clear commitment to cooperation with the ICTY and carried out such effective and practical action to match that commitment, we were able to resume the SAA talks with Serbia about a month ago.
It is worth recalling that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, apart from being a significant agreement, especially in economic and trade relations, is also the gateway, the waystation towards candidate status in the European Union.
I have repeated this numerous times in the Serbian public debate, I shall continue to do so and I will show that Serbia has a European future, as long as that country is willing to meet the conditions that this future requires.
We cannot expect that there will be any trading over concessions on Kosovo because of the European track for Serbia, but we can expect that the political debate in Serbia could finally move from the nationalist past towards a European future.
What we can expect is that, if there are further talks for a limited period of time, then Serbia should take a constructive attitude and a realistic approach in these talks, instead of repeating the same set phrases that we have been hearing over the past couple of years.
My second point is that international supervision covering both political and security issues will be necessary for some time in Kosovo.
Its purpose must be clear: to supervise the implementation of a status settlement that ensures the rights of all communities and the sustainable development of Kosovo.
For that we need a resolution from the United Nations Security Council.
It is difficult, frankly, to operate under conditions of political uncertainty while the process in the United Nations Security Council is still going on.
We have every right to expect that all Permanent Members of the UN Security Council realise their responsibility in the future security and stability of Europe.
We have every right to expect that all the Members in the Security Council realise the great responsibility they have.
In the Commission we are working hard to ensure that the EU will be ready to deploy civilian missions to supervise the implementation of the status settlement.
It will be a different mission from that of UNMIK, and we need a sound legal basis in the form of a UN Security Council resolution to ensure the success of this mission.
Finally, all in all, Kosovo and the status process of Kosovo show how much we need the better steering and coordination mechanisms that the reform Treaty should finally provide.
It is indeed high time to create more effective and efficient instruments for establishing the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The debate is closed.
Written statement (Rule 142)
in writing. - The question of the future of Kosovo is part of the aftermath of the horrible wars in the Balkans.
We are talking about an area in the heart of Europe.
Delaying the question is not an option.
Quoting President Ahtisaari, who conducted 14 months of negotiations between the Serbs and Kosovars, 'a solution will not only be in the interest of the people in Kosovo, but also of vital importance for the regional peace and stability'.
It is hard to disagree.
Last March he concluded that there was no ground for agreement between the parties.
Later he proposed independence for Kosovo.
The plan has wide international backing.
It is time to look ahead not, of course, forgetting the rights of the Serb minority in Kosovo.
Slovenia was the first of the former Yugoslav states to join the EU.
Macedonia is a candidate.
The rest are queuing.
Hopefully all will end up as members and the past borderlines will loose their significance.
Sometimes borders have to be first drawn in order to erase them.
This seems to be the case in Kosovo.
According to Commissioner Rehn the Commission supports President Ahtisaari's plan.
I think that we should too.
TRIPS agreement and access to medicines (debate)
The next item is the debate on:
the oral question to the Council, by Gianluca Susta and Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Kader Arif, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Georgios Papastamkos, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Vittorio Agnoletto and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines B6-0130/2007)
the oral question to the Commission, by Gianluca Susta and Johan Van Hecke, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Kader Arif, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Georgios Papastamkos, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Vittorio Agnoletto and Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, and Cristiana Muscardini, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on the TRIPS Agreement and access to medicines - B6-0131/2007)
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the secretariat of the Committee on International Trade for the help they gave me during this work.
For us, access to medicines by the poorest countries is a priority, and that includes where the international obligations we have assumed are concerned.
We therefore cannot be content to blindly accept the protocol to the TRIPS agreement and believe that this will resolve the issue.
Members of the Commission, members of the Council, there are no longer sufficient generic commitments.
The European Union can and must do more, and if it is not realistic to suggest renegotiating the protocol, the Council, if it wishes to obtain the assent of the European Parliament, must make a firm commitment to state that the mechanism created by the WTO decision of 30 August 2003 is only a very small part of the solution to the problem.
This means ensuring that the Member States can resort to Article 30 of the TRIPS agreement in their national laws on patents, in order to authorise production and exporting, to tackle the public health needs in importing member countries.
It means restricting the Commission's mandate in the negotiation of economic partnership agreements with the poorest countries, so that provisions are not included that go further than the TRIPS agreement.
It means supporting developing countries that use the flexibilities included in the TRIPS agreement, to provide essential medicines at reasonable prices.
It means supporting grouped supply strategies to achieve economies of scale in the production of generic medicines at affordable prices and to stimulate direct investment in local production facilities.
It means actively supporting the work of the World Health Organisation's intergovernmental working group on public health, innovation and intellectual property.
It means recognising that the European Union must urgently adopt additional measures to promote the transfer of technology, research, capacity-building and regional supply mechanisms for the world's poorest regions.
It means guaranteeing a specific level of funding with which to develop or construct pharmaceutical production facilities owned by regions within developing countries, and increasing overall funding for public-private partnerships undertaking research and development in medicines that are particularly important in developing countries.
We therefore believe that we have made an active contribution to this issue, the urgency of which is demonstrated to us by the pictures that reach us from the poorest parts of the world.
The ball is now in the court of the Council and the Commission, and if we receive swift, precise replies, not generalities, then the European Parliament will give the requested consent without delay.
author. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we have sought today to question the Council and the Commission, it is because the consent requested of us to amend the TRIPS agreement for the purposes of making the August 2003 transitional solution final is raising many issues.
Indeed, following the debate held in parliamentary committee on this mechanism, all the experts heard were unanimous in criticising this solution, which only solves a very small amount of the problems faced by countries that have no pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity and, therefore, the difficulties their populations have in gaining access to health care.
Although it was supposed to provide a fast and effective response, this mechanism is deemed to be complex, even inefficient.
Despite the commitment made by the Council and the Commission to Parliament, no assessment has been carried out.
Doubts therefore remain on this issue.
'It has never been assessed because it has never been used' we are told by the Commission, which claims that that does not mean that it is inefficient.
That is a fine piece of rhetoric based on a reversal of logic, but it is by no means a well-argued response.
The questions being asked by the MEPs are as follows: why has not this solution ever been used?
Is it equal to the scope of the problem posed?
If not, what new measures ought the Union to introduce in order to achieve the stated objective?
There can be no discrepancy between what we say we are going to do and what we actually do.
In its declarations, the Union supports the Doha Declaration, the flexibilities of the TRIPS agreement and the Member States that have recourse to them.
It also makes a commitment not to call for developing countries to be made subject to new intellectual property rules that are more stringent than those laid down at the WTO, as that would undermine genuine access to treatment.
However, these declarations have not been put into practice.
Let us start by understanding what we mean.
For example, what do we mean by flexibility?
In our opinion, this concept encompasses all the flexibilities, not just the 2003 solution.
However, in its declarations, the Commission refers solely to that one.
As for the intellectual property rules that go beyond the TRIPS agreement, how do we define them?
Do we identify the same ones?
In its declarations, the Commission refrains for resorting to such rules, but the negotiations that have been conducted do not necessarily reflect this commitment.
The Commission's representatives even at times justify its resorting to these rules for the sake of combating counterfeiting, but this comes under an entirely different debate.
Finally, clear political support must be given to every country that uses a flexibility instrument, whatever it may be, which is not the case in practice.
What we are asking for is transparency and a balance between the public discourse and the negotiations conducted behind closed doors.
We are convinced that the problem raised goes far beyond our simply assenting to an international protocol.
This is a far-reaching political and humanitarian problem that requires a genuine political will to match the challenge posed.
We now want clear commitments, and commitments on many points, all of which are included in our resolution due to be put to the vote tomorrow.
This hinges on a joint policy statement, with Parliament, before our vote.
We will not be content with yet another debate that lacks any precise commitment.
We want a solemn commitment by the Council and the Commission that guarantees that Europe will become more involved in finding new solutions and that it will strive to do as our fellow citizens want and become a leading player in the fight to secure access to medicines at affordable prices for everyone in the world.
Madam President, I thank my honourable friends for their cooperation, which allowed us to formulate the joint motion for a resolution.
As you know, the Union has played a decisive role in achieving the agreement under discussion within the framework of the WTO.
It is one of the few members which have adopted internal implementing legislation.
We of course recognise that no use has been made to date of the mechanism provided for.
Doubts as to the efficacy of the mechanism provided for in the Protocol to the TRIPS agreement are reasonable.
However, the amendment to the TRIPS agreement was the result of lengthy and laborious negotiations within the framework of the WTO.
Renegotiation, even if it were to be considered feasible, will have uncertain results.
The Union is being called on to make the mechanism in question operational with all the means at its disposal.
At the same time, the transfer of know-how and technology and research in developing countries must be encouraged.
Compulsory licensing is just one aspect of the problems relating to public health in developing countries.
At the same time, measures are needed which aim to improve health care systems and infrastructures.
Targeted development aid from the Union can play an important role in this direction.
I should also like to emphasise the importance of safeguards against the diversion of trade.
Drugs must reach and stay with the people in the countries for which this mechanism was created.
I consider that the European Union must accept the amendment to the TRIPS agreement as quickly as possible.
To close, I should like to say that a global approach is needed which includes both prevention and treatment.
(Applause)
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the export mechanism provided for in the decision of 30 August 2003 has added such a number of restrictions and administrative/technical obstacles that to date, as is pointed out by 'MÃ©decins sans frontiÃšres' in a publication from September 2006, it has never been used.
Parliament asked the Commission and the Council to make a specific commitment in its resolution of 2 December 2004.
On 30 November 2006 the European Parliament again adopted a determined position on the issue of access to medicines in the south of the world and unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the Commission, and I quote, 'to recognise, five years after the adoption of the Doha Declaration, that its application has been a failure, inasmuch as the WTO has received no notification from an exporting or importing country of compulsory medicines nor any such notification under the Decision of 30 August 2003 of the General Council of the WTO on implementing paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration'.
Secondly, Parliament called on them 'to take the necessary steps within the WTO, in association with the developing countries, to modify the TRIPS Agreement and its provisions based on the Decision of 30 August 2003 ..., in order in particular to abolish the complex and time-consuming procedural steps in the authorisation of compulsory licences'.
So far, six months later, neither the Council nor the Commission, despite having been requested to do so by all the parliamentary groups, has not dignified the European Parliament with any reply.
Defending to the bitter end a mechanism such as that of 30 August 2003, reproduced word for word in the amendment to the TRIPS agreements that the EU would like to ratify, signifies a very clear choice of sides: it means siding with the large pharmaceutical multinationals and abandoning millions of patients in poor countries to the mercy of diseases that, in their case, are fatal, such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and dozens of other forgotten illnesses, without research or treatment.
This is a choice that this Chamber, convinced as it is of the primacy of human rights for all over the profit of a few, cannot accept.
author. - (SV) Imagine going to the doctor's and, in order to afford treatment, being forced to pay the whole of your family's annual wage.
Imagine going to the doctor's and being forced to choose between obtaining medicine for yourself and no food for the children, or food for the children and no medicine yourself.
That is a choice facing millions of people today.
Two years ago I was involved in starting the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative.
There were many of us who took the initiative here in Parliament to produce this report, and the cooperation between us has been excellent.
We are very much in agreement on these issues.
I wish to emphasise to the Commission that Parliament takes a very serious view of the need for rules guaranteeing access to medicines.
Today, 12 million people per year die due to lack of medicine, above all that designed to combat tropical diseases.
The patients are poor, and it is not profitable to do research on their behalf, so we do not get any new medicines.
We therefore have to resolve, firstly, the issue of access to existing medicines and, secondly, that of research into new medicines and the development of these, because these countries will never be able to leave poverty behind if their populations are at home ill.
The TRIPS+ agreements must definitely not become incorporated into the economic partnership agreements and undermine these countries' ability to provide their populations with medicines.
In the period allotted to me in which to speak, I do not even have time to run through all the ways in which the Commission is at present endeavouring to force the inclusion of the various patent-related issues into the negotiations on economic partnerships.
We would ask you to stop doing that.
When it comes to research, we need to have a fund at EU level or a global profits tax on pharmaceutical companies.
Otherwise, we shall never produce the medicines that can raise these people out of poverty.
The right to survival comes before all other rights.
author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Susta and all my fellow Members who have enabled this work, which covers many areas, to develop, and who have made it possible to launch this political initiative aimed at guaranteeing the residents of the world's poorest countries access to medicines at prices that are reasonable and affordable for those people.
While extreme poverty is a serious social hardship, when it is accompanied, as it often is, by serious diseases, it constitutes utter misery: that is the central message that we want to put across.
The agreement achieved within the WTO, which is probably the only practical legal way within the context of multilateralism to facilitate access to medicines at low prices, creates great confusion on many scores.
An exemption mechanism is set up, certainly with laudable intentions, but it is not operational: this is because of the restrictive clauses accompanying it, the numerous and complex administrative formalities that make it difficult to put into practice and the inability in practice to access the benefits of the proposed mechanism by countries that are potential beneficiaries.
Few countries have ratified it so far and - even more worryingly - no country has requested the help of this instrument.
We need to calmly verify that something is not working, and work out how to put it right.
We need to have the courage to go further and to realise that the de minimis agreement is only a partial solution to the fundamental problem, which casts doubt upon the effectiveness of the WTO's multilateralism rules.
We need to put forward measures at European level that go beyond the agreement and that are able to offer a sound contribution to access to medicines at affordable prices, thus helping to save many human lives.
We must encourage the transfer of research and technology to facilitate the production of medicines in poor countries.
We must be vigilant - and this is the Commission's task - because too often counterfeit medicines are sent to poor countries, and this is why we must also act decisively to combat this distortion of international trade.
Above all, though, we must undertake to be vigilant to ensure that the citizens of poor countries do not have to suffer this insult also.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Madam President, honourable Members, on 6 December 2006, the Council sought Parliament's approval, under Articles 133 and 300 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, for the Commission proposal for a Council decision relating to the acceptance, on behalf of the European Community, of the protocol amending the TRIPS agreement, signed in Geneva on 6 December 2005.
In developing and negotiating the aforementioned protocol, which will result in citizens of developing countries having increased access to drugs at affordable prices, the Community, from a political point of view, played a key role.
This was one of the greatest successes achieved in the run up to the WTO Ministerial Conference held in Hong Kong in December 2005.
The fact that that forum on standards in international trade addressed an issue of such importance for developing countries, constitutes a concrete application of the principles of consistency in the development policies set out in the European Council, agreed in 2005 between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
It also constitutes a significant practical step towards meeting Millennium Development Goal 6 to combat HIV-AIDS, malaria and other diseases.
A number of members of the WTO, including the United States, have already ratified the Protocol, and it is desirable that the Community, as the main advocate of the measure, should follow suit by December 2007 at the latest, once internal procedures in the Commission, the Council and Parliament have been completed.
As far as both technical and wider-ranging questions raised by the honourable Members are concerned, it is not the Council's responsibility to assess the technical effectiveness of the mechanism, created by the WTO's decision of 30 August 2003.
The Council recognises the complexity of the issue, but also underlines the fundamental political importance of ratifying the protocol for developing countries.
The Council does not intend to amend the mandate conferred on the Commission regarding economic partnership agreements since these are in the final stages of negotiation.
The Member States meeting with the Commission on the European Development Fund Committee will seek to ensure that adequate resources are channelled to meet Millennium Goal 6, in particular for the ACP countries.
The Council takes this opportunity to call on the European Parliament to fulfil its vital institutional role, in order that the European Community can accept this important protocol, and so that trade standards may be amended in such a way as better to serve the interests of millions of human beings in developing countries.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, the Commission shares Parliament's view that access to medicines for poor developing countries is a matter of huge political and humanitarian importance, and the Commission has taken a number of initiatives to facilitate access to medicines for poor developing countries through existing programmes.
From the outset, the European Community has been at the forefront of the debate on TRIPS and access to medicines.
In the WTO, we played an active role in bringing together almost irreconcilable positions.
Developing countries were grateful to the European Union for our role as an honest broker.
The debate in the WTO first led to the adoption of the declaration in Doha in November 2001.
This declaration reaffirms the right of WTO members to use, to the full, the flexibilities contained in the TRIPS Agreement, including the use of compulsory licensing.
For those countries with no manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical sector and that could not make effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS Agreement, a temporary waiver from the normal rules of patent law was adopted in August 2003.
Parliament, together with the Council, implemented this waiver decision by adopting it at first reading - Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 - to allow manufacturers of generic drugs to produce patent medicines for export to countries in need without sufficient capacity to produce them.
The protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement aims at transforming this decision into a permanent and legally secure solution.
This flexibility, to be introduced into the TRIPS Agreement, can help save lives without undermining the patent system, which is one of the main incentives for the research and development of new medicines.
We are now at the very end of this WTO process.
The last step is the acceptance of the TRIPS amendment.
I come now to the specific questions raised in the oral question, and I have discussed these responses with my colleague, Mr Mandelson, who is in charge of trade policy in the Commission.
I should like to make four specific, concise points.
First, the mechanism created by the WTO decision of August 2003 and the Protocol to the TRIPS Agreement is the result of long and difficult negotiations between almost 150 countries.
It represents a balance which was difficult to strike.
This mechanism must be seen only as a part of the wider issue of access to affordable medicines for developing countries, which goes far beyond the issue of patent law.
Second, the Commission can confirm that the European Community is committed not to include, in the economic partnership agreements and in other future bilateral and regional agreements with poor developing countries, any TRIPS+ provisions which could affect access to medicines or undermine the TRIPS flexibility contained in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health.
Third, the Commission encourages pharmaceutical companies to adopt schemes, such as tiered pricing, under which medicines are sold in poor and developing countries at considerably lower prices than in developed countries.
Fourth, the Commission supports local production capacity.
Local production can promote competition and make pharmaceutical products more affordable.
It is also important to encourage technology transfer to ensure that locally produced pharmaceutical products can meet internationally agreed standards.
To conclude, I hope that Parliament has been reassured that access to medicines remains a priority for the Commission.
Now that the European Parliament has all the elements in its hands to make a well-informed decision, and given the role played by the European Community in forging this permanent solution, it would be regrettable if the European Community could not accept it in time.
It is essential that Parliament and the Commission continue to cooperate closely to facilitate access to medicines for poor developing countries.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, every year, some six million people die of the effects of AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis.
Every year, millions of people, particularly in Africa, are denied the treatment that could save their lives, not because the medication is unavailable, but simply because it is unaffordable.
Whatever the exact reason may be, this is, of course, a downright scandal.
Since 2003, a temporary WTO regulation has been in place for countries that do not have the capacity to make their own cheap medicine for their people.
What the Commissioner said is right.
In Doha, we managed to secure a huge victory in 2003 when we made the breakthrough in this respect.
This is something for which the EU deserves enormous appreciation.
Whilst we may be able to discuss the causes ad infinitum, the trouble is that this regulation is still ineffective in practice, and all these millions of people have not received this medication, which is what we desperately want and why we welcomed this breakthrough at the time.
You are now asking this Parliament for permission, really, to make the agreement permanent.
Needless to say, before this House can add its signature to this regulation, which has not been workable to date, with all the underlying causes and complexities, we want firm guarantees.
The Commission and the Council have tried to say a few things.
First of all, it is essential that use is made of a practical regulation, as this simply requires much more assistance - practical, legal and political - from the countries involved.
We know that many of them consider it very complex to actually use it.
My suggestion would be to do what we did at the time of the trade negotiations, namely to set up a European cheap-medicine team, the 'A-Team' of the European Union, so that direct aid can be given, as it were.
This aid should not just be financial but also take the form of information and legal expertise.
Secondly, I understand that you, the European Commission, have pledged not to incorporate any TRIPS+ in bilateral agreements.
This would be a very crucial element, provided it is clearly confirmed by the Council.
Thirdly, the long-term solution is to enable developing countries to take care of their own production, which, of course, brings the developmental perspective into the equation.
The expertise is there.
This is what a number of countries, including Tanzania, are doing.
I think that this same European A-Team would be able to pull this off again without any trouble.
If this is the direction you are heading, we will be able to sign on the dotted line.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the TRIPS amendment is both overdue and ahead of its time.
It is overdue in that, for a long time, there has been a need to give poorer countries assisted access to drugs.
It is ahead of its time because the extension of patent regimes to cover drugs in India and other countries in 2005 has not yet bitten.
It takes years for a drug to get from development through clinical trials and it is only after that that this amendment might come into play.
But it could come into play earlier if the Indian patent office is not upheld in its line of rejecting patents for minor modifications of older drugs.
Now the amendment alone cannot solve the problem that generic drugs still available now are not affordable, but it will establish in TRIPs that production for export legitimately comes under compulsory licensing and so also loosens the constraint of the legitimate interests of the patent owner, at least as regards territory, in other articles.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wonder whether the Commission and the Council are here to pull our legs.
I intend to ask the Presidency if I can have a recording of this part-session, because I believe that playing it in Africa will explain better than any words the absolute and utter indifference of the Council and the European Commission to the problem of access to medicines.
All the groups are putting this question to you concerning a regulation that has been in force for three years but not once implemented; are you replying that this regulation will allow developing countries access to medicines?
But it has not allowed it for three years!
What, do you have a magic wand?
That is as far as the Council is concerned.
The Commission tells us: 'We have worked so hard to reach this agreement'.
But if it does not work - regardless of whether a large or small amount of work has been done - the agreement must be amended or in any event we need to find other ways to make progress.
The Commission and the Council also talk about 'asking the pharmaceutical firms to offer lower prices for the south of the world', which amounts to saying: 'Let the pharmaceutical firms themselves do a good deed, because we are completely unable to guarantee a right'.
They also talk of 'increasing local production capacity in the south of the world'.
But how?
There is endless talk of the transfer of technologies, but absolutely nothing is being transferred to the south of the world.
These regulations hinder production!
They are just fine words, and then you come here to say that the Millennium Development Goals are being achieved in this way.
It seems to me that there is a total lack of interest on the part of the Commission and the Council in the issue that we have raised.
Madam President, the Commission and Council are right to remind us that the 2003 waiver was greeted in this House as a great breakthrough in terms of access to medicine, but I think we are right as a Parliament to remind the other two institutions that four years later, not a single drug has been supplied to a single patient.
As others have said, the reasons for this are complex.
It is partly because of the expense of utilising the waiver, it is partly because of the complexity of the mechanism itself and it is partly because of economic pressure put on certain countries by other countries and by big pharmaceutical companies.
The Commission is right to say that we cannot go back and renegotiate this waiver.
It was a complex deal that was struck and we are not asking for that.
What we are saying is that if we are to give our assent to this waiver, we want the Commission to commit itself to giving technical, financial and political support to developing countries in order to enable them to utilise the mechanism.
The four points that Commissioner Rehn made were all very valid and welcome, but he has to go beyond those four points and make it clear that he will give the backing that the developing countries need to access medicines today, not in 10 or 20 years time.
(NL) Madam President, thanks to my report of December 2005, a compromise has been reached at first reading on a regulation which guarantees the uniform application in the EU of the WTO Decision of 30 August 2003.
Nearly four years on, though, it now looks as if this decision is nothing but an empty shell.
The fears at the time have now been realised.
The system is far too elaborate and does not work.
I share Mr Agnoletto's dismay over the response by the Council, which has managed to sidestep every question or concern expressed by this House.
The ratification of the TRIPS Protocol should force the EU into careful reflection and, above all, to a more cohesive policy which should enable the poorest countries to develop their own capacity to produce vital medicines.
Without a strong signal in that direction, I am not convinced, Madam President and Mr Susta, that we should sign this waiver just like that.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Madam President, honourable Members, as I said earlier, In developing and negotiating the aforementioned protocol, which will result in citizens of developing countries having increased access to drugs at affordable prices, the Community, from a political point of view, played a key role.
Mr Rehn has also made it clear here that this was achieved after lengthy and difficult negotiations and we believe that, in the light of the circumstances, the outcome is a balanced one.
All that remains for me to do, therefore, is once again to call on Parliament to accept this important protocol so that trade standards may be amended in such a way as better to serve the interests of millions of human beings in the developing countries.
Member of the Commission. Madam President, thank you for this very responsible debate on a very important issue.
I would like to give a response to an issue which was raised by David Martin and some other speakers concerning what the Commission is doing in order to support technology transfers leading to the local production of affordable key pharmaceuticals.
The issue also concerned what we are doing in the field of prevention, treatment and care as regards HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.
This is one of the objectives of a specific initiative dedicated to aid for poverty-related diseases in the developing countries which provided a combined total of EUR 81.2 million over the past two years.
The European Union is also a major funder of pharmaceutical and health-oriented clinical research including health systems research and capacity building in various sub-Saharan African countries through the European developing countries clinical trials partnership.
Moreover, during the period of implementation of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research, EU support for R[amp]D devoted to poverty related diseases amounted to more than EUR 455 million.
For the same period an additional EUR 78 million was spent by international scientific cooperation on various projects covering the fields of neglected infectious diseases, health systems policy research and reproductive health.
As you can see, the Commission is doing a lot to help developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, to enhance their access to affordable medicines, including local production capacity.
Is that enough?
Probably not.
Is the Commission ready to do more?
Yes, provided we have the resources needed.
And this is an area where Parliament has a key role to play.
There was another important issue raised concerning the fact that the mechanism has not yet been used, which implied that it does not work.
It is important to understand how compulsory licensing works.
The mechanism can operate without any compulsory licence actually being granted.
The usefulness of compulsory licenses comes mainly in the leverage they give to developing countries in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies.
In other words, compulsory licenses can deliver the expected results, i.e. make medicines more affordable without being actually granted.
Finally, I hope that Parliament has been reassured that access to medicines remains a very strong priority for the Commission and for the European Union.
We hope that Parliament will give its assent to the protocol as soon as possible.
The outside world would not understand a delay or refusal from the European Union.
This would undermine the EU's credibility as a whole in this field and as an international partner in general.
I have received one motion for a resolution in accordance with Article 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday 12 July 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - The right agreed in 2001 for developing countries to produce generic medicines was a welcome one.
But, as is only too obvious, many developing countries have neither the technological capacity nor the finance to do this.
The Agreement of August 2003 to add an annex to the original WTO Agreement that allowed these countries to import generic drugs was thought to solve this problem.
Yet four years later, not a single developing country has proved able to do this.
Four years on, not a single patient has received a single drug.
Alongside agreeing to sign the Annex we must ensure the necessary resources and will are available to transform what to date has proved to be mere rhetoric into reality.

Council Question Time
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) As the honourable Member is aware, the Council is not in a position to verify whether or not the Member States are complying with their various international obligations under international conventions.
The current situation relating to the European Union's southern maritime borders was debated in the Council of 12 June.
The Council intends to carry out an in-depth analysis of certain proposals put forward by Malta relating to the recent events in the Mediterranean Sea, which will take pertinent international instruments such as the SOLAS and SAR conventions into account.
Due attention will also be given to the Commission's study on international legal instruments relating to illegal immigration by sea.
In addition, the need to provide Frontex with the necessary resources to carry out its mandate efficiently was noted, and the Commission intends to increase its operational budget for 2007.
The Member States were also call on to honour their commitment to ensure that data is registered in the centralised record of available technical equipment.
(ES) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to begin by thanking you for answering my question first.
I wish the Portuguese Presidency every success, because we all need you to be successful.
Secondly, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to express great concern at the inadequacy of the 2 June agreements.
The EU, which is the wealthiest Community of states in the world, cannot allow itself to continue to allow a country to let dozens of shipwrecks perish in the sea due to a lack of practical measures.
I believe that the EU has sufficient means at its disposal and yet the resources we have to deal with such situations - in particular Frontex - are completely inadequate.
It is shameful and unacceptable that the EU should behave in this manner due to a lack of economic measures.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) I would firstly like to thank the honourable Member for his kind words in wishing the Portuguese Presidency good luck.
I would like to say that this is a question that the Portuguese Presidency considers not just important, but in fact a priority.
In his speech in the Chamber this morning, setting out the priorities for the six-month period of the Portuguese Presidency, the Portuguese Prime Minister had stressed that issues relating to the fight against illegal immigration would be a priority for the Portuguese Presidency.
We shall indeed be working hard to address these issues, but always from a humanitarian perspective, which, for us, is fundamental.
As you are aware, certain measures in this area were taken by the last European Council.
Obviously, we could always do more, and perhaps should do more.
However, I repeat that we consider this issue to be a priority.
They form a major part of the Portuguese Presidency's list of priorities so the honourable Member can rest assured that we will be doing everything possible to address the justified concerns that he has expressed here.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) The honourable Member has raised a highly pertinent question in the context of the changes under way in the European labour market in the light of the Lisbon Strategy.
With regard to the honourable Member's specific question on the action planned by the Council and the possible impact of the proposals in this sector, obviously the Council can only act through legislative channels based on a Commission proposal.
This is what is stipulated in the Treaties.
At this moment no legislative proposals relating to childcare are being analysed.
Adequate, high-quality provision of childcare services still falls to the Member States.
Although the Barcelona objectives have been implemented throughout the EU, the Council reiterated them in the European Pact for Gender Equality adopted in March 2006, when, the Council decided that the availability of high-quality childcare structures should be increased, commensurate with the internal objectives of each Member State.
We would also point out that the Council moreover reiterated its commitment regarding family-orientated policies, including childcare, in the conclusions adopted on 30 May 2007 on the importance of family-orientated policies in Europe and the creation of an Alliance for Families.
The honourable Member also mentioned the 18-month programme covering the German, Portuguese and Slovenian presidencies establishing that one of the major goals of the three Presidencies is to strengthen the European social model, which is an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy.
The programme also establishes that, in this particular context, the emphasis will be on a better balance between work, family and personal life, adequate childcare infrastructure, and support for the elderly and the disabled.
In its effort to achieve this goal, the Portuguese Presidency is also organising a conference on the balance between work, personal life and the family: fresh challenges for the social partners and public policies.
The conference will be held in Lisbon on 12 and 13 July 2007, beginning, therefore, tomorrow.
(EL) I too welcome the new Presidency and thank the representative of the Portuguese Presidency for his reply.
Of course the 12 and 13 July are tomorrow and the next day.
In order to revive everyone's interest, I should like to ask if measures can be designed within the framework of qualifications, an issue on which we have other legislative decisions by the Council and Parliament.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) I thank the honourable Member for her kind words in wishing success for the Portuguese Presidency.
When reading the list of priorities for the Portuguese Presidency, you will have noticed the attention and importance which we have attached to social issues and, specifically, to those concerning the relationship between work and the family.
Regarding the specific question you have just raised, the Council is obviously open to studying and considering all proposals and the Commission naturally has an important role to play in this matter.
As soon as the Commission proposes complementary or other measures in this field, the Council will obviously be ready to discuss and debate them.
Since the Portuguese Presidency underlines the importance of the social policy and European social model within the scope of its programme, it is naturally particularly keen to consider any proposals that may be submitted.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) The Council is disappointed that an agreement could not be reached on this issue in the session held in Luxemburg on 12 and 13 June, despite the analysis and adoption of this framework decision having been a priority not only for the German Presidency but also for the preceding presidencies since the presentation of the Commission proposal to the Council on 28 April 2004.
In this context, I would like to remind the honourable Member that on 1 and 2 June 2006 the Council agreed the principles that should govern subsequent work on this proposal.
It was concluded that the scope of the proposed framework decision would be limited to the right to information, the right to legal assistance, the right to free legal assistance, the right to an interpreter and the right to translation of the procedural documents.
At its session of 15 and 16 June 2006, the Council called for negotiations on the procedural rights in criminal proceedings to be concluded.
At its session of 19 April 2007, the Council concluded that work on this question should continue, with a view to obtaining a consensus on the scope of the instrument at the June European Council.
The question to be resolved was whether the Union had competence to legislate on purely national cases or whether the legislation - and I would point out that at least 21 Member States shared this opinion - should be applied solely to cross-border cases.
I should emphasise that the German Presidency in particular undertook every effort to obtain a consensus on this matter, unfortunately without success.
In turn, the Portuguese Presidency will attempt to find a way forward.
At this moment we are analysing the content of the dossier resulting from the Council debates of 12 and 13 June 2007.
In some Member States the delivery of the rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights is poor, so we need a measure spelling out rights to information, legal aid, interpretation and so on. Indeed, the Council of Europe has welcomed the framework decision, completely undermining claims - by, for example, the UK - that it would undermine the ECHR.
I welcome what the Presidency has said.
President-in-Office, do you think that expected changes in the Treaty to move to QMV and codecision will help?
Will you, perhaps, try to find a way through for enhanced cooperation?
Will you try to promote something like a PrÃŒm Treaty for rights - perhaps a Member State initiative?
How will you make sure, in practice, that we get this absolutely vital measure to match the European arrest warrant and other measures which have made prosecution easier, so that our citizens know that their rights are actually important in the EU?
It is, I believe, still a little early to reply fully to all the questions you have raised.
It was a single question, but one that contained a number of different sections and opened up various possibilities.
I have pointed out that our Presidency began only a few days ago.
We are currently analysing the content of the dossiers to see how we can make headway on this issue.
You spoke, for example, of facilitating the co-decision procedure by means of qualified majority voting, a more frequent application of qualified majority.
As far as I am aware, this possibility is not the one currently to be found in the Treaties, but it should be found in the so-called 'Reform Treaty', which is not yet even at the negotiation stage in the Intergovernmental Conference.
What I can assure the honourable Member is, as you will have realised from my speech, that we are attaching great importance and urgency to this issue.
In the light of the entire process thus far, and given the whole history of this issue, we shall be striving to find the solution most deserving of the support of all the Member States.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Obviously, the Presidency welcomes any initiative or proposal concerning relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries aimed at reinforcing Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
This region has always been, and will continue to be, at the top the EU's agenda.
At this moment, we do not have at our disposal specific details of the ideas proposed by the French President on this matter, so I am not in a position to comment on them for the time being.
(DE) I have two short supplementary questions.
One: how do you envisage improving and increasing cooperation with North Africa?
It is not satisfactory at present.
Two: would you consider creating a Mediterranean Community as an alternative to Turkey becoming a full member of the EU?
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) You will also have seen in our document outlining the Portuguese Presidency's priorities the strengthening of the relationship between the European Union and the Mediterranean, and our intention, within the scope of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, is to hold a number of high level ministerial meetings on a variety of matters.
This is, in fact, an important area to which the Portuguese Presidency will give its full attention, as the Portuguese Prime Minister also said very clearly here today during the debate on the Portuguese Presidency's priorities.
With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation or union, that is to say, the proposal put forward by the French President, I repeat what I have already said: that we have the need and desire to obtain a clearer view of what concrete proposals will effectively be submitted so that we can then make a comprehensive overview of the entire framework of relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean.
Question No 6 will not be answered, given that the issue with which it deals is already on today's agenda.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:
Subject: EU imports of Brazilian beef
There is an increasing body of evidence showing that the standards and controls in place in the Brazilian beef sector are deeply flawed, open to widespread abuse and nowhere near as stringent as equivalent rules applicable to European farmers - yet the EU continues to accept imports of Brazilian beef.
In this context, does the Council intend to act to protect Europe's beef producers and consumers, and to ensure that producers and consumers can be confident that all beef on the European market adheres to the same high standards?
Subject: Separate EU-Brazil deal on the beef sector
Can the European Council make a statement as to whether it intends to pursue an individual deal between the EU and Brazil concerning Brazilian beef imports into the EU if the WTO negotiations fail to make progress in the coming months?
For such a deal between Brazil and the EU to go ahead, does the European Council have to give Commissioner Mandelson the mandate to conclude such an arrangement, or does Commissioner Mandelson already have this power to conclude such a deal under his negotiating terms of reference
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Mr President, I would ask the honourable Members to consult the German Presidency's answer to oral questionof 20 June 2007, in other words not long ago.
The Council would first like to emphasise that with regard to the new legislative proposals it is naturally the Commission's responsibility to exercise its right of initiative.
With regard to the specific question of beef imports, we must take account of the fact that, in accordance with Community law, the Commission is competent to manage the safeguard clause.
Consequently, the Council has no direct influence on the decisions taken by the Commission in this area.
The response was brief, but the question is a very serious one and it will not go away.
What is being looked at here is the imbalance in standards between Brazil and Europe; what we demand of our producers and what our consumers expect, and what is delivered in terms of beef brought into the EU from Brazil.
I note in your priorities, President-in-Office, that you have a special relationship with Brazil and are looking at a specific political dialogue with that country.
I stress that we are looking at a ban on such imports and I think that, in terms of consumer safety and protection, that is the very least we should be looking at.
On the issue of the trade deal, I would ask that you address that particular question and the likelihood of same.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Very briefly, Mr President, I wish to thank you for your kind words wishing the Portuguese presidency success and to tell the Chamber that, on the initiative of this Presidency, the first EU-Brazil summit was recently held in Lisbon.
I believe this summit will very much set the tone for future relations between the EU and Brazil, which we would naturally like to see taken to a new level.
The strategic dialogue that we will be establishing with Brazil is set to be all-encompassing - covering issues ranging from economics and trade to energy and climate change.
I believe that these and other questions will continue to have their place.
This is what I wanted to say to the honourable Member.
President-in-Office of the Council.
(PT) Thanks to the efficiency of all those who work with me, it was easy to find Question 19, to which you referred, and I am delighted to give you an answer.
It is our understanding that Turkey's approach to minority rights continues to be restrictive.
Where cultural rights are concerned, legislative amendments have been introduced, as you are aware, with a view to allowing education and broadcasting in languages other than Turkish.
However, the public education system maintains restrictions with regard to the learning of these languages.
