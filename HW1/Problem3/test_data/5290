It concerns the interplay between religion and politics.
As the Commissioner said, our relations with the Islamic world are an extremely sensitive area, both internally in the European Union and in our various Member States.
I mean that religion and freedom of religion are of fundamental significance for the development of human rights and, ultimately, of democracy.
Religion must not, of course, take over the political system, but nor can religious life be kept completely separate from the rest of society.
I believe that the types of solutions that exist in certain countries, for example in Iran where an Islamicist Council of Guardians says who may stand in elections and who may not, is completely unreasonable.
Nor am I convinced that the French or Turkish solution, in which religious symbols are to be banned in schools, is the right one.
I wish, therefore, to refer to what Commissioner Patten has said about our relations with the Islamic world and about MrÂ van den Bosâs report on human rights, adopted by Parliament in July 2003.
A number of amendments were approved, emphasising every personâs right to seek their own faith, the right to change religion and the right not to belong to any religion.
The value of being free to conduct missionary work, irrespective of whether the country concerned is predominantly Christian, Muslim or Jewish, was also emphasised.
The fundamental principles are that of the equal value of human beings, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity, the principle of non-discrimination and the principle whereby religion stands for non-violence, love and reconciliation.
The equal value of human beings, irrespective of their religious affiliation, is emphasised.
I believe that the conversation about the significance of religion for the good society and for combating the misuse of religion itself to issue threats, perpetrate violence and oppression and justify terrorism and discrimination against people is an important and fundamental part of our relations with the Islamic Mediterranean countries.
Let the dialogue about religion and the good use of religion in the proper sense of the word be an important part of our relations with countries around the Mediterranean.
Â Â  Mr President, the importance attached by the European Parliament to respect for and the safeguarding of democracy and human rights everywhere and always is a known fact and is non-negotiable.
As a general principle, it has become our prime concern to demand the same respect and the same application from all our partners, without wrongful interpretation, differentiation or a selective approach.
In addition to this, our insistence on control of the application and operation of the principles of democracy, human rights, the rights of national minorities and sexual equality are uniform and undivided for everyone, everywhere.
The linking of European financial aid with compliance with absolute respect for the above rights is also uniform for everyone, everywhere.
This truth is repeated and emphasised in the relevant motion by the European Parliament to our Mediterranean partners, in order to avoid misunderstandings or different interpretations.
Good accounts make good friends.
Deepening political dialogue on issues of democracy and respect for human rights at all levels certainly helps to consolidate our bilateral relations and transactions and to further deepen them.
The exchange of information, knowledge and experience by all the partners, as the motion comments, helps to further serve the desired approach on the basis of principles and rules which are common to and respected by everyone.
The Commission's contacts with civil society and the reports on its findings to all the partners are a simple, straightforward tool for evaluating the present situation, to be praised, or an intervention to be corrected.
With the recent excellent upgrading of the Mediterranean Forum to Parliamentary Assembly, a huge step has been taken towards democratic dialogue and creative consultation and understanding between the partners on both sides of the Mediterranean.
This political dialogue will help enormously to resolve possible problems or misunderstandings and to support the procedure of rapprochement and cooperation, which will serve stability and the peaceful development and coexistence of the entire Mediterranean area.
Let us hope that those developments in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, which are still obstructing an unimpeded approach, come to an end as quickly as possible, without walls and divisions, for the good of the entire area and its inhabitants.
Â Â  Mr President, it is a fact that the countries of the south-eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East as a whole are an important field of action for the foreign relations of the European Union and the present Commission communication confirms this.
It is particularly positive that the Commission recognises that the marginalisation of women undermines political representation and obstructs economic and social development in the area.
It is true that women in Mediterranean and Arab countries, despite a certain improvement in conditions over recent years, continue to be the victims of sexual discrimination and inequality.
Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical and pharmaceutical care, little participation in professional and political life, these are the main features of the life of women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin and in the countries of the Middle East.
Worst of all, however, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, ultra-conservatism and autocratic regimes which base their power to a large degree on controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even the way they dress.
Certainly, the best defence against the powers of retrogression and intolerance is to strengthen the secular aspect of the state and the legal democratic order.
Our message must be clear.
No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the rule of law.
The more these basic elements of a democratic state are missing from numerous countries of the Mediterranean, the more the hopes for economic and social development and an improvement in the position of women will remain dim and the resolutions passed by the conferences held within the framework of the Barcelona process will remain dead letter.
That is why we are asking the European Commission and the representation of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to use all the mechanisms at its disposal in order to include clear clauses and commitments on the recognition and protection of human rights and the rights of women and the principles of the rule of law as for the development of the countries of the Mediterranean and the elevation of the Mediterranean basin to an area of peace and cooperation.
Â Â  . I do not want to delay the House unduly as it quietly prepares to go about its democratic duty.
However, I should like to respond to one or two questions from what has been an important and useful debate.
I was asked how our proposals had been received by our partners.
The fairest diplomatic answer is that the ideas have been received rather cautiously in some countries but much more positively in others â Jordan and Morocco spring to mind.
Whatever the response, the ideas that we have put forward are now a central part of the debate, a central part of the dialogue with these countries.
It is important to remember that what we are talking about is not negative conditionality, but positive encouragement.
We are talking about setting aside part of our MEDA funds each year and allocating them to those countries which enter into specific partnerships with us to develop democracy and human rights.
That is an important shift of emphasis and an important way of trying to use our development assistance and cooperation to promote political objectives which we all know are crucial, not only to the stability and wellbeing of societies, but also to their long-term economic development.
In pressing our views on issues such as human rights in Tunisia â to which the honourable Member rightly referred â we have to be vigorous and avoid being counterproductive.
A couple of weeks ago in another part of the world â when pressing the case for the rule of law and civil liberty â I was accused of being neo-colonial.
I had to point out that as far as I was concerned that was a terrible insult: I had been the real thing; I had been a real colonial oppressor and not simply a neo-colonial has-been.
We have to be careful about how we proceed with the debate.
It is also important to recognise that it is a long process and that, as Mrs Bonino said, we need to be consistent.
We need to show that we mean what we say.
We have to be mindful of our credibility and we have to make sure that this is a debate we conduct on the basis of mutual esteem, on the basis that we are on an equal footing.
I was also asked how our arguments and ideas tied in with those of the United States on democracy and the wider Middle East.
It is fair to say that this is a subject about which we have a decade of experience.
We welcome the United States' interest.
I am sure there will be a lot of discussions, as there were last weekend at the Munich security conference.
I hope that we do not lose the distinctiveness of our own approach.
I hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that this is a long-term process and I hope that, as the honourable Member said late in the debate, that we do not lose sight of the relevance of the Middle East dispute, of the relationship between Israel and Palestine, to the discussion about democracy in the wider region, because at the moment undoubtedly some in the Arab world doubt our credentials and goodwill because they do not think we are doing enough to resolve the problems of Palestine.
Lastly I would like to repeat again to Mr McMillan-Scott that we go into these debates with an open mind.
We recognise the experience and the wisdom of Parliament and we are sure that together Parliament, Commission and Council will be able to frame a policy which will not only continue to command the attention of the whole House, but will actually lead to the sort of beneficial consequences that we wish to see.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your contribution and your efforts in a climate which has not always been very easy.
I have received motion for a resolution B5-0049/2004, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today, Thursday.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 9a and Annex XI of the Rules of Procedure, I should like to ask the President if he would refer the events of this morning's STOA management committee to the Anti-Fraud Office for investigation.
The committee voted by 11 votes to 8 to suppress a scientific report on inedibles, in respect of which the European Academy of Sciences' advisory committee stated: 'This report is, overall, a reasonable, impartial and balanced piece of work on a very difficult topic.'
The peer review would lead me to conclude that it should definitely be published.
It is important that the general public realise that this decision was made on the basis of grave political errors, rather than believing that the committee has become a majority-owned property of European chocolate manufacturers.
Â Â  We will forward your comment to the President, MrÂ Ford.(1)
Â Â  . Given the importance of the aims of the MEDIA programme, we broadly welcome the report and the extension until 2006 requested by the Commission.
Like the rapporteur, however, we regret that there is, as yet, no definitive report that evaluates the programmeâs implementation.
We trust that Parliament will shortly be provided with this.
A high-quality, wide-ranging debate must be held regarding audiovisual policy at European level, before decisions can be made regarding the bases of any future programme.
It is, therefore, also important that all elements in the audiovisual sector â namely, operators, various networks and associations â as well as workers and representatives from the general public, will be invited to participate in this debate.
Â Â  . As we all know, MEDIA PLUS and MEDIA-Training programmes constitute one of the pillars of Europeâs audiovisual policy.
These form the Community support mechanism for the audiovisual sector and replace the MEDIA I and MEDIA II programmes, which were launched, respectively, in 1991 and 1996.
Experience acquired in the previous programmes has helped considerably to improve the functioning of the current MEDIA instruments.
MEDIA-Training aims to support study on the application of the new technologies; economic, commercial and financial management; techniques for the financing, production and distribution of audiovisual programmes; techniques for the development of new audiovisual programme types and script-writing and storytelling techniques.
In addition to the establishment of a dedicated parliamentary committee, I also welcome the Commissionâs intention to ensure, for 2006, that continuity is provided to operators and professionals who are involved in the MEDIA-Training programme, which would therefore be extended without any structural changes until 31Â December, with increased funding.
Encouraged by the parliamentary committeeâs unanimous approval for the proposals to establish a training programme for professionals in the European audiovisual programmes, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I have voted in support of this report welcoming the extension of the European Maritime Safety Agency's powers to maritime security and seafarers' qualifications.
Parliament is perfectly correct to emphasise the need to make maritime transport safer, better protect the marine environment and enhance shipping security.
In the wake of the disaster and the many other catastrophes we have witnessed we can all agree that maritime transport must be made a lot safer and there must be far better coordination of actions in all Member States.
A properly resourced European Maritime Safety Agency would enable such coordination with due respect for the need to safeguard the subsidiarity principle in recognition that primary responsibility must lie with coastal Member States.
I also fully support the proposal that the European Maritime Safety Agency should be involved in recognition of certificates of competency for seafarers and hope that the Agency will prioritise this particular area with a view to ensuring greater safety for workers and citizens.
It is however my view that EMSA should not be given responsibilities for combating terrorism: these must continue to be the responsibility of the Member States, and I welcome the clarifications contained in the report in this regard.
Â Â  . I congratulate Mr Mastorakis on his report, which I wholeheartedly welcome.
I should like to highlight two points that I consider to be of great importance:
- complete support for extending the competences of the European Maritime Safety Agency to include the fight against pollution.
There are major advantages in coordinated Community action in this area and the Agency can play a crucial role, by integrating mechanisms that will make cleaning-up operations more effective following oil spills;
- agreement that the Agency will be able to intervene in matters of security, as a result of the new tasks assigned by the Member States through the directive on âships and port facility securityâ.
Â Â  . Regulation No 1406/2002, establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency, was adopted by Parliament and the Council on 27 June 2002 and came into force following its publication in the Official Journal in August 2002.
The main task of this new body will be to provide technical and scientific assistance to Member States and the Commission in order to ensure that Community legislation in the maritime navigation sector is correctly implemented, to prevent ship-source pollution and to monitor the implementation of this legislation.
Following the recent series of disasters at sea, the Commission proposes extending the competences of the Agency to provide it with the necessary means to address certain problems connected with maritime safety.
Most importantly, it assigns complementary tasks to the Agency to support the Commissionâs activities in the fight against terrorist acts on ships and port facilities, in training seafarers and in the fight against marine pollution.
There is already a legislative framework in place that establishes a system of cooperation in the area of sea pollution, and a Community mechanism designed to encourage closer cooperation in emergency interventions in the field of civil protection.
This proposal, which has undergone substantial improvement in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, wins my support.
Â Â  . Mr Mastorakisâ report deserves our wholehearted support.
The European Maritime Safety Agency must have the competences and the means to prevent and combat pollution caused by ships and other vessels.
We must ensure that the Agency is located in Portugal and â in the interests of decentralisation and of combating the inherent imbalance in Portugalâs Lisbon-centric development â we must make it possible for the Agency, or one of its branches, to be located in Sagres, on the Algarve, in Southern Europe.
Â Â  . The sustainable development of transport requires the adoption of an integrated approach to transport that exploits to the full the potential of all the different modes currently available.
Bearing this in mind, the Commission has pointed out the difficulties encountered by users of current intermodal loading units (ILUs) â in other words, containers or boxes usually used in transport â which range from the diversity of handling and securing devices to questions of security and methods of monitoring.
The aim of this proposal is to recommend the use of an optional European ILU (EILU) that will overcome such difficulties by combining the benefits of both swap boxes and containers, which could be used in rail, road, sea and river transport.
This measure will provide the transport sector with the freedom to opt for the alternative proposed by the Commission, which will undoubtedly bring advantages.
I welcome the method chosen to promote the new system, which remains non-mandatory for Member States, granting financial benefits and other incentives to encourage Community projects or programmes that clearly demonstrate the intention of using EILUs.
In view of the potential benefits for commercial transport, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . We can only take pleasure in the new protocol raising the capacity of the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF) to EUR 930 million.
I have therefore voted in favour of the Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado report.
However, we cannot ignore the fact that the damage caused by the sinking of the is estimated at a minimum of EUR 5 billion.
In view of the size of oil tankers, and therefore the scale of the disasters they may cause, we are far from our target.
This is why it seems to me necessary to progressively raise the ceiling for IOPCF compensation, and that we need an additional fund amongst the European States, provided that it is not used as a pretext to postpone the necessary adaptation of the IOPCF.
We must also adopt international agreements which are not limited to establishing the responsibility of the owner of the vessel, as is the case today, but also extend responsibilities to all the actors in the transport chain, ship operators, charterers, and also owners of the cargo transported, thereby encouraging the latter to take care to choose safe ships.
Â Â  . I wish to confirm my support for this report authorising Austria and Luxembourg to sign the 2003 Protocol by 30 June 2004.
I believe that in response to the accident involving the there is a clear need to ensure that full and swift payments can be made to victims of future oil spills, notwithstanding our obligation to do everything possible to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.
I call on all Member States to sign, ratify or accede to the protocol as soon as possible.
Â Â  . I voted for this report because it is important to make the current system for compensating victims more efficient.
Additional funds should allow for effective, quick and fair compensation for victims of future oil spills.
This is why the Member States must sign or ratify the protocol on this fund as quickly as possible.
I would like to express some reservations however.
First of all, it is unacceptable that the human, economic and environmental damage resulting from the sinking of the is not taken into account in the raising of compensation.
Furthermore, it is a shame to be deprived of recourse to the COPE Fund, a European additional compensation fund with a ceiling of EUR one billion, since it could have speeded up the compensation of victims who were not in a position to obtain complete compensation within the framework of the international system.
This dossier, which has been left aside, seems to be mistaken for the additional fund.
Finally, the Member States must transpose the measures adopted at European and international level following the and accidents as soon as possible.
In conclusion, I would point out the equally important need to act in advance by means of a genuine preventive policy.
Polluters must be severely punished and each party involved in the transport of goods must be made responsible.
Â Â  . We voted in favour of this report, as we feel that the new supplementary fund will greatly help to ensure that victims of future oil spills will be paid in full and more swiftly.
This proposal arose following the Councilâs decision authorising Member States to sign or ratify, in the interest of the European Community, the Protocol of 2003 to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage, 1992.
The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) protocol increases the funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills.
The Member States have been called on to sign this protocol as soon as possible and, if possible, by 30 June 2004.
This decision follows the accident involving the in November 2002, when the Council adopted a firmer position on the need for additional compensation.
More recently, the European Council of 21 March 2003 confirmed the point of view expressed at various Council meetings, calling on Member States, âin terms of compensation for the victims of pollution, including environmental damage (...) to pursue within the forthcoming diplomatic conference at the IMO in May an increase in the current ceiling on compensation to EUR one billionâ.
On 16 May 2003, the IMO adopted a new protocol to the existing oil pollution liability and compensation conventions.
This protocol establishes a supplementary fund, which multiplies the ceiling by five ...
Â Â  . I congratulate Mr Gil-Robles on his recommendation on the establishment of an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage.
I share his opinion that maximum levels of compensation in this fund are insufficient to guarantee adequate protection for victims of any future large-scale oil spill.
The Supplementary Fund will compensate victims provided that compensation claims are deemed justified and if the person is unable to obtain full and adequate compensation under the 1992 Fund Convention.
I should also like to point out that raising the level of compensation can be no excuse for negligence in terms of prevention.
Â Â  . The proposal for a decision submitted for Parliamentâs approval, authorises and calls on Member States to accede to the Protocol on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) compensation fund, which increases funding available to compensate the victims of oil spills.
By significantly raising the ceilings for compensation established by the existing international system, the Protocol on the supplementary fund plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations on oil pollution liability.
The new supplementary fund will ensure that victims of spills of harmful substances will be paid swiftly and in full, thereby providing against situations such as the and the .
Given that some parts of the Protocol on the supplementary fund fall within the exclusive competence of the Community, Member States must ratify it in order to comply with the Protocol, thereby leading to implementation, which will naturally enjoy the support of our vote in favour.
Â Â  . The proposal for a decision submitted for Parliamentâs approval authorises Member States to accede to the Protocol on the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)âs supplementary fund, which increases the funding available to compensate victims of oil spills.
Member States are requested to sign this protocol as soon as possible.
The protocol establishes an International Fund for Compensation of Oil Pollution Damage, 1992, to ensure that victims of damage caused by oil spills from tankers will be paid compensation swiftly and in full.
By raising the compensation ceiling established in the existing international system, the Protocol plugs one of the most important gaps in international regulations in terms of liability for oil pollution, as the compensation ceiling set by the supplementary fund will be fixed.
There will probably be far fewer parties to the new fund than to the 1992 fund, since numerous States that were party to the 1992 Fund feel that there is no need for supplementary protection.
I believe that the new fund will greatly help to ensure the full and swift payment of victims of oil spills.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . The extremely precarious state of the metallurgy sector is well known, as is the lack of an overall plan to revive the sector at European level.
Portugal has also suffered as a result of this.
Hence our vote in solidarity with the workers, the unions and the population of Terni, in the hope of maintaining a high-tech production hub.
We deplore the rejection of our groupâs proposal, which was intended substantially to diminish the effects of company relocations, from which Portugal is also suffering.
It is therefore essential that the Commission propose adequate legislation to protect workers from the appalling consequences of company relocation, that it promote legislation containing social clauses designed to protect jobs and the standard of living of families affected, and which commit companies to providing workers with the opportunity to gain new professional qualifications.
A new policy is also required that would oblige multinationals, especially those that neglect their social responsibilities, to return any financial support granted to them.
Â Â  . I wish to support this call on the Commission and the Member States to learn lessons from the Europe's largest corporate scandal in years, and strengthen EU auditing rules with particular regard to the interest of workers.
In the wake of the accounting scandal surrounding Italian food group Parmalat, which erupted in December 2003 with the revelation of a black hole of EUR 4 billion in lost funds and EUR 14 billion in unpaid debt, I believe we certainly need the Commission to set up a revised directive on corporate governance that could strengthen rules on auditing.
Time and time again workers and pensioners have lost out in the wake of corporate scandals so none of us can be in any doubt that there is an urgent need to improve corporate governance and strengthen our defences against corporate malpractice.
Good company law and good corporate governance are essential to the job security of all employees and to the protect the future of members of company pension schemes.
The financial services industry must certainly put its house in order and ensure ethical conduct and diligence to protect the jobs and savings of millions of people.
It is outrageous that no warning signals were sounded while Parmalat funds were being embezzled.
Â Â  .â The Parmalat company has been presented to us as an example of the success of liberal globalisation.
Parmalat, once a small family pasteurised milk company, was developed partly thanks to European Union subsidies.
Since 1974, it had multiplied its subsidiaries and created shell companies in tax havens.
The system lasted until 11 November 2003, when the auditors expressed doubts about a EUR 500 million investment in the Cayman Islands.
Parmalat â like Enron, Tyco, World Com or Ahold â is nothing but a prototype for this rogue capitalism.
For 30 years, Parmalatâs bosses have received public subsidies, disguised their accounts and announced fictitious profits.
These practices have led to the elimination of thousands of jobs.
However, the resolution proposed does not attack these Mafia practices and confines itself too much to observations.
It is for these reasons that we have abstained.
First of all, the EU should do everything possible to ensure that all the people responsible are extradited and tried quickly.
Then, the EU must stop giving public subsidies to this type of company.
Furthermore, employees and their organisations must have the means for effective control of accounts.
Finally, all tax havens in the EU (San Marino, Monaco, Luxembourg, and others) must be eliminated.
Â Â  . â At the end of yesterdayâs debate, CommissionerÂ Bolkestein neglected the two key problems: legal tax havens and the impact of fraud on employees and small savers.
It is good that he is introducing strict disclosure requirements in September, which will result in special operations and transactions being listed in the accounts and the use of special instruments being explained; that should have been done much sooner.
It is imperative that we have an accounting system that does not conceal the actual state of affairs and the reasons for it.
What I now find the most worrying is that European countries are offering companies the opportunity of bypassing rules laid down by other countries.
I had always thought that the problems of banking secrecy, letter-box companies and tax havens were confined to Luxembourg, Austria and the Swiss cantons Zug and Schwyz, but it now emerges that thousands of billions of Parmalatâs property was kept in the Netherlands with the help of 181 trust offices, five private companies and one foundation.
The favourable investment climate for foreign companies created by the Dutch government in the 1990s gives swindlers and tax evaders elbow-room.
I have not heard anything from the Dutch Commissioner about what action he is taking against this policy, which his party helped to promote.
I shall shortly be putting this on the agenda, therefore, in questions to the European Commission.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on approximating civil procedural law in the EU, aimed at harmonising the entire body of private international law relating to contractual obligations.
I agree with the rapporteur that in this field it is preferable for the provisions concerned to be directly applicable in all Member States instead of being subjected to the uncertainties stemming from the transposition of a directive.
The future instrument should therefore be adopted in the form of a regulation.
I also agree with the rapporteur, with regard to the proposal for an order for payment procedure, when he underlines that the approximation of civil procedural law in the EU cannot happen unless the system of notification and communication of judicial and extrajudicial acts must be standardised.
I also endorse his view that, in the small claims procedure, alternative ways of resolving cases should be found that may make it possible to simplify the taking of evidence and to limit the right of appeal.
I welcome the rapporteurâs suggestions to ensure that the powers granted to the Court of Justice in this field are not excessive.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  We agree with the demand that the GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners should receive a fair trial.
That is why we have voted in favour of this report.
We believe, however, that it is not clear that the prisoners fulfil the conditions for being regarded as prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention.
The report is not, therefore, correct in invoking the rules of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of captured soldiers as rights possessed by the GuantÃ¡namo Bay prisoners.
Â Â  . Events in Afghanistan have been a cause for serious concern for a number of years.
The world must not forget the Afghan people, who continue to suffer from the impact of wars waged by those who value their economic and geo-strategic interests ahead of peopleâs well being.
The Taliban regime was appalling. Equally appalling, however, was the war started by the US Administration, under the pretext of combating terrorism.
More than two years on, it is clear that the war did not solve the underlying problems of the Afghan people, nor did it help to support the countryâs move towards democracy.
As the report says, âthe deteriorating security situation is the main threat to the population of Afghanistan and to the efforts of Afghan and international NGOs supporting reconstruction, rehabilitation and development initiatives and to the peace process in generalâ.
Events today in Afghanistan, and indeed in Iraq, clearly demonstrate the complete mistake of going to war.
The Bush Administration should be condemned for the appalling situation in these countries and for the terrible suffering of the majority of the population.
Â Â  . â There is a great difference between the reality within Afghanistan and the way it is regarded by outsiders.
It is a collection of isolated valleys, with different languages and cultures, that have little more in common than theirÂ Muslim religion, the oppression of women, and the fact that they were herded together into a single state in the 19thÂ century in order to form a neutral buffer zone between the British and Russian spheres of influence.
Although Tajiks, Uzbeks and Baluchis also live in neighbouring countries, the issue of whether their languages should be prohibited within Afghanistan is being discussed as part of the establishment of the Afghan constitution.
The outside world is imposing a supreme president and a central army on the country with the task of achieving unity, whereas, in practice, the President and the army do not have any power outside the capital.
This kind of illusion of unity will induce the outside world to retain a permanent military presence in the struggle against peoples who have no desire for such unity.
The only possibility of a lasting peace seems to lie in a Swiss-style constitution consisting of cantons with a high degree of autonomy and different languages.
I welcome the indication the proposed text gives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is starting to understand something of this and is advocating decentralisation, a stronger parliament and an independent judicial system.
I can only support the proposal in the absence of the amendments by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats which seek to move away from these.
Â Â  .
I welcome this report on the situation in Afghanistan.
The reality is that the recent history of the country is characterised by a lack of security and by the slow pace of reconstruction, a situation that makes it essential for the EU to adopt positions.
I agree with the rapporteur that concern must be expressed with regard to the difficult situation facing women in Afghanistan.
The EU must insist that improving the situation of women represents a priority for the country.
It is true that some progress has been made, such as the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women by the Afghan Transitional Authority (ATA) and the reference to equal treatment for women and men in the new constitution adopted on 4 January.
While these are important steps, they are insufficient in themselves.
It is essential that the ATA condemn consistently, publicly and unequivocally all acts of violence perpetrated against women and children.
I endorse the rapporteurâs view that funds from the Community budget earmarked for the ATA must be increased, particularly because granting less money may be seen as a lack of support for the progress that has taken place and as a disincentive to proceed with reconstruction.
The idea of creating a European reconstruction agency along the lines of the Kosovo model must be considered.
Â Â  That concludes the voting.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to point out that someone has just been taking photographs from up there, with the evident intention of discrediting a lady MEP.
I ask that the photographer should have his camera taken off him and the pictures confiscated.
Â Â  I will ask the services to do what they can, MrÂ GrÃ¶ner.(3)
Â Â  The sitting is resumed.
The Minutes of yesterdayâs sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Â Â  â Mr President, I just wanted to say that Mr Hans-Peter Martin has announced the withdrawal of the report on lobbying in industry because of his own personal interest.
This is not something that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes; it has been done contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and of the coordinator.
I just wanted to have it recorded in the minutes of the House that he personally withdrew this report contrary to the intentions of the relevant committee and contrary to the statement that he made.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just wanted to say that I hope â as I trust Mr RÃŒbig does too â that this report can be discussed in plenary as soon as possible, as it certainly should be.
Â Â  We take note of the comments made for the Minutes.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0012/2004) by Mr Herzog, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to the Commission, on the European Commission's strategy on Services of General Interest (SGI).
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the Commissionâs strategy in relation to services of general interest.
First of all, we condemn the lack of transparency, and also of respect, towards civil society and Parliament.
In fact, in relation to services of general interest, the Commission has carried out consultations throughout 2003, but they were separate consultations.
The Competition DG has produced a package on financial compensations, which I only know about through journalists, and essentially these texts completely ignore the advice and requests of our Parliament.
Financial compensation is essential to the very existence of services of general interest.
Any intrusion by the Commission in the field of definitions and rules justifying compensations would be unacceptable, since it is outside of its competences.
The Commissionâs role is to apply the law, not make it.
Another reason for Parliamentâs call for a legal act under codecision which would include the principles of funding is to clarify the Treaties and case-law.
In this regard, only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise.
Therefore, in the White Paper, which it must publish before April, the Commission must give a clear âyesâ or ânoâ to this demand for a legislative act.
By saying ânoâ, by not responding clearly and by assuming the right to impose substantial definitions and rules, it would be committing an abuse of power.
For the moment, on the basis of the information available to me, I note that, in the package under preparation, it assumes it has the power to lay down rules, and that many of these choices formally contradict the European Parliamentâs resolution.
The resolution we adopted on 14 January of this year states that 'the task at Community level for services of general interest is to guarantee their exercise within the internal market and, notably, to ensure that competition rules are compatible with public service obligations'.
But I believe that the Monti package, which I have not seen, makes funding possibilities more difficult, in the name of full respect for competition rules.
I would insist, under these circumstances, and we have already told you this â I remember in particular the speeches by Mr Langen and Mrs Flautre, last year â on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the Treaty and jurisprudence.
We want the Commission to prepare a legislative act involving the codecision procedure.
However, the Commission is competent in the field of the application of rules.
It is therefore entitled to prepare a decision and a framework, but these executive acts depend, as we all know, on the interpretation of rules.
That is why we are asking you to say explicitly today, when you have corrected them following consultation, that these texts under preparation will only enter into force provisionally, while we await the adoption of a legislative act.
I would now like to draw your attention to the substance of the Monti proposals, which contradict our resolution.
Far from increasing legal certainty, they will worsen the uncertainty.
Many services of general economic interest, in particular social, which did not previously notify, would now have to notify.
For the acceptance of compensation, the requirements for tendering procedures will be toughened up.
Our requests for criteria for the calculation of costs are being ignored.
The notion of over-compensation would be greatly extended.
As for services provided essentially to companies, they would be considered not to be included in the notion of service of general economic interest, which would represent a blatant intrusion into the field of definitions.
So here are my questions.
What is the Commissionâs timetable for action?
Will you respond coherently to the consultation and the proposals on compensations in the White Paper that we asked you to present here in April?
Will you state clearly yes or no to a legal act through codecision?
Will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act?
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to say what a pleasure it is to be here this afternoon.
With several hours of further debates ahead of me, I will have been able to spend the whole day in the Hemicycle, and what more could a man want â except perhaps to be lying on a beach in Langkawi?!
The honourable Member raises some extremely important issues, and I will come to some of the points he raised in a moment.
I recognise that his question suggests that there is still some confusion about the Commission's intentions.
So I want at the outset to state as clearly as I can that the Commission does not intend to adopt any final package before drawing political conclusions from the broad public consultation on the Green Paper on services of general interest.
The Commission services have assessed very carefully the responses received with regard to the financing of services of general interest.
The responses are various and interesting, and I can, if Parliament would like, refer to some of them.
The public consultation has clearly confirmed the need to increase legal certainty and clarity with regard to the application of the state aid rules in this area.
In fact the comments received from interested parties and also the discussion on the Green Paper in Parliament have both shown that there is a broad agreement that such a clarification is not only necessary, but is also urgent.
A decision exempting certain types of aid from the notification obligation would be, in our judgment, an appropriate instrument for achieving more legal certainty.
Given the urgent need for clarification the Commission is considering extending the consultation started by the Green Paper to the specific aspect of financial compensations for public service obligations.
This could be done by submitting appropriate proposals for consultation.
In conclusion, I re-emphasise that the Commission will not draw any definitive conclusions in the area of services of general economic interest before it has presented its conclusions on the consultation on the Green Paper, which it intends to submit during the month of April, which is exactly what Parliament has requested.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start at the end.
Parliament has resolved to demand the creation of a legal framework under the codecision procedure and while respecting the principle of subsidiarity in connection with the implementation of the provisions on the internal market and competition and in relation to the compatibility of competition and the internal market with services of general interest.
We have called upon the Commission to present, by April at the latest â and we now hear that it will take all the time it has been given â a follow-up document, in which it will show what it has learned from the consultations on the Green Paper and make it clear where it stands on the possibility of a legal framework and what it proposes to do next.
That is our position where codecision, subsidiarity and adequate provision for services of general interest are concerned, and we will not accept anything to the contrary.
Secondly, we are so overwhelmingly in favour of the codecision procedure not only because it increases our influence, but also because services of general interest are a quite crucial issue for the public in terms of European politics, and because we want to do everything we can to prevent the public thinking of liberalisation, competition and the internal market as being in conflict with services of general interest and security of provision, and, instead, to try to get the two to work together.
We affirm that social cohesion is not excluded by competition, liberalisation and the internal market, but is, on the contrary, dependent on them and needs complementary measures.
That is why the way we handle services of general interest is closely tied in with public confidence in our policies on competition and the internal market and in Europeâs competences â and that is why we, the publicâs representatives in the citizensâ parliament, who have to deal with this permanent antithesis on a daily basis, want to be involved in deciding and determining what is to be done.
My next point is that it is important that the principle of subsidiarity be maintained in view of the differences involved â differences in definition from one Member State to another, differences in geographical situations, differences in the problems of demographics and those affecting social and health policy.
That is another reason why we are so strongly in favour of the European constitution, because the draft contained a formulation securing the principle of subsidiarity, one to which we can give our support.
There is something else I would like to touch on.
According to the constitution, the European Unionâs goal is the social market economy and social cohesion.
Treating services of general interest as not being the antithesis of competition and the internal market is what defines and gives life to the governing principle of the social market economy and creates social cohesion on that basis.
I stress the need both for potential service providers to be treated impartially and for there to be security of provision, the latter of which must be ensured even if aid payments are needed to do so.
The fact is that we need services of general interest only where the market is unable to guarantee these services on a universal basis, at affordable prices and to a high standard of quality.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I have to admit that I prefer to discuss foreign policy with you, because that is where your heart lies.
The fact is, though, that you have to take this opportunity too.
What I did not like about the statement you had to deliver, I think, was its failure to acknowledge that the present European social model is supported by a majority of this House.
A narrow majority perhaps, but still a majority.
I believe it is also supported by the majority of the European population, who see services of general interest as something different from the other goods and services that are on offer.
I believe that the basis for any consideration of services of general interest is the identification of the specific interests of the general public, and here I am certainly at one with MrÂ Karas.
In contrast to many other services, people can also help to determine, by the way they vote in elections, the range of services of general interest available to them, especially if these services are provided by or on behalf of regional or local authorities.
People want sufficient high-quality public services at a reasonable price.
The market may well be an instrument with which this aim can be achieved â I certainly do not rule that out â if its activity is governed by proper guidelines.
The basic guidelines would therefore have to be set by means of a legal act adopted jointly by the Council and Parliament.
That goes without saying, in my view, and the Commission must surely agree.
We can still discuss the precise details of the legal framework, but there must be a legal framework that takes account of the special nature of services of general interest and the needs they are designed to satisfy.
Our preferred option is, of course, the framework envisaged in the draft constitution.
Although we do not yet have a constitution, this is the direction in which we should be moving.
Far too many of our citizens are discovering that liberalisation â which, admittedly, is often accompanied by privatisation â is resulting in fragmentation of services.
I have heard, for example, that no fewer than 28 companies are operating on bus routes in the city of Manchester following deregulation.
All too often, the price cuts resulting from liberalisation are short-lived, and new monopolies frequently emerge â private monopolies, which are no better than public monopolies.
Indeed, they are worse, because they cannot be influenced at the ballot box.
I also believe that, in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity â of which you, in fact, wholeheartedly approve â the only thing we should ask of the Commission is that it create a legal framework for public services.
In all other respects, just as the clamour was once for freedom of thought, I would now appeal for freedom of structure, for the right of local and regional communities and authorities, which know best how to provide the services that people actually need, to structure public services as they see fit.
The Commission should commit itself to this approach.
Â Â  Mr President, we have on a number of occasions expressed our disagreement with the Commissionâs strategy concerning services of general interest.
It is unacceptable that it should continue to intervene in this area, thereby undermining the very existence of high-quality public services that are essential in combating poverty and in ensuring social inclusion and a high standard of living for the whole population.
What is urgently required, as we have proposed on many occasions, is a moratorium on liberalisation and a root and branch evaluation of the consequences of what has already been implemented in the various social and economic sectors, especially in terms of jobs, of the universality of the services provided, of client satisfaction and of making the functioning and management of services more democratic.
Firstly, however, the Commission must refrain from implementing measures that, in practical terms, may result in further erosion of quality public services in the various countries of the EU.
Â Â  â Mr President, I believe that in this debate our problem is not so much to reopen all the discussions we have held time and time again on the meaning and the nature of services of general interest, but to deal with the issue of security and the framework, and more precisely that of the democratic security and the democratic framework, within the context of the debate on services of general interest.
Todayâs speech, Commissioner Patten, has certainly been reassuring, but you will be aware that the same can be said of Commissioner Lamyâs speech, a month ago.
At that time we talked about discussion, about very rich consultation â three hundred contributions â we planned to carry out an analysis, we talked about options available to us, about the framework directive, the consensus within the Convention in favour of a European law.
And the Commission considered and considered âŠ
As for me, I have the feeling that in this way we are holding a form of debate which almost found its rhythm until the White Paper in April, while Commissioner Monti, during this time, has been presenting his âpackagesâ, in which he makes snap decisions on the issues and all of this without debate and without discussion.
I believe this is in unacceptable way of doing things, because the campaign for a democratic Europe, aimed at highlighting the added value of Community policies, is not going to be carried out by Mr Monti, but by us.
However, if Mr Monti wants to, let him, instead of us, wage the electoral campaign to defend the social Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, one month after the adoption of the Herzog report on services of general interest, which called for the setting up of a European legal framework, adopted by the codecision procedure, we are already totally confused, as can be seen from Philippe Herzogâs oral question.
The rapporteur has discovered, in effect, that at the same time the Commission, all by itself, using its own powers, has been preparing a regulation on the financial compensation from which services of general interest may benefit.
Today, the Commission has just half-admitted this, and has promised that it will await the outcome of the consultations on the Green Paper before taking any decision.
So much the better!
However, I would say to Mr Herzog that in the years to come you will see more of this sort of thing, and worse things too.
To put it simply, it was not necessary to meddle with the workings of the European legal framework. This concept, like that of the framework directive, is ambiguous, because nobody knows exactly what should go into it, from authorised subsidies to the definition of the service itself, via organisational principles, obligations and relations with service users.
Moreover, the concept of a legal framework which respects subsidiarity, which was invented by the European Parliament, is even more ambiguous, or even contradictory, because real subsidiarity in this matter would consist in admitting that public services, which are actually essential to life in our societies, must be defined, organised and managed at the closest possible level to the public within the national framework.
We need a single rule: each Member State should be free to decide on its own public services.
The corollary to this rule is that public service obligations should take priority over Community competition rules.
Â Â  Mr President, when I hear the discussion in this Chamber, I start to wonder what we are actually debating.
For two years, Parliament has been demanding more legal clarity, and Commissioner Monti wants to create legal clarity on key issues.
It is surely an illusion to believe that we can now suddenly enact the amendments envisaged in the Constitution on our own and bring competition law into line with the proposed article on the internal market.
The fact is, MrÂ Herzog, that we spent months discussing that, and you did not obtain a majority for your proposals.
You did not get majority support for the idea of rolling back sectoral liberalisation.
You did not obtain a majority for your renewed demands for a framework directive.
There was no majority behind your call for standardised European services of general interest.
Now you are touting these ideas all over again.
All I can say is that you either have no idea what Mr Monti is trying to do or you are seeking to overturn your defeat of four weeks ago.
I cannot conceive of any other reasons.
Mr Swoboda, as he said himself, is truly an expert on foreign affairs.
On matters of competition law, thoughÂ âÂ you would do better to keep a low profile MrÂ SwobodaÂ âÂ because you have not grasped the views of the House as reflected in the voting figures.
If we call for legal clarity, as we did, and Mr Monti presents a proposal â which takes full account of subsidiarity, MrsÂ Flautre â your objections leave me wondering what you actually want.
MrÂ Monti proposes that subsidies of less than EURÂ 15 million a year paid to businesses with an annual turnover of less than EURÂ 40 million should in future be the sole responsibility of the Member States.
If they no longer require approval, this surely means more freedom for the Member States.
This is the legal clarity we want.
I fail to understand the point of all the discussion here.
Approval need no longer be sought for the awarding of aid for housing construction and for hospitals.
I cannot fathom the debate here, because this is surely part of what we have been demanding.
For this reason, all I can say is that, if Mr Montiâs proposal as I understand it enters into force, it will do so on the basis of the EC Treaty in its present form, which empowers him to enact such legislation without submitting it to codecision.
He is acting to ensure that subsidiarity is strengthened, and he is acting to ensure that legal clarity will prevail in important areas by the end of the current legislative term of the European Parliament.
We do not want to give our blessing here to state aid for the likes of ElectricitÃ© de France or Volkswagen, but grants to small and medium-sized businesses, including regional grants, are to fall within the ambit of the Member States in future, and Mr Monti intends to open up that possibility.
Before we spend another three years debating a White Paper and framework legislation, he is making things happen.
I can only heartily welcome the fact that greater legal clarity will finally prevail in these matters before the end of this parliamentary term.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for straying away from your usual subjects in order to take an interest in the problem of services of general interest, which is so important to the citizens of Europe.
Following the completion of the consultations on the Green Paper, you reported on the general consensus on the need for clarification and legal clarity, as Mr Langen has just said.
However, has any consensus been reached on the need for democratic clarity mentioned by Mrs Flautre?
What Parliament was asking for in its resolution â and it did not, in fact, do so unanimously, as I think we would all agree â was that the interpretation of the Court of Justice or the Commission should not be the only prevailing interpretation with regard to clarification on the subject of acceptable state aids, or in order to define the correct interpretation of Article 86.
What we need is a debate, in the context of the codecision procedure, which will make it possible to carry out evaluations on a case-by-case basis, since it is true that everyone perceives the evidence as a function of his or her historical or national experience.
Thus as far as all services of general interest which are the responsibility of regional or local bodies are concerned, it is clear that it is not the task of the Community to intervene.
Do people realise, however, that in other countries, both Member States and third countries, the evidence may show that there are national public services which have operated very efficiently up to now?
Moreover, many people would consider, as regards the effects of liberalisation in areas such as rail transport â for example in a country with which you are familiar â or in areas like energy and electricity, that it is not entirely apparent that it is absolutely necessary to make competition rules alone the be all and end all of the system.
Nor is it apparent that the calculation of State aids and compensation, whether legitimate or not, should be made the subject of a debate.
We believe, therefore, that there should be a democratic debate.
Mr Langen and his friends very often quote Article 86(3) in order to prove that something is the responsibility of the Commission, but they fail to mention Article 86(2), which lays down that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition, in so far as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance, in law or in fact, of the particular tasks assigned to them.
It is this that is the subject of our discussions among ourselves, but it should also be the subject of a discussion between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on a sector-by-sector basis.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating Commissioner Monti, because I believe he is looking after the rights of consumers and of the citizens of Europe, and they are entitled to obtain a decent quality of service and, more importantly, to obtain it at a reasonable price.
One of the fundamental defining characteristics of services of general interest is that they are subject to a transparent public tendering procedure.
I believe there is still a great deal of confusion here between liberalisation and privatisation.
I believe that liberalisation offers a fair framework for competition.
In Sweden, for example, we have seen that many towns and cities, often administered by one and the same political party, compete with each other in a bid to provide the best possible services and that a town or municipal administration offering the best deal to the public, to the consumer, is awarded the franchise to provide its services in other towns and cities too.
In public tendering procedures, it is possible to specify quite precisely what is wanted.
If, for example, a railway service is being put out to tender, a public authority can say that there will be three people at six in the morning, twelve at ten oâclock in the morning and three again at midnight.
Good and appropriate tender specifications can then be drawn up for the service from A to B. I am also in favour of public resources being used here, because we are all in favour of the social component of government activity.
We want to ensure that services of general interest are accessible to people who have no driving licence or who have financial problems, mobility problems or other disadvantages.
I have to say, though, that liberalisation and fair competition are one track, while privatisation is a second track.
I would ask that we try to avoid confusing the two and focus here on the systematic pursuit of the strategy of free competition.
In this context I should like to congratulate Commissioner Monti once again for organising his proposal along these very lines.
It goes without saying that city councils and public administrations which provide services of general interest will have to compete with our small and medium-sized enterprises.
This is why public bodies put services out to tender.
At the present time, two out of every three employees works for a small or medium-sized enterprise.
There are 18 million businesses here that can bid for a franchise to provide public services for the benefit of consumers.
The small and medium-sized businesses pay 80% of total tax revenue; in other words, they ultimately provide the money that enables us to afford these social services in the general public interest.
For this reason I believe that the term âsocial economyâ, which was once in common use, is inappropriate, as is our German term , literally âsubsistence provisionâ, which is commonly used to translate âservices of general interestâ.
What we want is the best service for our citizens.
That can only be provided in the framework of fair competition.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to take this opportunity to say that I share the opinion that the market and free competition are important values.
In this area, however, as in many others, we should not be fundamentalists, fanatics, or, if you will, ayatollahs, which, as we shall see in the forthcoming debate on Iran, is the worst-case scenario.
Yet it strikes me, Commissioner, that this is precisely what the Commission is increasingly becoming, and in an increasing number of fields.
I should like to give you an example: the Commission has just begun legal action against Greece for insisting that those who serve on coasting vessels in their islands must speak Greek.
This is absolutely ridiculous, Commissioner.
I should like to remind you that, very recently, only a few years ago, many dozens of Portuguese seamen lost their jobs on Norwegian routes just because they did not speak Norwegian, in spite of the fact that Norway is also required to abide by the laws of free competition.
Though it pained me, I felt obliged to accept the reason given, namely that of safety.
It is absolutely essential that crews serving on ships, especially on island routes, must be able to speak the language of the country concerned.
In taking legal action against the Greek islands â which is similar to the action it has taken in other parts of Europe â the Commission has displayed an utterly fanatical attitude; it has shown that it has no idea how far to go with free competition, nor does it know where safety â or other extremely important values â should begin and end.
The Commission lacks a sense of proportion and common sense and should take firm steps to remedy this state of affairs.
Â Â  â Mr President, first of all, in reply to Mr Langen, I would say this.
With your usual vehemence you are concealing your own failure, because I would remind you that you renounced your own resolution of 2001, which was in favour of a framework directive, and in January you were forced to accept the fact that we were reiterating our demand for a legislative act by means of the codecision procedure.
Do not try, then, to conceal your failure.
Mr Patten, you are a diplomat and you know the meaning of words.
You talked about confusion.
Yet where is that confusion, when the Commission, in its Green Paper, is completely vague on the fundamental issue of funding, and when now, just a few weeks before the end of the debate, it tells us that it is now going to organise consultations on funding?
Where is the confusion?
Where is transparency?
Where is democracy?
The only thing that we ask of you is not to organise consultations on financial compensation today, but to produce a text which corresponds to the demands of civil society and of the European Parliament. The present text, which you will be presenting to the Commission in three daysâ time, does not correspond to those demands.
You also talked about certainty, legal certainty.
That is all well and good, but there is a misunderstanding here.
In effect, the Monti text will improve legal certainty in the sense that the rules will be clearer, but they have also been tightened up as regards the financial compensation which is the subject of this text.
There will be greater certainty, but in the final analysis there will be fewer possibilities for funding public services.
That is the content.
Do not try to deceive us about the content.
You talk about exemptions.
All services of general economic interest are social in nature.
Those which did not need to provide notification will be obliged to do so.
At this very moment the social housing organisations are in the process of indicating to the Commission that the Commission will be obliging them to notify what was not notified previously.
So much for making things more certain.
Finally, will you please indicate, especially in the White Paper, whether or not you will now agree to prepare a legal act via the codecision procedure.
It is, after all, an elementary principle of good democracy to answer yes or no after so many years.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr Herzog.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2004) by Mr Perry, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Commission, on the implementation of Directive 73/239/EEC by the UK between 1978 and 2001.
Â Â  Mr President, as we debate, yet again, this issue of the regulation of Lloyd's of London, 63 names are currently facing bankruptcy proceedings against them in the English courts.
This is not an abstract issue to them, nor is it a matter that has long since been resolved.
It is a very real issue and one that will continue to be of serious moment for years to come.
Those 63 people did not become names under the present regulatory regime, but in the pre-2001 period.
The losses that they are now faced with and that are, seemingly, forcing them into bankruptcy, occurred under the regulatory regime enforced between 1978 and 2001.
Those 63, the petitioners to this Parliament, and thousands of other names from many European countries have one simple question, the question put in our resolution of last September and reiterated today: did the United Kingdom, between 1978 and 2001 implement, fully and correctly, Directive 73/239/EEC relating to Lloyd's?
This question has been put to Parliament by petitioners.
It is a legitimate question.
We have put it repeatedly to the Commission.
The Commission, so far, seems strangely reluctant to answer it.
The dossier presented to Parliament in December in response to our resolution of September 2003 is totally inadequate and conspicuously fails to offer any answer to that central question.
Commissioner Bolkestein, who launched two sets of infringement proceedings against the UK Government over the regulation of Lloyd's, regularly tells us that his responsibility is only to bring a Member State into compliance.
That is right, but only in part. He has other responsibilities as well.
Life would be simpler for us all if there was only one responsibility.
That is never the case.
Allow me to remind the Commission that it has a Treaty obligation, under Article 197, to answer questions posed by Parliament.
That Article is not there to allow clever sophistry, like the question once posed in an Oxford University admission interview, which asked: 'Is this a proper question?', to which the smart-Alec reply is, 'Yes, if this is a proper answer.'
That may well do in a university interview, but not in Parliament.
If a non-reply was sufficient, there would be no point in having the Treaty obligation in Article 197.
Citizens have a Treaty right to petition Parliament about whether rules are being respected.
The Commission has a Treaty responsibility to ensure that EU rules and directives are properly respected.
Parliament has a Treaty right to have its questions properly answered.
I can only assume that, for reasons unknown to me, the Commission finds it embarrassing to answer this question.
Clearly the British Government is acutely embarrassed and I find it shaming, as an Englishman, that the British Government is being so secretive in this case that it ordered the withdrawal of all British responses from the file the Commission released to Parliament.
What on earth does it have to hide?
The Commission should not aid it in this secrecy or become complicit in it.
When this petition was put to the Commission, I believe the Commission behaved correctly.
It investigated the petitioners' complaints.
It was clearly not satisfied with the situation and sent a detailed questionnaire to the British Government.
Although this House has never been allowed to see the responses, it is obvious that the Commission was still not satisfied, since it launched infringement proceedings.
Subsequently it launched further, separate infringement proceedings covering the regulatory regime post-2001.
The Commission now judges that the current regime is in compliance.
Well, it knows the facts and we do not, so we cannot comment at this moment on that.
But the Commission's satisfaction with the post-2001 regime does not take away our right to ask the Commission about the regulatory regime prior to 2001, nor the Commission's responsibility to answer us.
The EU has to be based on a system of rules and laws.
There cannot be a pick-and-choose system.
Policy-holders of Lloyd's have a right and need to know whether the solvency rules were being respected.
People who invested in Lloyd's names also have that right.
As one said to me, we had a right to assume the rules on solvency were being respected and that we were not operating, as it were, in the Wild West, where rules could be ignored.
If the Commission persists in refusing to give a clear answer to this House, we have a major difference about the interpretation of Article 197 of the Treaty and a major interinstitutional problem.
In my opinion Parliament would need to refer this to the European Court of Justice for resolution under Article 232 of the Treaty.
Under that Article, if Parliament believes the Commission has failed to act, under the obligations imposed upon it by the Treaty, then the ECJ can be called upon to give a ruling.
I hope that this afternoon the Commissioner, whom I greatly respect, as indeed I do Commissioner Bolkestein, will now at long last give us a straight answer to a straight question.
Did the United Kingdom between 1978 and 2001 implement fully and correctly Directive 73/239/EEC?
Yes or no?
Â Â  . Mr President, may I say straight away that while I recognise that there is some disagreement between the Commission and the honourable Member on this enormously important matter, we recognise the exemplary diligence with which he has pursued an issue of considerable importance to so many people.
He has pursued the case with great conscientiousness and I am sure he has and should enjoy the gratitude of a large number of Lloyd's names.
Let me say a few words on the background to this very complex issue.
As the House knows, following several petitions to the European Parliament complaining about the United Kingdom regulation and the supervision of the Lloyd's market and a number of individual complaints, the Commission decided to open infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom in December 2001.
As a result of these proceedings, the United Kingdom changed the legal framework for the supervision and regulation of Lloyd's, which is now governed by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.
After issuing a supplementary letter of formal notice in January 2003, whose purpose was to clarify the concrete functioning of the new regime, the Commission concluded in October 2003 that all aspects of the Lloyd's regime under examination now comply with the requirements of the relevant European Union insurance directives.
More specifically, in a press release issued on 15 October 2003, the Commission confirmed the compatibility of the regulatory and supervisory regime for Lloyd's, as established under the Financial Service and Markets Act, with the requirements of Articles 8(1)(e), 13(2) and (3), 15(1), 16(1), 19(1) and 19(2) of Directive 73/239/EEC, as amended.
As regards the regime applicable to Lloyd's prior to the entry into force of the Financial Services and Markets Act, the Commission has consistently maintained, in full accordance with ECJ case law, that the objective of infringement proceedings under European Union law is to establish or restore the compatibility of existing national law with European Union law and to rule on the possible past incompatibility of national law, which has been in the meantime brought into compliance with European law.
I think my honourable friend would accept that the Ombudsman agrees with the legal interpretation that I have set out and that we have set out in the past.
To borrow from my honourable friend's anecdote about the examination question at a university with which I am familiar, I would only ask whether this is a proper answer and would say that it is a proper answer if you want an answer that is in compliance with the relevant case law.
In its resolution of 25 September 2003, Parliament called for access to the Commission's file under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 â that is under the general public access provisions â and for a Commission statement on the compatibility of Lloyd's regulation and supervision in the period 1978 to 2001 â that is before the implementation of the 2000 Act.
Since the infringement proceedings had in the meantime been closed, the College of Commissioners mandated my colleague and friend, Commissioner Bolkestein, to forward the relevant documents to President Cox, and this was done by letter dated 15 December 2003.
As regards the assessment of the UK's former regime, the Commission's views are detailed in the first letter of formal notice, sent in December 2001, which is part of the file forwarded to Parliament.
Following the UK Government's reply which indicated the entry into force of the 2000 Act in December 2001, the Commission's inquiry dealt exclusively with the new United Kingdom regime.
Therefore, since the regime, which was applicable between 1978 and 2001, no longer applies, the Commission sees no scope for further action.
Let me repeat that I recognise the dedication with which my honourable friend has pursued this matter and I am sorry that, for the reasons which I have adduced, I am not able to give him on this occasion a reply which will, I suspect, satisfy him wholly or in part.
Â Â  Mr President, I have known Mr Perry for some time in this Parliament â and I consider him one of my best friends â and I have followed the issue he raised in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market with very real interest.
But having examined the case, I have no choice but to agree with what Mr Patten just said.
That is to say, in the infringement procedure, the Commission is not the Court of Justice, but an agent of Community law which tries to ensure that the law is applied, by demanding that the State comply with Community legislation.
And in this case, I believe that the Commission has done that, although perhaps rather belatedly.
The result of an infringement procedure, once the State in question has complied with Community law, is the closure of the case, because â as Mr Patten has also said â there is a repeated judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities according to which there is no case for infringement when the State in question has complied with Community law.
I believe that Mr Perry has a laudable interest in the Community institutions functioning properly and, of course, it would be desirable for us all to do the same with all the directives that are not transposed by the Member States.
What does not work here is a mechanism of fines and penalties imposed by the Commission.
The Commission does not have those powers.
Only the Court of Justice should have them and, specifically, I would refer Mr Perry to British law.
Continental administrative law allows a State to be called to account for non-compliance with its obligations, including, for example, the failure to transpose a Community directive in time.
But I have the impression that the procedure which is being tried here is not going to lead anywhere, because I do not see how the Commission, at any point, is going to be able to invoke non-compliance with a Community directive in the past on the part of the State in order to call them to account.
From a legal point of view, that mechanism does not exist.
In other words, given that Mr Perry is probably completely right to be concerned about compliance with Community legislation and acknowledging that there has probably been harm done to individuals, the judicial procedure is not that of reiteration of the action by the Commission â which has fulfilled its obligations â but, if necessary, an internal British administrative procedure in the event that, in accordance with British law, individuals have been prejudiced by the failure to transpose a Community directive in time.
I therefore believe that the Commission, at this time, has fully complied with its obligations and we in the European Parliament cannot demand that it act in any other way.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his very careful reply, which he relates very much to this particular question, the issue of Lloyd's. I should like to think of this in terms of two very general principles: firstly, the implementation of legislation by Member States and action by the Commission to ensure that that happens; secondly, the entitlement to information between Parliament and the Commission during such enforcement measures.
I should also like to apply some common sense to those two principles.
Looking with common sense at how this particular matter proceeded, one cannot but feel that something is not quite right, that there is a period of 20 years when nothing seems to happen and no implementation takes place.
I am sorry, Commissioner, that your colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein is not here.
I know that he shares our deep concern about implementation of legislation by Member States and making sure that it happens effectively so that the internal market, of which we are all so proud, works properly.
However, if it takes a Member State over 20 years to implement a directive, and a Member State can carry on without doing that for such a long period of time, then common sense tells us that something is not right.
I am greatly concerned â as I am sure others are â about the message that this sends out to acceding states on the eve of enlargement concerning the way we conduct our business and the way we expect Member States to adhere to Community law.
It is all very well to say that there is no past incompatibility.
As a lawyer, that sounds to me like a very nice, lawyer's answer.
What we are looking for here are common sense answers and an answer to the question as to why a Member State can be so long in default and why it is that we, as Parliament, cannot get a simple answer to a simple question about that.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by dealing with the allegation contained in Mr Perry's report that directives have not been implemented.
That seems to have been accepted in this House.
However, that assertion and allegation have not been proven.
Mr Bolkestein has on many occasions â both to the committee and to this House â indicated that he could not look at past regimes: he could only rule if current law was compatible.
Some of us heard that, but others failed to hear it.
If there is alleged past failure, then the place to seek redress is in the national courts.
This has been played before the national courts on many occasions, and the judgments have gone against the plaintiffs.
Indeed, at the moment before the English High Court there is a case of alleged breach of statutory duty against Her Majesty's Treasury and the Secretary-of-State for the Department of Trade and Industry.
Yet Mr Perry calls for documents which the UK Government has sent to the Commission, whilst failing to recognise that those same documents may form part of its defence.
Any defence has to present its case before the relevant court.
Equally, I have learnt, from being a member of the Committee on Petitions, that one of the petitioners is about to bring a case before the Court of Justice.
Let me refer now to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
There is a degree of ignorance or naivety that appals me.
Parliamentarians do not have to refer to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 in order to gain access to documents.
There is an interinstitutional framework agreement for parliamentary access.
But, if anyone were to read that Regulation, he would see that the infringement proceedings are a particular exception under Article 4.
Let me just refer to something Mr Perry said.
All of us in public life must be consistent in the application of principle.
Mr Perry said that he finds it shaming that the UK Government was so secretive that it undertook the withdrawal of documents.
What does it have to hide?
This morning I was in the STOA Panel discussing and voting on a study on inedibles in food product packaging.
Mr Perry voted for the suppression of a public document.
I fail to understand that.
We must be consistent in the application of principle.
The Commission has met its obligations.
If Parliament wants to go down the cul-de-sac to the Court of Justice, let Parliament prove itself foolish.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
- B5-0080/2004 by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the elections in Iran;
- B5-0083/2004 by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the general elections in Iran;
- B5-0084/2004 by Pedro Marset Campos and Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the elections in Iran;
- B5-0088/2004 by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, Anna Karamanou, Jannis Sakellariou, Johannes (Hannes) Swoboda and Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the political situation in Iran prior to the parliamentary elections on 20 February 2004;
- B5-0094/2004 by Michael Gahler, Arie M. Oostlander, Bernd Posselt, Lennart SacrÃ©deus and Ilkka Suominen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the parliamentary elections in Iran;

- B5-0099/2004 by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the parliamentary elections in Iran.
Â Â  Mr President, as the parliamentary rapporteur on Iran, I should like to emphasise the cross-party disquiet about political developments there in the run-up to the elections.
Representatives of the two largest groups and of one of the other groups in this House recently paid separate visits to Iran.
I can see that the groups are largely in agreement in their assessments of the current situation and in the political conclusions they have drawn.
Sadly, we are compelled to note that the process of democratisation has received a severe setback, in that this forthcoming election will be less democratic than the previous one.
The President and the majority of members of the Parliament in Tehran agree that this cannot be regarded as a free and fair election.
We share their view.
The electorate, whose frustration is so deep that they are not even supporting the reformers, are likely to vote with their feet and stay at home on election day.
This really benefits no one, not even the usual suspects in Iran, although they are delighted and are already canvassing European governments to do business with them and forget the reformers.
I have to ask the Commission whether, in view of this setback, it simply plans to turn its attention to other matters.
On behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let me say that we must now intensify our political contacts with the Iranian institutions but also with all the political forces and civil society in Iran.
We must not only talk to those in the reformist camp; it is also particularly important that we seek dialogue â and it will be a difficult dialogue â with those who exercise power in the judiciary and in the Council of Guardians and make it clear to them that, if they continue to pursue their present policies, they will make poor use of their countryâs potential, obstruct progress towards a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the EU and, above all, thwart the hopes and expectations of the Iranian people.
Also, any sustained attempt to govern against the people is doomed to failure, as events of recent decades in this world have shown.
That is why I make this appeal to those who hold power in Iran: change; turn about, before it is too late.
Perhaps you can indeed put the domestic dialogue back on track, so as to foster the growth of democracy in Iran.
Â Â  â The ayatollahs on the Council of Guardians are doing everything they can to hold on to their religious, political and economic power.
Their exclusive power to interpret the Koran is constantly being abused for political ends.
They block everything that does not appeal to them or that could impinge on their own position of power.
They have now vetoed more than a third of the laws adopted by the parliament.
More than 2Â 500 reform-minded candidates have now been excluded from the elections, including around 80Â sitting MPs.
Whilst large sectors of society, young people in particular, want modernisation and freedom, the hard core in power is clinging to medieval ideas and repressive practices.
The younger generation constitutes the vast majority of the population in Iran.
In addition, even many former revolutionaries have become disillusioned by the clergyâs abuse of power.
PresidentÂ Khatami himself calls the exclusion of candidates a threat to the nation and the system.
The conflict between reformers and conservative clergymen is increasingly coming to a head.
If nothing is done about it, it seems that it is only a matter of time before the situation boils over, with everything that entails.
The human rights and democratic situation in Iran is still extremely worrying.
Unless substantial improvements are made, the European Union will not be able to form a partnership.
It is highly debatable whether it is actually still advisable to continue to negotiate.
What is Commissioner Pattenâs opinion on this?
Does he still see prospects for partnership with Iran now that the situation is deteriorating so dramatically?
Nor is the human rights dialogue with Iran of any great account, as I know from personal experience.
It will not make things any better if the parliamentary elections turn out to be a farce.
The European Union must not lend itself to a dialogue that is used as a pretext for not actually carrying out any reforms.
Iran is a potentially rich country with an ancient civilisation, and has the potential to play an extremely important, constructive role in the region.
It will not become a new civilisation, however, whilst the ayatollahs continue to abuse their unrestricted power, but will instead be doomed to remain an international pariah.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, today in Iran the conflict between conservatives and reformists threatens once again to throw an entire nation of this great Middle East into obscurantism and fundamentalism, into a pernicious and despairing arbitrariness.
More than ever, therefore, and certainly more than in the past, our Community institutions must make their presence and influence felt among the conflicting forces in the Iranian Parliament, in President Khatamiâs Participation Front and in Ayatollah Khameneiâs Guardian Council, in order to defend the universality of the values of the rule of law, democracy and human rights.
These fundamentals should serve as a basis for negotiations and exchanges between the two factions, without which there is a risk of ending up with a State in which there is no rule of law, and to push that State or to push the cohesion of Iranian society and the geopolitics of this tormented region towards even worse scenarios.
The time has come to defuse the Council of Guardianâs attempts to disqualify reformist parliamentary candidates in the forthcoming general elections.
In effect, the acknowledged absence of democratic rules and procedural transparency will end up discrediting the political rulers and encouraging their rejection.
Those rulers have already succumbed to the suppression of freedoms, including freedom of expression, and they are the cause of the failure of economic and social development.
To suppress all the democratic aspirations of the people of Iran, who are already worn down by years of war and revolution, would be to snuff out their last hopes and ideals, leaving the way open to despairing ideologies and extremisms.
The mobilisation of the European Union must be a matter of priority and it must be committed and pro-active, and must engage decision makers and all social categories or categories of activity.
Any withdrawal, any ostracism on the part of foreign diplomats, would strengthen the retrograde and destabilising forces in a region of the Middle East which is as far from us in geographical terms as it is geo-politically sensitive in our view.
Any argument in favour of severing cultural links between Europe and the Middle East should also be rejected.
The creation of a special parliamentary delegation to Iran proves this, the signing of the additional protocol on safety controls for nuclear materials confirms it, and the preliminary discussions between the European Union and Iran on human rights should convince us of it.
These first signs must support and encourage the European Unionâs approach to the Iranian authorities with a view to sending, right now, a party of observers to examine the electoral process and cooperating, right now, in judicial reforms and in the control of drug trafficking.
At the present time, history is being made in Iran, and Brussels has learned enough from Munich in the past to be aware that it cannot refuse to make its voice heard now in Tehran.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Europe and the United States of America have long been striving to achieve considerable influence over developments in Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan.
That influence often produces results quite different from those that had been expected.
Muslim fundamentalists in Afghanistan and Saddam Husseinâs regime in Iraq owed their survival not so long ago to support from the West against others.
In Iran, too, attempts were made for a long time to keep allies in power when their position was contested.
Fifty years ago, the Mossadeq government was ousted as it was considered that it was too left-wing and that it could conceivably have entered into cooperation with Iranâs neighbours to the north, which were still part of the Soviet Union.
An authoritarian ruler, the Shah, returned to power, but he proceeded to make ever more enemies in his own country on account of his lust for power and his neglect of his people.
Whilst left-wing nationalism and socialism had no opportunity to constitute an alternative, a medieval variant of Islam was given renewed opportunities to organise popular resistance.
Twenty-five years ago, a popular uprising put an end to a regime that had always sought military and economic cooperation with the West.
The outside world has never trusted the new authorities.
Following a few years of great enthusiasm, social policy and democratic experiments, this regime, too, incurred hatred within the country.
The sizeable younger generation wants an end to the exclusion of politicians whose views differ from those of the conservative clergy, to restrictive rules for women, to the expulsion of students, and to the frequent hanging, stoning or amputation of body parts of those who do not fit into the world view of the authorities.
Many people have fled the tyranny, often to Europe.
Nevertheless, in recent years, Europe, motivated by economic interests, has been making overtures to this regime.
The United States was hesitant, but seemed to be doing the same after Iran suffered the earthquake in Bam and showed readiness to have its nuclear projects inspected.
In 2002, a part of the opposition standing up for the rights and freedoms that we take for granted in Europe was placed on a list of terrorist organisations.
That increased the confidence of the real authorities in stopping earlier initiatives for democratisation and normalisation.
Excluding the most critical candidates reversed the political composition of the parliament from the outset, turning the large majority into a small minority.
My group hopes that Europe will learn from this and take the side of the Iranian people and their resistance organisations from now on.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a clear signal from Tehran is always welcome, and yesterday PresidentÂ Khatami gave one personally.
In a speech on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Iranâs Islamic revolution, the Head of State levelled particularly sharp criticism at the exclusion of a whole host of reform-minded candidates from the parliamentary elections on 20Â February.
PresidentÂ Khatami said â and my colleague MrÂ vanÂ denÂ Bos has also said this â that elections are a symbol of democracy.
The President then warned that âif this [right] is restricted, itâs a threat to the nation and the systemâ.
His message to the conservative forces in the Islamic republic is unmistakable.
Their repressive actions are destabilising both State and society.
Public bitterness is already great and will only increase.
What is the lesson that the European Parliament should draw from these unfair elections for the Iranian parliament, the Majlis?
If it turns out that the vast majority of the new Majlis consists of arch-conservative, even radical Islamists, we should not set any store by close relations.
âA sheer waste of taxes,â a German Iran specialist, who is also a voter, commented to me an hour ago.
I think that this is spot on.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when a delegation from our parliamentary group recently visited Iran, we were actually surprised at the degree of discussion that took place there as well as at the willingness to engage in dialogue which was shown by the many young women who constitute the majority of the student population in Iran.
Yes, the majority of university and college students are women.
It is probably this very situation that prompted the Council of Guardians to curb and nullify the potential effects of what we, from our perspective, see as an encouraging development.
If we talk today about the elections in Iran, it would be quite legitimate for anyone to say that Iran should take its own decision and to ask why we are interfering.
I would say yes, Iran â that is to say the population of Iran â should decide for itself.
That, however, is precisely what the Council of Guardians wants to prevent.
It is not a matter of reformers or non-reformers.
If the non-reformers are elected, we shall have to live with that.
The point is that the Council of Guardians operates a selection process from the outset to determine who is allowed to stand for election, and it is this very selection process that prevents the Iranian people from deciding freely.
Such elections cannot produce a truly legitimate freely elected Parliament because of the way in which candidates are preselected.
We in the European Union have no option but to press for the most important changes that are needed in Iran, whatever happens at the polls.
I am thinking here of the death penalty.
The present moratorium on stoning, a particularly barbaric form of execution, must be scrupulously observed and even enshrined in a legal instrument.
I am thinking of the ratification of the Additional Protocol to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which will probably be a matter for the new Parliament.
Whoever is elected, we must press a clear case for ratification.
I am also thinking of the situation in the Middle East, where we need Iranian support.
Let there be no shortage of criticism â unsparing criticism â of these conditions in Iran.
At the same time, the Commission will no doubt also have to work to ensure that all the main aspects of Iranian conduct in the Middle East are conducive to peace in the region.
Be that as it may, the fact remains that we cannot but roundly condemn the approach adopted by the Council of Guardians.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I also took part in the visit to Iran.
I am thankful that Iran is seeking dialogue and cooperation.
It has made us Europeans an offer, which came from the Supreme National Security Council, for the creation of a joint commission to engage in a bilateral Euro-Iranian dialogue centred on the fight against drugs.
At the present time, Iran has about two million drug addicts, along with some eight million occasional drug users.
These are very high numbers in a country with a population of 60 million.
The bulk of drugs leaving the region currently goes to America, but we can expect Europe to be targeted soon for a massive wave of drug smuggling.
This is why I am particularly grateful that the head of the Supreme National Security Council has made an offer to the European Union to work with him and his organisation to stop this flow of drugs from the war lords in Afghanistan.
The second offer, for another bilateral commission which would engage in a joint effort to combat terrorism, is one which, in my view, we should not refuse, likewise the offer made by the judiciary to cooperate with the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg in order to accelerate the training of Iranian judges in this field as well as simply to show them the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems.
This should be put at the heart of our bilateral relations.
Similarly, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the promotion of cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises in Iran and those in the European Union, is a means of strengthening democracy.
I believe that the business contacts in this domain could point the way to more fruitful cooperation in the domain of dialogue and democracy.
Another point of particular importance to Europe, of course, is partnership in the domain of energy.
Security of energy supplies is the issue of the future.
Â Â  Mr President, Iran is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Islamic revolution in a state of deep political crisis, with thousands of progressive candidates having been excluded from the imminent elections and with millions of Iranians who voted in favour of the reforms wondering where the country is heading.
The extent of the exclusions also includes numerous important women who played a leading part in the legislative reforms and, as a result, the position of women is further deteriorating in Iran.
These are women with whom we have cooperated constructively within the framework of the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights.
Elections are a symbol of democracy only when they are conducted properly, to quote President Khatami.
Nonetheless, it would appear that above President Khatami and the democratically elected representatives of the people stands the all powerful Revolutionary Council, which is endeavouring to deprive the parliament which will come out of the elections on 20 February of any democratic voice or powers of reform.
It is known that of all the bills voted for by parliament in 2000, over one-third were not ratified by the Council.
It is a fact that Iran, a country with a long history and an important geopolitical position, can play a strategic role in the stability of the area, especially in relation to Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, I fear that efforts by the hard core to bend the will of the Iranian people may result not only in a parliament which has no democratic legitimacy, but also in the weakening of Iran's international position.
Without doubt, Iran's basic problem is its power structure.
No reform efforts and no progress with respect for human rights can be made while the Islamic Revolutionary Guards show disdain for the decisions taken under democratic procedures.
The recent moratorium on stoning must be converted to legislation which will put an end to this horrific punishment.
And I should like to take this opportunity to add something else. I hope that Iran will include women in the teams which it sends to Athens to represent it at the 2004 Olympic Games.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am incredibly disappointed with the joint motion for a resolution.
It should be crystal clear that President Khatamiâs decision to call a general election in February has crushed any hope of his intending to implement reforms in Iran.
In Iran, the critical dialogue has clearly been interpreted in such a way as to convey the impression that we in the EU are now better placed to understand and accept their oppressive regime.
When will the EU realise that this dialogue is a farce?
Is there nothing being done by the hierocracy in Iran that can make us take seriously our own much trumpeted values of democracy and human rights and, let it be said, act in accordance with them?
What, moreover, do we do on the day that Iranâs mullahs export their regime to Iraq?
The EU should now support those forces that really want to see a pluralist and democratic Iran.
At the moment, it is the resistance movements, for example the Mujahedin, that, in order to please the Iranian Government, the United States and the EU have added to their list of terrorists, even though they have never attacked civilians.
As a first step, the EU should ensure that members of the Mujahedin are not handed over to Iran and certain death, and it should, as quickly as possible, see to it that they are removed from the EUâs list of terrorists and support their demand for a referendum in Iran.
Â Â  MrÂ President, anyone with an interest in democracy is seriously concerned about the recent political developments in Iran.
There is the risk that the banning of reform-minded MPs from fighting the elections will result in a huge abstention rate, particularly among young people.
This is the only way for them to express their disillusionment.
They fear more than ever that they will become victims of the backward-oriented forces.
The constant flagrant undermining of the reform-minded forces constitutes a threat to a new revolutionary movement.
Furthermore, Iran is running the risk of further isolating itself at international level.
This is particularly worrying with regard to the conflicts in the Middle East region.
Given its location, Iran is making the Middle East more vulnerable than ever.
In the short term, the European Union should bring all diplomatic channels to bear in an attempt to induce the regime in Iran to reconsider the exclusion of reform-minded MPs from the elections.
This should be made a condition for giving the existing cooperation between the European Union and Iran new impetus in areas of mutual interest.
Apart from that, the European Union should lose no time in developing new initiatives aimed at cutting off the drug route between Iran and Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Iran is a great country with a glorious past.
I also believe it to be one of the most sophisticated Middle Eastern societies, with an inherent tendency towards progress and modernity.
Perhaps its fundamentalist Islamic revolution will be seen, with the passage of time, as a blip in the curve of its traditionally long historic record of advancement.
It is precisely for this reason that at this critical juncture of the ongoing power struggle, the EU must maintain open supportive dialogue with both the government and the reformists, and in particular with the modernisers within the government.
We have already seen the welcome suspension of the barbaric medieval punishment of female lapidation for adultery, and Iran has now agreed to sign the NPT Additional Protocol to put a stop to its covert nuclear weapons programme, now fully out in the open after the confessions of Abdul Qadeer Khan in Pakistan.
Ultimately, democracy too will prevail and the mullahs of the Council of Guardians will hopefully return to their intended spiritual and pastoral role.
Â Â  Mr President, surely no one can be in any doubt that the illusion of democracy in Iran is dead and that only a complete overhaul of the political system will one day enable democracy in Iran to flourish again.
At this juncture I should like to join with Mrs SandbÃŠk in calling for dialogue to take place with the opposition, and not with the religious hierarchy, with those who head the criminal regime that oppresses Iran.
Most urgently, the Mujahedin currently in Iraq should be removed from the terrorist list and should not be extradited to Iran.
It is through dialogue with those who genuinely want democracy, with secular forces, that we will be able to see the situation change towards democracy in this most important of countries, as all those here recognise.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Islamic Council of Guardians operates as an unelected organisation consisting of Islamic theologians whose task it is, in accordance with Islamic principles, to preserve the heritage of the revolution of 25 years ago.
The issue is that of whether this Council of Guardians does not instead discredit religion in itself, the role of priests and theologians in society and what is, in this case, the entirely dominant religion, namely Shiâite Islam.
These are the consequences for the Islamic revolution in Iran of the activities of the Council of Guardians, of the legislation they have promoted and of other legislation they have prevented.
We Europeans and members of the European Union must state that, if people have the right to vote, they should have the right to stand as candidates.
It is completely unacceptable for theologians to be able to prohibit people from both voting and standing as candidates.
Â Â  Mr President, Iran makes us face up to our own contradictions.
It is undoubtedly, as Mr Tannock has said, a great country with a prestigious past.
It is also a potentially rich country, which has oil, and it has shown its willingness to return to the international fold by abandoning its military nuclear programme and adopting a moratorium on the death penalty.
Iran is strategically important because it has a border with Afghanistan and another with Iraq.
In short, Iran is essential to us and yet, within a month, it has destroyed our hopes of seeing it make progress in terms of democracy.
On the eve of the countryâs parliamentary elections, the conservativesâ coup dâÃ©tat is succeeding. Only fifteen of the reformist parliamentary candidates who were disqualified have been reinstated by the Revolutionary Council.
The provincial governors who had threatened to resign will not do so.
President Khatami will not resign.
The students will not protest and the EU Member States, sensing a change in the wind, will not declare themselves to be frankly hostile to neo-conservatives who, they think, will distance themselves from religious fundamentalism.
The result is that complete hypocrisy reigns.
I ask you, Commissioner, are we too going to close our eyes, in the name of economic and geopolitical interests, to this serious attack on human rights which is shattering the hopes of so many Iranian men and women, and what will be our attitude as regards the cooperation agreement?
Â Â  . Mr President, I am sure that most Members of Parliament would agree that it is crucial to try to develop a long-term and constructive relationship between the European Union and Iran.
Why?
First, as Mr Tannock said, Iran is a great pre-Islamic civilisation; one in which we in the West have occasionally meddled in ways that were not always â to put it mildly â very well judged.
Second, Iran is an enormously important regional player.
One only has to look at its neighbourhood to see how important it is and to recognise that we cannot have a credible policy for the wider Middle East that does not embrace and include Iran.
Thirdly â and I feel this very strongly â we see in Iran, in my judgment, the first stirrings of genuine Islamic democracy.
Indeed, for the hard-line conservatives, that is the problem.
I happen to think that demography is strongly on the side of democracy in Iran.
However, the theologians, who are seeking to block progress, are not the first theologians we have seen â even in our own European experience â who have not been wholly in favour of democracy and the advancement of civil liberties.
I will come back to that later.
Because of the significance of Iran, I have favoured â as the European Union has favoured â a constructive, tough-minded engagement with that country.
That has taken a number of forms.
We have tried to develop a political dialogue, which most recently has focused on our understandable concerns about whether Iran's nuclear ambitions for energy have turned into nuclear ambitions for military purposes.
We were concerned by the IAEA reports last summer and autumn.
We are pleased at the progress that has been made following the visit of the three European Union foreign ministers to Tehran, but we will now be watching for Dr El Baradei's next report, for discussions in Vienna and for a clear commitment by Iran to meet the undertakings that it gave in Tehran when European foreign ministers visited.
We also hope that we can develop a dialogue about terrorism, as well as weapons of mass destruction, and about the peace process in the Middle East.
We have established a dialogue on human rights, which is an extremely important aspect of our relationship with Iran.
It is fair to say that we have seen progress in some areas, allowing thematic rapporteurs into Iran.
Some of the â frankly barbaric â punishments that have been carried out appear to have been stopped for the time being.
Someone said during the debate that we should talk to the judges and others: I have.
I felt that, in talking to some, I had been transported back several centuries, in order to take part in the discussions.
However, it is important that we have these discussions and have them on a frank basis.
We say to those that we talk to in Iran that a human rights dialogue is not simply an alternative to doing something about human rights.
So we want to see our dialogue leading to progress in that area.
We have also talked to the Iranian Government about trade and investment and economic issues.
We have had a number of rounds of negotiations towards a trade and cooperation agreement â a fairly basic most-favoured nation agreement.
We had not had any discussions for a while.
That sort of agreement is important to Iran, not least because of the number of young people coming on to the job market every year and the requirement on the part of the Iranians to attract more foreign investment in order to create the jobs and the economic development which is needed to deal with that demographic pressure.
The Iranians know perfectly well that all those issues â political, nuclear, trade and human rights â are umbilically linked.
We cannot simply ignore problems in one area and think that we can move forward rapidly in all the others.
I repeat that I am in favour of engagement, but engagement should not be regarded as a sort of cop-out for acting responsibly in these areas which matter so much to Parliament and to the Union and beyond.
It is in that context that I just want to say this about democracy: we have obviously been pleased that the democrats and the moderates have done so well in recent years.
We are a little disappointed that, despite that, they have been unable to make more progress in government, partly because so much of what they wanted to do has been blocked by the conservative clerics, by the Guardian Council.
That has led to some disillusionment on the part of the public, which led in turn to a low turnout in the elections and a less satisfactory result for the democrats than they might otherwise have achieved.
I am in no doubt that what we are seeing at the moment is an attempt by the conservative clerics to distort the electoral process.
Why are they trying to do that?
They are not trying to distort the electoral process because they think they are going to do well, but because they think that, unless they do so, the moderates, the reformers and the genuine democrats will do well.
It is an attempt to thwart that democratic impulse in Iran that we are seeing at the moment.
I have to say â and I hope this does not sound too much like the leader of a Boy Scout troop â that you cannot halt the democratic process in Iran indefinitely.
It is like trying to stop the tide coming in.
So I hope the conservatives will realise that and that Iran is best served by allowing people greater participation in the government of their own country.
If we see genuine democracy rather than the Potemkin variety of democracy, that will be one of the best ways of underpinning a relationship between Europe and Iran, which all of us should wish to see.
I repeat that if we are serious about a creative and constructive policy for the wider Middle East, it has to involve Iran.
It is no good condemning Iran out of hand and regarding it as being led by Manichean forces of wickedness and darkness.
We have to be constructive and encourage the genuine democrats, who many of us have met and we have been impressed by their bravery.
I hope that in the course of the next months and years we will see Iran making the difficult transition to an Islamic democracy which can play a constructive leadership role in the affairs of its region.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
â B5-0095/2004 by Mr Thomas Mann, Mr Nassauer and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on political assassinations in Cambodia;
â B5-0082/2004 by Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on Cambodia;
â B5-0079/2004 by Mr Watson and Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on political assassinations in Cambodia;
â B5-0097/2004 by Mrs Isler BÃ©guin, Mrs McKenna and Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Cambodia;
â B5-0085/2004 by Mr Herman Schmid and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Cambodia.
Â Â  Mr President, over the past few weeks, three politicians from the Sam Rainsy party have been murdered.
Chea Vichea, a founder member of the party and president of the free trade unions, was shot on 22 January.
He is the latest victim in a long series of killings.
The absence of retribution for political assassinations is tantamount to an invitation to commit further atrocities.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats utterly condemns these assassinations but also condemns the slowness of criminal investigations.
Cambodia needs vigorous political leadership.
Its leaders must enact reforms that put an end to the continual violations of human rights.
I also refer in this context to the countryâs record on child prostitution and forced labour.
For some time now there has been an agreement between the Cambodian Government and the United Nations on the establishment of a war-crimes tribunal.
All that stands in the way of its creation is the ratification of the agreement by the Cambodian Parliament, and that must be done without delay.
We therefore call for a UN delegation to be sent to Cambodia.
We must help, and we want to help, so that a sustainable process of normalisation can take place.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Cambodia, I am sorry to say, is certainly not making progress.
In the elections the Cambodian population showed greater political and democratic maturity than was demonstrated by the countryâs leading political forces.
And incidentally, Mr Mann, not only politicians from the Sam-Rainsy party are being shot dead in the streets; my research has revealed that three members of the governing Funcinpec party have met with the same fate.
In other words, rather rough customs prevail, and the normal rules of etiquette for dealings between Government and Opposition are not observed, which means that anyone who has made himself unpopular for whatever reason is in grave danger.
It is, in fact, the case that impunity continues to act as an incentive to eliminate unpopular politicians, whatever their origins, because the assassins do not have to face the consequence of their actions.
Public trust in politics has been seriously damaged.
Even on the odd occasion when a person is charged, nobody normally believes that he is the real murderer.
As well as having a huge impact on morale in the country, this situation also severely restricts the flow of international aid.
The Asian Development Bank does not intend to resume its payments unless the new Parliament, which was, of course, elected some time ago, is convened soon and a new government is formed.
This is actually the crux of the problem, and influence must be exerted to change the situation.
At the time of the peace process, the UN specified that a two-thirds majority was required for a party or coalition of parties to form a government.
Parties are now unwilling to assemble the broad coalitions that would fulfil this requirement.
In practice, it has become a barrier to normal political life in Cambodia.
This is where influence must be exerted to create political conditions that are truly conducive to improvement.
This is the spirit in which the planned delegation should conduct its talks.
Â Â  Mr President, political murder is a heinous crime in darkness: it is even more chilling in daylight.
Mr Chea Vichea, trade unionist and member of the Cambodian opposition, was shot and killed on January 22, beside the road in Phnom Penh, in the middle of the day.
So brazen was his killer, that passers-by mistook the bullets for firecrackers.
Mr Vichea is the fifth member of the opposition Alliance of Democrats to have been murdered in 2004, and the latest victim of a year of violence.
His funeral brought into the streets a crowd estimated at 30Â 000 strong.
I know why, having met MrÂ Vichea last April and been deeply impressed by his commitment to democracy and good government and improving the lives of his fellow citizens.
Mr Vichea was a founding member of the Sam Rainsy Party.
He was a committed advocate of the rights of Cambodia's 200Â 000 garment workers.
His killing, along with that of activists from the Funcinpec party, adds to a temper of political intimidation in Cambodia that is worsened by the failure of the caretaker government to respond to these murders.
Whether the Cambodian People's Party is responsible for these killings or not, its persistent failure to apprehend and punish the killers leaves it accountable for the rising tide of fear in Cambodian politics.
Hun Sen's government continues to rule Cambodia without full legal and constitutional authority.
It is imperative that a negotiated settlement be reached to enable legitimate government, yet negotiations cannot take place in the shadow of political murder, which sours attempts to construct a viable coalition and threatens to provoke retaliatory violence.
The European Parliament must condemn not only this killing, but also the climate of intimidation and impunity that Cambodian authorities allow to persist.
Our resolution calls for the suspension of all non-humanitarian aid to Cambodia and for the European Commission to refuse to deal with Hun Sen's government.
The EU should not do business with a government that fails to safeguard the lives of democratic leaders.
In conclusion, we call on the Council to issue strong words of condemnation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, in its misfortune, Cambodia is once again crying out for help, but the echo of the distress of its people and of its associative and democratic militants reaches us only from beyond the grave.
This is now the case with regard to CheaÂ Vichea, the President of Cambodiaâs Free Trade Union of Workers and a founding member of the Sam Rangsi party, for whom the main contribution of the European Union will be to salute his memory after his death.
However, this trade union leader strove to defend the rights of more than 38 000 of those modern slaves of globalisation working in the textile industries of South-East Asia.
The fact that the police or the Cambodian Government did not take action when threats were made against him is understandable, in the light of the collapse of the rule of law and of democracy in Cambodia.
The fact that the integrity of such leaders of civil, trade-union or political society is not safeguarded by anything more than the dialogue between the European Union and that region of Asia which is going through severe political crisis is something that we should regard as a challenge.
Is it really necessary to point out here that the assassination of CheaÂ Vichea is merely the latest in a series of violent crimes against opposition figures and that 2003 was the most violent year since 1998?
Is it necessary to add that none of these crimes has been the subject of any court judgment and that the perpetrators have consequently never been convicted.
Against such a background, how can we celebrate the 25th anniversary of the fall of the despotic rule of the Khmer Rouge, when the martyred people of Cambodia are still experiencing such violence and terror?
The credibility of our European Union at international level and the emphasis it places on international law and democracy versus the use of force and makes it imperative that we should bring together the Cambodian political leaders and make them aware of the urgent need for political and economic reform and ensure that they face up to their responsibilities with regard to the fundamental rights of their citizens.
The Cambodian Parliament must take up its duties again, and a serious agreement must be ratified, not a compromise which looks more like a masquerade between the UN and the Government, with a view to creating a special tribunal with responsibility for judging the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge.
This is a project, incidentally, which has already been in preparation for five long years.
I would also like to point out, Mr President, that it is essential to put an end to the unacceptable, intolerable forced labour involving children, whether it is the children working on the Phnom Penh garbage dump, of whom we are all well aware, or those who are sold into prostitution, or those who are the victims of trafficking in human beings, thereby feeding one of the most vile of all networks.
Although it is a matter of urgency, Mr President, that an ad hoc European delegation be sent to Cambodia as an initial measure, we must not forget that the fundamental duty of the European Union is to continue to provide permanent and voluntary assistance to Phnom Penh, side by side with all the people involved.
Â Â  Mr President, in the killing fields of Cambodia the Khmer Rouge murdered millions of their own people, and now the country is struggling to find stability and equilibrium.
It is balanced between the King and the political parties, there is a degree of balance between the parties â sometimes more, sometimes less â and the country is also trying to maintain a balance between various outside influences.
A constant balancing act is, however, no recipe for long-term stability, which cannot be achieved unless the rule of law is firmly established.
This is why paragraphs 4 and 6 of the resolution are of paramount importance.
Straightforward prosecution, by due process, of the murderers and assassins who are threatening the very existence of democracy, and above all the long-overdue creation, together with the United Nations, of a special criminal court with a view to enabling Cambodian and international lawyers to work together in order to ensure that those who have committed crimes against humanity can finally be brought to justice and duly punished: in this way, after a bloody and turbulent past, the country can at long last find stability, underpinned by the rule of law, which will enable it to become an important partner of our European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the Commission for holding firm. I believe that since the elections in Cambodia the European Union, via the Commission in particular, has shown itself capable of taking a stand.
Nevertheless, I believe that the situation is now extremely delicate and I agree with Mr Watsonâs analysis.
Although we do not know whether Mr Hun Sen and his party gave the orders for the enormous number of crimes which have been committed, we know that they have done nothing â neither they nor Mr Hun Senâs Government â to arrest even one of the perpetrators of these crimes.
We also know that the Cambodia of today is no richer than the Cambodia of ten years ago, and that for ten years the European Union and the international community have poured millions and millions of euros into the country.
Knowing all this, therefore, we should perhaps draw some conclusions from it.
The person who has been unable to act as Head of Government in order to prevent crimes, to arrest the guilty parties and to bring even a minimum level of wealth to Cambodia is called Mr Hun Sen.
I believe that if the Commission were to ask the Council to create a mandate to go and discuss the matter with the Americans, the Australians and the Japanese, with a view to making the removal of Mr Hun Sen the condition for the resumption of loans from the Asiatic Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, it would be possible to demonstrate, and to make the Vietnamese and the Chinese understand, as they already have done to a large extent, I think, that the problem of change in Cambodia can only be solved by the removal of Mr Hun Sen and the granting of a mandate to another member of his party, which did, after all, win the election, even if that election was not entirely democratic, indeed, far from it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will be very brief because any sentiments I express will largely echo the remarks that have been made with some passion and knowledge of the country by Members who have already spoken.
I was very interested to go back and re-read the report of the European Union's election observation mission to the Cambodian national elections in July last year.
In passing, let me say once again what an exceptionally important role these election observations missions play in the development of democracy around the world.
The report noted that, compared with previous elections, the atmosphere was less tense and there were fewer violent incidents â although such incidents did occur.
Concerns remained during the pre-election period over the number of alleged political killings.
As Mr Watson said, we have seen the killing of a number of those associated with Prince Norodom's party and we saw most recently the appalling assassination of Chea Vichea.
I wholly endorse what has been said about the importance of his political role as one of the founder members of the Sam Rainsy Party and the importance of his role as a noted and brave trade union leader.
I strongly condemn that assassination.
I wholly support Parliament's call for a thorough investigation and for the prosecution of the perpetrators in accordance with the due process of law.
I would also like to take this opportunity once again to call on all political parties in Cambodia to continue to pursue negotiations which could lead to the swift formation of a new government.
We all want to see the formation of such a government as rapidly as possible.
Parliament rightly continues to take an active interest in the affairs of Cambodia and I will ensure that this interest is reflected in what I say to Council and in the work of the Commission.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr Patten.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place at the end of the debate.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
â B5-0096/2004 by Mr Thomas Mann and Mr Zacharakis, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi;
â B5-0081/2004 by Mr Katiforis and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the Greek seamen in Karachi;
â B5-0078/2004 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the and its crew;
â B5-0086/2004 by Mr Alavanos, Mr Bakopoulos and Mr Korakas, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi;
â B5-0087/2004 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Greek seamen held in Karachi.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to express my perplexity and, at the same time, my anger about the situation which we have before us concerning the four Greek and three Filipino seamen from the tanker the .
This tanker ran aground last summer outside the port of Karachi in Pakistan as the result of an error on the part of the Pakistani pilot, who was steering it into port.
The sea levels were very low because the tide was out, the mistake was made on the part of the Pakistani authorities and we had a dramatic incident.
Of course, tonnes of oil were spilt into the sea but, from that point on, the way the Pakistani authorities acted was incomprehensible.
The sole and only victims of this unfortunate incident were the Greek and Filipino seamen.
The matter was not dealt with globally in order to see what were the responsibilities of the company, of the Pakistani pilot and so on. All the blame was laid at the feet of the Greek and Filipino seamen, who are receiving unacceptable treatment in prison and one of whom attempted the other day to commit suicide.
Apart from that, we had something else: the head of the salvage team, a Greek seaman, also went to help and he too is being held by the Pakistani authorities as we speak.
This situation is, without any doubt, tragic.
I personally have met the families of the seamen, who are honestly in a state of despair, and that is why Parliament must react and, I believe, it will react, because this is first and foremost a humanitarian issue.
Â Â  Mr President, in addition to what Mr Hatzidakis said, there is a relatively recent report on the circumstances surrounding the accident involving the tanker by the relevant ministry in Pakistan, which does not contain any, even rudimentary evidence that could be used to substantiate charges against the seamen.
Similarly, the ship's insurers submitted proposals for compensation a long time ago but have not received any official reply from the Pakistani authorities, and yet they have spent over USD 20 million on this accident, for transportation of the shipwreck and so on.
We know that the European Union Troika with Commissioner Patten is going to Islamabad next week, on the 18th of the month, and that they have managed to get this issue placed at the top of the agenda on relations between the European Union and Pakistan.
We hope that there will be results from this discussion, which for a long time now has been plaguing our feelings and our thoughts, mainly of innocent people struggling to make a living at sea.
We note that interventions have been made on the part of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by Georgos Papandreou as minister for foreign affairs and by the deputy minister, without any substantial response from their counterpart in Pakistan.
This is a terrible situation.
In addition to what Mr Hatzidakis said about the Greek seaman who tried to commit suicide, there is the following tragicomic or sad fact: attempted suicide is a criminal offence there.
So now this shadow of a man is on trial because he attempted to commit suicide.
We hope that suicide will not also be a criminal offence when it is committed.
With such conduct, how do you suppose any qualified young man will turn to the seafaring profession?
Who, ultimately, will protect the lives of seafarers and the marine environment in the future?
We are calling for humanity, logic and legality to prevail at long last in this affair and we are depending on the efforts of Commissioner Patten next week in Islamabad.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to add a few things on behalf of the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece and the whole Confederal Group of the European United Left who, with other groups, have signed and are supporting the joint motion calling for the immediate release of the members of the crew of the ,who have been held illegally in Karachi by the Pakistani authorities since July 2003.
This is a clear case of hostage taking for financial gain.
It is telling that the engineer, Mr Pappas, who arrived in Karachi 20 days after the ship had run aground as head of the salvage operation, which was a success, is being held together with the crew.
It is inconceivable that the entire crew should be held on the grounds of the ecological disaster caused when the ship ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi and for even the ship's cook to be held to account.
Besides, the ship ran aground when it was under the responsibility of the port authorities of the local pilot.
The situation is particularly worrying for the health of the detained seamen who, without having any responsibility, have been prohibited from returning home, a state of affairs which has even led to a suicide attempt.
We must again emphasise that these unacceptable tactics, which are used by numerous governments and which benefit shipowners and insurance companies, that is, using seamen as scapegoats in order to resolve financial disputes and to apportion them responsibility, which they do not have, for whatever happens at sea, cannot continue.
We call on the European Commission and the Presidency and the Greek Government to intervene decisively and demand the immediate release of the seamen being held in Karachi.
They must not be held hostage any longer.
Â Â  Mr President, for eight months now, Greek and Filipino sailors have been held by the Pakistani authorities.
Their tanker ran aground outside the port of Karachi, causing the greatest environmental disaster in the history of Pakistan.
Thirty thousand tonnes of crude oil spilled into the sea, contaminating the coastline and destroying the livelihood of fishermen.
In the view of the Pakistani Government, the disaster was caused by incompetence and negligence on the part of the crew.
As MrÂ Hatzidakis and the previous speakers have pointed out, however, the tanker was incontestably under the command of a local pilot at the time of the accident.
There can therefore be no clear-cut apportionment of guilt.
The Pakistani Ambassador has informed me that judicial proceedings will shortly be instituted against the sailors.
Shortly?
According to media reports, they have been under house arrest since October 2003 and are not allowed to leave Pakistan.
Government sources have assured me that the sailors have unrestricted freedom of movement within the country.
That will have to be verified.
International law actually covers unresolved compensation issues.
In the domain of oil pollution there is an International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, to which 124 nations have now acceded.
I hope that Pakistan will soon do likewise.
On both humanitarian and legal grounds, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats appeals to the Pakistani Government to allow the crew members to return to their homes and families, subject to a pledge to return to Pakistan when the judicial proceedings take place.
Such pledges are made on word of honour and must be redeemed.
Â Â  . Mr President, let us be clear, this is a most regrettable business.
It would be most unfortunate if the Pakistani authorities were to believe that they could resolve the case by detaining the crew.
As the honourable Member said earlier, next week the EU Troika will be visiting Islamabad and I will once again appeal to the Pakistani authorities to release the crew on humanitarian grounds, in line with a guarantee that I understand has been given by the Greek Government to ensure that the crew would cooperate in any investigation that subsequently takes place.
That seems to be a sensible way to proceed and I do not know what further the Pakistani authorities can expect from the Greek Government.
The Commission would recommend arbitration according to internationally established standards along the lines of the 1992 Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage.
We encourage Pakistan to discuss the advantages of ratifying the convention with officials of the International Maritime Organisation.
In the meantime, it would be constructive to settle compensation claims in line with the convention's regulations, as though Pakistan was already party to the convention.
That is what the insurers have proposed.
I have already raised the issue with the Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Mr Kasuri, during his visit to Brussels on 5 November 2003.
Heads of our European Union Missions in Islamabad have discussed the issue on several occasions with the Pakistani authorities, including Mr Kasuri.
As referred to earlier, I and the Foreign Ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands have agreed that during our visit Pakistan on 18Â February we would raise the issue again if the situation remained unchanged.
It would obviously be admirable if things could be sorted out even before next week.
I repeat, this deplorable situation has gone on for far too long.
The sooner it is resolved the better, and our sympathy goes out to the families of the crewmen and to the crewmen themselves, who have been detained in these circumstances for so long.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner.
The joint debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions.(1)
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I believe it is paragraph 5 of the resolution which states that observation of the elections did not take place because of the refusal of the Iranian authorities.
That requires correction in so far as the request was also made by Parliament.
It should therefore be worded in slightly more neutral terms, in that âthe authoritiesâ should be replaced by âthe Iranian sideâ.
May I request that correction.
It is merely a matter of factual clarification.
(2)
Â Â  â Mr President, I only wish to move amendments to recitals D and F. In D and again in paragraph 7, it should be political figures rather than opposition members, since three of the five assassination victims belonged to a governing party.
And then the date in recitalÂ F should be 7 January instead of 4 February.
These are technical rather than substantive amendments.
Â Â  Mr President, my Group has no problem with the second of those amendments, but we feel that the first weakens the text and therefore we object to it.
(3)
Â Â  Mr President, this is also just a small technical amendment, but I do consider it important, because it is, after all, about people in custody.
The text refers to Greek and Filipino sailors, but the title refers only to Greek sailors.
I believe we agree that the Filipinos should be released too.
For this reason, I move that the title be amended accordingly.
Â Â  Parliament has no further business.(1)
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 12Â February 2004.(1)
Â Â  By letter of 24 February 2004, the President of the Catalonian Parliament informed us that Mr Joan Colom i Naval has been appointed a member of the Catalonian Court of Auditors.
Mr Colom i Naval, I congratulate you on this appointment and, pursuant to Rule 8(4) of the Rules of Procedure, inform the House that Mr Colom i Naval's mandate as a Member of the European Parliament â in long and good standing, I might add â officially terminates tomorrow, 26 February 2004.
So, Joan serves his last day here, and will carry from this House our respect and our best wishes.
By letter of 19 February 2004, the Belgian authorities informed me that Mrs FrÃ©dÃ©rique Ries has been appointed a member of the Belgian Government.
Again, let me â in this case in her absence â congratulate MrsÂ Ries on this appointment and note, pursuant to RuleÂ 8(4), that her mandate as a Member of the European Parliament has terminated and that a vacancy exists as of 12 February 2004.
In the same letter, the Belgian authorities informed me that Mrs Ries had been replaced by Mrs Jacqueline Rousseaux with effect from 19 February 2004.
I welcome our new colleague and remind Members that credentials must be verified in line with the appropriate procedures.(1)
Â Â  Mr President, I just wanted to draw the attention of the House to a major seminar that has been held in Dublin over the last two days on the subject of HIV/AIDS.
I would also like to draw to the attention of the Commission what emerged during that conference, particularly that the growth in the incidence of AIDS has been so horrific that it has been considered worse than the spread of the Black Death in the 14th century.
I hope very much that colleagues â not only within this session of the Parliament but also in the next Parliament â will recognise the serious, catastrophic and deadly problem we are facing.
I hope, too, Mr President, that as you were present in Dublin, we will see some continuity from that conference.
Â Â  The conference you mentioned, MrsÂ Banotti, adopted a declaration.
At the next Conference of Presidents, I propose to give a copy of that declaration to the Group leaders and also to give a brief account of my own sense of the meeting on HIV/AIDS, which indeed imposes a duty of care on this institution and on the European Community in general.
Â Â  Mr President, I draw attention to the fact that in a recent Eurobarometer poll European voters identified the subject of immigration among the top four issues for the forthcoming election campaign.
We have a situation in which Member States in the last five years have so far failed in their Treaty obligation to establish a common asylum and immigration policy offering a reassurance of orderly control of asylum and immigration, a level playing field and responsibility-sharing.
They have made a complete mess of free movement from the new Member States and in some Member States â such as my own â there has been complete hysteria from the popular press; there is a worrying rise in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia; passions have been inflamed by the proposed ban in France on the wearing of headscarves, and so on.
We therefore face quite a dangerous situation.
Mr President, when you meet the heads of government at the forthcoming summit, would you ask them to do everything in their power to ensure that the subjects of immigration, asylum and the integration of immigrant communities are handled with sensitivity and tact so that we ensure that there is no extremist success at the forthcoming elections?
Â Â  I take note of that suggestion.
Â Â  Mr President, I returned just this weekend from a visit to the West Bank. I had been there on a fact-finding trip with a number of other Members of this House to get some information about the so-called security barrier and I was shocked by the sights that met me there.
This is not a barrier which is being built on the border between Israel and the West Bank; it is a barrier that has been built around the towns and villages of the Palestinian people.
They are literally being walled in with no-man's-lands and permit-only exit and access, controlled by the Israeli defence forces.
This is a recipe for continued destabilisation of the Israeli state; it is not a security solution.
I would appeal to you, Mr President, to convey my message â and perhaps the message of many others in this House â to the Council and to the Commission that in the International Court in The Hague we must come off the fence.
We cannot be neutral with regard to the legality of the location of this barrier.
I do not deny the Israeli state the right to build a barrier anywhere it likes on its own territory, but the Court must come down heavily against the legality of this particular barrier, which is imprisoning, criminalising and dehumanising the Palestinian people.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention, and to that of this House, something I regard as a very sad situation in Slovakia, our neighbour and soon to be a Member State.
It would appear from television reports that the government has cut social security benefits for the Roma, which has prompted many women and mothers â and, appallingly enough, their children as well â to loot food shops in order to get food.
I do not in the least want it to be thought that I approve of violence in any form, but the Roma must be in a truly tragic predicament, and I would ask you, Mr President, to seek information and an explanation of this.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday, the Commission granted non-European wine producers â in South Africa, Australia and the USA â authorisation to use three denominations of Port wine: Tawny, Ruby and Vintage.
This decision by the Commission has provoked a furious reaction in the Port wine defined region, the oldest wine region in Europe, and will have a devastating impact on the legitimate interests of Port wine producers.
This is a disgraceful decision, one to which we object in the strongest possible terms.
This is not just a matter of economics; it is both highly sensitive and a cultural issue.
The EU must support Port wine, its authenticity and the trademarks that it has acquired.
Â Â  I would ask the Commission to make note of Mr Lage's comment.
Â Â  Mr President, it is the comments of my esteemed colleague, MrsÂ Ludford, that cause me too to request the floor.
I entirely agree with her that we face a very unpleasant situation in which we are in danger of seeing the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament characterised by a fear of foreigners and a hostility towards them.
I therefore wish to propose perhaps attempting to take action at this early stage.
I am not normally one to propose new expenditure, nor am I normally one to propose that Parliament print glossy brochures extolling its own virtues, but I should like to make an exception in this case.
Kofi Annan made an outstanding speech to us recently, and I would ask that this speech be printed, that it be printed in all the languages and that it be published in a presentable edition so that we can use it in the election campaign.
I think he made a fantastic contribution to this debate and issued an extremely necessary challenge to all the European peoples.
Nearly everybody clapped â for the speech at least.
That, then, is what I would call for.
Â Â  That is a very good point.
The speech is certainly being translated into the languages of the current 15 Member States and I will ensure it is also translated into the languages of the accession countries.
I will also see if it is possible for our information services to distribute the speech through the mass media to reach a wider public than has thus far had access to it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to bring to your attention a written statement by Mr Glyn Ford, a Member of this House, in which he urges the boycotting of the products of a company in the European Union.
I would also like this statement to be forwarded to the Council, the Commission and the Member States.
I would ask you to call upon the Legal Service to make a statement as to whether this is in any way permissible.
In Germany, my own country, it would be prohibited by law.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to take up the issue raised by a previous speaker.
The decision taken by the Commission on 20Â February amending the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products is important because the problem does not just affect Portugal but all European wine-growing areas.
This decision merged the two categories with which we protected our highest quality products into a single category indicating quality wines and introduced the possibility for third countries to produce wines using our designationsÂ âÂ using equivalent requirements as the only point of reference.
In economic terms, this decision is a crisis for the entire European wine sector.
At the same time, it also means that we are abandoning a series of quality guarantees to be given to consumers as regards European production.
Amongst other aspects, the Commissionâs justificationÂ âÂ which stresses how this decision was taken to aid talks within the World Trade OrganisationÂ âÂ is extremely worrying, because we are continuing to open up Europe to products for which we cannot provide the consumers with guarantees.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to alert Parliament and the Commission to the earthquake that occurred late last night in the Atlas mountains in Morocco and which has caused a considerable number of deaths there.
I am also speaking on behalf of my friend and colleague Mr Deprez when I point out that there are a lot of people in Brussels and in this Parliament whose families are in Morocco.
The Commission is very good at providing humanitarian assistance via ECHO, and this is an instance in which we should move as fast as we can.
Â Â  I should add that, on behalf of Parliament, I am communicating with the authorities to ensure that they are aware of our expression of sympathy.
Indeed, we need effective solidarity and I will communicate that to the Commission as well.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on its annual policy strategy for 2005.
Â Â  . âMr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour of presenting the annual policy strategy adopted by the Commission this morning.
It spells out the political priorities for 2005 and the initiatives necessary for their implementation.
It also outlines the budgetary guidelines needed to ensure the priority initiatives are adequately funded.
MrsÂ Schreyer will comment on this last point. I will focus on the first issue I mentioned.
As of two years ago, it has become our custom to engage in a structured dialogue with the EuropeanÂ Parliament and the Council on an annual basis.
Given the special issues pertaining to 2004, the structured dialogue will take the form of a meeting of the Commission and the ConferenceÂ ofÂ CommitteeÂ Presidents to be held in April.
