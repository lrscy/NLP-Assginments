A sector based on extremely expensive technology, with a rapid rate of growth, has an immediate effect on employment in ancillary sectors, such as research, industry and tourism.
In my opinion, trying to safeguard the environment by simply slowing down growth in the aeronautical sector and the air industry is not a valid option.
But there is no doubt that the public, not only people in the surrounding area who suffer most directly from certain types of pollution such as noise or even emissions, but the public in general, who want sustainable development and quality of life, has a right to demand action from us to guarantee this type of growth that should be the European model.
In its communication on air transport and the environment, the Commission maintains that the aviation industry needs to increase its efforts to improve the environmental quality of new aircraft being built.
If the current rate of growth is maintained, the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made.
I know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but, without a doubt, in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success.
The Commission, however, is aware that the air transport sector is correct in saying that before carrying out environmental measures, a serious in-depth study must be done on the economic and social repercussions that these measures will have.
I have the impression that today, those most concerned by the environment are accepting, little by little, but more and more, the fact that in order to develop a definite environmental policy, account must be taken of the balance between the cost and effectiveness of the measures proposed.
The report we have before us considers these fundamental issues and takes account of both the need to reinforce environmental protection beyond routine efforts and the profitability analysis factor.
I would like to thank Mrs Lucas for the efforts made to achieve flexibility, as it is clear from her amendments that this is not exactly what she would like as a report, but she is looking for a compromise that makes parliamentary approval possible.
For example, what she says on kerosene seems to me to be a reasonable way of presenting this problem, which undoubtedly cannot be solved at European level, but at world-wide level and by the ICAO.
For it is in aviation, ladies and gentlemen, the industry in which globalisation is more evident than in any other, that these issues must be resolved.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the support she gives the Commission in the report, and say that we find ourselves at a difficult stage of the debate on new noise standards and on legislation which gradually eliminates the noisiest aircraft, within the framework of the ICAO.
On many occasions, we have indicated our preference for an international solution to these problems, and the Commission has noted with satisfaction the positive development of the United States' stance in relation to the standardisation process that is taking place in the ICAO.
I have to say that the legislation on the so-called "hushkits" , with regard to the noisiest aircraft, adopted in its day by Parliament, the Council and the Commission, was based precisely on the fact that the United States had adopted unilateral measures outside the ICAO.
There is no doubt that it is within the ICAO that this work needs to be done.
We shall coordinate the actions of the various Member States within the CAEP, given that it is the Member States that are the signatories of the ICAO, and I hope that Parliament will support initiatives such as the single sky, to which Mr Ojeda referred, which, naturally, will also have consequences for kerosene saving, if it can be implemented, and the improvement in the allocation and general management of slots.
Mr President, once again I thank everyone for the work carried out in trying to obtain a realistic and flexible text that is acceptable to the various parties.
We await Parliament's vote, to which the Commission will pay great attention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Tyres for motor vehicles and trailers
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0218/00), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting [C5-0220/2000 - 1997/0348(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr De Roo).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to talk about noise generated by car tyres.
Noise is an environmental and health problem which is underestimated.
Tyres cause a nuisance to one third of the citizens in Europe who complain about it, compared to one quarter of the citizens ten years ago.
The problem of noise is therefore escalating, especially road and aircraft noise.
At first reading, the European Parliament was wrong not to react to the feeble proposals from the European Commission.
For example, the European Commission' s proposal did not contain a review clause.
All environmental proposals made by the European Commission contain a review clause, but not this one.
This is hardly surprising given the fact that this proposal was drafted by the DG for Industry.
In the Council, this environmental matter was wrongly dealt with by the Ministers for Economic Affairs and the Internal Market.
It should have been dealt with in the Council of Ministers for the Environment.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has tabled 4 amendments with 32 votes against 10 votes.
With regard to ordinary passenger cars, we suggest that the limit is reduced by 2 decibels.
The German independent inspection body, TÃV, has tested numerous existing car tyres.
They all meet the ineffective noise limits proposed by the Council.
A reduction of 2 decibels is technically possible without jeopardising safety.
This has also been confirmed by experts of the Swedish institute for roads and traffic.
With regard to vans and lorries, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection also suggests reducing the noise level by 2 decibels.
Vans and lorries produce more noise than ordinary cars.
This is why it is important to make the necessary changes here too, and I hope that a number of the Christian-Democrat MEPs will be able to vote in favour of this.
The tyre industry has been given until October 2005 to meet stricter noise limits.
This seems ample time to me.
More is required, of course, in order to reduce the noise from road traffic.
The noise level from 'fluisterasfalt' [silent asphalt], as it is termed by our Flemish friends, or 'ZOAB, zeer open asfaltbeton' [very open asphalt concrete], as we like to refer to it in the Netherlands, is probably 20 decibels lower than that from cobblestone roads.
Our motorways are no longer paved with cobblestones, but a reduction of 3 to 5 decibels is possible by introducing this type of asphalt everywhere.
We will be returning to the problems of noise when we deal with the directive on noise.
Silent asphalt and a change of tyre could help reduce the noise level by 6 decibels, which may not seem a great deal, but one should remember that decibels are a logarithmic table.
This means that the noise level can be cut by more than half without reducing the volume of traffic.
Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems.
More than 10 years ago, the European Parliament introduced the first generation of catalytic converters and, two years ago, the second generation of catalytic converters appeared in the Langen/Hautala report on the motor oil programme.
As a result, air pollution caused by cars and lorries will drop by 70% to 90% in 2005 and 2007.
Similarly, we found a sound solution to the recycling of end-of-life vehicles in the Florenz report.
There are now two major environmental issues left to tackle at European level.
The first one is noise, which I have dealt with extensively, and the second one is the CO2 or the greenhouse problem.
With regard to CO2, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has suggested that the European Commission submit a legislative proposal to reduce the rolling resistance of tyres by 5%.
This means that 5% less fuel will be used and that the emission of CO2 will also fall by the same amount.
I would welcome a positive reaction from the European Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, the general lines along which this Directive is discussed are of little concern to me.
I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge.
What is true is that insufficient account has so far been taken of environmental interests.
Just in the last three days, the car and tyre industries have indicated in this Chamber that their options may well be open when it comes specifically to car tyres.
My group is not at present overly concerned about whether the figure is to be 1, 3 or 4 decibels, but we should like to make it clear that we want positively to force the tyre industry to act and do more of what is required of them in this area.
The motor oil, car and recycling industries have made a lot of things possible where road use by individuals is concerned.
In contrast, the tyre industry has largely refrained from taking action.
It is in this area that we want them to do some catching up.
We shall doubtless at some stage also have to talk about alternative road surfaces in Europe.
I believe that this is a positive way of forcing the tyre industry to act.
I should therefore like straight away to forestall some of my fellow MEPs who now and again stand up jokingly and say that Mr Florenz wants a reduction of two decibels where possible but is accepting a 10 metres longer braking distance in return.
Obviously, we want to maintain standards.
We expect innovation. We expect the tyre industry to employ young engineers of both sexes and finally to go some way towards meeting people' s justified demands to be exposed to less noise in their homes.
That is a task we have set ourselves, and I hope that the Commission will be prepared to cooperate.
It is possible, as we shall see in one or two years' time, that the industry will be able to achieve these objectives of ours by the year 2005.
If that were not possible, I am the very first to concede that we need to broaden our field of operations somewhat.
But the industry must be forced to act, and that is what we shall be campaigning for at the present time.
Mr President, Commissioner, it is a well-known fact that you are not entirely averse to cars yourselves and also enjoy driving.
It would therefore be a jolly good idea if, merely by being fitted with new tyres, our own cars were to cause 40% less noise and, at the same time, use 5% less fuel and also emit less CO2.
This is the road we should be going down.
There are already tyres whose specifications are well below the values proposed in the common position when it comes both to tyre noise and to the rolling resistance which is responsible for petrol consumption and CO2 emissions.
There are even tyres to which the Federal Republic of Germany awards a Blue Angel as a sign of environmental friendliness because they are a model of quiet operation and give rise to low petrol consumption.
Now, these tyres are not particularly unsafe.
On the contrary.
Michelin and Dunlop tyres even make for shorter braking distances while remaining quiet and preserving fuel economy.
I am therefore wondering why this Parliament cannot summon up the courage to say that whatever is now already state of the art technology is what we demand by 2005 for all tyres, particularly those fitted to private cars.
I should therefore like strongly to request that we adopt Amendment No 1, through which we call for limit values not only for tyre noise but also for rolling resistance, and that we adopt, in particular, Amendment No 2 in connection with quieter tyres.
I would ask you to consider that this does not yet mean the end of the negotiations.
We are entering into the negotiations in the Conciliation Committee with the Council, and we shall then see what emerges.
However, we must also have room for manoeuvre.
Mr President, before I start on the subject of tyre noise, may I make a more general point to the Commission.
They are bringing forward far too much legislation and, with legislation, quality is usually in inverse proportion to quantity.
We talk of doing less and doing it better. In fact we do more, and we do it worse.
Now turning to tyres.
I little thought when I came to this House that I would end up defending the Commission's position - and yet the Commission has done its homework.
It has consulted with the industry.
It has come up with a proposal that sets challenging, but achievable, targets which protect the environment whilst also recognising the interests of road users and tyre makers.
Some of our colleagues are seeking to sabotage this careful work by demanding arbitrary and ill-considered decibel reductions.
In some cases their figures are achievable, in others not.
But they have forgotten that changes in the production specifications of tyres affect not only noise, but also grip, safety, fuel economy, cost and durability.
They may end up with quieter tyres that are expensive, that wear out quickly and that allow cars to slide off the road and crash into trees!
Let me speak plainly.
More road users will die if Mr de Roo's amendments are passed.
The electors I represent will not thank us.
We are being far too prescriptive.
It is our job to set a broad legislative framework in the public interest.
Instead, we seek to micro-manage a highly technical and complex industrial development programme, a task for which we have neither the time nor the skills.
I call on colleagues to reject the amendments and support the Commission proposal.
Mr President, I welcome this proposal.
It is long overdue.
Certainly the amendments to it by my colleagues Mr de Roo and Mr Lange are moving in the right direction.
Since the first publication of this directive back in 1997 the manufacturers have moved to meet the Commission standards.
I understand the desire of my colleague, Mr de Roo, to take the standards further.
However, I have to sound a note of caution.
Firstly, tyre standards are not the only problem.
The nature of the road surface is just as important and in particular circumstances like noise hotspots in urban areas perhaps more important than trying to change the tyre standards.
In many cases a better solution is to change the road surface and not the tyre standards.
Secondly - and in my opinion of paramount importance - is the need to balance the problem of tyre noise and tyre safety.
Whilst we are tonight seeking to adopt new tyre standards to reduce tyre noise we are not making any progress at all on tyre standards for the grip or adhesion of tyres on the road.
Despite good and serious proposals being put on the table some considerable time ago by the UK, they have not yet been agreed or seriously considered.
Our failure to agree tyre safety standards creates an unacceptable level of uncertainty with regard to this vital question.
For that reason I am particularly concerned about the potential effects of Amendments Nos 3 and 4 and their impact upon tyre safety, especially for vehicles such as buses and trucks.
In the circumstances I feel bound to say that I personally cannot give my support to Mr de Roo's Amendments Nos 3 and 4.
I suggest to him that they are premature and I would ask the Commission to reject them.
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to Mr de Roo for the work he has done.
The reduction of any kind of noise is important both for people' s health and their comfort.
For that reason, I feel very positive about the Council' s common position with regard to tyre noise.
I am by no means acting as spokesman here for the tyre industry, but, having watched that industry very closely, I nevertheless wish to express my concern about the effect the amendments will have.
The tyre industry is a very fiercely competitive industry, and one that is competitive on a global scale. It is responsible for some very thorough development work and, owing to the nature of tyre technology, it is progressing slowly but surely.
The situation will become untenable, however, if there is an attempt to bring in changes too fast, as would seem to be the case on this occasion.
If things move too quickly it will mean immense technical problems for the industry, with unnecessary extra costs, which will be reflected in the prices of the products.
The consumer is always the one that has to pay.
An adequate transition period, however, will guarantee that the new requirements are taken account of at the development stage.
Any other course of action would be a waste of resources, because it would take on average three to four years to develop a new tyre model.
The issue becomes especially problematic when we consider that a tyre is a very delicate product in terms of balancing its individual properties.
It is not really just black and round, as the layman thinks.
When one property of the tyre is improved, it affects the others adversely, so tyre design is really a question of optimising compromises.
For example, a broad tyre holds well on asphalt, but tends to start skimming over water easily.
On the other hand, a narrow tyre works well on snow.
If a tyre' s noise properties were to be essentially improved it would above all impair its ability to hold the road in wet conditions.
I want my fellowmen to drive on safe tyres, above all.
I wish the tyre industry and the EU legislators would get together and draw up a realistic timetable for the excellent objectives outlined in this report.
Mr President, the aim of this proposal for a directive is to limit tyre/road noise without sacrificing grip and therefore road-holding and braking safety.
In preparing the proposal, the Commission consulted several bodies independent from the manufacturers, who worked with experts from the Member States for a long time in order to find the appropriate level of strictness on decibels for the various categories of tyres for cars, vans and lorries.
As a result of this extensive prior consultation of experts, the Member States have unanimously approved the level of strictness chosen in the proposal as a common position.
The European Parliament itself showed its satisfaction with the level of strictness of the proposal and did not table any amendments.
First of all, it should be noted that the quality of the road surface is, to a great extent, up to 6 decibels, responsible for the noise generated by tyre contact.
It should also be made clear that the Commission is continuing with the measures launched two years ago to combat the various sources of noise, covering every sector of activity of the European Union.
Now, at the second reading, 4 amendments have been tabled.
Amendment Nos 2, 3 and 4 propose the reduction of noise thresholds by 2 decibels.
If this reduction of 2 decibels were implemented today, more than 70% of tyres currently on the market would not pass the test.
Manufacturers would therefore be obliged to urgently modify the structure of the tyre and the hardness of the rubber by reducing the grip.
Until grip requirements are applied, these three amendments are therefore unacceptable.
This correlation between noise and rolling, tyre grip and fuel consumption is rightly at the centre of the concern expressed in Amendment No 1.
This concern is currently the subject of the search for a consensus in a working party for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, a working party monitored by the staff of the European Commission.
This matter is also the subject of discussion in the Transatlantic Business Dialogue to promote the emergence of a Global Type Standard GTS 2000.
The European Commission is following this work with the intention of transposing the results into Directive 92/23/EEC in order to determine the correct balance between safety, noise and resistance.
Unfortunately, however, the proposed timetable is too strict.
The wide range of products covered and the problem in all its complexity must be considered.
It is for these reasons that Article 3, as worded in the common position, stipulates that the requirements on grip and on rolling resistance shall be integrated with the noise requirements in the extended timetable of 24 and 36 months respectively, following the entry into force of this directive.
Amendment No 1, which proposes to legislate again on two occasions within a period of one year after the entry into force of this directive, is not acceptable.
Due to the complexity of the methods of measuring grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance and due to the wide range of products, the results of the experts' work will not be available before 2002.
The Commission will then be able to amend this directive in order to include grip on dry and wet surfaces and rolling resistance for all categories of tyre.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)
The next item is the report (A5-0168/2000) by Mr Bakopoulos, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)[COM(1999) 620 - C5-0312/1999 - 1999/0269(COD)].
Mr President, the proposal for a directive which we are debating today is designed to restrict the marketing and use of azocolourants used in fabric dyes and leather goods.
The reason for the restriction is that there is good cause to believe that these substances are carcinogenic.
The annex to the directive contains a list of fabric and leather products in which the use of these suspect substances is banned.
Several countries have already introduced similar bans in their legislation and most companies established in the European Union fall into precisely this category.
However, we need a directive in order to harmonise the internal market and prevent such unilateral regulations.
Finally, as is only to be expected, the directive also contains an analytical method for detecting banned azocolourants.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy accepts the principle on which this directive is based.
The amendments, which were adopted unanimously, therefore represent an improvement.
I should like to refer to just two of them.
The Committee on the Environment takes the view that the list of products in which the use of azocolourants is banned, as contained in the annex to the directive, should not be open.
It should be a complete, closed, precise list of named products.
This will avoid arbitrary interpretation of the directive and, as a result, a wide variety of applications, which would run counter to the principle of the single market, which this directive has been introduced to protect.
That is the purpose of Amendment No 3.
The second amendment to which I should like to refer is Amendment No 2, which introduces recital 7a, exempting hand-made oriental carpets from the directive.
The reason for the exemption is that, because these carpets are hand-made, spot checks are, by definition, impossible, while separate testing of each carpet would seriously damage the product.
Especially in cases - and they are not infrequent - of hand-made artefacts and/or works of art. Importers are, however, advised to develop a quality mark.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs MÃŒller tabled Amendment No 6, on time, rewording the previous recital 7a and proposing that the exemption from the scope of the directive for oriental carpets should expire on 1 January 2006.
I think this proposal is sensible and propose that it be accepted.
Finally, Mr Ferrer tabled Amendment No 7, again on time, proposing that the list of 21 azocolourants in the annex should include another substance, in addition to the two inserted in Amendment No 4.
However, the substance which Mr Ferrer proposes is already included in the annex.
Obviously, this is an oversight and I do not therefore propose that it be accepted.
Mr President, Commissioner, this is a small and modest report, an amendment to a directive that I, however, believe is an important and significant example of the great success of the awareness and information policies and of the fact that the regulation often comes after society has sorted itself out.
The fact that practically all manufacturers and producers in all the Member States have removed the products we are now trying to remove indicates that there are now many mature areas in which ideally we would not have to establish legislation, and would not find ourselves in situations like this.
I would therefore like to emphasise, so that it may be taken down in the Minutes, that we must work to this formula where possible in a mature society and a mature industry.
I think the exclusion of oriental carpets is marvellous, as I believe it is good that flexibility in favour of art and beauty is entering into the spirit of a legislative machine that often forgets small details.
Furthermore, as far as I know, people do not normally tend to eat carpets, and therefore this level of risk could be avoided.
I repeat, I believe it is positive for us to work towards progress, for society to be one step ahead of us and that all we have to do is ratify what has already been recognised.
Mr President, in response to the rapporteur' s intervention, I should like to clear up one small point.
The amendments to this report were tabled by myself.
I just want to straighten that out because Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s name was mentioned.
Azocolourants are dyes which release cancer-causing aromatic amines if they come into contact with human skin or with the mouth cavity.
That was also the reason why a number of Member States issued interim regulations to protect consumers, as well as the reason for the Commission' s initiative, which we are discussing this evening, whereby azocolourants are now to be prohibited throughout the EU and a ban placed on imports of these substances from third countries.
The draft we have from the Commission nonetheless has some gaps in it which compromise safety and which, in my opinion, need to be closed.
That is the purpose of my amendments, to which a large majority of the committee agreed.
We are mainly concerned with adding two further amines to the banned list because they have since been categorised as carcinogenic.
Moreover, the general description of the area of application that has been given is too vague.
We want an exhaustive, clearly defined list for the purpose of creating clarity and legal certainty.
By means of the voluntary stamp of quality and the interim deadline of 1 January 2006, we have also succeeded in taking account of the special problems presented by the oriental carpets industry and, in spite of these problems, in also including hand-made oriental carpets in the directive in the medium term.
We have also provided for an option whereby, until such time as new testing methods have been validated, two methods can be applied which take account of the differing demands which materials make upon the testing method.
With the adoption of these amendments, which have been decided upon by a large majority of the committee, any vagueness and lack of clarity in the directive would, all in all, be removed.
In this way, the directive would do justice to the demands which will have to be made upon it in view of the risk of actual damage to public health.
Mr President, I would like to thank Members for their interest in this subject and especially Mr Bakopoulos, the rapporteur, for his constructive work.
Certain azocolourants used in textile and leather pose the risk of cancer for consumers and workers, as has been said.
Following an opinion of the Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment confirming such risks, the Commission proposed in December of last year a directive restricting marketing and use of certain azocolourants which could pose a risk of cancer if they come into close contact with the skin.
The Commission proposal for a directive would introduce a ban on the use of certain azocolourants in textile and leather articles that come into close contact with the skin.
The colourants concerned are xylidines which may release any of the 21 cancer-causing amines listed in the proposed directive.
Furthermore, textile or leather articles dyed with these same xylidines may not be placed on the market.
The test methods to be used to show compliance with the provisions are specified in the proposed directive.
The proposal provides not only for the protection of consumers' and workers' health.
It also addresses an internal market issue.
At the present time, the internal market is fragmented, as some Member States are already applying national bans.
The proposed directive would harmonise the rules of Member States.
I would stress that the proposal is based on the results of independent studies on the risks of azocolourants and of the costs, benefits and trade effects of the proposed restrictions.
It also takes account of the opinion of the competent Scientific Committee on Risks.
I believe it is a proportionate measure.
The Commission is unable to accept those Parliament amendments which would extend this ban by replacing the proposed list of examples of product categories covered by an exhaustive list by covering articles other than those made of textiles and leather and by including other amides.
Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 7 of the Committee on the Environment are the ones I refer to.
The Commission feels this could not be justified on the basis of the current knowledge about the risks.
Nor is the Commission able to accept amendments that would introduce a second testing method to show compliance with the provisions.
This applies to Amendment No 5 of the Committee on the Environment.
These would make it more difficult for suppliers, especially in the Third World, to show compliance as the method proposed by the Commission is the method most widely accepted and used.
However, the Commission can accept that when available a more reliable standardised testing method could be introduced.
The Commission can accept in principle an exemption for handmade oriental carpets from the example list of product categories covered by the proposed directive as the risk from such carpets is likely to be low.
However, the Commission cannot accept that the exemption is only temporary.
To summarise our point of view, we can accept Amendment No 1 of the Committee on the Environment.
We must reject six amendments, namely Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Committee on the Environment.
However, the Commission can in principle support parts of Amendment No 3.
We wish to carry on the dialogue with Parliament.
I am convinced that we can reach a constructive solution.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Undeclared work
The next item is the report (A5-0220/2000) by Mrs Glase, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication on undeclared work [COM(1998) 219 - C4-0566/1998 - 1998/2082(COD)].
Mr President, the report before us is a position adopted by Parliament in response to a communication from the Commission on the problems associated with undeclared or illicit work.
This problem is being dealt with at European level because it relates not just to one particular country but to all Member States.
What is the heart of the problem?
Major economic and socio-political damage is being caused in the Member States through work not being declared.
Health insurances, pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year.
Workers are in no way insured or otherwise safeguarded.
Thoughts of a modern slave trade with fatal consequences for those involved spring clearly and inevitably to mind.
Those who are rewarded in some way for undeclared work have no right to claim compensation at all and no other consumer rights.
The people concerned believe that they are at an advantage but are in fact harming only themselves and society.
The fact is that, by definition and by its very nature, undeclared work is difficult to get to grips with in any country.
On the basis of estimates and long-term investigations, it may be assumed that a total of 28 million people engage in undeclared work.
The volume of undeclared work now corresponds to 15% of gross domestic product in the EU.
The sector as a whole is growing three times as fast as the official economy.
In the communication before this House, the Commission has problems with the analysis, as well as with the steps that need to be taken to stem the tide of undeclared work.
Parliament has been working flat out on these problems for a long time and produced a list of causes which produce combined and many-sided effects.
Almost all investigations list unduly high taxes and social security contributions as a cause.
However, the Committee lists further causes such as poverty, frivolous bidding procedures, giveaway prices for subcontractors, inflexible employment legislation and poor administrative practice, as well as a clear decline in the perception of undeclared work as something illegal and illicit.
In drawing its conclusions, the Committee has, however, come up with a variety of positions derived from the very different evaluations of the various causes.
I nonetheless believe that we are united as to our goal. It is only the path about which we disagree.
The conclusions adopted by the Committee at its last sitting call for as precise as possible an assessment to be made of the sectors affected and of the most significant groups of people involved, as well as for the social partners to be involved in active measures to combat undeclared work and for the issue to be tackled in national employment programmes. They also call for surveillance and for sanctions to be imposed when undeclared work is detected.
However, a majority of the Committee considers a reduction in tax and social security contributions to be crucial as a preventive measure, as well as a reduction in value added tax in the case of labour-intensive services, as already provided for by the Council' s decision of 28 February of this year and as also already practised in new countries.
It is also important to find solutions in hitherto unsatisfactory areas, for example in connection with the directive on the posting of workers and with the paid domestic work largely performed by women.
In the five minutes granted to me, I can present only a number of important points in the report.
The problem is complex and needs to be tackled at a variety of levels.
The Committee therefore calls upon the Commission and the individual Member States, each according to its powers but above all with firm determination, to take up Parliament' s proposals and to become active in this matter.
I hope that we can demonstrate to you our substantial agreement with the report, together with Parliament' s active resolve.
I would thank all my fellow MEPs for their splendid cooperation but, above all, the shadow rapporteur, Karin JÃ¶ns, for her constant readiness to engage in discussion.
Finally, I would draw your attention to a printing error. In Article 25 of the conclusions, the Committee has clearly formulated the right to a class action.
This needs to be revised in the latest text we have before us.
The words 'appeals to the courts' must therefore be deleted and replaced with the words 'a class action' . The words then correctly correspond to the will of the Committee, as agreed.
Many thanks for your attention.
Mr President, this is a most useful report on a very important issue.
There are some parts I do not like, such as for instance paragraph 13 which promotes tax coordination.
I am proposing to table an amendment on that because, as the rapporteur knows, this is a subject particularly dear to the heart of UK Conservatives.
But the overall thrust of the report is very good.
There is another report out today which was an annual report from the Commission, referred to in today's Financial Times under the wonderful heading "Brussels demands labour reform".
To quote briefly from the article, "In its assessment of countries, the Commission will tell France that, like Germany, it must reduce 'fiscal pressure' on labour and reduce the 'administrative burden on companies'."
Certainly anything that promotes labour flexibility, liberates enterprise and reduces burdens on business must be good for the economies of those countries and for employment.
But it also addresses this problem of undeclared work.
The higher the tax, the more the red tape, the greater the incentive not to declare work.
I should like to make one further suggestion.
Countries with the highest undeclared work may well be recording the highest official unemployment figures, thereby attracting the highest offsetting regional funds.
This is perverse and it is in all our interests to address the problem.
Reducing tax and red tape would be a splendid start.
I urge Member States to follow the Commission advice and also to note the Glase report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a clear need for action on the issue of undeclared work in all the Member States, for there have not so far been many successes in combating it.
All the more reason, then, for me to welcome the Commission' s communication on undeclared work because it gets the discussion going at European level.
In this way, I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase.
We must unreservedly include the fight against undeclared work in European employment strategy.
With problems of this complexity, we need to exchange views, learn from each other and, in accordance with the tried and tested motto for our employment strategy, always seek best practice.
We must take a close look at the issue of undeclared work in order to be able to combat its various causes efficiently.
I would warn against over-simplification, three forms of which I would also at this point immediately oppose on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
The first point concerns the repeatedly made assertion according to which undeclared work is in the first place traceable to unduly high taxes and social security contributions.
I would say to my fellow MEPs in the conservative camp that things are really not that simple.
Let us take Austria and Italy, for example.
In Austria, taxes are significantly higher than in Italy. In spite of that, there is very much more undeclared work in Italy.
High taxes and social charges are therefore only one reason among many. Or look at Scandinavia.
There, taxes and social charges are somewhat higher still. On the other hand, the amount of undeclared work is comparatively small.
This no doubt also means that the quantity of undeclared work also has something to do with social acceptability, that is to say with a society' s social coherence.
Undeclared work must no longer remain a mere peccadillo.
Secondly, I should like to reject the argument that making the labour market more flexible would reduce the amount of undeclared work.
This would-be panacea does not in fact work.
The Thatcher era in Britain taught us that.
The amount of undeclared work rose then, despite the fact that the labour market was made more flexible and social charges were reduced.
Making the labour market more flexible is something which no doubt only works if correspondingly high social standards can be maintained.
Thirdly, undeclared work is not primarily the result of illegal immigration from third countries.
On the contrary, the majority of those who engage in undeclared work are our own citizens.
As Mrs Glase' s report shows, we need a sensible policy mix at national and European levels.
As a part of this, public authorities throughout the EU must also be jointly liable for ensuring that no contracts at all are awarded to companies whose quotations can quite clearly be traced back to the existence of undeclared work.
In the same way, companies need to be jointly and severally liable towards their sub-contractors.
However, we also want a right of class action which could help the trade unions, in particular, to take proceedings against those suspected of not declaring their employees or only partially declaring them.
Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Mrs Glase for her report, which is extremely efficient.
It is a very complex report which I described in committee as cautious in parts: cautious for reasons of necessity, if we consider that employment policy concerns the Member States, and therefore does not afford the European Parliament, or, by extension, Europe, genuine, practical competence in this matter.
So we are faced with a real, substantial difficulty to overcome.
As Mrs JÃ¶ns has just said, what we now need to do is develop a new strategy which looks at the entire question of work and employment from a global viewpoint, and calls upon the Member States first of all to make their situation public with regard to employment and undeclared work.
So far, we do not have detailed documentation for all the States; that is, we do not know the extent of the problem in all the Member States. We do not know the extent of the problem in the States which are hoping to join the European Union either.
It is a complex issue: the percentage is increasing every year in line with the gross domestic product; we have a remarkably high average of 15% across the countries of the European Union. This figure should make us think.
In any case, for all of us, illegal and undeclared work constitutes, by definition, an abuse of those who need to work, not least in terms of the tax burden which should ensure solidarity.
This is, therefore, a crime against society, which we as legislators must address, within the limits of our direct competence in this field.
However, there are specific recommendations in the report, for example specific procedures which could be implemented in order to fight the scourge of illegal or undeclared work.
I tabled some amendments, which have already been accepted by the rapporteur, and I will therefore not dwell on them.
I would just like to use the rest of the time available to mention an amendment which is particularly important to me and which I believe people found difficult to assess objectively: the amendment on illegal child labour, which I will summarise now.
It is claimed that child labour does not exist in Europe, but that it might exist - as has been stated - in Italy and southern countries.
This is not true!
Child labour exists everywhere: among immigrants or third-country nationals, among all those young people who drop out of education before they reach the age of majority, who are exploited, underpaid and untrained, thereby constituting a serious problem of exploitation and undeclared work because they do not have a qualification which can be used to ensure that they are adequately paid.
Lastly, the issue of illegal work also concerns children under 15 years old!
So let us not pretend that this problem does not exist in Europe, because it does exist, and Parliament should speak out resolutely on this matter too, in order to confirm the social, democratic and political maturity of this House.
Mr President, when we talk about undeclared work, let us not forget that we are talking about construction workers, who more exposed than anyone to bad weather and accidents at work, and that our discussions concern the outcasts working in sweatshops, deprived of any social status, often including the right to residence.
To these people we must also add workers in the new economy, whose working hours, time between shifts, and salaries are subject to the hazards of excessive insecurity and flexibility.
In short, we are talking about a form of exploitation in the workplace, which admittedly is detrimental to public finances due to lost revenue from tax and social contributions, but we must never forget that we are talking about the exclusion to which, according to the Commission, between 10 and 28 million citizens of the European Union are reduced.
Far from stigmatising these victims, we should be concerning ourselves with a specific type of employer criminality.
Lumping together those offering this type of work and those accepting it is inappropriate, even shocking.
The report that has been submitted to us is not entirely free from reproach in this respect, and nor, what is more, is the Commission's communication.
What should we do?
Integrate undeclared work into the labour market or adapt the job market to the existence of these excessively flexible types of work?
I fear that proposals consisting of reducing taxes and contributions and increasing the flexibility of the job market will only lead to even greater deregulation of the labour market, at the risk of these precursors of excessive flexibility eventually becoming legitimate.
As the report that has been submitted to us indicates, poverty fosters the prosperity of the black economy, obliging employees and the self-employed to accept it.
Staunchly fighting for the creation of quality activities and jobs, paying attention to working conditions and limiting insecurity are the surest methods of reducing the attractiveness of undeclared work in all sectors.
Measures also need to be taken to prevent certain conditions for sub-contracting and the award of public contracts from leading small businesses or the self-employed to seek illegal ways of achieving the profit margins forbidden to them by contractors.
We do not need to regulate less, but rather to give greater resources to the authorities responsible for monitoring work.
In some States, the Labour Code stipulates that every illegal contract must be re-classed as a full-time, permanent contract.
That would certainly be a very active policy and a strong incentive for the employers concerned to regularise the situation.
Mr President, there are different types of undeclared work.
It can be difficult drawing the line between undeclared and properly declared work.
Sometimes, the blame has to be placed upon individuals who do undeclared work in order to dodge paying tax.
The serious cases of undeclared work are those that are organised as such.
More often than not, many workers are involved, and the reason is that there are employers who organise, lead and distribute work that will go undeclared in order to keep wage costs down and reduce taxes for themselves.
That is the heart of the matter.
In many quarters, organised undeclared work is well-known, both among the local population and the authorities.
In those cases where no action is taken against such work, this may be because unemployment is high and poor people have no alternative to being exploited by employers who do not declare their employees.
There is also a tax argument which plays a big part in Mrs Glase' s thinking.
This subject has already been taken up in the debate.
Mrs JÃ¶ns observed quite correctly that in those regions and countries where the level of tax is fairly - or even very - high, where the labour market is well organised and where workers have strong unions, there is almost no undeclared work at all, at least not in any organised form.
If Mrs Glase and her group want to reduce tax in order to make undeclared work less profitable, this is as good as saying that they want to legalise the economic calculations behind undeclared work and make them the general rule.
It is like increasing the speed limit on the roads to reduce the number of drivers who break the law by driving too fast, or like legalising the drugs trade to reduce the amount of illegal drug dealing.
I was quite shocked to read the rapporteur' s original report in which she proposed that all employees in European workplaces should be forced to carry electronic cards so as constantly to be monitored by the authorities.
I believe it is the employers who organise production and take on workers. If anyone is to be compelled to carry electronic cards, it is therefore these employers, who are responsible for the work that is done.
My group and I believe that fighting unemployment and poverty is the best, and in fact the only, way of properly combating organised undeclared work.
Improved wages are a much better remedy than lower taxes and other concessions to irresponsible employers.
Mr President, I think we should begin by congratulating ourselves not only on the quality of Mrs Glase's work, but also on the fact that this subject has come before Parliament.
We are living in a Europe that is increasingly closer to its citizens and therefore we cannot omit to concern ourselves with employment, as employment, together with health, is one of the main concerns of the citizens and, I dare say, especially of those who are unemployed because they have lost their job or perhaps never had one.
We should ask the question whether those who are working in the hidden economy, working on the black market or, to use the most common term, carrying out undeclared work, really have an adequate job?
I do not think this is the right time to detail the harm done by undeclared work to the public funds and those carrying it out, due to their own position of insecurity, and to other employers, competitors or otherwise, and society in general.
The economic causes of undeclared work, increased income for workers, the opportunity to save on tax and social contributions or the reduction in costs for the company, are not unrelated to its existence and a significantly higher rate of growth than that of the legal or official economy.
To refer briefly to the sectors or groups in which undeclared work has the most scope for expansion, we need to include multi-job situations where the income obtained from this illegal work is supplementary; economically inactive people who have greater flexibility in terms of time and the case of the unemployed who want an additional income, often turning down offers of legal work.
We must also consider the situation of illegal immigrants who cannot carry out other forms of work.
In addition to these easily visible situations, it is assumed that there are also many cases of production decentralisation, outsourcing or subcontracting which, in a less direct, less visible way, can lead to undeclared work.
A situation which must be prevented and which I would like to consider is that of the new type of work via the Internet, teleworking, part-time work, which can be an easy breeding-ground for undeclared work.
Mr President, we must anticipate this, as Europe must opt for secure, stable, quality work, and undeclared work is neither stable nor secure and nor, of course, does it demonstrate solidarity.
Mr President, we must welcome the Commission' s decision to address the problem of undeclared work and I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on managing to clarify certain aspects of such a complex issue.
It is precisely because this is such a crucial issue that I should like to make two comments.
It is true that this is not just some sub-issue; it is a central issue which impacts on the efficiency of individual policies in the taxation, insurance and employment sectors.
With the rapid spread of undeclared work in industrialised countries, this phenomenon has ceased to be a typical feature of third world countries, for which the International Labour Organisation several decades ago coined the term "informal sector" , which is not the same as "black" or illicit work.
That is a mistake which I would ask the Commission to take into account.
What we are witnessing, in fact, is the emergence of two productive systems and two social models.
One in which producers operate by analysing the responsibilities and costs imposed by the system and another in which they operate to the detriment of the former and society as a whole.
What we must understand is that the future success of European initiatives in the employment, insurance and tax sectors depends on the way in which this issue is resolved; in other words, this issue is of equal importance to employers, workers and the rest of society.
Secondly, I think that the general reference to undeclared work or to certain general categories is the weak link in the approach to the problem: we all know that undeclared work cannot be dealt with as a single phenomenon and needs a policy which is differentiated by sector and sub-sector, depending on the people supplying it and the nature of the individual problem.
The various categories of people which supply it, such as immigrants, minorities, children, women, moonlighters etc. cannot all be dealt with in the same way.
There is a thriving undeclared sector and there are instances which only partially constitute undeclared work.
Then there is the matter of bogus self-employment and certain new forms of employment.
All these problems require innovative solutions; bans are not enough.
Mr President, the good news is that Europe has not run out of work.
The bad news is that, more and more often, work goes undeclared.
Failing to declare work is no mere peccadillo.
The wide-boy in the local pub who brags about ripping off the State should no longer be indulged.
In Germany, for example, work is being lost due to illegal employment and, for every ten thousand jobs, DM 240 million is lost in taxes and social security contributions.
In her splendid and balanced report, Anne Glase estimates the volume of undeclared work in the EU at between 10 and 20 per cent of GNP.
People who engage in undeclared work are to be found not only among the unemployed and among those who have entered the country illegally and have to suffer at the hands of those who profiteer from unemployment.
They are also to be found among part-time workers who, in addition, are working at night and in the evenings on their computers, as well as among the self-employed who do additional work they do not declare.
Those affected by this are small and medium-sized businesses which, unlike competitors who operate illegally, obey the law.
Jobs cannot be safeguarded in this way. Nor can new ones be created.
What is to be done?
Firstly, abuse of the rules governing work must be punished, with fines for those who engage in undeclared work and for those who employ others to do such work.
Those who hire workers who do not have work permits should be excluded from being awarded public contracts.
Moreover, they should expect to receive custodial sentences.
Secondly, thorough checks, including cross-border checks, by the relevant authorities are necessary.
Town clerks' offices must cooperate with factory inspectorates, and tax offices with immigration authorities, preferably in task forces.
Thirdly, incentives to abuse the system must be reduced.
Taxes and social charges payable by companies must be significantly reduced, as must VAT on labour-intensive services.
Fourthly, it is particularly important that there should be more awareness-raising campaigns in order to convince all relevant target groups that undeclared work needs to be combated.
It is extremely damaging both socially and economically.
Acting illegally is anti-social.
I should like to thank Mrs Glase for her excellent report.
The Commission has opened the debate with its communication on undeclared work in the spring of 1998.
We are pleased to say that it has stimulated debate both with the European institutions and within Member States.
The time has come to bring together the fruits of this debate.
Therefore I especially welcome Parliament's initiative in taking up this issue now.
The Commission's communication focused on the policy strategy to tackle this important problem.
It has highlighted the need for an integrated approach to combating undeclared work, involving both preventive measures and sanctions.
These deal with the two dimensions of undeclared work: it can be viewed as an issue of individuals taking advantage of the system and undermining solidarity in the process or as the outcome of greater flexibility in the labour market and slow adaptation of existing legislation.
I am pleased to see that Parliament has agreed with the Commission's analysis.
Parliament also seems to share the view that the main action has to be taken at the level of Member States.
Indeed it is the mix of the situation in the labour market, the tax and social security mix, as well as the social acceptance, that determine the level of undeclared work.
For that reason, the action that can be taken at Community level can only be minimal and has to be clearly targeted in those fields where the Community can have an impact.
The Commission is also convinced that undeclared work should be dealt with within the framework of the Luxembourg process.
We believe that undeclared work should be actively taken into account in the national action plans for employment.
We are working with the Member States to ensure that this is so.
We welcome Parliament's support in this.
However, the Commission can have an impact in developing a standard methodology to describe and record the extent of undeclared work and to assess its impact on the economy and on social solidarity.
This we have done with the Communication in 1998 and we will continue to do so.
Indeed the Commission is now carrying out a study on different measures used to combat undeclared work in selected Member States in order to identify good policy mixes.
Results of this study will be presented in a conference at the end of the year.
However, to have annual monitoring and reporting on this problem would be heavy procedurally while not adding much new.
We must not forget that undeclared work is a deeply rooted phenomenon.
Changes take time.
To keep this item on the agenda and to ensure that progress is reported we would suggest a triennial reporting exercise.
The Commission agrees with the analysis of Parliament that women, while not the majority of undeclared workers, often operate in situations of greater insecurity and exploitation.
Within its possibilities the Commission will continue to monitor the situation and report on it within the framework of existing reports on the principle of equal treatment.
That is very important to the need to maintain momentum in introducing and reinforcing equal opportunities for women and men.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)
Mr President, on a point of order.
Questions to the Council are no longer being answered in the time stipulated. Despite being warned on two occasions, the Council has not answered European Parliament questions.
Would you please ensure that the Council fulfils its obligations in this area as well?
Thank you, Mr RÃŒbig.
Your request and your comment will be dealt with appropriately.
Mr President, on a point of order.
Regarding the questions that will shortly be put to the Commission and the Council, you will be aware that the French Government, confronted by the fuel crisis that has gripped France along with the rest of Europe, took a number of measures yesterday which will drastically alter the conditions of competition and the basis of the fight against the greenhouse effect, and which will, therefore, have an immediate and serious impact on Europe.
Mrs Loyola de Palacio had an extremely interesting article published in the French press this morning on this European crisis.
Would it be possible for her and/or the Commissioner for Competition to speak during this part-sitting in order to tell us how the Commission intends to react to the fuel crisis, and how the Commission and the Council intend to prevent an outbreak of fiscal dumping in Europe and prepare Europe to deal with this crisis?
Of course, Mr Lipietz, the point that you have raised is very topical and very urgent, but the agenda has already been fixed, and therefore, I think it will be quite difficult to satisfy your request, although the President will do everything possible to deal with it.
Mr President, the honourable Member's request concerns a matter of importance.
The President has very clearly ruled out the possibility of a debate this morning.
I shall tell Mrs de Palacio and Mr Monti that Parliament would like to hear them and, together with the Presidency, we shall decide on a suitable time.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for making yourself available.
Sport
The next item is the joint debate on:
the Council statement on doping in sport and sport in society;
the Commission statement on football player transfers;
the report (A5-0203/2000) by Mrs Zabell, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Community support plan to combat doping in sport [COM(1999) 643 - C5-0087/2000 - 2000/2056(COS)]];
the report (A5-0208/2000) by Mr Mennea, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the report from the Commission to the European Council: With a view to safeguarding current sports structures and maintaining the social function of sport within the Community framework - The Helsinki report on sport [COM(1999) 644 - C5-0088/2000 - 2000/2055(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking you for devoting this morning to sport.
In eight days' time, the Olympic Games will be opening in Sydney. Athletes will be gathered there from all over the planet.
The results of the various competitions are not yet known; they are not predestined; in sport, anything can happen.
The champions who are preparing to enter this field of dreams have their own schedules.
Many are familiar with the world of professional sport, but, as you well know, all of them have at least two things in common.
Firstly, their selection is the climax of several years of effort and of meticulous training, with volunteers, coaches and public and private resources all mobilised on their behalf.
Secondly, and most importantly, they all began their sporting careers in an amateur club or at a school.
In order to promote sport, we must also - at the same time and as part of the same effort - promote local amateur clubs alongside top-level amateur and professional sport.
Sport at the highest level is the stuff of dreams; it contributes to the development of mass sports and, through them, to social education.
Elite sport, be it amateur or professional, receives global media coverage today.
More and more men and women, whatever their age and their circumstances, are taking part in a sport.
Sport has permeated the whole of society.
So, nobody here will be surprised to see how this human activity can sometimes be perverted by acts of violence or racism, or engender greed.
Far be it for me to demonise the economic aspect of sport.
Sport needs resources, and the public purse cannot provide all the necessary funding.
It is not a matter of distinguishing between a pure form of sport which is untainted by money and a sponsored form of sport which is corrupt.
No, the real question is a different one and may be expressed as follows: will the sporting community have the means to preserve the ethics of sport by harnessing the funds that flow into sport and ensuring that money does not rule sport?
Let us not beat about the bush. This problem is not one that will arise in twenty years' time; it is already a problem today.
Sporting events have become so attractive that financial interests seek to use them as a source of profits, even if it means sacrificing the ethics of sport and treating sportspeople as marketable commodities.
Who has not witnessed the sale and purchase of sportsmen, some of whom are still very young?
Who has not been shocked by the amounts that are paid for broadcasting rights or by the size of certain transfer fees?
Who has not been alarmed at the sight of increasingly overcrowded sporting calendars?
Who has not been concerned at the plans of certain private groups to create their own sports competitions, outside the jurisdiction of the national and international federations and on the basis of a single criterion, namely the size of the participating clubs' budgets, as we have recently seen in association football and, subsequently, in basketball too?
What kind of sport do we want for the twenty-first century?
The reply to this all-embracing, fundamental question depends on our response to the present situation.
There are two options: having identified these excesses, we could consider that sport no longer depends on anything but the market or sportspeople on anything but their added value.
In that case, we must apply the rules of competition and compound the present follies with a dose of deregulation, accepting, in the name of freedom of movement, the sale and purchase of youngsters aged between 18 and 20.
The other option is to decide, on the basis of the European sporting tradition that has been developed in modern times, with its humanist values and voluntary structures, and in the light of the present situation, with all its economic and social implications, that we should re-equip the sporting community with the legal and political instruments it requires to protect the entire range of sporting activities within the framework of their respective federations.
This second option, which is supported by the French Presidency, does not mean adhering to the status quo, but actually requires innovative proposals from the sporting community itself - and I am gratified to see that these have been forthcoming on the question of transfers - and from governments with a view to combating the excesses that are affecting the sporting world and to developing practices designed to protect the associations and, hence, the cohesion of each sport.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has already devoted a huge volume of work to this option, and we are starting to move forward within the Council too.
In June 1997, the sports ministers met at the Stade de France in Paris, and this was followed by meetings in Germany, Finland and Portugal.
There have been the annex to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the conclusions of the Vienna Council and, last December, the Helsinki report on the subject of sport.
Then, at Feira in Portugal, on the occasion of the Council meeting in June 2000, a clear call was made for the specific characteristics of sport to be taken into account in the application of Community policies.
It is the wish of the French Presidency that we should succeed in defining precisely what these specific characteristics are and what their recognition implies.
To be absolutely precise, it is a matter of recognising that sport is rooted in the everyday practice of millions of men, women and children, in the commitment of hundreds of thousands of volunteers; that it is an irreplaceable instrument of informal education, of social inclusion, of access to citizenship; that sport is, above all, a means by which the individual can grow and flourish and can encounter other people in a spirit of mutual respect.
Sport forms a whole.
We need cohesion throughout the Union.
I am delighted that this is emphasised in the report prepared by Mr Mennea and adopted by the Commission.
This approach is the basis on which my counterparts in the other fourteen Member States and I have been working, in close collaboration with Commissioner Viviane Reding.
After two meetings of the working parties established by the Portuguese Presidency, a meeting of the Troika, and a great many bilateral contacts with my counterparts from the other Member States, here are some of the objectives that seem to have attracted the broadest consensus within the Council.
The first question concerns the protection of under-age sportspeople.
We must be able to put an end to commercial transactions involving minors.
Specific measures should be taken to protect the health of young athletes, especially to prevent any recourse to performance-enhancing drugs, and to ensure that they complete their education and vocational training.
To that end, the subject has been placed on the agenda of the Council of Youth Ministers for its meeting on 9 November.
I am very hopeful that, having regard to the 1994 Directive on the protection of young people at work, we shall be able to offer the prospect of precise recommendations on this point.
Secondly, I also wish to see measures taken to maintain the development policies of sports clubs.
Sports federations and governments should be able, if they so wish, to take appropriate measures to protect the clubs that develop young talent.
It must be possible to insert provisions such as a clause requiring young players to sign their first professional contract with the club where they have received youth training, perhaps with compensation proportionate to the cost of their training to indemnify the latter club if such a player is transferred.
At the same time, the international sports authorities have a responsibility to take action to control club management in order to avoid excesses, especially in relation to transfers.
Thirdly, in the wider context, it seems to me that there is an urgent need to recognise the unique central role played by the federations.
I believe it is necessary to acknowledge the key role of the sports federations in organising sports competitions, in formulating the rules of their respective sports and in awarding titles.
This does not mean that I advocate vesting these rights in the federations without demanding anything from them in return.
That is why I envisage that the recognition of these exclusive rights should be accompanied by the imposition on sports federations of precise duties and responsibilities relating to their obligation to serve the public interest and to redistribute their commercial revenue equitably.
Identifying the specific features of sport is an enormously complex undertaking.
Significant progress in this direction is a matter of urgency.
I believe we are caught up in a race against the clock.
France has decided to make this a priority of its presidency.
I have great faith in the contribution that will come from your Parliament.
I have taken note, by the way, of your call for the inclusion of an article in the Treaty and see it as a manifestation of your will to ensure that due consideration is given to these concerns.
Let me turn now to the fight against doping, which is an absolute priority issue.
I am also aware that the European Parliament shares this concern, as your reports and resolutions show.
You know that it is a long and arduous struggle, one which has to be waged relentlessly for the sake of public health and the sporting ethic.
Recent events show that we still have a long way to go.
Be that as it may, I refuse to join the defeatists who want us to throw in the towel on the grounds that drugs are endemic in sport today.
We need to enlist the support of the sporting community, but there is an equal need to enlist the support of governments and the European Union.
The World Anti-Doping Agency that has now been created owes its existence to the will of the European Union.
The International Olympic Committee has established the objectives of its fight against the use of drugs at the Olympic Games in Sydney.
Nevertheless, as you know, a debate is raging across the Member States of the European Union on the expediency of direct EU membership of the organs of the World Anti-Doping Agency and, hence, on whether the EU should help to fund the agency.
I wish to lay particular emphasis on this point, because it has emerged from our exchanges with the European Commission that the latter will not commit itself to the participation of the European Union as such unless it receives a strong and unanimous political signal in favour of participation.
I, for my part, believe that we have the legal basis for participation.
Doping is unquestionably a matter of public health.
One need only consider the increase in the consumption of performance-enhancing drugs by young amateur sportspeople.
It also has to do with the fight against trafficking and, thus, with police and customs cooperation.
Lastly, the struggle against doping also relates to the development of research.
As is proposed in the report prepared by Mrs Zabell and adopted by the parliamentary committee, the aim would be for the European Union to be able to speak positively, with one voice, in order to guarantee the effectiveness of the Agency.
While we await the resolution of the legal questions regarding the involvement of the European Union in the Agency, my Troika colleagues and I have established a liaison committee, which will be very useful.
There will also be a need to ensure that the Agency grows in stature so that it has the power to act in every country.
Public opinion, sportswomen, sportsmen and everyone who is interested in these Games expect these decisions to be taken.
The credibility of the anti-doping effort depends on it.
Ladies and gentlemen, European sport is at the crossroads.
I hope it will continue to be a field of dreams, just as I hope that it will keep giving young people the educational and integrative framework they need - in short, that it will remain a school of life for our children.
But the greed that it arouses and the threat that emanates from such greed must be taken seriously.
I am convinced that the clear positions you are preparing to adopt through these two reports will be a great asset in this debate.
I wish to thank you for that and to tell you how fervently I hope that we shall be able to continue this work together.
Mr President, Parliament has asked me to make a statement on the transfer system and on the whole panic which has gripped the world of sport and which the press has been echoing.
I have naturally taken note of Mrs Buffet's statements.
Let me also convey to her my sincere thanks for the work that the French Presidency has been doing in the interests of sport and for the solidarity it has demonstrated with the Commission and with Parliament.
It is my fervent hope that these efforts by the French Presidency will be rewarded with a very favourable outcome for sport at the European level.
Mr President, I shall respond to the report on doping in sport and sport in society at the end of the debate, if I may.
For the moment I shall confine myself to a statement on the transfer issue.
The approach that the Commission has adopted with regard to sport is defined in its Helsinki report.
We want sport to have a social function.
This report invites the sporting community, the Member States and the European Union to pool their efforts in order to ensure that sport, in its new economic environment, will continue to act as an instrument of education and integration on the basis of its values of fair play, equal opportunities and the pursuit of merit.
It goes without saying that the provisions of Community law, especially those based on the principles of non-discrimination and free movement of persons, as well as the rules of competition, are applicable to sport.
It is equally self-evident that, as the declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises, the European Community recognises the social impact of sport and the importance of dialogue with the sporting community.
This is the context, ladies and gentlemen, in which the Commission, under the direct responsibility of my colleague Mario Monti, has been examining several aspects of competition as they relate to sport.
The Commission recognises that the sporting community is free to determine the rules that will ensure the proper administration of their respective sports.
The Commission recognises the specific nature of sport in the sense that some degree of equality is needed in competition between players and clubs so as to guarantee the uncertainty of results, which is the very essence of sport, as the Minister has just emphasised.
The Commission is investigating only those aspects of sport with a Community dimension and an economic dimension.
Regarding the matter of current FIFA rules governing transfers, I must remind you that, back in 1998, following a number of complaints, the Commission questioned the compatibility of the FIFA transfer rules with the rules of competition and sent FIFA a list of grievances.
The Commission believes that the FIFA rules on transfers unfairly obstruct freedom of movement.
This is especially true of the rules which lay down conditions of transfer on expiry of a player's contract, even though the contract has been duly terminated in accordance with national employment legislation and with its own terms and the contractually agreed financial indemnity has been determined and paid.
Contrary to what some press articles have been suggesting, the Commission has no intention of simply abolishing the transfer system or of creating a situation in which players would be able to terminate their contracts on a sudden impulse.
The Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, wishes FIFA to apply a transfer system which complies with the principles of Community law as well as respecting the unique nature of sport.
The present system, however, satisfies neither of these criteria.
It obstructs competition between clubs as well as players' freedom of movement, it has done nothing to prevent the over-commercialisation of sport or the widening of the gulf between the rich clubs and those with limited financial resources, nor has it prevented players - especially the youngest players - from becoming targets of financial speculation.
For many years, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has been waiting 'patiently' for FIFA to present a formula that could replace the present system, to offer a basis on which we could work together in search of a universally satisfactory and equitable solution.
Mario Monti and I have established contacts with the footballing world.
We have made the point that, under national codes of employment legislation, some form of compensation is warranted when a player breaks his contract with one club in order to join another.
We have emphasised that, in order to avoid distorting championship competitions, we are naturally disposed to accept rules limiting transfers to particular fixed periods and, above all, we have stressed that efforts made to develop young talent must be encouraged, which means that we can accept a compensation mechanism designed to reflect the expense incurred by a club in the development of young players, provided that such a mechanism does not put young players in a position of undue dependence on their clubs.
For a number of years, and until a few days ago, we had received no reply.
The Commission certainly cannot wait indefinitely, which is why Mario Monti and I have been declaring very plainly over the past few months that FIFA must propose other solutions or run the risk of having its rules banned in the EU - something that no one would wish to happen.
Mario Monti and I are pleased to learn that our plea seems to have been heeded this time.
Last week FIFA admitted that its transfer rules do not conform to Community legislation, and it announced its intention of establishing a new system.
Since the details of that system have yet to be finalised, I cannot comment on them at the present time.
We have, however, received an initial outline of the proposals.
This afternoon I shall be meeting with FIFA officials and a delegation from the national leagues.
They too will be making proposals.
Mario Monti's departments are ready to examine these, within the shortest possible time, with the aid of my departments and those of Anna Diamantopoulou.
Our doors are always open to any debate or any negotiations that will help us to arrive at a consensus.
Allow me to conclude by underlining the commitment of the Commission to the European model of sport and its values.
The European Parliament has affirmed on many occasions - for which I am deeply grateful to it - that it shares this commitment.
I believe you will reaffirm this by adopting the parliamentary report devoted to the Helsinki report.
The French Presidency, as I said at the start of my speech, has testified to this same attachment to sport and its values on behalf of the Council.
So, if I am not mistaken, we are all on the same wavelength.
The Commission is acting in the interests of sport to preserve the beautiful game, and I am convinced that, if we all pull our weight, a satisfactory solution will soon be in sight for the good of sport, for the good of football and for the good of Europe.
Mr President, doping is not a new problem. It did not even start this century, but comes from the last century.
In fact, the first death from doping took place in 1896, when a cyclist took drugs.
The first measures against doping, however, began to be taken after the first Helsinki Olympic games in 1952, but it was in the Tour de France of 1998 that the problem became too big and the serious fight against it began.
In fact, we have already heard this morning that it is a priority for the French Presidency, the Council and also for the Commission.
We have to assess why this problem exists and why doping has increased so much in recent years.
On the one hand, it is worth mentioning the over-commercialisation that is affecting sport, as well as the saturation of sporting calendars and greater demands on sportsmen and women, both physical and mental.
Before, the motto of sport was that of Pierre de Coubertin, 'the important thing is taking part' . Now, however, it seems that whoever comes first wins, whoever comes second loses, and the rest just take part.
On the other hand, we should not forget that, these days, an increasing number of tests are being done, many of them outside competitions, and this also means that, logically, more cases of doping are being discovered.
However, it is very important to distinguish between the two types of doping: on the one hand, there is intentional or planned doping, that is, a team plans which substances the sportsman or woman needs to take, and when, in order to improve his or her physical performance.
Logically, this is more common in sports with greater financial resources.
On the other hand, there is accidental doping, which often does not even improve the sportsman or woman' s physical performance.
This tends to be more common in sports which have few resources, so that often public opinion does not even realise what has happened.
Obviously, we have to fight both types of doping, although each one should be approached in a very different manner.
Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult.
Police cooperation plays a very important role, because we should not forget that the trafficking of doping substances is worth EUR 1 billion per year.
It is also important to listen to sportsmen and women when drawing up sporting calendars or planning a competition or trial. Sometimes, we ask them to do more than is physically possible without turning to external help.
Overall, we need to fight doping globally.
It is not an isolated problem for one Member State and therefore the presence of the European Union in the World Anti-Doping Agency is absolutely essential.
Combating accidental doping is much easier.
It is mainly due to the lack of information among sportsmen and women, and the report therefore proposes that there should be an indicator on the boxes of pharmaceutical products, consisting of five Olympic rings and a traffic light.
Thus, when buying a drug, sportsmen and women will be able to clearly see the red traffic light indicating the risk of testing positive, or the green light which indicates that there is no risk, or the amber light indicating that there may be a risk and that they should contact their doctor or a specialist for advice.
This is very important, because we now have fifteen Member States with fifteen lists of prohibited substances, and in each country there can be a different brand name for the same drug.
For this purpose, we ask for the intervention of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency.
However, even though the types of doping are different, sportsmen and women receive the same treatment and from the moment that they have a positive result they are considered to be guilty, with no right to prove their innocence and without an assessment of whether the doping was intentional or not, as occurs with other things in life.
We also call on the European Commission to request that the Fifth Framework Programme carry out research into doping substances and their impact on the health of sportsmen and women, detection methods and the natural limits of hormones that can be produced by the human body.
With regard to laboratories, it is very important that they comply with ISO standards on uniform methods for collecting and analysing samples, and also that there should be protection and confidentiality, both in collection and in dealing with the case, in order to preserve sportsmen and women' s right to honour and privacy.
Finally, I will mention penalties.
When a person other than the sportsman or woman has taken part, such as a club, an association, a federation, a doctor, a coach, etc., that person should also be subject to a penalty, exactly equal to that given to the sportsman or woman, because we should not forget that the person with the shortest working life will always be the sportsman or woman.
Mr President, the European Union must act to ensure that sport is given its rightful place and due attention and that it is regulated by clear, precise rules.
The system of sport which the European Union must aspire to must make the right to sport for all citizens a practical reality and aim to preserve the social function and traditional values of sport, while taking into account its economic and legal development.
This is why the declaration on sport in the Treaty of Amsterdam annex is no longer sufficient to ensure that the predetermined objectives are met.
Sport needs a new definition: indeed, it should be considered as an activity that is an integral part of the education and training of young people, free time and the integration of socially excluded and disabled people.
In short, sport must be an essential factor in promoting the education and integration of all social classes.
Moreover, it must be able to adapt to the new business context, within which it must evolve without losing its autonomy.
Some changes are needed so that the European Union can help with the developments in the world of sport.
The central committee has stated several times that it can no longer guarantee the pyramid structure on the basis of which sporting organisations and the social function of sport are currently organised.
A legal basis is therefore essential since, without one, there is a danger that the objectives that have been reached so far will come to nothing.
Europe must be more forceful in the fight against doping, a phenomenon which, unfortunately, is growing very rapidly and is no longer confined to the world of sport: the spread of this scourge has led to an increase in highly lucrative illegal activities, in which many criminal organisations have been involved, and we need to recognise that entrusting the fight against doping solely to sporting organisations has been a complete failure.
Europe should therefore look into the possibility of promulgating Community criminal legislation which would be valid in all the Member States, and should consider setting up an independent, transparent, European anti-doping agency.
Moreover, all sports-related economic activities must be subject to the rules of the EC Treaty.
The monopolistic activity of sporting organisations has caused numerous problems and must therefore be subject to strict checks and possibly reduced.
We need to encourage sporting associations, provided that aims are established to support amateur sport and to show solidarity with less-advantaged people, particularly the disabled.
We need to try to improve the role played by sport and the role of the teaching of physical education in the curricula of schools.
Furthermore, the work and status of sportspersons should be properly appreciated and safeguarded by the Member States. I feel that it is the European Union' s duty to help reintegrate into the labour market athletes who have made no provision for their futures once their sporting activity comes to an end.
Europe must also call for sportspersons' professional qualifications to be recognised at European level and for their vocational training to be promoted.
There must be a firm, determined fight against the trade in young sportspersons, calling for the entry of young people into professional sport and their membership to take place as late as possible.
Moreover, we need to ensure that the statutes of national and international sporting federations lay down mission statements and contain clear, precise rules.
We need to combat the violence which takes place at sporting events and ensure that our citizens are protected.
Furthermore, we need to eliminate the permanent sporting contract currently used in many sporting federations, as this violates the most basic principles of the Member States' constitutions.
In conclusion, until a legal basis is established for 'sport' , Europe will not be able to do much in this area and will therefore have to consider the possibility of taking on a certain amount of autonomy in the sector, not in order to take it away from other bodies, but so that it can make an essential contribution to safeguarding the values and functions of sport.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was first and foremost concerned that the treaty provisions put into concrete terms by the Bosman judgment should also be observed in future European Union policy.
We are therefore grateful to the committee responsible that it has incorporated the requests to this effect into its report. We also unreservedly support the Commission's position on this issue.
This is necessary because of competition law and freedom of movement for workers. Mrs Reding has already made this point very well.
I therefore regret all the more that it has become evident over the last few days that many people in positions of authority in football and other sporting associations are unable to learn lessons and enter into a dialogue.
Judging by the statements made over the last few days, you cannot help feeling that the assumption that a lot of footballers' talents lie more in their legs than between their ears is quite justified.
So, when we now hear calls for Heads of Government to get involved and turn European law on its head, as it were, then I feel bound to say that this demonstrates that people clearly have no idea what the legal position is.
This has got nothing to do with Heads of State and Government at all.
It is the European Commission that is responsible for ensuring that the Treaties are respected.
And the Commission is exercising precisely that remit.
I would like to say, once again, that I unreservedly support the position being taken by the Commission on this issue.
Mr President, ten days before the start of the Olympic Games, the spectre of doping is hovering over Sidney.
The International Olympic Committee cannot be serious with its talk of 'clean' Olympic Games when we all know that 1,000 syringes of erythropoietin were stolen from a Sidney hospital a month ago and when one legend of the Olympic spirit after another now openly maintains that there are anti-doping tests for every banned substance only the International Olympic Committee prefers to bow to pressure from big business than to apply them.
Minister Buffet, who has addressed us so eloquently here today, stated in Le Monde on 4 August that the basic ingredient missing in the fight against doping was strong political will.
But it would appear to be difficult to exercise this will when there is the pressure of commercialisation and the pressure, encapsulated in the thoughtless and superficial motto of the Olympic Games, to be 'faster, higher, stronger' .
It is even more difficult to exercise this political will when the supply of banned substances is much more in demand, with a turnover, as we have heard, of a billion euros, although this turnover is much higher - much, much higher - if we include the mild doping which is spreading through gyms, beauty centres and God knows where else.
We need to bring our political clout to bear as quickly as possible, we need to harmonise lists of dangerous substances, methods of testing for the new substances which industry is constantly producing, we need to apply sanctions, we need to find out who is responsible and apply sanctions.
Of course, the European Union needs to take a more active role in the World Anti-Doping Agency, precisely as the President of the Council described, and I agree with him.
I should like to finish by saying that this World Anti-Doping Agency is quite simply an observer in Sidney today.
And, as long as we are just observers, nothing will be done in the fight against doping.
Mr President, sport is a popular activity.
We have just had Euro 2000, the Olympic Games are about to start, and, what is more, there are an increasing number of people who enjoy sports as a leisure activity.
It is healthy and brings people together from all walks of life, irrespective of age or race.
This is, of course, extremely important in a society which increasingly focuses on the individual.
At the same time, as has already been pointed out, there is also a downside to sport, namely violence around the pitches, the use of doping, an increase in the use of performance-enhancing substances - also increasingly so in amateur sport - and the huge pressure on sportsmen and women due to the major economic interests involved.
This is why we welcome with open arms the fact that the European Commission has taken it upon itself to highlight the social aspect of sport and to examine how the economic dimension of sport can be reconciled with the educational and other roles that sport fulfils.
The PPE-DE is entirely behind this objective and has tabled amendments to give this initiative a boost.
It has, more specifically, submitted proposals to step up the support given to sports organisations, in order to invest in people, in team spirit and to improve the legal framework underpinning sport, as all we have at the moment is the declaration to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
With regard to a few specific problems which sport is having to contend with, I would like to say the following on the issue of transfers.
The Bosman ruling has mainly hit the smaller clubs, as the Commissioner has already pointed out, especially in the smaller countries, such as the Netherlands where I am from.
These clubs invariably need to make major investments in training and education without sufficient backing or compensation.
We therefore hope that the Commission, in tandem with the sports organisations, will produce proposals which will make amends in the short term.
The sports federations, such as UEFA and FIFA, have also submitted proposals to this effect.
Doping is a huge, international problem, as already pointed out by the rapporteur, who has drafted an excellent report, and it is therefore vital for there to be international cooperation in this respect.
We will need to agree internationally on what we take doping to mean and will need to refer to the World Anti-Doping Agency.
It would be useful if pharmaceutical products could be labelled with a 'doping-safe' logo and a warning, and we would also welcome a more pro-active preventive policy.
Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, Commissioner, the Group of the Party of European Socialists asked the Commission to make a statement on the topical subject of football transfers and for it to be added to this joint debate.
I welcome the statement made by the Commissioner, which has our support.
I recommend that, in future, she should come to Parliament before so many leaks occur from the Commission administration, which forced the Commissioner to face the press with great courage and determination, not afraid to tell them the truth.
It would be better if they came to Parliament first and had our support.
The subject of transfers is perhaps an example that sums up the current situation of sport.
There are two reports, the Zabell report and the Mennea report, drawn up by Olympic champions.
On the eve of the Sydney Olympics, I would like to recall that the first, and perhaps the best, contribution to peace made by Europe, that is, by ancient Greece, was precisely the Olympic Games.
They talk of sport as a citizen' s right, with a social and cultural function.
There is a component of transfer fees that is justified in terms of the contribution that is made to training and preparing sportsmen. This makes sense and needs to be regulated, and we need to support young people and small clubs so that they can promote themselves.
Another dimension is the big business involved, which in many countries is becoming the second largest sector in the economy.
We are dealing with uncontrolled, unsustainable long-term speculation.
A major club in my native city made the biggest transfer in football history - EUR 70 million.
The person involved has said that it is absurd, and the chairman of the club has said that it is in a very grave economic situation.
If we were applying the rules of economics, we would have to act differently.
Therefore, I think that the Commission should act.
It has managed to make FIFA begin to see sense.
My group and I would like to show our support for the Commission and we maintain that action has to continue that will really express and guarantee this right of Europeans.
Finally, I would like to point out that there has been talk of the collapse of the world of football.
In the United States in the 1940s, under anti-trust legislation, the same measures were applied in Hollywood as those that the Commission is proposing.
But Hollywood did not go under. Quite the opposite.
We now have a considerable economic problem in coping with the clout of the American film industry.
Therefore, keep going, Commissioner.
I welcome the fact that the Zabell report tries to address the problem of intentional doping and proceeds from the presumption of innocence based on the charter of human rights.
Unfortunately, UK athletes - Linford Christie, Dougie Walker and Gary Cadogan - were not presumed to be innocent by the International Athletics Association.
Despite evidence, based on research by Aberdeen University, that nandrolene could be produced by a combination of dietary supplements and vigorous training, Mark Richardson is still waiting, eight days before the Olympics, in the Olympic village not knowing whether he is going to compete or not.
Linford Christie has campaigned throughout his career against doping in sport.
He would not do anything now to jeopardise that.
These cases demonstrate the need for the World Anti-Doping Agency to harmonise disciplinary procedure that would safeguard the rights of athletes but, at the same time, swiftly punish those who knowingly take drugs and are guilty of taking drugs.
Mr President, I would first like to support what Mr Mennea has said, and then to ask this question: do we see the social significance of sport as the old 'bread and circuses' or 'bread and sport' , or do we see it as a means of improving health and building moral fibre?
It has never been clear what social significance we should attribute to it.
By and large, I have to say that the top-level sport we are generally talking about here is not necessarily a healthy pursuit, any more than the extreme sports that I go in for, or used to do.
Only the gods on Mount Olympus can say whether top-level sport is healthy or not - we certainly cannot.
Let me turn to the facts now.
Because of globalisation, our consumer society has become ever more hungry for stars, sensations and records.
So, officials and businessmen have turned 'bread and sport' into a branch of show business that is now one of the biggest in the world, and the process of commercialisation, is of course, continuing.
And the systematic doping that this commercialisation encourages is simply intensifying this process.Those are the facts of the matter.
There is no way we can change those facts unless we create greater transparency, and unless we set up an independent anti-doping agency which is accessible to everyone and which everyone understands.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one point that I should like to emphasise, a point which is perhaps common to both reports. It revolves around the legitimacy of the specific status of sport, which I should like us to stress today.
The specific status of sport derives primarily from the sports system, from the social pyramid which is reflected in the structure of small clubs in our towns and rural areas as well as in major sporting events.
This pyramid must be respected in a number of ways.
It must be respected by recognising the sole right of federations to govern their respective sports and by promoting the role that the sports federations can and do play in bonding communities and society at large.
In so doing, we must, of course, ensure that money is distributed fairly throughout the entire pyramid formed by the clubs and their federations and that what we might call the sporting ethic is applied to all sporting events.
Let us not forget that it is possible to confuse those who stage events with those who provide the spectacle.
I believe that an effort has to be made there in the way sport is structured, a point that was raised in Mr Mennea's report, so that there can be no possible confusion between those who stage the event and those who provide us with the information, the spectacle, the entertainment, the pleasure and the dreams.
There is the system, and then there is the individual too.
And, of course, there is the issue of doping - and I thank Mrs Zabell here for her magnificent report; all of these are relevant to the health aspect of sport.
There is the training of sportspeople.
But what happens to the individual outside the arena?
We have been reminded that sportsmen and sportswomen are not commodities, that they are not goods and chattels.
They must be able to move freely in Europe, but they are not products. They are individuals.
So what happens when the competition is over?
As far as the system and its focal point, the sportsperson, are concerned, what the reports are calling for is the rationalisation of the specific nature of sport in our European Union.
Considerations of time - the calendar of events and the course of sportspeople's lives - have been highlighted in both reports, and I thank the two rapporteurs for emphasising the need to live before, during and after sport and throughout the whole year.
So you will understand why we in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport are asking for sport to be enshrined in Article 151 of the Treaty in such a way that its specific character is legitimised and that we no longer have to dip into the provisions on health, on education and on employment in order to assemble a case for the preservation of this specific character of sporting activity.
Mr President, doping is symptomatic of the inverted values of our societies, in which the end has come to justify the means.
It is primarily a form of cheating, with individuals cheating themselves as well as cheating others.
That is why there is a need to establish a vast education programme to reinstate the true values of sport and to make it,once again, a school of life and an example for our youngest generations.
At every level, including the very highest, sport should be an opportunity to teach the virtues of endeavour, courage, team spirit and respect for others.
The Commission was right to remind us that one of the first causes of the increased prevalence of doping lies in the commercial implications of modern sport.
That is why our reflections should focus more sharply on the possibility of imposing stiffer penalties on the various economic operators who encourage doping or profit from it.
Finally, the reason why sport has assumed an important and indeed a central place in our contemporary societies is perhaps because it has become the only means open to a nation to demonstrate its greatness.
Perhaps the nations ought to rediscover other ways of projecting their greatness and their pride on the world stage, and I cannot help thinking at this moment of national currencies, which are an essential attribute of a country's sovereignty and grandeur.
Today, as the euro, the currency of the Euro-optimists, plummets, it is an urgent necessity that all nations should be able to keep their own currency, just as they keep their national sports teams, of which they are so proud, with no need of artificial stimulants.
Mr President, on the eve of the Sydney Games, what remains of the Olympic ideal and the exalted principles of Pierre de Coubertin?
Not much, apparently, since some athletes - a minority, I am glad to say - are refusing to stay in the Olympic village, considering it to be below their station.
Others, especially the sprinters, are proclaiming loud and long that they are only running to promote their particular brand of footwear.
While it is worrying that top athletes are more motivated by the lure of financial gain than by the sporting ethic, mass sport, by contrast, is a guarantor of good physical and mental health and constitutes a veritable school of life, developing team spirit, tolerance and solidarity and presenting young people with exemplary role models.
An instrument of education and of social integration and cohesion, sport helps to combat racism, exclusion and violence, but sport, sadly, is being increasingly contaminated by doping, all in the name of business.
Professional sport has undoubtedly become a business in its own right, subject to the dictates of profitability.
Some football clubs are already listed on the stock market.
But as more and more money is invested in sport, the financial rewards gradually come to take precedence over the game itself.
This creates pressure to win by fair means or foul and particularly by means of doping, which is becoming ever harder to detect.
How can the sporting ethic be restored?
First of all, the fight against doping must be globalised.
Doping seriously damages athletes' health as well as the essential virtues of sport, namely honesty, fair play, respect for one's opponent, friendship, etc. In that respect, the creation of a World Anti-Doping Agency by the International Olympic Committee in 1999 has to be welcomed.
Let us hope that it remains independent and that it will become operational very soon.
It is our job to give it the tools it needs to accomplish its mission.
Doping is not only a European problem; it is indubitably a problem of global dimensions.
As far as regulation is concerned, it is not up to Europe to make the rules.
Europe must show its trust in the voluntary bodies by accepting the proposals from the federations and from other Olympic committees.
The Bosman decision, for example, which was taken in the name of high principles, has destabilised professional clubs and has exacerbated the impact of money on European football.
The latest transfer record, set when Figo moved to Real Madrid, is a case in point.
Clubs in certain countries now build their teams almost exclusively with foreign players.
This is particularly true of Barcelona, where they are able to field a team without a single Spanish player, which effectively makes it impossible for young nationals to play at the highest level in their country.
The plundering of young players from the clubs that have developed their skills is another consequence.
Transfer targets are becoming younger and younger: a player becomes transferable at the age of 15.
Europe is now trying to legislate on the rules governing transfers, as you, Commissioner, have told us.
If the scheme under consideration is implemented, which I hope it will not be, the result will be total deregulation of the system, which will benefit the richest clubs still further and despoil the clubs that develop young talent, condemning them to eventual closure.
The cure is worse than the disease.
It is therefore essential that we do our utmost to develop mass sport, village clubs, so that everyone can take part in sport and so that every sportsperson who enjoys competing can progress and strive for a place among the elite in healthy and fair competition.
This is an important debate, and I want to endorse the ideas coming out of the two reports, particularly those of Mrs Zabell on doping and also Mrs Lynne's remarks about the presumption of innocence, because that is important.
We all recognise nowadays that sport is big business.
This is particularly clear in football with its enormous transfer fees, often ridiculously high salary levels, and stock market deals, but it is not just football.
Other sports have a lot of money sloshing around.
Formula 1 is a good example.
In, the UK they even had a million pounds to spare for the Labour Party.
Sport has a lot of money and it cannot expect to be exempt from free market rules.
I do, however, disagree with the reports when they call for a Treaty clause on sport.
Jacques Santer was absolutely right when he said Europe must do less but do it better.
So let us try to operate within our means. Let us try to operate within the powers that we already have.
What is needed regarding transfer fees is a healthy dose of pragmatism and common sense.
I endorse the Commissioner's remarks this morning.
I have absolute confidence in her abilities and attitude and wish her well in her forthcoming discussions.
I would, however, say that there is no rush.
FIFA has certainly been very slow to act and should be criticised for that, but the Commissioner must also be prepared to listen to the small clubs, the players' organisations, and spectators.
Let us work for a good solution that we can defend rather than working for a solution this afternoon, or this week, or this month.
It is something that needs to be sorted out so that the people of Europe will understand.
Europe needs friends, not enemies.
Let us not add football spectators to those people who do not understand what Europe is about.
Come up with a good solution and you will have the backing of this House and the backing of football supporters across Europe.
Mr President, I also thank Mr Mennea and Mrs Zabell for highlighting the crucial role that sport is now playing in all of our lives, I have to start by saying that sport's importance as an industry is well known, but for sport to become just another industry would be a mistake and a great loss to our society.
We are all living longer, and sport is occupying a greater part of our time.
It is there not just to revitalise our bodies but also our minds and our souls, and we have to recognise the importance of that fact in European legislation.
I therefore support the call for a legal basis that will put our powers on a par with those of the very important international sports organisations.
Europeans share a love of watching and participating in football, from Newcastle through Dortmund to Barcelona, but it is important that local people should be inspired to join their clubs.
I would therefore say that the most enduring teams should be built up from scratch and not simply bought up.
The system needs well-run machinery consisting of clubs of all shapes and sizes and degrees of professionalism and we need to take the opportunity to reform it.
I support, therefore, Commission statements and the Commissioner's action on this matter.
Sport has a huge potential.
It has shown that it can build understanding and fight racism.
Let us do more work in sport to bring our communities together.
It has shown that it has the power to encourage disabled athletes to succeed.
Let us show that we share their pride and build joint events for them and able-bodied people.
Violence on the field has been the bad side of sport.
Let us work to ensure that sport is violence-free.
Doping, finally, is a symptom of the over-commercialisation of sport.
As our teams head off to Sydney they are under more pressure than ever.
We have to set up facilities that fight doping on an international basis because, as we have seen, one false accusation can ruin a career or cast a shadow over an exemplary career, such as that of Linford Christie.
Therefore, we support these reports and hope that they will provide the foundation for us to move forward into the next phase of European sport, a community spirit to build the industry and the potential of sport in Europe.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Mennea, for this extremely valuable report.
Sport fulfils a major social role in our society; that much is clear.
Professional sport fulfils this role too and has great social significance.
I have tabled an amendment to Mr Mennea' s report, naturally with his consent, proposing a possible alternative to the transfer system.
I happen to believe that the performance on the pitch which we are discussing, in other words the job performance, is no longer proportionate to current remuneration levels.
For this reason, I believe it is merely a commercial activity which should be distributed evenly.
I would like to know whether you have a response to this.
Secondly, on behalf of a large number of fellow MEPs, I have requested the final decision with regard to reforming the transfer system to be postponed.
You commented on it yourself a moment ago. The reason being that UEFA, together with a large number of national football federations, is organising a meeting during the next part-session in October and I would ask you to attend, together with Mr Monti.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no sportsman or woman takes drugs unless he or she has a financial interest in doing so.
There is no doubt that doping is changing sport and that sport will be changed due to doping, which means it will become absolutely ludicrous if we do nothing to prevent it.
The combination of enormous and disproportionate financial, media and sponsoring interests surrounding sportsmen and women puts so much pressure on them, and the intensity of sport is so great, that in order to maintain their level of competitiveness and the pace imposed on them by sporting calendars, sportsmen and women tend to use prohibited substances.
Without limiting the length of competitions and without having obligatory rest time, it will be very difficult to eradicate doping.
However, we should not forget that sportsmen and women are also human beings who can fall ill or injure themselves, and will therefore need drugs and additional help to combat the stress under which they place their bodies, which is why false positive tests are the order of the day and will brand the sportsman or woman concerned forever.
What we need to do is to harmonise criteria, have a single list of prohibited substances, homogenise tests, have warnings on drugs and do more research.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to reinvent sport, because as it is at the moment there is a battle for glory, but also for money and sponsorship.
In order for it not to disappear, we need to go back to the traditional values of sport, in which people compete for one reward only - a medal.
NGL). (EL) Mr President, we live in an era in which Europe is moving towards federalisation.
We might say that sport has got there first, that sport built structures before we were able to do so at political, economic or other levels.
Why?
Because sport had its roots in ancient Greek Olympia, sport had prophets such as de Coubertin, and sport allowed peoples to meet in peace.
Europe was at war but, at the same time, it had common sporting structures and common sporting rules.
Today the tables have turned: we are preparing to review the Treaty, we are increasing the number of common rules and common principles and our works and structures, while sport is falling apart.
Why?
Because big business calls the shots, because major financiers are involved, because the mass media are backed by strong centres of power and because, in my view, intervention by the European Union is inadequate and misguided.
By intervening in sporting issues solely from the point of view of competition, the European Union has, in essence, strengthened this trend and this attitude.
I think we are at a turning point.
Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which, I think, has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures.
I think that Mrs Reding also has a positive part to play on behalf of the Commission in changing the way in which the Commission intervenes.
In this sense, I think that we can avert what is happening in the basketball federation today and what we can see will happen in all the other sports tomorrow, and maintain the unity of sport and its contact with society.
Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work, which I fully support.
I think we all agree on the role and importance of sport which, at both competitive and amateur level, is an excellent tool for the education and social integration of both players and spectators.
Of course, sport is also an extremely important economic phenomenon and, as such, it must follow and comply with certain market rules, as indicated in the famous Bosman judgment.
However, as has already been pointed out this morning, sport must preserve its unique features, which are primarily of a social and cultural nature.
Precisely to avoid sport being reduced to nothing more than a business, we must call, loud and clear, upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference at Nice to expressly insert a significant reference to the institutional recognition of sport into Article 151 of the Treaty.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have three closely connected items on our agenda today.
But the problem is that media interest will focus not so much on the Mennea and Zabell reports as on the Commissioner's announcement.
I think that is a pity. We are now more worried about the apple of Germany's eye, football, than about what is really at stake today.
I have no hesitation in supporting the two Commissioners whose task it is to implement the Bosman judgment.
If FIFA had done its job, the Commission would not have needed to get involved in this.
I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals, as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment.
So I think that everyone has a job to do here.
As regards the reports, I would like to say that, in view of the big business sport has become, the social and educational importance of popular sport needs to be highlighted.
There is a danger that sport as a whole will sooner or later be badly hit by rules on competition.
We would like to prevent that, which is why the Mennea report quite rightly calls for a reference to sport in Article 151 of the Treaty as an aspect of culture.
I, myself, called for this in my report back in 1996. That resulted in a declaration at Amsterdam, which was by no means enough.
That is why I am supporting the fact that this is finally being introduced now.
That report also called for the Commission to declare a European Year of Sport.
A European Year of Sport would be an important stimulus, and I hope that the new Commissioner will now take this up.
I am delighted that Mrs Zabell has covered some broader ground in her report on doping and that she has also stressed the abuse of young sportsmen and women, and has given an impetus to jointly tackling doping.
I would like to congratulate the Commission on having joined this Anti-Doping Agency now, so that it can genuinely give an impetus to a harmonised approach towards combating doping on behalf of the Community of Fifteen.
I wish it every luck.
Mr President, Commissioner, sport is, of course, being discussed by a wide range of people and social groups right now, as the Olympic Games begin in Sydney.
The reports we have before us also provide a basis for debate.
The question that inevitably comes to mind is this: what has happened to the idealistic image of sport which is still being portrayed?
It is all too easy to be complacent and attribute a very important social and unifying role to sport, where fair play is held up as a model for our interaction with each other, be it at work, in politics or whatever.
However, both reports show very clearly that sport has become a powerful and extremely tough economic force, and sportsmen and women are its tools.
They are programmed to achieve peak performances on particular days and during particular weeks, with ever shorter gaps in between, and they have to function like machines.
In order to overcome human weaknesses, which cannot always be calculated, and to achieve perfect functioning, people resort to doping substances, and it is now becoming harder and harder to detect their use.
In this way, young sportsmen and women cause damage to themselves, to their health, to their personal development and, last but not least, to sport as an ideal.
Top sportsmen and women are a role model for thousands of young people and thus have a very strong impact on popular sport, which, as I see it, is the level of sport that most needs to be encouraged.
A sense of fair play and social interaction are still easy to find at this level. But bad examples such as violent incidents, doping scandals, million-dollar contracts and bankruptcies are also destructive at this level.
We need to create legal bases to stem these negative trends.
I welcome the fact that the WADA is now active, and that it is there to combat the worldwide problem of doping.
Measures are needed against violence and racism in sport, in order to guarantee that sportsmen and women and sports fans are protected against rampaging hordes of hooligans and racists.
There is also scope for top sportsmen and women to do more on their part and to make it clearer than they have until now that they want nothing to do with 'fans' like these.
It should be our job to give sport a new role in a changed society, with new and modern technical and medical facilities, and in this way to preserve its values.
I believe that a European Year of Sport could stimulate this debate and make a substantial contribution here.
Mr President, after congratulating our colleagues Mrs Zabell and Mr Mennea on their reports and the suggestions they contain, of which I very largely approve, I shall make do with two observations.
Firstly, I should like to stress the need for Community participation in the World Anti-Doping Agency, which would enable the European Union to make a vigorous and coherent contribution to the struggle against doping.
Secondly, as I did yesterday, I plead again today for the inclusion in the Treaty of a legal basis relating specifically to sport.
I am thinking here of a compatibility clause of the sort that exists in the cultural and environmental domains, a clause that would make it possible to take due account - and I stress the word 'due' - of the specific nature of sport in the formulation of the general policy or specific policies of the Community.
Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why the Commission submitted its proposal is to stop players being treated like a commodity, which can be bought by clubs because they are good players and, more to the point, because they can be sold on to other clubs for a great deal more money.
I welcome this proposal with open arms.
Needless to say, this will cause problems, certainly in the short term, for smaller clubs in smaller footballing nations, such as the Netherlands.
But holding on to the current system would not solve the problem either.
A more structural solution would be if the media millions were better distributed.
I therefore hope with all my heart that the large clubs will realise that ultimately, without the small clubs, their future will be bleak too.
I would like to say the following on the transfer system.
I back the Commission proposal but I do hope that it will make provision for recovering training expenses for players between the ages of 18 and 24, as, for example, is being proposed at the moment by FIFA, the international football association, and FIFPRO, the organisation for players.
I very much hope that UEFA, the European football union, will go along with this request and will stop being the last, self-appointed defender of a system which has created such absurd situations in the first place.
Mr President, sport, like culture, education and health, is gradually being hijacked by commercialisation and the so-called law of the market.
Three million people dancing attendance at major sporting events and huge profits for business have eclipsed the athletic ideal.
Fitness training and sport as a daily exercise and popular sport are in dire straits.
As long as the winners see 'sport plc' thriving, doping will increase, transfer fees will increase - another form of human trafficking in a modern capitalist society - and the problem of violence at football stadiums and various other signs of degeneration will increase.
Despite acknowledging that the main reason for the increase in doping is excessive commercialisation, the Commission is doing nothing to combat it.
How could it, when the entire structure of the European Union is built on the principle of 'there is nothing which cannot be bought or sold' ?
It confines itself to half measures. Studies, codes of conduct with passing references to controls.
If they intended, and really wanted, to combat doping, they would have already done so.
But it is not in the interests of the International Olympic Committee, the international federations, the sponsors who invest in sport or the pharmaceutical industry.
The two reports do contain positive elements, but they go so far, in the Zabell report, as to state that the pharmaceutical industry cares about the health of athletes and, in the Mennea report, as to suggest that Member States adopt practical measures in their legislation to encourage private investment in sport.
Unless we crack down on commercialisation, unless we erect barriers to speculation by big business, unless we introduce basic and efficient controls, nothing will change in sport.
We do not expect the European Union to take any such action, so we are struggling to develop a popular movement which will fight for modern sport to rediscover the principle of 'a healthy mind in a healthy body' .
Mr President, the over-commercialisation of sport has clearly led to the exploitation of many young athletes.
Proven cases of doping in sporting competitions have diminished the reputation of many sports in the eyes of the public.
At last, the International Olympic Committee has faced up to its obligations to combat the widespread use of drugs in sport.
Up to 2500 drug tests will be carried out during the Sydney games.
I welcome the IOC's announcement that heavy penalties will be imposed on sportsmen and women caught using drugs in Sydney this month and in the future.
The way to stop the use of drugs in sport should be coordinated on a worldwide basis.
The Union must continue to work through the World Anti-Doping Agency to ensure that uniform and structured guidelines are implemented for all sporting activities.
In conclusion, we should recall that the Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises the social significance of sport, but the European Union has no powers under the Treaty to take action on sport.
That is an issue that should be addressed in the ongoing discussions on the reform of Union policies and initiatives.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this debate and the reports are both a step in the right direction.
Our 700 000 sports clubs are pillars of Europe's civil society.
The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life.
Sport is a part of youth work, a part of education policy, a part of leisure activity, a part of health policy, a part of international understanding, a part of the information industry, and a part of economic affairs and of competition.
Let me stress that I am saying a part.
To reduce sport to an economic and competitive level is to deny its wider social significance.
It has to be said that, up to now, Community law has been applied to sport in a very indiscriminate way, because it primarily treats sport as an economic activity.
This means that insufficient account has been taken of the special hallmarks of sport and its 700 000 clubs, and of voluntary work done in areas like youth work and training for children and young people.
Unless we can work successfully with children and young people, and unless Europe has an effective system of sports clubs, we cannot make our aspirations for popular sport a reality.
Doris Pack has already referred several times to the consequent need to root sport in the EU Treaties and have it influence the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The importance of sport was also mentioned in the conclusions of the Feira Summit.
It is therefore both a logical and desirable consequence of all this that sport should be given a legal basis in the Treaty.
We do not want to interfere in the affairs of Member States. Sport comes under the principle of subsidiarity.
We simply want the overall social importance of sport to be recognised by the Commission and in European law, perhaps giving it its own budget heading so that it does not just have to be promoted through pilot projects.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone acknowledges that sport is a means of personal development and a special opportunity to meet other people.
But does everyone see and recognise the different purposes of participation in sport?
For some, it may be a question of keeping fit.
For others, it may be part of their personal education process, while for others it is the presentation of a spectacle or a quest for victory at all costs.
We all know that sport is a tremendous instrument of national cohesion and of social integration.
However, we are also aware that sport can sometimes be accompanied by horrific acts of violence, abominable racist outbursts and unacceptable strident nationalism.
And for all of these reasons, we cannot accept the idea that sport should be considered in its economic dimension alone.
Voluntary organisations and individual volunteers are every bit a part of the sporting world, and it is surely thanks to them that sport is alive in our countries and that mass sport will be able to survive in future.
Not every human act can be priced with a pocket calculator.
The effect of that approach on human relations is too dangerous for us to remain silent.
Where there is no money to be won and no obligation to show a profit, there may quite simply be the desire to share these special opportunities, and sport undoubtedly has its place - indeed its foremost place - in such encounters.
This quest for human bonds in an increasingly commercial society contains the seeds of resistance to the commercialisation of the world and of human relations.
We cannot accept this excessive striving for profits to the detriment of human development.
The protection of young sportspeople is a priority of the French Presidency.
It is our priority, and we must demand the prohibition of commercial transactions relating to these young people.
We must also, of course, provide for the introduction of sport into the Treaty - if not in the short term, then at least in the medium term.
It is certainly a challenge, but we must accept it for the sake of coming generations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs speak from experience, as is evident from their first-rate reports.
As far as Mr Mennea' s report is concerned, I have attempted to highlight three points in the amendments which I tabled, and which have fortunately been adopted in the final motion for a resolution.
One is the importance of sport as a mental activity in order to learn a number of social skills.
Secondly, sport helps us appreciate activities in forma pauperis which involve minority groups that deserve more support, also at European level.
My third point serves as a warning against the yawning gap which can arise between top sport and smaller sports associations on the one hand and professional and amateur sport on the other.
In both cases, one very much relies on the other.
As to the question of whether sport should be dealt with at European level, I certainly believe it should.
Therefore, this report does not mark the end of the game, quite the reverse.
The role and impact sport has in society have become so enormous, and the entire sports scene is undergoing such change, that as far as the social debate is concerned, we are only just in the first heats, if at all.
The European Parliament needs to ensure that it is not left on the sidelines in this debate, but plays an active part so that we can help decide the shape of the game.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, action has to be taken in three directions.
First and foremost, we must wage a relentless fight against doping.
The financial and political commitment of all the countries of the European Union to the World Anti-Doping Agency is imperative, but it is not enough.
The most important thing is that governments should arm themselves with proper structures to combat doping.
France has marked out the path, and I should be interested to know how the President of the Council sees the interaction between the Agency and national initiatives.
We must also combat the excesses of the transfer system, especially the trade in young professional sportsmen.
Finally, we must strengthen the real driving forces of sport, namely the federations and sport at school.
I support the efforts to secure recognition of the key role of sports federations and to protect them from the depredations of financial and media giants.
Young people must be the main target in the rehabilitation of sport.
I support the call made by Mr Mennea in his report for sport to be accorded a higher status in the school curriculum as well as his plea that the specific nature of sport be enshrined in the Treaties, otherwise we shall tend to see sport as little more than another domain of free economic competition.
Is humanity regressing towards the decadence of ancient Rome?
Is competitive sport once again becoming a gladiatorial conflict, waged now by robotic humans armed with the latest bio- and cybertechnology and funded by politico-financial interests?
The time has come for politicians and sporting authorities to exercise their responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, I am speaking on the Zabell and Mennea reports today in my dual role as a Member of the European Parliament and as president of a professional basketball club which takes part in the major European competitions.
I wish, first of all, to express my thanks and congratulations to the two rapporteurs for their excellent work, and I should also like to highlight the action of our colleague Doris Pack, who paved the way for the negotiation of the protocol on sport which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Doping is a scourge from which sport has to protect itself.
It undermines both fair play and genuine competition, and endangers the sportspeople who indulge in it.
I am personally shocked by the ease with which young sportsmen and women can supply themselves with performance-enhancing drugs, without being checked at all, through the Internet or in certain countries of the European Union.
Mrs Buffet has been tackling this issue in France, and I congratulate her for it.
Nevertheless, this evil can only be rooted out if it is combated at European and global levels, and I encourage the Union to work with the World Agency to that end.
The European Union must also rise to the challenge of the modernisation of sport.
The European Commission is questioning the system of transfers between clubs, believing it to be contrary to players' freedom of movement.
But the Commission is totally ignoring the distortion of competition between Member States, the social and fiscal disparity among professional sportsmen, which encourages the best of them to migrate to certain countries.
We in France should know, because out of our pool of 22 players for Euro 2000, no fewer than 20 have gone off to play in other countries of the Union.
This phenomenon falls under the heading of social and fiscal dumping, but the Commission, for all its high principles, does nothing to combat it.
Professional sportspeople are also preyed upon by numerous agents who have exclusive rights to negotiate their employment contracts.
Not only do the agents charge the players; they are also paid by the clubs, from which they extract commission, and I have first-hand knowledge of this.
These agents hand over their protÃ©gÃ©s to the highest bidder, like common merchandise, after having whipped up competition for the players' signatures in order to raise the bidding.
The abolition of transfers will induce agents to break their clients' contracts several times in the course of a year in order to earn new commission each time a new contract is signed.
The system of agents must be brought under control by the Union, or perhaps even scrapped.
I shall conclude by adding that sport must be brought within the scope of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
I therefore appeal to all those who govern us, particularly to the French Government, which is currently guiding the work of the European Union, to ensure that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held at Nice in December confers a share of responsibility for this matter upon the European Union and involves Parliament in the implementation of this initiative through the codecision procedure.
Mr President, sport has become a magnificent form of international entertainment.
It is a source of inspiration for millions and huge sums of money are involved in it.
Thousands of Finnish people travel to Hungary to see Mika HÃ€kkinen drive, while a Vietnamese hotel receptionist asks the right way to pronounce the name Jari Litmanen.
The importance of sport and exercise both for societies and for individuals must not, however, get buried under professionalism and commercialism.
Exercise is educationally important and vital for health.
Sports societies bring people together to do self-sacrificing voluntary work.
Along with the positive aspects, we have to remember the flip side of the coin - drugs, violence at sports events and the negative elements associated with player transfers.
To prevent these we need joint action on the part of the Union and a legal base for sport.
As we shape sports policy we have to take account of sport' s various structures.
For that reason, we must ensure that we continue to listen to sport' s NGOs at the Olympics in the wake of the sports conference held in 1999.
Finally, I would like to turn your attention to the need to improve levels of gender equality in sport and exercise.
The European Woman and Sport network conference held in June in Helsinki made recommendations which I hope will be taken into consideration at both national and Union level.
I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their exhaustive work, and I want to express my heartfelt thanks, too, to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Member of the Commission for their excellent speeches at the start of this sitting.
Mr President, the powerful role of sport in economic, social, and cultural terms and in terms of health cannot be denied.
It is incomprehensible why sport lacks a legal base in the European Union.
The European Parliament must frankly force the Commission and the Council to look at themselves in the mirror.
The status of sport must have a watertight definition produced for it at the next intergovernmental conference so that sports organisations can participate in decision-making on sport themselves.
As huge sums of money are involved in major sports, common rules and regulations should be drawn up to take account of the system' s basic pillars, sportsmen and the organisers of sporting events.
The interests of team-game players must be safeguarded, all the while honouring the principle of the free movement of labour, not forgetting financial reward for the so-called trainer associations.
We have to find a balance in the question of televising the most important sports events, one between the economic power of the organisers on the one hand, and the so-called public service principle on the other.
When we talk about drugs we have to make a clear distinction, as we do when it comes to any other discussion on sport, between keep-fit exercise and major sporting events.
The ethical problems associated with the latter are known to all.
Too little attention has been paid to the spread of the use of drugs among ordinary people who do sports, proof of which lies, for example, in the trade in banned substances which is rife in gyms generally.
The problem can be considered on a par with the narcotics problem, especially the use of synthetic drugs, so, simply out of concern for public health, the EU must do its bit to beat the problem.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after this very fruitful debate, I shall simply make a few observations.
Because we are all concerned about the excesses that occur in sport, it is very understandable that we have been focusing on those excesses, but it must also be stressed that the vast majority of the men and women who are involved in sport - participants and voluntary officials in local sports clubs and in sports associations - are men and women with a high regard for the values of sport, advocates of the sporting ethic who want sport to be a means of individual and collective development.
I refute the charges of universal drug-taking, I refute the idea put forward a moment ago that footballers' brains are all in their feet and that they are incapable of thinking.
Sportswomen and sportsmen are citizens of our countries.
