We must be careful not to set a level of lead so low that it will effectively prohibit the use of batteries containing even trace elements of lead for important purposes, notably in hearing aids.
I have no doubt that we will, in practice, be able to resolve these questions as we consider the legislation further.
I should like to touch upon the issue of collection targets for portable batteries.
I am deeply cynical about these.
I have been lobbied by the British Local Government Association, which wants me to support proposals for much higher targets â this from an association representing local authorities that currently only collect 12% of household waste.
It all seems ridiculous.
As we know, Member States all too often agree to what should be legally-binding targets in the certain knowledge that the pathetically cumbersome enforcement procedures that the Commission has at its disposal will mean that they never actually have to meet those targets within anything like the timescales proposed.
As I have been saying for the last five years, we have to find better ways of getting ministers who sign up to these agreements to keep to their word.
Â Â  Madam President, cadmium is extremely toxic.
In the water framework directive, we, that is the Council, Parliament and Commission, have decided to impose a gradual ban on cadmium.
Why do we not do the same here?
The Commission has proposed a closed-loop system, but the rapporteur has already pointed out that only 80% is being recovered, which means that 20% must be disappearing into the environment.
The Commission proposal is flawed in another way, namely the extraction of cadmium â a tiny amount of it â from the waste stream, which is huge; that is an extremely inefficient way of working, and so it is better to work on a ban and introduce a few derogations later.
Lithium-ion and nickel-hydride batteries are already on the market.
In future, fuel cells will become available too.
The alternative is thus in place.
What is more, the market share of the alternative is already growing.
That is why it is very regrettable that the Commission has succumbed to the pressure from part of the industry.
European politics should reward the pioneers in industry and not those lagging behind, as the Commission is doing.
Unfortunately, rewarding those lagging behind is exactly what the Christian Democrats and the Commission are doing.
I hope that the majority in this House will know better.
Â Â  Madam President, cadmium is a dangerous chemical.
It is carcinogenic and can cause serious damage to the nervous system.
It also bioaccumulates, which means that it stays in the body and builds up over time.
High exposure can cause severe lung, prostate and kidney cancer.
The use of cadmium should therefore be banned.
At the very least a ban on cadmium in household batteries would help to reduce cadmium levels and promote the use of alternatives in batteries over time.
These alternatives to cadmium are what we really need, and they already exist.
Cadmium pollution of the environment carries very high health and economic costs, including water purification costs.
These costs â or more correctly these potential savings â must be taken into account when considering the cost of a ban on cadmium batteries.
If one looks at the dangers of cadmium one realises that we must seek out alternatives.
There are alternatives and the only way we will achieve them is to impose a ban.
In the long run this is the right approach to take for the sake of public health, consumer protection and the environment.
The propaganda we have heard, which is completely simplistic and totally inaccurate, does nothing to help the debate, wastes the money of those who are trying to promote the opposite approach, and will not work.
I hope that the Members of this Parliament will not be swayed by this simplistic rubbish.
Â Â  . Madam President, I have distributed a list to the secretariat indicating which amendments are acceptable to the Commission(1).
I will limit myself to commenting on two issues that have been raised during the debate and explain once more why the Commission did not propose a ban.
As you know, the Commission carried out an extended impact assessment in preparing this proposal.
It has assessed the sustainability of different policy options, including a substance ban.
It is important to recall that in this proposal the Commission has maintained a general restriction on the use of mercury in batteries, in line with the existing Battery Directive.
The restrictions in the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive also continue to apply, so the provisions are there.
However, on the basis of this impact assessment, a substance ban for other batteries was not chosen for the following reasons: a substance ban can only be considered if viable substitutes exist.
At the moment, these substitutes do not exist for all applications.
A ban would always be limited in scope and would never be able to cover all hazardous batteries.
As we have already heard, a substance ban might not cover cordless power tools, emergency lighting and industrial applications.
In fact, a ban would only represent around 16% of the total nickel cadmium battery market and less than 6% of the total lead battery market.
A large percentage of these hazardous batteries are currently in use or stored at home.
It is estimated that 60% of rechargeable portable batteries are 'hoarded' or stored at home.
They would not be covered by the ban and would still risk ending up in the environment.
For cadmium batteries, the substitutes have a shorter lifespan and are more expensive, so that would create more waste and extra costs for consumers.
These are the main arguments as to why we chose a closed-loop solution.
We have proposed this closed-loop system for all batteries.
That should ensure that batteries no longer end up in the waste stream but are collected and recycled instead.
For industrial NiCad batteries the closed-loop system is guaranteed by the proposed ban on landfill and incineration.
Those are our main arguments.
I suppose that this will be debated from now on, but we all seem to agree that it is important to monitor what is going on and find the best solution to make sure that these hazardous substances and batteries do not end up in the waste stream.
They must be taken care of.
I thank you for your work on this report and for the debate.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is a report (A5-0261/2004) by MrÂ Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on Integrated Product Policy â Building on Environmental Life-Cycle Thinking.
Â Â  Madam President, CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶m, environmental policy has so far been relatively successful in dealing with point source emissions from factories, power stations etc. It is a different matter where non-point source emissions are concerned, that is to say the effects of the consumption of goods and services.
The problem we face is that total pollution in society, especially due to our habits of consumption, is increasing all the time.
The European Environmental Agency has recently shown that the volume of waste in the fifteen Member States has increased by 15% since 1990.
In spite of the fact that we have reduced pollution and are using energy and materials more efficiently, the gains are quickly being eroded by increased growth.
Because the worldâs gross domestic product is expected to increase by three or four times in the next 30 to 40 years, we must do something radical if we are not literally to be buried beneath an ever higher mountain of waste and pollution.
The Integrated Product Policy we are debating in this House today offers excellent opportunities for creating a framework of incentives to get us to move away from production and consumption models characterised by a consumerist approach to linear resource flows and, instead, to embrace resource efficiency, waste minimisation, controlled use of hazardous substances and expansion of the stocks of natural capital.
If this is to happen, the Integrated Product Policy must, however, be based upon a long-term vision of how we are to change our industrial production model.
I think that what we have learned is that it is not sufficient to pollute a little less.
We must strive to achieve patterns of production and consumption that are clean in themselves.
The advantage of an Integrated Product Policy is that it involves a comprehensive approach, that is to say it tackles the whole product chain from the extraction of natural resources via product design and the production phase itself to the stage at which the productâs useful life is over.
The Commissionâs proposal has a number of good features, but is still not sufficiently proactive.
It seems as if the Commission has partly rejected the Integrated Product Policy in favour of the thematic strategies.
I see it not as an either/or but as a both/and.
We need the thematic strategies, but we also need a framework for the Integrated Product Policy in order to hold the policy together and to be a driving force in its actual implementation.
In general, environmental policy and also energy policy must become far more coherent and consistent.
We now have an abundance of directives and regulations, but too little attention is given to the bigger picture.
In its proposal, the Commission talks about using voluntary methods as far as possible.
EMAS and ISO are obviously constructive, but research shows that they are not enough.
On the Commissionâs model, voluntariness is also linked to market forces, that is to say to working with the market.
Because it is extremely rare for environmental costs to be factored into the prices, the market does not, however, operate satisfactorily.
Companies must be given direct incentives, that is to say be able to earn money from developing environmentally adapted products.
That is rarely the case at present, in which case how is the market supposed to be able to help?
In its communication, the Commission talks about improving information for consumers.
That is good, but it is naÃ¯ve to believe that better labelling and better environmental information will solve this problem.
I myself have been involved in developing environmental labelling in Scandinavia, and I know how difficult it is to implement it on a broad front.
As I see it, we need to place the Integrated Product Policy within a dynamic framework that supplies guidelines for policy in general and provides support for the thematic strategies.
This framework should be characterised by a clear vision, based partly on the following principles.
Firstly, a systems-based approach, of which life-cycle thinking is the very core.
Secondly, an enhanced understanding of how natural systems and the eco-system work so that companiesâ product and business models might be adapted along biological lines.
Thirdly, the optimisation of the product design process by the selection of materials that have as little environmental impact as possible.
Fourthly, the principle that products whose useful life is over must be broken down into their component parts and either re-used or, if they consist of biologically degradable materials, progressively integrated into natural cycles.
Finally, much more thorough use must be made of the increase in information in order to promote greater efficiency when it comes to the use of energy, materials and dematerialisation.
It is especially important to note the opportunities presented through learning from, and copying, nature.
I do not have time to go into this now, but there are a number of examples where companies now make use of these principles, bring about perfectly clean solutions and, moreover, earn money from doing so.
Madam President, during the discussion in the committee, the Commissionâs representative pointed out that sights are not set primarily upon a framework directive.
I regret that.
I am convinced that a framework directive is needed, and I hope that, under CommissionerÂ WallstrÃ¶mâs leadership, the Commission will think the matter over and realise that it is important in the long term to bring about a horizontal, political framework that is of help in environmental work overall.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliamentâs draft report supports life-cycle thinking and provides sound guidance on how the Commission should further develop the Integrated Product Policy over the next few years.
We have put a lot of effort into finding a better name that will tell the uninitiated something of what this is about, if only that it is an important task.
I really do appreciate the efforts that have gone into this report, particularly the work done by the rapporteur, MrÂ Wijkman.
In the Commission communication, we emphasise that it was necessary to show how the Integrated Product Policy can operate in practice, and we have also said that we wish to use two methods to do this.
Firstly, we wish to carry out a couple of pilot projects that bring together different actors to discuss, and preferably also to implement, measures that reduce these special productsâ environmental effects.
Secondly, we are in the process of drawing up a European inventory of those products that have the greatest potential for improving the environment.
Such an inventory can help us direct our efforts at the most important products.
The report contains many interesting insights.
Allow me to comment on a couple of important ones that show the link between the thematic strategies and this proposal, also mentioned by the rapporteur.
I should also like to describe how I see the link between the Integrated Product Policy and other initiatives mentioned in the report, particularly the two thematic strategies: the strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources and the strategy for waste prevention and recycling.
My long-term vision for these three areas is really quite uncomplicated.
I believe that the strategy on natural resources should include the general problems linked to the issue of how we are to break the link between economic growth and environmental damage.
The strategy must state what is to be done to break this link and establish general objectives concerning the way in which natural resources are to be protected against over-exploitation and pollution.
The Integrated Product Policy must then transform these resource-focused objectives â do not forget that natural resources provide us with minerals, food, water and clean air â into practical measures for reducing productsâ and servicesâ effects upon the environment, at the same time as creating business opportunities.
It is of no consequence that we are beginning to prepare an Integrated Product Policy even before the resource strategy is ready.
As we said in our proposal, we can do a lot right now.
I also believe that the strategy on waste and recycling should be more clearly focused upon the environmental and market problems that arise in that part of the life-cycle.
This does not mean ignoring the productsâ whole life-cycles.
On the contrary, the measures taken here must take account of environmental effects throughout the life-cycle, with the Integrated Product Policy being applied.
Nor, therefore, do I think that the Integrated Product Policy should embrace resource-based objectives.
I think that these are better placed within the resource strategy.
Nor do I believe that the Integrated Product Policy should advocate the use of certain materials, irrespective of whether they are bio-based materials, composite materials or other materials, because there is then a danger of ignoring the life-cycle dimension.
Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I do not believe that this is the right moment to prepare a framework directive on the Integrated Product Policy.
Alongside the issue of what, realistically, can be part of such a directive â it should cover a very large number of tools and concepts, as well as its being possible to monitor compliance â I believe quite simply that it is too early to decide whether such a framework directive is necessary.
However impatient we may be, I believe that we must wait a little and see how different actors apply the Integrated Product Policy in practice.
That applies to industry, governments and consumers.
If they do not make use of the opportunities it offers, we can consider a strategy with less of a voluntary basis, but I believe it is too early to draw conclusions about this at present.
In 2007, the Commission will review the two points I have mentioned, as well as the whole of the Integrated Product Policy.
If it appears necessary, we shall make changes.
For example, we might place greater emphasis upon services, recommend a framework directive or change the Integrated Product Policy as a result of the discussions concerning the thematic strategies.
Moreover, I believe that the rapporteurâs contribution contains many important points which should definitely do more to direct our overall thinking as we face the future.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, I strongly support Mr Wijkman.
If we really want to enforce sustainable production, we must think in life cycles and not in individual products.
That is why, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m, we also need a structural framework for the building site.
If you look at it now, what we have is a building site with the various building blocks scattered on the ground.
We have EMAS, we have eco-labels, and for batteries we have decided on eco-labels again.
Then we have limits, then for cars we have enhanced environment-friendly vehicles.
We have the public procurement system, but nothing dovetails.
Consequently, businessmen and consumers are of course not exactly clear how this integrated production is supposed to benefit them; that is why I can only strongly support Mr Wijkman.
We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result.
Only then, I believe, will we be able to persuade manufacturers to change their production methods and finally have environmentally friendly, sustainable production.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is a recommendation for second reading (A5-0234/2004) by MrsÂ Lambert, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation on the coordination of social security systems.
Â Â  . Madam President, I regret the late hour for the debate on this topic which is actually going to affect the lives of many of our citizens, but the core group of the 'friends of Regulation 1408' are still here and recognise its importance.
This piece of work on the coordination â not harmonisation, as some of my colleagues would like us to believe â of social security systems has been lengthy.
It started life in the previous Parliament and then changed to codecision and unanimity in Council in 1999.
I trust that this simplification and modernisation of the much-amended regulation in the past will provide a useful and very constructive framework in a further enlarged European Union.
I wish to thank sincerely all the shadow rapporteurs and other Members for their serious work and ultimately constructive approach to this regulation.
I also want to record my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to support our work with time, information and explanation.
In Council, too, we have seen an increasing willingness to approach this reform with some spirit, which I know was not shared by all Members back in 1999 when I first met with representatives and Member States in Helsinki.
I would remind Members that Council informed the chairman and members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs â in writing in a letter dated 31 March and indeed verbally after that â of its agreement to the amendments here proposed to the common position and to the Council statement on taxation to be entered in the Council minutes should agreement be reached on the adoption of the regulation.
I trust that tomorrow we will confirm the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its last meeting.
As we know, the restrictions concerning this regulation have caused us some problems: the fact that tax cannot be tackled within it raises particular problems for some cross-border workers, especially as we see tax and social protection systems increasingly interlocking in some Member States.
The fact that we cannot build bridges between systems means that some people will still feel that free movement is not sufficiently supported and that will mean at least more work for the Committee on Petitions.
However, mutual recognition, whether for family status or status as a person with disabilities, for example, will also continue to be an issue.
We also recognise in Parliament that we have not achieved the full flexibility we had hoped for with regard to access to benefits in kind for frontier workers and their families.
While we realise that the fact that Member States must now explicitly register in Annex 3 if they do not wish to provide such a service demonstrates that this is a deviation from the norm, we view such refusals with concern.
I am sure that this is an issue which will be taken up in the next Parliament when we see the Commission's proposals for the currently empty Annexes 2, 10 and 11, and for the implementing regulation.
We trust that work will progress as speedily as possible so that the full revised proposal may come into force within the next two years.
However, we believe that the common position as amended in committee is a positive step forward.
There has been no regression on the status quo: all persons covered by social security schemes are now included â not just paid workers.
The positive steps taken for third country nationals â Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report â are also there and were in the original Commission proposal.
There is greater clarity concerning cross-border healthcare, and the European Court of Justice decisions on the criteria concerning medical necessity are there.
The adoption of the assimilation of facts and events will be of benefit to frontier workers in particular and the number of derogations and exceptions has been reduced, despite our concern about the future development of the Annexes.
There are clear criteria now concerning special non-contributory cash benefits. The principle of good administration has also been introduced.
This is a complex but necessary piece of work and it helps to answer the question of what the European Parliament does to benefit people.
Despite certain reservations, which many of us in the House feel, I commend the common position, as amended, to the House and wish future rapporteurs on the subject the same degree of support and interest that has been offered to me as your rapporteur.
In conclusion, in a strange sort of way, I found this challenging and interesting experience quite fun at times.
Â Â  .
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am most satisfied with the substantial progress which has been made on the present proposal, both in the Council and in Parliament, and with the fact that we are now coming to the final stage in its approval.
Achieving the objective of official approval by the Council and by Parliament before the 1 May is of the greatest importance, for numerous reasons.
The most important is that it will send out a clear message to the citizens in both the present and in the new Member States, demonstrating that the European Union is both willing and able to set appropriate conditions for the real free movement of persons, the cornerstone of which is the coordination of social security systems.
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Lambert, on her truly excellent report on such a technically difficult issue as the coordination of social security systems.
I should also like to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its work.
As you know, the European Commission, in the amended proposal which it submitted last October, took account in full or in part of most of the amendments approved by Parliament at first reading.
As regards the two amendments within the framework of the second reading, they clearly improve the quality of the text and the Commission can therefore accept them in full.
In addition, I can assure you that the Commission is also in a position to accept some of the remaining concerns and considerations expressed by certain members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at second reading, within the framework of the proposal for a new executive regulation which the Commission will submit by the end of this year.
I hope, as Mrs Lambert also said, that both the regulation and the three annexes will be approved by 2006.
The common position of the Council responds to the main objectives of the Commission proposal, which entail simplifying and improving the coordination of social security systems, for the benefit of European citizens moving around within the Union.
The simplification and modernisation of the present regulation are the basic to the promotion of the mobility of labour in the Union.
They are therefore closely connected with the general objective of competitiveness, of more and better jobs and of social cohesion.
It is a fact that the present regulation provides protection in the social security sector for persons moving for any reason â personal or professional â from one Member State to another.
It is therefore important to the overwhelming majority of European citizens.
I do not intend to enumerate all the improvements which the new rules will bring about compared with the present regulation, but we can focus our attention very briefly on three issues.
The new rules will apply to all citizens in the European Union covered by a Member State's social security system.
The application of the coordination rules to all insured persons will satisfy the need for Regulation No 1408 to be brought into line with developments in the freedom of movement within the European Union, which is not just a right for workers, but is also a reality for all European citizens.
The new rules will strengthen the principle of equal treatment of nationals of the European Union by introducing a provision governing the cross-border recognition of facts and incidents.
This provision is particularly important for cross-border workers.
The current regulation does not contain clear provisions on good administration.
The new rules remedy this shortcoming.
These rules in fact require increased cooperation and mutual assistance between the agencies in the Member States for the benefit of citizens.
In addition, agencies will be required to reply within a reasonable period of time to all questions and to provide citizens with any information requested in order to exercise their rights.
Finally, I should like to say that this was indeed a long and difficult procedure which is coming to a successful end and I must thank you once again for bringing such a laborious task to a speedy conclusion in your capacity as joint legislator.
Â Â  Madam President, I reluctantly agree with what is now on the table.
I wanted more and better proposals on a number of scores.
Nevertheless, I have noticed that a number of important achievements have been made, and I would thank Commissioner Dimas for his responses.
The regulation that is before us applies to all EU citizens.
That is progress.
I have noticed that it has not only been expanded in terms of scope, it has also been simplified.
That too is progress.
I gather that on paper, a clear distinction has been drawn between the exportability and non-exportability of cash benefits.
Furthermore, I think that problems could well occur when the annexes are further detailed.
I still regret the way in which, last time, Mrs Gillig and her Socialist colleagues refused even to bring this point to a vote in a democratic manner.
I therefore fear that we will have problems when the annexes are fleshed out.
There are major improvements in this regulation for frontier workers.
I can see the legal implications of what has now been established.
For example, certain events in a Member State must be treated in the same way by the country of residence as similar events that have taken place on their own territory.
That is progress.
I have also noticed that the position of the family members of frontier workers has, in fact, been turned round and that they now have rights too.
In an annex, however, those self-same rights are being nullified, so the progress made in the regulation is invalidated in the annex.
I have the feeling that we could have achieved more had we consulted all protocols, for example, in the field of tax levies and social premium levies.
I know that the Council is against it, but we could have kept this all together.
I can see that, in a number of respects, the Court of Justiceâs judgments have been much more clearly incorporated into this regulation.
I also gather that the Courtâs health-care decrees have been assimilated effectively.
I do have a problem, though, with the way in which outpatient care has been treated, in contrast with what the Court states.
In addition, unemployment has been better highlighted, although to a lesser extent than I had expected.
Third-country citizens are now included, but my report had already proposed that.
I have recommended that my group should vote in favour, on the condition that I am given every opportunity of introducing improvements where possible when the introductory regulation is fleshed out and also in the annexes.
I would like to thank the rapporteur most warmly.
Â Â  Madam President, this simplification and modernisation has proved to be an arduous task.
I should like to congratulate all those involved, particularly Parliamentâs rapporteur, MrÂ Cornelissen and his team, the Irish Presidency and a number of previous presidencies on this achievement.
My group considers this to be a sound basis, and also sets great store by the fact that it is ensured that the first step will be ready, as a matter of priority, by 1 May.
Needless to say, we are not completely ready, nor are we 100% satisfied.
During the new legislative period too, with 25 Member States, it will still be of the utmost importance that we should cast a critical eye on the way in which the annexes are fleshed out, as well as the development of the implementing regulation.
In this respect, we should not only examine the system, for which the basis has now been laid, but also the consequences of the changes which ensue from it, because some people can be seriously let down by this.
We need to seek out solutions to these problems.
In addition, there are problems that cannot be solved in the regulation itself, some of which have already been mentioned, including the linking of taxes to social security systems or systems with which social security systems are complemented through collective labour agreements in private-sector industry.
These are points mainly affecting frontier workers.
On various occasions, we in this House have called for a frontier work test, for changes in national rules and for a much better, structured cooperation between Member States where frontier work is a frequent occurrence.
Accordingly, I should like to urge the Dutch Presidency at this stage to set to work in this respect in the next half year, as soon as the review is complete.
The Netherlands, along with its neighbouring countries Germany and Belgium, should set an example for the other Member States in areas in which a great deal of bilateral negotiation is yet to take place, and the Netherlands should, if possible, also produce more ambitious cooperation agreements for the 25 Member States, because it is to be expected that labour migration will intensify.
Pressure of time prevents me from repeating all the points, but I should in any case like to suggest that cooperation between Parliament, Council and Commission should continue, on the same footing and in a constructive manner.
This could quite possibly be in the context of a special working party, the name of which Mrs Lambert has already suggested: The Friends of 1408.
Â Â  Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on his new appointment.
I hope that he shares our view that mobility in the Member States is more than necessary if we want to implement the Lisbon agenda.
The Lambert report and Regulation 1408/71, on which the report is based, are, of course, important instruments in this respect.
I am extremely anxious about the wariness displayed by Member States with regard to the implications in terms of their own tax and social security systems.
Here, I think, it is worth giving them a push in the right direction in future.
That does not necessarily mean that you need to get Parliamentâs backing, but mainly that you do need it from the Member States.
I should nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and all those involved.
Tomorrow, my group will be voting in favour of the Lambert report.
I have to say that I have a great deal of admiration for Mrs Lambert.
This regulation contains some valid points.
The definition of frontier workers has been adopted; there are improvements in the field of pensions and also the families of frontier workers have not been overlooked.
However, that is not all.
For example, my country, the Netherlands, has yet again asked for an opt-out in certain sections, one being the medical treatment of frontier workersâ families.
We have provided for this in the regulation, but the Netherlands has still asked for an opt-out.
I see that as being unacceptable.
I think that you should always be the first one to tell your country that it is acting unwisely.
That, of course, also applies to other countries that are extremely anxious that, upon the EUâs imminent enlargement, a heavy burden will be placed on their social security.
Madam President, Commissioner, I hope that we can, together, realise the ideal of mobility among Member States being promoted, and that first-generation frontier workers will be compensated accordingly and do not always have to fight for their rights.
I gather that the President considers I have exceeded my speaking time, but I should very much like to have a good long talk with the new Commissioner about how we could bring this subject into the open more effectively.
In my view, this needs a permanent monitoring committee.
Â Â  Madam President, I should like to join my colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lambert on her tremendous work on what was a very difficult brief.
One thing this highlights is that great results can be achieved when the EU institutions pool their collective intelligence.
The rapporteur has shown great tenacity in steering a very difficult course between many different viewpoints, and has arrived the best possible solution.
I hope all Members will support this report tomorrow, along with the two amendments in it, as we need a majority vote.
In presenting this regulation to the public we should also highlight that this is probably the single most important piece of social legislation to come out of this Parliament and one that makes a real difference to people's lives in that it reflects the realities in which the modern-day European Union citizen is working.
People are moving across borders to take up jobs, some people are retiring to other areas and an increasing number of people are working for periods in other Member States.
We need to ensure that the rights of such people can be carried across borders.
Great credit is due to the Council for taking on board so many of the amendments Parliament sought to bring forward after first reading.
To be parochial, I wish to thank the Irish Permanent Representation for their tremendous work.
A number of those colleagues, who are sitting on the far side of this House, are a credit to Ireland and their to department for all the work they have done on this.
There are one or two points of concern.
Some of them have been dealt with, but I would like to re-emphasise them.
The issue of taxation is an issue for Member States alone.
It is not an issue that we should link with other matters because that merely diverts attention away from where the real work can be done.
I agree with the rapporteur that this report is not about harmonisation; it is about better coordination of the social security systems in Member States.
This regulation represents a huge change.
Where previous regulations applied only to those who were economically active, this one applies to all benefit holders.
It also constitutes an improvement as regards strengthening the equal treatment of all EU nationals.
There remains the issue of the 'empty Annexes'.
We insist that the Commission and Council come forward in the near future with a proposal concerning the implemented regulation to ensure that the legitimate and genuine concerns raised by my colleagues â and in particular by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten â are taken on board and dealt with.
MrsÂ Oomen-Ruijten brought forward issues that relate not to abstract numbers or abstract individuals, but to real people who encounter this kind of discrimination every day.
It is now up to the Commission and Council, on the basis of the good faith we will show tomorrow, to keep their part of the bargain and bring forward a proposal in this regard.
They must be as good as their word and ensure that those empty Annexes are filled.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, like other Members, I am delighted this evening to see how much progress has been made on the task of modernising Regulation No 1408/71 on social security, which obviously improves the position of EU nationals who have to travel across borders, essentially in the context of their work.
This is something that we can be pleased about, even though I do share the reservations which other Members have expressed.
This is a technical and complex issue.
Dealing with it has required a great deal of time, and the task is not finished even now.
We have just been reminded that the annexes are empty, and we still have some work ahead of us.
However, I should like to thank, also on behalf of my colleague, first of all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for her perseverance and determination.
I should also like to pay tribute to all those who have assisted with this work, whether in the Commission or in the Council.
Although, overall, we can feel satisfied, we ought nonetheless to admit that margins for improvement are both possible and necessary on this subject.
I should like to concentrate on the issue of the tools at our disposal for dealing with this matter.
We need to go beyond the reservations and attitudes of those Member States who seek to preserve prerogatives which, in this context, look very much like protectionism.
I hope that the coordination principle, which basically restricts and constrains us, and does not allow us to respond to the questions put by Members, will soon give way to real harmonisation on social protection, which is one of the essential components of the European social model.
I am convinced, Madam President, that the demand expressed by European citizens for a real social Europe, which we shall all be hearing a lot about in the near future, requires significant institutional change. The progress which has been made is to be welcomed.
It is considerable, but it is still modest in comparison with what is at stake.
Finally, and above all, it must not be allowed to mask the existing disparity, which is to be condemned, between the very effective procedures which we have at our disposal with regard to economic matters, and the much weaker procedures which are used in the social sphere.
Social convergence criteria are essential in order to deal correctly with the subject of social protection linked to mobility in Europe, a subject which, to the citizens of Europe, forms the basis of the credibility of European integration.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Commission can take on board the concerns of some members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the framework of the proposal for the new implementing regulation.
For both of the Commission's proposals, for the new implementing regulation and for the content of the three Annexes, the Parliament will play its role as a co-legislator.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner Dimas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.

Â Â  . I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the situation of Mordechai Vanunu, who is being released from an Israeli jail this week after 18 years' imprisonment for revealing details of Israeli nuclear weapons programmes.
He is now subject to emergency regulations, which constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment, even though he has served his sentence â incidentally for revealing details of the kind of weapons that the US is seeking to discover in Iraq.
The emergency regulations prevent him from leaving the country for six months or from being in contact with any foreign person â even by email or phone â otherwise he will be rearrested.
He cannot talk to journalists and he is also barred from going within 100 metres of foreign embassies.
This should be condemned by Parliament as contrary to the rule of law.
Â Â  .â The President of the European Parliament, in his interview in the Cypriot newspaper , appears to have commented on the Cypriot leaders by saying that he personally was disappointed by what he considered to be a failure in the fields of the imagination and courageous leadership which needed to be demonstrated at this time.
He concluded by calling on the Cypriot people to seize the opportunity.
I consider it unacceptable and inadmissible that the President of the European Parliament, even at a personal level, should throw all his weight behind and add to the unbearable pressure, coercion and threats to which the Cypriot people are subject from the UN Secretary General and his entourage, from the US Government, from the European Commission and Council, from Turkey and from numerous others, including the political forces in Greece.
His intervention is an insult and, if I may say so, is unseemly towards the political forces of Cyprus and the Cypriot people as a whole, who do not need lessons in good behaviour from the President of the European Parliament or anyone else.
In addition, his comments contradict what he says at the beginning of the interview about the choice of the communities of Cyprus in the two referenda being a choice by free and sovereign peoples.
Do the President and others perhaps consider that the only free choice which the Cypriot people have in the referendum is to say 'yes'?
Â Â  . Madam President, in the next couple of days, ceremonies will be held in various places around the world to commemorate the Turkish genocide against the Armenian people, which claimed the lives of more than one million people.
Between 1915 and 1918, the Turkish army evacuated almost all Armenian villages within the Ottoman Empire.
This involved the immediate execution of hundreds of thousands of citizens, while others died later, under horrendous circumstances, during hunger marches to Syria.
This was the first genocide of the twentieth century.
To this day, however, Turkey refuses to acknowledge this genocide.
This is quite a serious blemish on a candidate Member State.
It illustrates the way in which todayâs Turkish Government views human rights.
I would remind you of the resolution adopted by our own Parliament in 1987, which clearly stipulates that Turkey has no claim to EU membership as long as it does not recognise the Armenian genocide.
I would insist that this same resolution, which is still valid, be brought to the attention of the Commission and the Council.
Â Â  . Today is 19Â April.
It is the feast of SaintÂ VicentÂ Ferrer, which is cause for much celebration in my home region of Valencia.
It so happens that today is the day I take up office as a Member of this House representing the Valencian Nationalist Bloc.
I should like to seize this opportunity to highlight a serious problem affecting the production of oranges and other citrus fruits in the region of Valencia.
The EuropeanÂ Union has failed to adopt precautionary plant health measures to prevent possible attack by pests and diseases due to the import of citrus fruits from third countries such as Argentina or Brazil.
This is a particularly serious situation.
In the past, it led to the introduction of pests such as the citrus leaf miner.
In the near future, it could have serious implications for the cultivation of citrus fruits in the region of Valencia, and across Europe.
It is possible that the pv. could penetrate the territory of the Union.
This pest causes canker in citrus fruits and the subsequent appearance of black patches on the skin of oranges.
The EuropeanÂ Union must not evade its responsibility.
It must introduce clauses ensuring plant health as a matter of urgency.
Clauses of a different nature would be appropriate for other sectors, such as the textile sector.
The aim should be to prevent the entry of pests and diseases into a sector that is so important to the economy of Valencia and therefore to the economy of Europe as a whole.

Â Â  . â Madam President, a few weeks after the murder of the Hamas leader Sheik Yassin, the Sharon Government murdered its new leader Abdel Ratissi, not only demonstrating that it does not wish the peace process to proceed and for there to be an independent Palestinian state, but also adding fuel to the fire and deliberately creating tension.
The ÎU, as is clear from its attitude to date, is basically following the US line, in that it has confined itself merely to expressions of protest about these murders and the attacks by Israel, while at the same time talking â through Mr Solana â about Israel's right to protect itself and examining Sharon's policy to clear the Gaza Strip.
It is therefore making a victim out of the attacker.
We members of the Communist Party of Greece condemn the crimes by the Sharon Government and the hypocritical, complicit, policy of the ÎU.
We express our active solidarity with the Palestinian people and call on the European Parliament to demand that the ÎU stop arming Israel and freeze the association agreement with it.
Madam President, again today, at your invitation, the European Parliament observed one minute's silence for the young Italian paramilitary executed in Iraq, but it has never requested the same for the thousands of victims of the invasions of Afghanistan, Iraq and, previously, of Yugoslavia.
As the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have repeatedly requested this of you, could you tell us when you intend to do this?
Â Â  . âMadam President, I asked for the floor in order to inform the House that the Pakistani authorities have allowed the crew of the to return to their homes in Greece and the Philippines.
Following attempts over several months by the Greek Government, with the then Minister for Foreign Affairs Georgos Papandreos, which of course have continued up to today, and the provision of guarantees by it, following the reaction by the European Parliament, which passed a resolution on the subject, and following action by the troika and by Commissioner Chris Patten and the visit to Pakistan, the desired result has been achieved.
Having noted, therefore, how action by the institutions of the European Union and its Member States can be successful when properly coordinated, let us thank those responsible for handling this issue.
Â Â  .â Madam President, I should like to bring the House's attention to and ask for your immediate intervention in an extremely important issue.
It concerns the survival of Greek farmers, who are literally on the brink of disaster.
The bitterly cold weather which hit Greece a few months ago caused extensive damage to farm assets (plants, land and so on) throughout the country.
The farmers affected are having serious trouble surviving and will face bankruptcy unless specific measures are taken at once.
I am calling, Madam President, for your intervention in order to speed up the time-consuming Community procedures for approving the payment of compensation and financial aid to Greek farmers, as was the case with France, Italy and Malta, in order to prevent bankruptcy and enable the farmers affected to continue their productive activity.
Â Â  â Alzheimerâs disease and other neuro-degenerative diseases are seriously affecting the population of Europe. According to current estimates, they affect 5% of those aged between 50 and 60, 8 to 10% of those between 60 and 70, and 10 to 20% of those between 70 and 80.
These diseases which affect the brain occupy third place in the tragic hit parade of diseases, after cardio-vascular diseases in first place and cancer in second place.
Alzheimerâs and related diseases affect millions of European citizens who, in time, become incapable of coping with their lives, not to mention their families who, when they assume responsibility for the care of such patients, have to reduce considerably or even give up their professional activities.
These diseases are having disastrous human, economic and social consequences for our society.
In addition to the mental suffering caused by these diseases, there are almost no specialised care homes available, and those which do exist are often too expensive for the patient or his family, and are not covered by the social security system or by medical insurance.
There is therefore an urgent need to develop, on all fronts, a real plan for the organised control of this scourge, which affects all of us either directly or indirectly.
The economic and social burden of diseases of the brain represents 35% of the cost of all diseases in Europe, and this figure is expected to rise in the next ten to twenty years.
This finding must lead to a redefinition of the policies to be pursued regarding research, education, healthcare, prevention and social protection.
Since a third of the total cost of all diseases is attributable to diseases of the brain, the following measures are necessary: a substantial part of the funding for research into the life sciences should be devoted to the brain and its diseases, in particular Alzheimerâs disease, and the Seventh Framework Programme currently being negotiated should take this into account; a substantial share of spending on healthcare (prevention, diagnosis and treatment) should be devoted to these diseases; medical study programmes should be proportionately targeted against these diseases; a system of social protection should be set up, making it possible to give material support (care homes) and financial support to patients suffering from this disability and their families; and finally a European brain disease monitoring centre should be set up.





This scourge is so widespread, and its impact on our society so severe, that it is the duty of the various European institutions, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council, and of the Member States, to take all appropriate measures within their power to combat, control and prevent these neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâs, and to help those who suffer from them.

âThe Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has already approved Mrs Hazan's report on this subject.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have already expressed our views.
We reject the request for urgent procedure.
Â Â  âWe shall now vote on the request for urgent procedure.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we are a group of MEPs who wish to attribute responsibility for the Eurostat affair.
We have asked the Commission to do so itself, but it has still not acted, and we have therefore tabled a motion of censure because that is the only means at our disposal.
We have done so not because we want a head on a plate, but because we quite simply wish to attribute responsibility for the affair. Nothing more nor less.
The Bureau now has 67 signatures.
Two more have just been submitted and, since yesterday, there have been more than 63 verified signatures.
Since yesterday evening, the Bureau therefore owes it to us to give official notice that a motion of censure has been tabled, and this must therefore be scheduled for debate within 24 hours.
I should be dreadfully annoyed if the date were to be put back, because that would lead to our having the vote during the May part-session, which should be a time for celebrating the accession of the new Member States.
It is not our wish to hold the vote at that time.
We are very sorry that the services have delayed this matter, and we insist that the President now give notice that it is on the agenda.
Â Â  Mr Bonde, I wish to inform you that the services of Parliament are currently verifying the signatures, because, as you know, in the process of sending the signatures, some were added and others withdrawn.
As soon as this verification process is completed this morning, the President of Parliament will be informed in order to take a decision on the matter.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (Î5-0257/2004) by Mr Sterckx, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea, on improving safety at sea. (2003/2235(INI).
Â Â  . â Mr President, it all started in November 2001 when the sank and tens of thousands of tonnes of oil ended up in the sea off the Galician, Spanish and French coasts, with residues of it staining even the British and Belgian coasts.
It was a true European tragedy and once again, a tragedy that we needed like a hole in the head.
The European Parliament appointed Dirk Sterckx as rapporteur, but due to circumstances in his own country, he has asked me to replace him.
I shall therefore replace him on behalf of the Liberals and say a few words.
Parliament is deeply disappointed, because after the disaster involving the , we had already worked with the Commission constructively in order to tighten up policy.
The upshot was two packages, but another disaster had to happen first.
In September 2003, Parliament approved an initial report by Mr Sterckx, which gave a detailed account of events and made a few recommendations.
Its salient points were: first of all, tightening up the regime of ports of refuge and the request to organise a compensation system and secondly, the setting up of a temporary committee.
The Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea (MARE) was set up in November 2003 and its brief was firstly, to look into recent shipping disasters, particularly the and the ; secondly, to analyse the social and economic implications; thirdly, to evaluate existing European and international rules; fourthly, to examine how the recommendations from the first resolution have been acted upon and finally, to formulate additional proposals, if necessary.
After six months of hard work, we now have a balanced report.
It was not always easy to take a rational view of the situation, but fortunately, everyone pulled together and has adopted a constructive stance so far.
As such, approval of this report will hopefully constitute an important step in the direction of a safer sea, because that was the key motivation behind the work of these past six months.
Maritime safety is in everyone's interests, because another or sinking off any coast does not bear thinking about.
On behalf of MrÂ Sterckx, I should in any case like to thank MrÂ Jarzembowski, chairman of the MARE Committee, the people who we interviewed, including the master of the , who received a delegation of the committee, all coordinators and all fellow MEPs.
MrÂ Sterckx deeply regrets that local issues prevent him from being here today.
Let me now turn to the report.
Firstly, the clearing of the wreck.
According to the Spanish authorities, 43Â 000 tonnes of crude oil have been recovered.
Repsol, the company that will be removing the remaining oil from the wreck, states that the wreck holds another 14Â 000 tonnes.
As indicated in the report, there are therefore still 20Â 000 tonnes unaccounted for that still constitute a threat.
The cleared oil is being stored somewhere but is yet to be processed.
Secondly, the meeting with the master has exposed the contrasting statements, on the one hand, by the Spanish authorities who claimed that right at the outset 10Â 000 tonnes of oil ended up in the sea, and, on the other, by the master that on the first day, only 2Â 000 to 3Â 000 tonnes were lost via one of both openings.
Moreover, the master's treatment does not exactly inspire people to work in shipping.
It is quite a responsibility and it is very tough when you are personally put under pressure in this manner.
This also applies to a huge number of colleagues of his.
In this respect, the is not alone, unfortunately; witness what has happened to other crew members in shipping disasters.
We are still awaiting a report on the by the flag state, the Bahamas.
That is unfortunate and actually very unsportsmanlike when you consider the efforts we have all made to contribute to the activities.
I should like to comment on another few proposals.
First of all, compliance with existing law remains a priority.
We must first and foremost apply what already exists.
We are delighted to be able to conclude that the Member States have caught up with regard to the directive on port state control and the classification bureaus.
That is why we would suggest updating the text of paragraph 7 and rejecting the second part, because evidently, that issue has been resolved.
A sound compromise has been reached in the committee on the European coastguard service.
I have noticed that the final section of the compromise creates confusion and is at odds with our request for an independent decision-making and command structure at Member State level capable of enforcing the necessary decisions.
The visit by the Englishman, Robert Middleton, to our committee was very instructive.
I would therefore suggest removing the contradiction in Amendment No 26 and bringing paragraph 13 into line with paragraph 10.
I would like to finish off by saying something about labelling and tracing of loading units containing dangerous goods.
This aspect has been included in the report, but I think that a quick scan from the Commission is required to indicate the level of transmitters we would need to deploy.
We would probably need passive, but possibly also active, transmitters for heavy cargo.
I would like to ask MrsÂ Palacio to look into this matter again.
There are very simple, cheap transmitters, which can be attached to any cargo.
These could be introduced tomorrow; the market is ready for them.
I think, though, that it is important to look into these matters at greater length.
I am looking forward to your response.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Sterckx, the Chairman of the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea, MrÂ Jarzembowski, and the whole committee for the magnificent work that they have done to increase maritime safety.
I am convinced that this work and the report being presented today will make a valuable contribution towards continuing to improve safety at sea in Europe and doing as much as possible to prevent further environmental catastrophes.
I would like to say that now that we are reaching the end of the legislature, we can be proud that, among other things, it has been the legislature of safety at sea.
There have been other terrible incidents like the or the in the past, but the appropriate steps were simply not taken, practically no measures were adopted to prevent, alleviate or correct them or to safeguard against them happening again.
In this case that was not what happened.
In this case we have adopted measures and the Member States are acting, albeit not always in a satisfactory manner.
As I stated in my speech to the MARE Committee on 22 January 2004 as a result of the entry into force of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system on 5 February, the Commission has already begun the appropriate violation proceedings for failure to inform it of transposition measures for this Directive.
I must point out that to date only Germany, Denmark, Spain and Ireland have informed the Commission of the measures they have adopted to incorporate this text, which is fundamental for sea traffic, into national law.
The situation is, however, more satisfactory with regard to port State control and classification societies, as only one Member State of the Union of Fifteen has still failed to comply by communicating the measures it has taken to transpose the Directive on port State control.
The new Member States must have incorporated all Community legislation on safety at sea into their respective legal systems by 1 May.
We are going to be absolutely firm on this point, because safety at sea is an important matter.
I am well aware of your concerns regarding compliance with international and Community regulations by Cyprus and Malta and I want to tell you that we are being especially vigilant.
Following my last speech to the Temporary Committee, the Commission services conducted on-site inspections in those countries and we were able to verify considerable progress in incorporating Community law, although it must be said that we cannot yet say that the required objectives have been achieved.
We need to continue to strengthen the administrative capacity of these countries.
We will continue to monitor this in the near future.
In the context of the application of the legislation in force you have highlighted three points.
I will spend a few moments on one of them.
With regard to places of refuge, the evaluation of plans for providing refuge for ships in distress conducted by the Commission in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency has now been completed.
In addition, last month the Agency organised a dayâs workshop on this subject with the national maritime authorities, which enabled the Member States to exchange experiences on the application of Article 20 of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system.
Currently the results of the evaluation process are being analysed in detail and, as promised, the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with a report that will include the conclusions of that evaluation and also the results of a study that the Agency was charged with on compensation for damage caused by the use of a place of refuge by a ship.
Based on this information, and also taking into account what is raised in the conclusions of your report, we will assess any possible amendments or improvements to the texts adopted.
With regard to anti-pollution measures, I would like to inform you that the amendments made to the Regulation Establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, which extend its powers to combating sea pollution, have been finally approved.
The Commission will make the necessary amendments to the budget resulting from this change.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to support the Commissionâs requests to provide the Agency with the necessary resources in the debates on the budget for 2005.
We also believe that the publication of the black list of vessels that are banned from entering Union ports is an essential deterrent against this type of vessel approaching or travelling along European coastlines.
As a preventive measure we are currently looking at reinforcing this concept.
With regard to the legislation currently being debated, I first of all wish to thank you for your support for the proposal for a directive establishing effective criminal sanctions for those responsible for sea pollution incidents.
The Commission joins you in calling on the Council to take a decision on this matter.
Regarding the adoption of the Regulation on the International Safety Management Code, which seeks to promote a culture of safety and prevention of pollution, the Commission would like to thank you for the support that you gave in the plenary in February, and I trust that at its meeting in June the Council will adopt common positions on both subjects.
Regarding the future prospects for maritime legislation I will say that I gave you a few clues in January, which the Commission is currently considering.
I welcome the fact that the report that we are discussing today shows that our approaches are in line with each other and I particularly note its ideas on investigations following accidents at sea, increasing traffic monitoring in Community waters, stepping up port State control and applying minimum criteria for flag states in the Union.
Some of these ideas, such as, for example, increasing the obligations of the Member States to pass on information on traffic or the role of the Agency in responses to incidents at sea are part of the plans that you have outlined for the creation of a coastguard service.
I have explained the Commissionâs position on this on various occasions.
You stress, with strong arguments, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.
This Convention was partially incorporated into Community law in 2001, with the adoption of the Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers.
The entry into force of the amendment to the Regulation establishing the Agency gives it powers to evaluate training for sailors provided in third countries.
I wish to finish my speech by highlighting the role that the Commission plays in terms of international relations.
This week, during our visit to Russia for the European Union/Russia Summit, as part of the Association and Cooperation agreement, we have the firm intention of pointing out that in order for the International Maritime Organisation to adopt the amendment of the MARPOL Convention, which includes an accelerated phasing out of single-hulled vessels by April 2005, Russia has undertaken to provide for early phasing out and therefore to require that it be carried out.
I would like to point out that, as has been accepted among charterers, accelerating the phasing out of single-hulled oil tankers and replacing them with double-hulled tankers is not resulting in any increase in chartering costs or in a shortage of transport capacity.
This shows that the Commission did a good job and proposed schedules that were ambitious but realistic.
The Commission is closely monitoring the work being done on the IOPC regarding the modification of the international compensation system for oil pollution.
Once again we regret the Councilâs delay â and I use those words quite clearly â in requiring the Member States to ratify these agreements that have been adopted, which is going to delay the availability of the compensation if an accident occurs.
Summer is coming.
I hope that we will not have to deal with any tragedies of this nature in the next few months, but imagine the scandal if anything did happen and the Member States had not ratified the recent agreements on the level of compensation.
I would like to point out that in the meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee held in London last week, the IMO designated the Baltic, the Canary Islands and the Galapagos Islands as Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas.
In my opinion, this is a great achievement not only for the Commission, but also for the whole of the European Union, as the adoption of a series of international regulations in this field increases the protection of the interests of coastal States against the risk of pollution.
We are aware of the significance of the work done in the International Maritime Organisation and I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Communityâs membership of the IMO.
In order to promote the application of satisfactory maritime regulations, the Commission actively supports and promotes the work of the International Labour Office in the process of consolidating all the agreements on international maritime regulations, with a view to adopting a single agreement to which I believe the Community should be a contracting party.
Finally, we are working in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation to increase the responsibility of the flag state through inspection systems, in other words to combat flags of convenience.
Once again, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has shown how much importance it attaches to the Commissionâs work.
Following the accident more than four years ago, during your mandate I wished to help drastically improve safety at sea, and I wish to particularly thank your for the support that you have given me and say, as I said at the start of my speech, that this legislature has been the legislature of safety at sea; the legislature in which, finally, the European Union has had the ambition and the decisiveness to genuinely protect its coasts and also to work at international level with determination, will and rigour to ensure that this protection is not only applied to our coasts and our seas but to all the seas in the world.
As I have always said, the sea belongs to everyone, it is our heritage and treasure, both for humanity now and for future generations.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for the information you have given us, and sincere congratulations on your excellent work during this legislature.
We agree with your description of it as the legislature of safety at sea, and you have played the leading role in this.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vermeer, I am glad that you are here with us today, although we regret that MrÂ Sterckx cannot be with us to defend his report.
On behalf of my group, please pass on our congratulations to him for the commendable and honest work he has been doing in order to be able to present to this House today the most objective and comprehensive report possible with the greatest possible consensus, on a sensitive and difficult matter.
I would also like to congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work as Chair.
It is in this spirit of objectivity and consensus that I also wished to tackle this issue on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, both in committee and in plenary.
My group, therefore, did not table many amendments, but those amendments were key as we believe that they affect significant points and, although we disagree on some approaches and would like others to be better thought through, I will only highlight those that I consider to be essential.
First of all, our two amendments aim to correct statements in the report regarding fisheries in Galicia that are inaccurate and made rashly, without any basis, and could do a great deal of damage in the future.
My obligation here is, without a doubt, to help increase safety at sea, but also to defend the truth and the fishing and shellfishing interests of Galicia, and to ensure that there is not a shadow of a doubt regarding the situation and quality of world famous products, which were managed and preserved before, during and after the in an exemplary manner.
The fishing areas were closed during the accident and were opened as soon as the excellent Galician biologists, health professionals and technical staff advised that they should be, having carried out the strict tests required by Community standards.
No one foresees that this will mean any future risk or undermine their profitability, as is being demonstrated by the market and by the research being conducted by the prestigious Spanish Oceanography Institute, with experiments being carried out on their own scientific vessels.
Galiciaâs fisheries management system is a model for many others in the world and we cannot allow a document from a Community institution â which is not specifically on fisheries but on safety at sea â to question it with no basis and to accuse us of overusing our resources or overfishing.
We do not, therefore, understand how other Galician MEPs from other political groups have been able to support this absolute nonsense with their vote in committee, which I hope they will now correct in plenary.
I also hope that they will support our second amendment, which clarifies the current paragraph 51, as the reduction in extractive activity due to the closure of fishing grounds for preventive reasons is not linked to the ultimate decrease in resources, as can be verified on the website of the Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Board of the Regional Government of Galicia, , which gives all the updated fisheries statistics for the whole of 2003 by species, and shows that some species that have decreased are fished in international waters and not along the coast of Galicia, which makes it difficult for them to be affected by the accident.
This is the rigour and accuracy that we want to see throughout the Sterckx report, defending the real situation of fisheries in order to support it, which you are aware that we want to do.
Finally, paragraph 39 is also incorrect.
The decision of various Member States of the European Union to ban âsubstandardâ, or in other words âgarbageâ vessels from their exclusive economic zones, may be controversial but has of course been the most effective one since the Until international law is revised, as we ask in our amendment, now paragraph 40 (which is something that is going to take a long time) to amend, among other things, the so-called âinoffensive passageâ for these âfloating bombsâ, citizens want us to provide effective measures and there are few measures more effective than those taken by the French and Spanish Governments, supported by Portugal, Italy, Germany and the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
These measures do not make it difficult to assist the âgarbageâ vessel or its crew as they are escorted by naval ships, which provides them with the best possible means of assistance.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first like to thank Mr Sterckx, who has done a remarkable job as rapporteur, even if there might be doubts that this committee has got to the bottom of things.
It is obvious that, in spite of irrational and last-ditch opposition by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to try to minimise the responsibility of the Spanish State, particularly in management of the wreck, the truth has become clear.
We now know that we are, in fact, faced not simply with problems of prevention regarding safety at sea, but also with problems concerning the management of wrecks.
I must say, for myself personally, how sorry I am that the document we are presenting to you does not go into these matters in sufficient depth.
We also have two questions to settle.
Firstly, that of the fate of Captain Mangouras who, it seems to me, is clearly being made the scapegoat â there always has to be one in such a case â and whose treatment is not worthy of a great democracy.
I hope that the political change in Spain will allow the relaxation of the judicial control to which he is subject and that he will at last be allowed to return home.
He will have suffered the lot, detention as well as having to lodge a very substantial security.
Secondly, in Amendment No 11 and Recital 15, on which we expect to be defeated, we express our wish that the wreckage should be dealt with.
We cannot accept that causes of long-term pollution should remain while people gradually turn away from them, trying to avoid the responsibilities of the Spanish State in this area.
I think therefore that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be very clear.
Finally, we of course hope that the proposals for the future made in this report will be adopted.
The Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that future packages will not all be called , but that there will be a package to emphasise the fact that we have drawn the conclusions from this wreck and from this disaster.
There are several questions at issue here, in particular the question of how responsibility is assumed.
There are two schools of thought regarding these problems; those who want duties on polluting and those who want insurance.
We are among those who think that the insurance arrangements must be strengthened and, in particular, extended to cover the degree of danger presented by the cargoes and not only their value.
I would have had many other things to say, but in two minutes I cannot go any further.
I simply hope, Commissioner, that, as in the past, you would draw positively all the conclusions from this report so that we strengthen further the requirements of the European Union regarding safety at sea, particularly within the IMO.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, as the Commissioner said, it is really time we brought to an end the protracted work we have been doing together on improving safety at sea.
We have you to thank for this, but we also owe thanks to our fellow Member MrÂ Sterckx for his excellent report.
With a view to the future, I have a feeling that it would be a very good thing if the Commission were to order a study into where the holes in the acquis communautaire lie.
I had this feeling following the package.
We noticed that there were new holes â like those in Emmental cheese â that had been exploited.
I sometimes have the feeling that we think we are making progress, but new holes are springing up.
I should like us to look at these holes before another disaster occurs.
We have tried to do this to some extent in the report, but I think that we are in need of additional expertise in this field.
I am glad that you mentioned enlargement and Russia, and I think that this report is a historic one from the point of view of the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic has never had as much mention in a report by the European Parliament as it has in this report.
My thanks to all my fellow Members for this.
The international dimension emerges strongly and, in your speech, MrsÂ deÂ Palacio, you point out what you are intending to do.
I noted with interest that single hulls are to be phased out in Russia by 1Â MayÂ 2005 at the latest.
I should like you to elaborate a little on what you said on that point.
I do not think that sufficient attention has been paid to the work being done by the working group that is considering changes to the international compensation regime.
We know that the working group is going to meet in May, and that Spain, France and the Commission have presented a proposal.
I think that the proposal to remedy the flaws in liability insurance and in liability throughout the maritime chain merits more attention here in Parliament.
I should like us to think a little more carefully about whether we want the European system we are calling for, or if we should give more thought to this working group in the IOPC context in order to see what can be done there.
Finally, I hope that we shall work together on tangible rules for success with the Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) that have been designated.
The creation of the new PSSA in London was a success, but we need to specify what is meant by these.
At the same time, when the Commission evaluates the plans for dealing with places of refuge in other respects, I should like it to decide, with respect to item 14 in the report, whether or not places of refuge should be made public.
The Member States need guidance, because this matter has been the subject of much debate.
Â Â  Mr President, I must also thank Mr Sterckx for producing such an excellent report following the work done in the last few months in committee, with the help of experts from the various countries.
The work in the MARE Committee has enabled us to look in depth at the disaster and its environmental consequences, and the need to make progress on safety at sea.
My colleague Mr Sterckx has produced an excellent report following discussions with experts and the meeting with the captain.
It is clear that the decision to move the away was an error, so we urgently need to create a network of ports of refuge on European coastlines, and progress has already been made on this, as the Commissioner has said.
As the report says, we need to provide this network with financial compensation for problems, including environmental problems, due to providing refuge for vessels carrying dangerous cargo.
The Commission needs to be quicker and stricter in applying its Directives on safety at sea to the Member States and it needs to create the right conditions in cooperation at international level.
Although it is a positive report, our group abstained in the vote in committee because it does not include some matters that are fundamental for the safety of the environment and of seafarers.
An environmental principle is amongst the content that we think should be adopted as part of the report: âthe polluter paysâ.
It should therefore be incorporated into Amendment No 3 by the GUE/NGL and a new paragraph be added stating: âDecisions need to be adopted to ensure that those responsible for disasters pay the full costs of them: owners, charterers, owners of the cargo and classification societies, and in the interests of security, to ban flags of convenience in European watersâ.
The amendment on dignity for seafarers, their pay and valuing their work should also be supported.
Measures cannot be taken without reviewing the situation of seafarers and considering exploitation and we cannot make one hundred percent progress on safety if we do not establish the situation of seafarers and their welfare in the report.
The GUE/NGL Group considers these amendments to be fundamental in order for such a positive report to be one hundred percent positive.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Sterckx report is a positive one, for which special thanks are due to the rapporteur.
For this reason, we voted for it in committee.
It is still not what we wanted, however, and we therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted.
The report should be firmer and more unequivocal in condemning the behaviour and the culpable omissions of the Spanish Government and the Galician authorities with regard to the disaster, and also in criticising the lack of European Union institutional, technical and economic resources for avoiding and responding to accidents at sea.
The report should highlight the indifference and the neglect displayed by the Commission and by many Member States in the face of calls for effective measures to improve safety at sea and to help countries affected by disasters.
It should also call, as a matter of urgency, for the International Maritime Organisation to recognise the culpability of the institutional system and of those capitalist companies â which I would brand as guilty â which govern maritime traffic, as well as demanding the measures needed to protect both life and maritime and coastal resources.
In any case, given the temptation for those with vested interests to forget the disaster, we need to stress that the is not a historical issue, but that it can teach us lessons for the future, especially for Galicia, which of all the countries in the world has suffered the greatest number of such accidents over the last thirty years.
The reaction of civil society in Galicia meant that the disaster became a political issue there, and for the European Union also, giving rise to a democratic movement that was intensified by the democratic struggle for peace and against the war in Iraq.
This set in train the events that led to a democratic change of government in Spain, which was of momentous importance for everyone, including the European Union.
I remember the date very well: it was 13Â November, the day on which my third grandson was born.
Nevertheless, the threat of accidents like the disaster is still hanging over us.
This is very much the time for the European Union to spell out its willingness to make good the impact of a disaster which affected 2Â 000 kilometres of our coastline, from the Minho to Brittany.
There is a particular need to support and strengthen the Galicia Plan, which is an undertaking on the part of the state to remedy the consequences of the disaster, an undertaking which the European Union and the new Spanish Government must fulfil without prevaricating, and which they must treat as an urgent priority.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to thank MrÂ Sterckx for the excellent work put into his report.
I hope that nothing, and certainly not a disaster, will happen to temper the Commissionerâs optimism and that neither the Mediterranean nor any other landlocked sea will be the arena for a tragedy of such proportions.
The hearings of the temporary committee on improving safety at sea have been most instructive.
It has been revealed, for example, that the human element plays a role in 80% of accidents.
It is therefore essential for crews to be given good training in safety matters.
This must provide for efficient and coordinated emergency plans in the event of a disaster at sea.
In addition, steps should be taken to ensure that crews have good conditions in which to work, in this way helping at an early stage to provide rapid and appropriate responses to extreme situations.
In the case of the , we can only deplore the decision taken by the Spanish Government to tow away the vessel and wonder at the statements made at that time by its representative.
Moreover, I welcome the somewhat belated transposition, by virtually all Member States, of the directives relating to classification societies and to port state control, to which the Commissioner referred, while waiting for a more positive attitude from Finland.
The worrying situation of certain new Member States as regards the implementation of international and European laws on maritime safety seems to me to lend itself to the creation of a rapid and complete body of expertise, especially since we may wonder at the relative inaction of the Council regarding criminal-law penalties for pollution of the sea.
Without the introduction of such penalties, the hooligans of the sea will go unpunished and will continue to pollute the sea without scruple.
In the interests of the âpolluter paysâ principle, the polluters must be severely punished and, beyond that, each party involved in the transport of goods must be made aware of their responsibilities.
To conclude, therefore, I should point out the equally important need for maritime safety to be accompanied by a genuine policy of prevention and punishment.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the report resulting from the work of the Temporary Committee is ultimately rather unconvincing.
What was surely needed was to carry out an exhaustive and rigorous review of the many weak links remaining in the chain of maritime safety, one that would be capable of producing operational guidelines linked together according to the different areas of competence, including the intermediate European level.
Certainly, many good intentions are expressed.
The report, as amended, thus favours preventive action and calls for the joint construction of large anti-pollution vessels and the permanent equipping of fishing fleets with fuel recovery trawls.
These are good guidelines.
I should point out that a tonne of fuel recovered at sea represents ten tonnes of waste fewer to be treated.
The report also favours the setting up of particularly sensitive sea areas under the auspices of the IMO, which is what France wants.
It is opposed to flags of convenience that do not meet the vessel inspection and safety standards.
This is certainly a very sound reminder at a time when the European Union is itself becoming the worldâs leading host for flags of convenience.
Very soon, however, the report cannot stop itself drifting off towards a series of federalist fads.
For example, when it aims to encourage replacing Member States with the European Union at the IMO or to develop the inspection and restraint powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to the point of transforming it into a veritable federal authority; or again when it advocates the establishment of an integrated European coastguard system, while being very careful not to specify who would finance it and who would be in charge of it, but which would nevertheless have numerous functions, including, in no particular order, ensuring maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, fisheries surveillance, protection against terrorism or even the assignment of emergency moorings and ports in the event of an accident at sea.
Finally, the icing on the cake is paragraph 39 at the heart of the report, which by the way completely contradicts paragraph 40, and which condemns the only measure of immediate application taken following the shipwreck, that is very strict control of high-risk vessels, which could result in their expulsion outside the 200-mile zone, decided on jointly by France and Spain in Malaga.
This device has nevertheless produced very good results.
Of more than sixty in-depth checks carried out so far by the French, one vessel made a gallant last stand, and sixteen were expelled.
The prospect of being ordered to make very expensive detours is clearly an effective deterrent to the use of dangerous vessels.
Vessels in distress are obviously not covered by this procedure, as this report nevertheless pretends to believe.
In the final analysis, therefore, the Sterckx report leaves a strange feeling.
What credibility should be given to it when, instead of advocating, as one might logically have expected, the widespread application of measures proven in practice to be the most effective against the hooligans of the seas and the greatest deterrent to them, it condemns them on the basis of the other inaccurate considerations, on the pretext that they do not come from European institutions but are the result of close cooperation between Member States directly concerned?
Ideology does indeed make you blind.
On the pretext of increasing safety, here we have a suggestion to decrease safety by challenging the right of the Member States most directly affected by maritime risks to provide effective protection for their coasts and their coastal populations.
Instead of being encouraged to continue, they are being discouraged from doing it.
Instead of good practices being applied more generally, they are â I quote â ârejectedâ, a quite paradoxical result, Mr President, for a committee set up for the purpose of proposing measures to improve safety at sea.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank Mr Sterckx, even if he is not here, for the remarkable job he has done.
I should also like to thank you, Commissioner, because I believe that, in the course of this legislative period, we have succeeded in establishing a close working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in order to try and put the finishing touches to the legislation on safety at sea.
We have lived through the disasters of the and the , from both of which we have been able to draw conclusions regarding bad management and we must make use of them.
This has been shown clearly by the discussions of our committee.
We must first turn our attention to all forms of pollution because, while there are maritime disasters, there are also, unfortunately, continuing instances of pollution, in particular those caused by the daily degassing.
Under the âpolluter paysâ principle, we must tackle this problem and adopt measures which are applicable from day to day.
Hence the unannounced inspections of vessels, the establishment of a European coastguard service, which must be operational and have human and technical resources at its disposal equal to the tasks assigned to it, and then, of course, the need to monitor the quality of crews so that they can take the right decisions at the right time.
The measures adopted then have to be implemented.
A short while ago, the Commissioner noted that Member States have been very slow in implementing the directives and regulations.
On this matter, I think that good information on the successes and failures is important, not in order to denounce one or other Member State but rather to encourage them to outdo each other in achieving the objectives set.
As far as ports of refuge are concerned, it is true that there are many questions remaining and that States are not rushing to give a list of such ports.
In the face of the concerns and questions of inhabitants who do not want to see shipwrecks turning up outside their windows, I wonder whether we should not proceed differently and perhaps, quite simply, fit out major ports situated along our coasts with adequate technology and equipment, so that such technology and equipment can be made available at any time that a disaster or accident occurs.
Finally, it is also important to note that European authorities, whether national or local, must continue their partnership with the people working in maritime transport.
It is not sufficient to state systematically that the people working in this sector are not reliable.
Some are, whereas others really are seagoing hooligans.
We must â and I think the Commission has a role to play in this respect â support the moves by those who would clearly like to change the image of their industry.
From this moment, they are taking responsibility in efforts to modernise their fleet and, of course, to train their seagoing personnel.
Be that as it may, I believe that we in this House must remain vigilant so that the work done here really can bear fruit.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament proved its worth by establishing a temporary committee to assess the causes and consequences of the oil tanker disaster and to make proposals to increase safety at sea.
The institution thus carried out its responsibility for political monitoring of what was and continues to be a European disaster that goes beyond the limits of a single Member State and took on board the consequences by promoting the sea traffic policy, which is the responsibility of Community and international bodies, although the decisions to implement it are left in the hands of the leaders of the Member States.
Talking of the Member States, Parliament has had to put up with hijacking manoeuvres and a lack of cooperation on the part of those who were then in charge of the Spanish Government.
It is usual practice in Parliamentâs temporary committees for ministers to give their points of view.
This was not the case and the majority of the groups feel that between 13 and 19 November 2001 hasty and badly thought out decisions were taken which resulted in an accident turning into the greatest environmental disaster in Europe of the last few decades.
After five months of hearings we are still wondering what made the Spanish authorities in charge order that the vessel be removed to the high seas.
As the European Parliament stated in its resolution last year, this decision considerably increased the proportions of the disaster.
My group is tabling several amendments, but following on from Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegnaâs speech, I would like to say that, while we think that Amendment No 2 from the PPE-DE Group is entirely superfluous and we are neither in favour or against it, we, and myself in particular, as a Galician and vice-chair of the Committee on Fisheries, think that Amendment No 1 is irrelevant and, what is more, dangerous, because no one has questioned the rigour of the scientific testing or the healthiness of the food chain.
We would not have opposed an amendment to remove the word overfishing â if the honourable Member thinks it is so serious â although we still believe that the original wording of paragraph 50 is entirely inoffensive, as it only mentions the risk and the possibility of overfishing and in no way claims that it is already the case.
I will say once again, however, that we are not entirely in favour, and we will therefore vote against, because we think it is quite dangerous to bring back the ghost now and question the rigour of the scientific tests and the healthiness of the food chain.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Sterckxâ sound report does in fact take into account the important data confirmed during the months of work by the Temporary Committee.
Among other things, the report incorporates the necessary criticism of the Spanish authorities regarding management of the tragic disaster of the .
It deplores the fact that it has been made impossible for the master of the vessel to leave Spain during his trial.
It asks the essential questions concerning the amount of fuel still on board and the dangers that remain as a result.
It emphasises strict monitoring of adherence to shipping routes and the coordination of measures to be taken in the event of an accident; it recommends that the Maritime Safety Agency should have more power.
Finally, the report would like to see better protection for the Baltic, a better instrument for tracing dangerous vessels in order to locate them in the event of a disaster.
It also formulates a number of requirements concerning international legislation.
Although all these proposed measures are positive, they do not, even so, seem to me to go far enough compared to the measures already proposed in the and packages, even though the measures in these packages are indeed important and must be welcomed.
Much was expected of this report from the Temporary Committee, and, indeed, it still is.
I am sorry that the amendments calling for better cooperation and coordination of national actions have not been accepted in favour of a European coastguard service, which my group does not support.
Before the vote just now, following the example of Mrs Bergaz, I am going to stress a number of proposals which we wish to have taken into account in the report and which can be found in the amendments proposed by my group and others.
Safety at sea will not be improved without a review of the conditions under which seafarers work, without an end to the overexploitation that is to be found on many vessels, and without offering worthwhile pay with harmonisation at European level.
Stronger measures against flags of convenience are essential.
It is also necessary to look seriously at how to make the main parties responsible, shipowners, charterers, owners of cargoes and classification societies pay.
What is more, the question of full compensation for the victims of the still remains unresolved.
I myself truly believe that the report is worthy of our support, but I am anxious to say that my group will look carefully at how its proposals are taken into account in the vote on the amendments in order to decide on its final vote.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, having followed the information given to the public during the crisis and the speeches in the parliamentary information committee, I believe that the vessel sank for two reasons: firstly due to its terrible seaworthiness, and secondly, due to the bad decision by Mr Aznarâs Spanish Government authorities, which, rather than seeking a place of refuge, chose to send the damaged vessel to areas with rough seas, with waves more than six metres high, until it broke up and sank, causing the biggest ever oil slick in Europe.
I think that the fact that the vessel was sailing in an unsuitable condition was the responsibility of the owner, the captain, the oil company that owned the cargo, but above all, it was the responsibility of the classification society ABS, whose inspection conducted in the port of Dubai four months before it sank had not been correctly carried out according to the audit subsequently conducted by the International Association of Classification Societies.
ABS also inspected the ship that exploded in Porto Torres, Sardinia on 1 January this year.
I have therefore already tabled an amendment urging the Commission to carry out more effective monitoring and to audit classification societies and their inspectors regarding the quality of their work.
It also urges the Commission to put a stop to any collusion or conflict of interests that there may be with owners, charterers, oil companies, etc. There needs to be greater transparency in this and also in the International Maritime Organisation, which receives a large proportion of its budget from States that are known as flag of convenience States, but where the real control is in the hands of other States, some of which are European.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the interpreters for their patience and kindness for the unforgivable suffering I have imposed on everybody since my first speech in September 1999.
At that time I announced that I would speak neither French nor Spanish in plenary while the Basque language did not enjoy full recognition in the Basque country.
Now, five years on, the rights of Basque speakers are still being ignored.
I would therefore ask â in the English language, of course â my French and Spanish colleagues to act immediately.
I join with other speakers in their positive response to the important work produced by the committee, chaired by Mr Jarzembowski, and to the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx.
The Commissioner said that a new report on the future of maritime safety will soon be presented.
I hope that this time the Commission will emphasise the need for immediate and accurate information in the event of maritime disasters.
That was not the case with the , where the interests of the public and in particular of the victims in Galicia and the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula, including the Basque country, were completely ignored.
As a demonstration of linguistic solidarity, I am opting today to speak the language of farmers and seafarers, for the language of CastelÃ£o, a defender of true individual and collective freedom, taking the specific as my starting point and moving on to universal truths.
I would like everyone to be aware that the disaster represented an exceptional time of dignity and strength, which was vital in understanding not just the Galicians but also all those oppressed men and women who want a fairer world.
Even today, CastelÃ£o is a universal reference for peoples subjected to oppression in other states, and for all those nations whose existence is denied.
Thank you, Galicians. Those will probably be my last words in this House because I will not be able to stand for re-election in June.
I will be the only Member of this Parliament who will not have this opportunity because my political party has been outlawed by the Kingdom of Spain.
I thank you all.
CastelÃ£o is a universal reference for all peoples subject to the oppression of states that deny their existence.
'Thank you, Galicians' will probably my last words in this Parliament because I will not be able to stand for re-election next June.
I will be the only Member of this Parliament who will not have that possibility because our political party has been outlawed by the Kingdom of Spain.
Thank you all the same. .
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, as the chairman of the non-standing committee for the improvement of safety at sea, I would like to extend warm thanks to the members of the committee and to the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, for the extraordinarily sensible way in which they conducted their deliberations and for their excellent report.
The committee worked consistently in an excellent atmosphere, and everyone attempted to resolve the problems in a sensible manner.
Many thanks.
My special thanks, obviously, go to the staff of the secretariat, under the leadership of Mr Darmis, without whose extremely professional administrative support the rapid but, at the same time, careful work of the committee, including the important trip to Barcelona, would not have been possible.
The hearing of numerous experts with various backgrounds, representatives of the Commission, the European Agency for Maritime Safety, the Irish presidency of the Council, the General Secretary of the IMO and, not least, the acting Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, in my opinion provided the committee with a broad foundation for its recommendations and assessments.
We once again investigated maritime accidents subsequent to those involving the and the and mainly concentrated on the statutory measures introduced since then at European level to improve safety at sea and their implementation in the Member States.
Of the 56 conclusions, I would like to emphasise four of a general nature.
I will not go into the details.
I believe, however, that four conclusions are so important that they should be emphasised.
The Spanish authorities have successfully stopped the leak of oil from the wreck of the and submitted a timetable for the further pumping away of the oil out of it, so that additional harm to the environment and fishing should be avoided.
We still have the problem that the waste extracted from the sea in the last few months and in the last few years must be carefully recycled, but that is a special problem.
Secondly, in our opinion, the Spanish courts should urgently bring forward the judicial proceedings in respect of the accident and change the conditions applicable to the captain, so that he can return home until they start.
Thirdly, the new regulations resolved on with the âErika Iâ and âErika IIâ packages of legislation are essentially the right ones for achieving a substantial improvement in safety at sea.
Fourthly â and this is the key point â there is still inadequate transposition of the safety regulations into the national law of some Member States, and therefore into reality.
Accordingly, Madam Vice-President, we support the Commission in its investigations into the implementation measures, in particular with regard to the question of the provision of emergency resting places and crisis response places.
Commissioner, stick to it, put pressure on the Member States, and this House will support you!
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I was part of the mission which my party sent to Galicia immediately after the accident and I remember how shocked we were by the sight of the beaches and by the despair of the residents of the area.
I therefore wish, from this position and in the time available to me, to express my surprise at the blunt statement by the representative of the Spanish Government of the time that, in the event of a similar accident to the , they would again decide to remove the ship from the shore.
I would also emphasise the findings in the report on the treatment of the master of the and the fact that this sort of treatment was also seen later, in Pakistan, with the crew of the , a matter on which Parliament passed a resolution.
These seamen have already been released and returned home.
Pakistan is ahead on this count of a Member State of the European Union!
I further wish to denounce a distortion, no my mistake, a clearly deliberate misrepresentation in the translation into Greek â and only Greek â of the discussion with Captain Mangouras referred to in the report.
The translator, by adding a phrase which does not exist in MrÂ Sterckx's text, presents the master as maintaining exactly the opposite of what he actually maintained and agreeing with the action taken by the Spanish authorities.
I would remind you that the matter of the shipwreck of the and the setting up and operation of the MARE committee were given broad coverage in the Greek media, which of course obtain their information from Greek texts.
It would therefore appear that the translator wanted to exonerate the Spanish Government and its Greek supporters, come what may.
I call on every person in a position of responsibility to examine my accusation, which concerns the last paragraph of the text entitled 'exchange of views with the master' in the explanatory report, and to crush the translation mafia in the European Parliament.
To close, I wish to express my faith in what I would call absolute cooperation with the ÎÎÎ.
Â Â  â Mr President, the paradox in the European Union when we discuss safety at sea is that the Member States call for measures following disasters and then fail to apply them.
What usually happens is that industry is incriminated, the crew is incriminated, the states tend to shirk all responsibility and it is obvious that this is not true.
If only things were that simple, because we would have resolved the problem.
The problem with safety at sea is obviously not Mr Mangouras, the Greek master, who should have had better treatment from the Spanish authorities, as the Sterckx report rightly notes, nor is the problem purely and simply single-hull tankers.
It is also the maintenance of ships, as demonstrated by the recent shipwreck of the double-hull cargo vessel, the ,off the coast of Norway, it is that we do not have ports of refuge, in violation of Community legislation, it is that we do not conduct proper port controls, again in violation of Community legislation. It is overall, if I may say so, that the Member States do not apply what is generally speaking the good Community legislation which we have in the European Union.
The first thing, therefore, that we need to do is to apply Community legislation and then we also need to look at the measures proposed in the Sterckx report, select certain basic priorities and take additional measures, such as creating a European coastguard.
I would also point out that, obviously, as shipping is an international problem, international measures are also required, which is why cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation is always required.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Sterckx on his sterling report.
It contains many sound recommendations, and it is to be hoped that they will be followed, so that we will be able to prevent unacceptable accidents involving oil tankers even more effectively, something by which we have been confronted on a number of occasions during the past term.
What matters most now is to deliver on what has been agreed.
This can be done, above all, by investing considerably more in monitoring existing measures.
We must invest in global cooperation, also in order to tackle international maritime safety problems that fall outside of the European Union.
Another point of crucial importance is consultation with, and the tackling of, flag states that take safety measures rather lightly.
I think that what we all want is for so much to happen in the next few years that we will never have to hold a debate of this nature in Parliament again and that the risk of accidents of this nature will go down considerably, partly as a result of what we in the European Union are doing.
Needless to say, coordination and cooperation among Member States is of key importance.
The report contains many proposals to that effect.
We must learn from each other and we must try to apply the same procedures.
Reference was made a moment ago to the experiences of, and the meeting with, the English coordinator.
From that, it transpired that the United Kingdom has adopted a very clear line of command in the case of accidents.
This must also be done at European level.
As such, we support the proposal on the setting up of a European coastguard service.
That is a fair objective.
However, it is important for us to examine first how this can be done via research, projects and experiments.
We are all in favour of giving the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the new institution, an important role during the further development of policy in this field, including controls and suchlike.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the chairman of the committee and also the rapporteur in spite of his absence.
I am especially grateful to him for his work because, seeing the title and the aim of this Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and some of the numerous amendments proposed, one gets an impression of the difficulty of his work as rapporteur, as well as the impression that the political opponents of the party in government of the Autonomous Community of Galicia and also in the Spanish Government were more interested in the partisan and party debate and in trying to erode and wear down the governing party politically than in looking forward and trying to efficiently and effectively improve the various aspects of safety at sea: social, economic, fisheries, tourism, environmental and health.
It could seem as though we are living in different countries since, with some exceptions, some of which existed right at the start, as an inhabitant of the region most directly affected I think it can be asserted that the activity in the fisheries sector was initiated at the right time and with all possible guarantees, in accordance with the technical and health reports.
It can also be asserted that, according to the opinion of a large majority of the professionals in this sector, the catches have not suffered; that neighbours and tourists who have come to Galicia in great numbers over the recent Easter week, possibly with some specific problems, which there always are, found our beaches to be clean, and that help and assistance have arrived punctually and, furthermore, that we can all be proud of our civic solidarity, in the knowledge that the peoples of Europe are resolved to overcome their former divisions and to shape a common destiny, as called for in the preamble of the future Constitution.
Finally, I will refer to the purely social aspect, since maritime activity is a human activity, and every professional maritime worker also has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity and also requires measures intended to raise the prestige of maritime occupations in order to make them more attractive to young people in general and young Europeans in particular.
Thank you for this, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for all the progress we have made under your drive and direction.
Just a note, Mr President, to say that the situation of Captain Mangouras corresponds to a legal decision and legal decisions must be respected whether you agree with them or not.
Mr Savary, if political change affects the independence of the judiciary it would be very serious, because the separation of powers continues to be a fundamental pillar of democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry that Mr Sterckx is not present in the House, and I am sure that he has pressing reasons for this, but I would like Mr Vermeer to pass on to him that this committee is making progress as a result of the disaster and that, as of this moment, we have an excellent Commission proposal and an excellent report by Mr Sterckx on safety at sea.
Is Parliament really asking Mr Sterckx for an own-initiative report on safety at sea in this situation?
This would not be very logical.
Everyone is aware that what Parliament is asking for is an investigatory committee on the , precisely in order to clarify what has happened and to avoid repetition, in order to establish that seriously damaged vessels should not be sent to the open seas to sink, but that ports of refuge should be provided.
This committee should have made it very clear that this should not be repeated, that we cannot get away with pollution and that not everything can be resolved through commercial relations and political dependencies.
None of this appears in Mr Sterckxâs report.
The experts have been ignored, not to say scoffed at, and I am sorry that Mr Sterckx has reneged on the pact that he made with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in order to have, at this time, the President of the House that we have.
I must, however, give Mr Sterckx some bad news: in his investiture report, the President of the Spanish Government has decided to create a monitoring committee on the .
We will be able to continue clarifying and providing information in spite of the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, as other Members have already said, we can be pleased with the work the rapporteur has done.
I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating Mr Sterckx on his work on maritime safety.
This compliment also applies to the Commissioner.
The report that is now before us is succinct and clear and has avoided duplication in respect of the September resolution.
I have tabled a few amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and all of them have either been approved or included in the rapporteur's compromise amendments.
I should now like to turn to my concerns.
First of all, the European coastguard service.
A majority in this Parliament is â quite rightly â in favour of a far-reaching form of cooperation between the different coastguard services, with the establishment of a common European coastguard service as the ultimate goal, if necessary.
For this coastguard service, as well as for the existing European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), it is of major importance to have sufficient powers to be able to carry out the work in the field of maritime safety effectively.
In my view, far more attention should be paid to the maintenance and state of the ships.
Accordingly, a poorly maintained double-hulled tanker will constitute a greater risk than a well-maintained single-hulled tanker.
I have also expressed my misgivings about the registration labelling of containers and vessels containing dangerous chemicals and substances.
This is further to the loss of very toxic cargo from the in the North Sea, in which apparently, the substance in question did not correspond to the description on the bills of lading.
I am also anxious about the increase in the export of Russian oil via the Baltic Sea along the EU coastline, because very often, this involves the cheapest substandard tonnage.
Since my own report concerning the introduction of criminal sanctions has run aground in the Council, I am delighted to see that a few Members, including the rapporteur, are calling on the Council to reach a decision in this matter as soon as possible.
Internationally, there are plenty of options in legislation to tackle the situation.
The problem, though, is that the Member States do not enforce the rules to which they have committed themselves through treaties.
It is precisely those Member States that reject controls by means of Community legislation.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, in the course of one minute I should like to point out to you six paths to be worked on during the next legislative period.
Firstly, the European coastguards.
Secondly, seafarersâ living and working conditions, which must be as good as possible on board.
Thirdly, flags of convenience, making every effort to drive them out, and strengthening our position within the International Maritime Organisation.
Fourthly, implementation of the regulations relating to port reception facilities.
Fifthly, work on the concept of freedom of the seas, which is an old concept about which seafarers care but which will have to be studied carefully.
We no longer transport wood, wine and stones but much more dangerous materials.
Sixthly, ensure greater traceability of petroleum products.
You know that the techniques for doing this exist, a sort of petroleum DNA, and when degassing is carried out or ballast tanks are emptied, this is a new lead for detecting the culprits.
There, Commissioner, you have a number of points on which it must be possible to work during the legislative period that is about to start.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, anyone who travelled at the time with the delegation of the committee to Galicia will never forget the inexhaustible assistants in their initially white, but soon oil-stained overalls, above all how they attempted stone by stone to wash away every trace of oil from the coast.
It is, sadly, the case that in particular it took so serious an accident as that of the tanker finally to improve safety in maritime traffic.
Today, however, I would like to emphasise that we will have succeeded in doing that, if we implement the measures indicated in the report and follow them up.
This needs a maritime network rather than another bureaucratic skyscraper in the big city of the European Union.
Effective protection of the coast can only be achieved through greater safety at sea at the multinational level.
Any particularist approach by small states must be relegated to the past.
What is effective is if, in the context of joint protection of the coast, synergies can be recognised and, through a joint organisation, people and materials be aligned with each other and the best possible use made of them across the countries and seas of the region.
For me, therefore, coastal protection, environmental protection or whatever you would like to call it is also a form of regional and structural support across Europe.
I take such protection to mean preventive measures for the protection of the environment and, in the context of a joint monitoring of the coast, also an effective resource for combating crime at sea.
I am proud of this and I am sure that the catalogue of measures we have decided on will achieve its objective.
This will be to the benefit of everyone in the European Union, in both the present members and the new ones, in the short, medium and long term.
A revival of the maritime ecosystem and increased readiness for investments in maritime routes, the maritime motorway of the future, will be the payoff.
Â Â  Mr President, learning from a catastrophe means facing the future.
All the laws or directives that we pass here are, at the end of the day, worth nothing if they cannot be monitored and enforced.
For this reason, we need very rapidly in the medium term a European coast guard service, not least in view of the new and emerging risk of terrorism.
We cannot sit and wait until terrorists attack vessels in European waters, but rather we must counter them in good time through a coast guard service.
My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area.
As a committee, we called for obligatory pilots in the Baltic, but we are aware that this cannot be achieved without Russia.
For this reason, we ask you, Commissioner, to combine with the Commission and the Council in putting political pressure on Russia to ensure that Russia also at last complies with the international regulations in the IMO.
My third and final point is that we are aware that 80% of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error.
Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology.
In the future, we must concentrate more on the human factor, which means that we must direct our attention more specifically to the training of captains, officers and crew in accident management, fire protection and emergency measures.
Â Â  Mr President, I have campaigned long and hard for the establishment of a European coastguard, and in the light of numerous maritime accidents and incidents that have occurred in recent years, the case for such a maritime force has never been stronger.
Last year I produced a detailed policy proposal calling for the establishment of an EU coastguard, which I submitted to the European Convention for discussion.
Since the disaster in November 2002, the issues of European maritime security and safety have been given a much higher priority on the European agenda.
The enduring environmental damage caused by the disaster demonstrates that Member States acting alone are under-resourced and ill-prepared to face such disasters.
In addition, the traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions and disasters that have occurred in EU waters points to the need for more effective coordination in avoiding potential maritime disasters.
Regrettably, our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs, cigarettes and human beings.
Additionally, given the present geo-political climate, we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe.
Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant in the daily lives of their citizens.
Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it would tackle the real concerns of those we represent.
I therefore welcome the Sterckx report.
I welcome the fact that it has adopted my proposal for the establishment of an EU coastguard as the best means of improving safety at sea in the long term, and in addition has called for a clear decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies.
I congratulate Mr Sterckx for producing an excellent report and I would urge Members of this House to support it enthusiastically.
Â Â  Mr President, I regret that MrÂ Sterckx cannot be with us here today, but such is the fate of a party leader.
I should like to congratulate the Commissioner on her work in the field of maritime safety.
To send the frail into the open sea in storm conditions was a capital blunder on the part of the Spanish Government.
The refusal to admit mistakes was characteristic of the Aznar Government and it is not surprising that this Government has now been voted out.
The covering up of the facts was the result of a wrong interpretation of democracy, one that is still tangible in Galicia.
I went along to help the volunteers clear up the oil.
I am backing this report and therefore hope that this disaster was the last one of its kind.
In this report, measures are proposed.
A European coastguard service will play a crucial role in future.
My last word on this â and I say it with pride â is: .
Â Â  Mr President, I would like, firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, although he is not present, to congratulate Mr Jarzembowski for his magnificent work as chairman of the committee and to congratulate you all, ladies and gentlemen, for your speeches and for your work to take this committee forward and make it work.
I would start by requesting, ladies and gentlemen, that we all be fair and that we try to be a bit impartial.
If we must be critical, we must go back much further, as before the , before the , unfortunately, the European coastlines had been polluted, assaulted, by a series of dreadful accidents.
I would recall the , off the Breton coast, or the , off the Galician coast, to name but two cases previous to those cited, which are as alike as two peas in a pod.
At that time, dreadful disasters took place and nothing was done, ladies and gentlemen.
In this respect, we can feel proud that now something has been done.
This time has been different from that time, in the eighties and nineties, when nothing was done, whilst, for example, the United States, following the disaster, took a series of measures that now allow them to assert that their coastlines are much safer, given that there can never be zero risk.
I must say that, as a politician, the past only interests me in order to be able to avoid repeating mistakes and look towards the future.
The future is where we are and this is what we are all working on together.
In this respect, we can be satisfied and say that in the future, in current reality, the European coastlines are safer than four years ago.
We can be satisfied with everyoneâs participation, and the Commission is aware of the joint effort we have made.
I must also say that the Council has taken the corresponding steps forward.
It is, however, true that the decision of the Commission and Parliament has been much more systematically clear than that of the Council.
I am not referring to each of the countries of the Council, as they have different sensibilities, but to the Council as a whole.
To move on the issues relating to the true situation of Community law, we are first of all monitoring the timetable closely.
When the months envisaged for transposition come to an end, any Member State that does not report the transposition of a regulation will be summonsed to legal proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg.
I have told you, ladies and gentlemen, we have already initiated a series of proceedings in some Member States.
Second, regarding the reality of internal application, even when the transposition has been carried out, we are, thanks to the European Maritime Safety Agency â we have present here today its Executive Director, Mr De Ruiter, who is doing a fantastic job â making systematic inspections .
This allows us to verify whether, as well as incorporating a certain number of rules into national law, this is also reflected in practice.
We will also produce the appropriate and relevant reports.
Third, you have asked about the situation of Captain Mangouras.
Look, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is not able to intervene in the legal systems of the Member States.
Neither can the governments intervene in the legal decisions of the Member States.
There is a separation of powers.
In this respect, I suspect, as has already been indicated, that a political change in the Spanish Government will have little effect on the opinion of the judge on duty.
It would be catastrophic and disastrous if the judge on duty were to obey the political impulses of the ideals of the government in power.
I would find it regrettable and I am sure that the judge on duty is doing his job.
In this regard, consider the precedents, such as the fact that the captain of the â I would like to remind this House that this was a vessel whose owners were very close relatives of the owners of the , as close as brothers and brothers-in-law â who was responsible 14 years ago for a catastrophe similar to that of the on the Spanish coastline, left without allowing them to bring him to justice, because he took advantage of his bail to, quite simply, get on a plane and never again set foot in Spain.
In this case, what is happening is that the judge on duty is taking precautions as there is some very specific background that is particularly unfavourable in terms of the behaviour, at least in this case, in a very similar situation, of some companies that are particularly involved.
As one of you, ladies and gentlemen, said a short while ago, although the majority of crews, captains and officers are reliable, reasonable and respectable people, there are exceptions.
I will now comment on spills.
The great disasters, according to the statistics, represent less than 10% of marine pollution.
Most pollution, although it is true that it is more diluted and, therefore, less visible, is continuous spillage, bilge cleaning, the cleaning carried out on the open seas by unscrupulous vessels.
In this respect, I would like once more to thank this Parliament for the backing it has given to the Commission proposal to penalise those who voluntarily cause this sort of pollution of our seas.
Regrettably, the Council is not in favour, which is causing problems.
This proposal, as Mr Poignant has said, includes such subjects as traceability and sensors to monitor how the large vessels that put into our ports manage dumping and bilge cleaning.
All this is also in line with the measure that we previously adopted for harbour installations to collect waste and to allow the vessels putting into European ports to carry out cleaning within these installations.
Fifth, I agree with Mr Ortuondo Larrea that the classification societies have a great responsibility.
The classification societies should be the guarantee and, in this respect, Mr De Ruiter, the European Maritime Safety Agency and also the Commission are monitoring and analysing their behaviour because, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have increased the responsibility of the classification societies following the disaster and we can even withdraw their power to recognise and certify vessels in relation to European ports.
We are working on it and I agree completely on its importance, as well as the chain of responsibilities that another of you indicated previously comprising the maritime transport operator, the ship owner â not only the captain, who also is responsible â and the various elements appearing in the transport chain.
This must be done, however, not only at European Union level, but also at the level of the International Maritime Organisation.
With that, we arrive at the sixth point of my intervention.
We are talking about an entirely international and globalised activity.
In this respect, we can adopt a series of measures at European regional level, but there are other measures that can only be adopted, or will only have any real effect if adopted, at international level.
This comprises our fight against flags of convenience, although to some degree we are already penalising them, because of the criteria by which the vessels that must undergo port controls are selected.
The flying of certain flags automatically causes that vessel to be a priority control objective and, therefore, it is moored for longer and experiences more problems, etc. Therefore, to a certain extent, we are already looking at this problem, but we will only be able to go further when at international level, which is what we are pushing for, all questions of auditing and of the responsibility of the Member States issuing the flag are clearly reinforced.
The minimum rules regarding crews are also international.
In this respect, the International Labour Organization must make progress regarding the qualifications and training of maritime personnel, not only for European crews, but also for international crews that put into our ports in vessels from third countries and to whom our European regulations cannot be applied.
It is, however, clear that we require the seafarers and the crews of our vessels to have undergone training that makes them much safer.
We simply have to compare the reality of the accidents in vessels with a European flag with that of third-country vessels.
It is necessary to continue this work and, in fact, throughout this legislature we have established and adopted measures to strengthen and improve the quality of crews and also the prestige of maritime work, making it more attractive, making it a viable life option for our young people to join a merchant ship as a seafarer, officer or captain.
In this respect I think that, for example, during the Greek Presidency, a series of measures were taken and I hope that there will be a commitment on the part of the British Presidency to take up all these initiatives that we are working on to make the occupation of sailor more attractive to young people in the European Union.
You are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the coastguard problem is important to the Commission, but we know that for now it will not be resolved.
For this reason, we must back what is attainable at the moment: greater cooperation and coordination between the coastguards of the different Member States and, of course, an expansion of the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency.
Very recently, we adopted a regulation to amend the powers of this Agency, including the power to manage anti-pollution activities in the event of accidents, in order to be able to tackle them by means of European measures that are equal to any needs that may arise, but we have also expanded its powers in the spheres of safety and security
I would appreciate it, therefore, if we had financial backing in the budgetary debate, because we are discussing financing for 2005 and we need funds to be able to establish the anti-pollution measures and, specifically, the cleaning vessels we were discussing.
I will finish on a very clear issue, directed at MrÂ Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso.
Look, Mr Gorostiaga, you know as well as I that I will be able to come here.
Aralar upholds the same ideals as your party, apart from the fact that it condemns terrorism.
You know that your political party has been declared illegal by the judgment of a judge in Spain, not by a government decision.
It is true that this judge was basing his judgment on legislation adopted democratically and legitimately by over 90% of the Spanish Congress of Members and that, from that moment, your approach is defensible, but what is indefensible, not only from the point of view of the Spanish, but also of Europeans, is not condemning a very specific example of terrorism, that of ETA.
In this respect, I would like to remind you that your party has been considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union by means of a decision of June 2003.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to say to the Commissioner that, firstly, in Spain there is Spanish nationalism, and Spanish judges are under its influence all the time.
We are neither Spaniards nor French: we are championing a political course to self-determination for the Basque country.
We are not championing terrorism of any kind, contrary to what the Commissioner said.
We are championing a political path for the Basque people.
If we are in a European Union based on democracy, and if the Basque people were to decide on a particular political future for their country, everyone should respect that decision.
I refute any kind of accusation of complicity with terrorism.
The Commissioner knows perfectly well that I have never defended in this House any kind of action that could be construed as terrorism.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
Â Â  There can be no doubt that the Spanish authorities have a great deal to answer for over the shipwreck of the .
The report itself, although it is very much lacking in some areas, is highly critical of the Spanish authorities, and in particular of the statements made by Spanish leaders and of the failure to make the conclusions of the investigations more widely known.
It is also positive that the report emphasises the need for more attention to be paid to the maintenance of ships and to their condition, even in the case of double-hulled vessels, which may represent a greater potential hazard; that it advocates agreements under the auspices of the IMO on the speedy and independent investigation of shipping disasters; that it calls on the coastal Member States to establish a clear and independent decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies; that it calls for an investigation of the scope for introducing mandatory insurance; for financial compensation for places of refuge; for a system of penalties to combat illegal discharges; for an audit of the classification societies; and for the Member States to transpose the relevant Community directives and to ratify the international conventions; for the training of seafarers; and to retain the dignity of the seafaring professions.
I regret, however, that the report does not mention improvements in workers' social conditions and that our proposals to abolish flags of convenience, to make all parties responsible for the payment of damages, and to support investigations of the authenticity of maritime certificates issued, were rejected.
We hope that these amendments, which we have tabled once again, will be accepted in the plenary.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A5-0220/2004) by MrÂ Cocilovo, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have today before you for the vote a report of great importance within the framework of European transport policy, specifically, the amendment of the âEurovignetteâ Directive.
As you well know, the current Community framework is inadequate in view of the numerous initiatives that have been set up recently at national level in this regard.
This framework needs to be strengthened, particularly in order to ensure fair competition conditions between freight transporters and give greater stimulus to the balance between the individual modes of transport.
First of all, I would like to sincerely congratulate MrÂ Cocilovo on his excellent work.
He has achieved something that, I must say, I thought impossible: grouping, bringing together, and integrating a series of amendments, presenting in the end a result that respects the principles and philosophy of the Commission proposal.
Apart from some technical aspects, I would like to convey clearly the Commissionâs support for the Parliamentary report.
First, I would like to point out that the draft report takes on a fundamental principle of the proposal, and this is the allocation of charging income to transport.
This principle has been and continues to be the subject of arduous debates in the Council.
For this reason, it is of vital importance that Parliament has supported it.
How can the idea of a motorway toll be justified if we do not know what is to become of the funds it generates?
In an internal market, such as we have now, how can this situation, that could send us back almost to medieval times, be justified?
The execution of the great projects of the Trans-European Transport Network also suffers from a lack of funds.
In this respect, road charges constitute a financial impulse mechanism that must contribute to the improvement of transport links in the enlarged Union.
With regard to the calculation of tolls, the draft report encourages the Commission to develop a method of calculating external costs.
The discussions held in the Council demonstrate that, for the moment, it has not been possible to reach a compromise based on objective data and objectively determined costs.
In this respect, we must continue our work and find a reliable methodology, which can be clearly accepted horizontally within the Council.
It is also necessary to obtain the support of Parliament for the increase of tolls in particularly sensitive areas, such as mountain regions and those affected by a high level of pollution.
This last concept is completely innovative and will contribute to the creation of infrastructures that are costly but necessary for the elimination of bottlenecks in our network.
I would like to finish by emphasising the fact that the Commission has made an effort to offer the European Parliament a text that is acceptable to everyone; the transit countries must be capable of applying a system of charging that allows them to promote their own network within a perspective of sustainable transport development and, at the same time, the peripheral countries of the Union and their freight transporters will be the first to benefit from an effective charging policy in Europe that provides them with well-functioning networks.
On the other hand, we need to understand the concerns of those countries that are expecting a possible increase in transport costs and, therefore, a comparatively unfavourable situation.
In order not to affect the viability of transport companies, the tolls must be fixed at reasonable levels that imply compensation for the use of an infrastructure, and therefore for the objectively calculated costs generated by the use of that infrastructure.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, I would have liked to have this initiative adopted at first reading and for an informal trialogue, or an informal agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission, to have allowed us to go ahead with this initiative.
This has not been possible.
I hope, however, that thanks to the result of Mr Cocilovoâs report, to the amendments to be introduced and to the fundamental support of this Parliament for the Commission proposal, we will soon be able to achieve a common position in the Council that is sufficiently close to Parliamentâs proposal to allow, quickly, at second reading or through a quick conciliation, the adoption of this extremely important directive for the balance of transport in the European Union to be completed.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner de Palacio, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner has mentioned, it is important not just, and not so much, to highlight the significance of this proposal for a directive, within the framework of developing a European strategy for transport systems, but also to mention that it is not the first time that the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council itself have dealt with matters relating to the transport system and transport networks and expressed their views with specific pronouncements on them and with reference to the external costs involved in their use and the associated, problematic issue of transport infrastructure charges.
As regards the reference to Parliamentâs contribution, certain points were highlighted on all of these occasions in the conclusions linked to individual reports and speeches: the need first of all to harmonise transport charges in all Member States to consolidate the single European market; the opportunity for a transformation â if not a radical one in some cases, then one that is objective and realistic at all times and, in any case, challenging â of the charging structure with a view to internalising the external costs of transport, which are often overlooked when decisions are made concerning the transport mode and, therefore, omitted from infrastructure completion strategies.
Also highlighted was the need, in any case, to create a system of tariffs tallying with transport infrastructure use; the need to establish homogenous mechanisms for calculating the costs of each mode of transport and clearly comparing the Member States; and, finally, the need, to equip governments with transport policy instruments based on infrastructure costs so as to encourage the use of transport modes with less environmental impact and, above all, to allow for new investments in infrastructure and, in future, to complete the plan for fully implementing the major infrastructure projects for the trans-European transport networks that are also suffering from problems of financial cover.
This was mentioned a short while ago and we are, moreover, all aware of it.
At this stage, therefore, the governments of the Member States must address two separate issues.
On the one hand, there is an increasingly urgent need to invest huge resources to satisfy the demand for transport infrastructures.
On the other hand, the Member States must tackle the costs â including social costs â involved in the growth of mobility, from increased air and noise pollution to environmental problems, and above all increased congestion and rising accident rates.
I cannot call to mind the figures relating to this outlook, which must also be seen in the context of enlargement and of the expected increase in demand that, as always, must be met.
This is not just an issue of external costs.
We know that often the construction of infrastructures and the operation of the transport system have been funded primarily from general taxation.
Today, however, the new approach to the sphere of public sector activity, the ceilings on the Member Statesâ budgets and policies for the privatisation of services, make it essential also to have recourse to private-sector capital to finance the construction of infrastructures, even if it means sacrificing a plan for completion.
I would just like to mention that if this all has to take place outside of a plan â which is acceptable to no one â of detrimentally penalising road transport, it will be necessary to guarantee alternatives because the single incentive of toll charging or the measure relating to costs would not constitute an answer to the problem, in the absence of real and competitive alternatives to redirect a proportion of the volume of traffic.
Instead, in terms of costs, it would exacerbate the forced use of this infrastructure and would have general economic consequences.
This is why we have tried to give guidelines and find solutions to the most sensitive and difficult aspects of the problem through the cost financing instrument, and to divert an additional set of resources to accelerate the implementation of such projects.
I will conclude by lamenting the fact that a delay on this due to internal positions in the Council will today prevent a complete result.
In order to achieve one, I believe that strengthening Parliamentâs position could play a major role in the future development of negotiations and, to this end, I must thank all the groups and all the Members for their valuable cooperation in the work at this stage, at least in view of the objective of bringing the first reading of the report to a positive conclusion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the fundamental aim of this directive is to create a system of cross financing that will facilitate the construction of alternative transport infrastructures in particularly sensitive areas.
At the same time, it will help to improve conditions for the movement of persons and goods within the Community, it will stimulate increased competitiveness in the transport sector and it will regulate the inclusion of all external costs in the prices paid by users.
I am basically in agreement with these objectives, although I would have liked to see a more ambitious text in terms of harmonisation.
I nevertheless consider it vital, and I emphasised this in the opinion that I drafted, that the new charges and tolls should not lead to an increase in the aggregate tax burden.
For that reason, the Member States will have to revise annual road taxes and registration fees downwards.
Lastly, I have taken into consideration that the original proposal did not include any measure to allow for the specific situation of outlying countries, whose transport operators, as regards their ability to compete, will be more affected in the short to medium term than their counterparts in Member States in the centre of Europe.
The approval of a new recital covering exactly this point should encourage the Commission and the Council to take this fact into account.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, Mr Cocilovo, my group does, of course, endorse your report, in which you support the proposal of the Commission to review the Directive on the road toll fees and propose major improvements.
We are also glad that the committee, contrary to the rapporteurâs original inclinations, has not proposed the introduction of road toll fees for private motor vehicles by way of Community law, because I believe â and in this the Commission is completely right â that whether a country wishes to introduce road toll fees for private motor vehicles should be left up to that country on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity.
In my own country, Germany, there would be no reason for it, because when we consider what the driver is already paying for fuel and vehicle taxes, he is to a large extent paying for the costs of roads, indeed more than the costs of the roads would require.
So we are glad that the question of toll fees for private motor vehicles is dealt with under European law.
Secondly, we support the Commissioner in her struggle â âwhich is what it is â in the Council for a clear commitment of purpose, because it makes no sense to increase the road toll fees in order to improve road maintenance and expansion, if as a result the increased revenues are added to the general tax pool and go to finance no doubt very reasonable training or cultural measures or other policies.
If goods vehicles are to be subject to higher toll fees the revenues from them must be returned to the transport sector.
I would like to end by raising two questions, and I can guarantee that we will be discussing them again in the second round.
We were indeed all in agreement â even the rapporteur has referred to it â that we cannot increase the road toll fees without limit, because the increase of toll fees would lead to the death of the transport economy and the economy as a whole.
We cannot just regard the goods vehicle as the cash cow of Europe.
There must be limits to how far we can increase road toll fees, because otherwise we will harm jobs and economic growth.
For that reason, there are two questions on which there is certainly a need for further discussion.
Up to now, we generally took the view that it was possible to tax goods vehicles in favour of other transport players in the spirit of cross-finance in the Alps and the Pyrenees, because this territory, so to speak, imposed a need for particularly expensive transport facilities, for example for rail.
Now, this provides a basis for permitting cross-finance in other sensitive areas also.
I must warn against leaving the door open here.
Speaking for my home city of Hamburg, I can say immediately that it is a sensitive area with a high volume of transport, so that we could indeed impose higher toll fees in Hamburg, Cologne and elsewhere.
We must therefore think very carefully about where we will apply cross-finance as an instrument.
The second issue has to do with external costs; let me give you an example of what I mean.
If toll fees are increased because of blockages on many sections of the Trans-European network, we would be rewarding the Member States who fail to build the necessary infrastructure.
They would get more money if they do not expand.
That cannot be right!
So let us carefully consider these questions at second reading.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I note that there is still a great need for discussion and we will indeed continue with it in the next parliamentary term.
Let me begin by expressing my best wishes and thanks to the rapporteur. He really had his hands full with one of the most difficult and important reports in this parliamentary term, and he has done an outstanding job of it.
Some important comments have already been made.
I would like to emphasise once again that it is a good thing that we have now formulated a uniform methodology.
In this way, we can in future get rid of the mosaic of different toll systems with markedly varying charges.
It is also extremely important for us that it has been possible to apply the full cost principle and to include infrastructure older than 15 years.
There is, of course, another point that is close to my heart.
The purpose of the Directive is not only to generate financial resources for the infrastructure, important though that indeed is.
The purpose of the Directive is also to contribute to the control and management of transport, above all through levying appropriate charges.
We will do this on the one hand through the differentiation of the toll and on the other through the possibility of cross-finance.
In the differentiation of the toll, we will be able for the first time to allow for external costs such as ground contamination, blockage and noise costs.
This represents a first step towards the comprehensive internalisation of the environmental costs, a result not to be underestimated.
My group also endorses Amendment No 55, which deals with a further differentiation in these areas.
As regards the increase of the toll for the purpose of cross-finance, the rapporteur has indeed proposed an excellent compromise.
It is right that we have expanded the definition of the sensitive areas â something about which I absolutely do not agree with Mr Jarzembowski â so that the conurbations are also included in them, because that is where the most serious noise and emission problems occur.
We have certainly not come up with the best solution, and it would be a pity if we now only get as far as the first reading.
I look forward to the further discussion in the next parliamentary term and to future debates on the subject.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Cocilovo, sooner or later, even the European Union will succeed in giving itself some rules in order to apply the two principles: the âuser paysâ principle, whereby users meet the cost of infrastructure use, and the âpolluter paysâ principle, whereby polluters will pay the costs of the negative effects of congestion, pollution and health damage, that are becoming ever more evident.
Sooner or later it will happen.
At the beginning of the parliamentary term we were idealistic about being able to apply both of them: this has not happened, we are half way there.
We can say that the excellent Cocilovo report does, at least, allow us to achieve the first objective of sensibly applying the principle according to which those using the roads are charged the cost of them and this money is used to finance maintenance or further construction and, therefore, indirectly, to thus take a broad approach that, by using cross-financing, allows us to take a more comprehensive look at the corridor in which the road runs.
Fortunately, however, it seems to me that the Cocilovo report gives some additional guidelines.
In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with fixing tariffs and only maintaining this objective for some heavy vehicles and for some roads â just for transporting goods, in short â because at the end of the day something is achieved.
At the same time, the report suggests guidelines as to the possibility of having different tariffs to take into account congestion and pollution and to encourage a shift to other modes of transport.
From this point of view, I feel that the route chosen is positive and should be supported, including this relatively innovative concept, which is a concept upon which I believe we must carry out more work.
The World Health Organisation sees a clear link between particulates and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
This implies that we have a duty to intervene, including with a tariff instrument, to ensure that these problems are dealt with seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur warmly once again for his constructive collaboration.
