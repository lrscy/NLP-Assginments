We also understand that it is one of the largest payments ever made, and we are appreciative of that.
Last year's floods affected 48 000 UK homes and 700 businesses and the total damage is estimated at over EUR 4 billion.
My own region of Yorkshire was one of the worst affected and many people have still not returned to their homes and, therefore, this help and assistance is very much appreciated.
I am replacing Mr Titley as he is stuck in London because of the very severe storms that are battering western Europe this evening.
We cannot attribute all bad weather to climate change, but we do know that the number of extreme weather events is increasing.
We have seen severe floods, and also the fires in Greece and southern Europe last summer, and no amount of solidarity funds can actually meet the damage and the cost which we are seeing as a result of these climate-change events.
We are beginning our work as MEPs on the new package of climate change legislation.
I very much hope this House will adopt a tough stance and implement and agree good legislation which really does tackle climate change so that we do not have to come back here and ask the Commission for money to tackle these kinds of events.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, in a sense I have an easy task following the last two speakers.
I, too, wish to speak clearly in favour of the proposal from our rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr BÃ¶ge, but particularly in favour of the mobilisation of the solidarity fund for the UK.
A sum of EUR 162 million: it seems to be uncontentious, but it is hugely important on several levels.
As an MEP, I represent the area of Yorkshire and the Humber, hit, as Ms McAvan said, by floods last summer - cities, villages across our region devastated.
Many individuals, even in the village down the road from me, are still out of their homes.
Whilst we know that this payment may not change their situation overnight, it will go indirectly towards helping by relieving pressure on our Government's own budget.
Secondly, I am extremely pleased that our Government made this application, and a successful application at that.
There were times at the beginning when we were not sure that would happen, and I hope that, having gone through this experience, our government will now become a big fan of the solidarity fund in Council and will persuade other Member States accordingly.
Lastly, the British people, my constituents, will now understand that European solidarity has a tangible and practical meaning.
And that will apply, I think, to all of us in this House.
As climate change does bite, we may all be in the situation of representing those who are victims of such natural disasters and may have, therefore, to lay claim to European solidarity.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, solidarity is the European Union's most important and finest principle.
Without it there can be no question of joint action by independent states and nations.
The creation of the European Union Solidarity Fund followed naturally from this principle.
For the time being we have EUR 1 billion available annually.
That is not a large sum, especially as last year, and this year too, we have had to face an increase in climatic disasters.
We have been hit not only by floods and hurricanes, but by fires of unexpected magnitude.
With our limited means we are able so far to make only a small amount of help available - 3% or 4% of the losses incurred, or even less.
That is why, while supporting Mr BÃ¶ge's report and Mr Virrankoski's draft amending budget, I also conclude that the resources of the Solidarity Fund need to be gradually increased.
Two euros per citizen will not suffice to wipe away the tears when such enormous losses are incurred.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, this Parliament knows many different types of solidarity. The hardest type of solidarity is military assistance.
The solidarity clause in the Treaty of Lisbon states that Member States will be obliged to deliver military assistance to another Member State which is the victim of a terrorist threat or attack.
A harder type of solidarity is unknown in the European Union.
The security guarantee clause in the Treaty of Lisbon does not impose an obligation of military assistance.
It is therefore a milder type of solidarity than when there is a threat of terrorism.
Jutta Haug, Parliament's rapporteur for next year's budget, is proposing that a key principle of the Commission's budget should be regional solidarity, i.e. a balancing of the Union's internal development.
It would come about best via the Structural Funds.
Under the amending budget before us there is a move to use budget funds to compensate for the damage caused by the floods in the United Kingdom.
A billion euros has been reserved in the Solidarity Fund for this purpose.
Our group agrees with the mobilisation of these funds to help the United Kingdom.
It is possible that there will be more exceptional natural phenomena like flooding as a result of global warming.
The Solidarity Fund offers a sort of small-scale insurance policy against them.
The Member States pay a premium into the EU budget and they can therefore acquire help from the others when their turn comes.
Besides the Solidarity Fund, the EU budget contains a Globalisation Fund, which may spend EUR 500 million every year to ease the social problems that result from job transfers.
Last year less than EUR 20 million was mobilised for this purpose.
It seems the EU shows solidarity towards countries but not its citizens who have fallen on hard times.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year's floods.
We are all very happy that the EU has generously come to the aid of a Member State in difficulty.
But it is not quite like that: first, the grant is only 3.5% of the cost of the damage - a gesture, as Mr Ashworth says - and, secondly, it is nine months after the event - and that is fast, they say!
It would have been more helpful if we had known it would be forthcoming, and then reconstruction could have been planned accordingly.
If there is one thing that gets up the nose of the British - when we realise that we are getting back a little of the cash we have paid into the European Union - is that we are obliged to beg for it and then advertise the EU's generosity.
Please, can we not rather keep our own money and then decide how to spend it ourselves?
That way, it could be paid out more quickly.
(FR) Mr President, most of our States have lines of credit in their budgetary law for dealing with disasters.
Under French budgetary law, for example, there are global allocations that allow appropriations to be committed by decree in advance in emergencies.
Since November 2002, European budgetary law has incorporated this disaster financing law with this Solidarity Fund.
For financial disasters, we have also set up the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
As regards natural disasters, we are being asked for aid of less than 4% to repair the flood damage in the United Kingdom in June 2007, costing over 4 billion.
Nine months to commit appropriations is a long time, because this is by definition an emergency situation.
That means that the amending budget method to authorise the commitment is not operational.
The amending budget should come into effect earlier to ratify the commitment to be made in advance, with provisional and non-restrictive appropriations for disasters, floods and fires.
That being so, EUR 162 million in solidarity for the United Kingdom of Adam Smith, Ricardo and Mrs Thatcher, who only believe in the market, Darwinism and natural selection, is an excellent lesson in pragmatism.
When the lion that roars in the economic jungle gets wet, he discovers the virtues of solidarity.
That is three times now - mad cow disease, foot-and-mouth disease and floods - and tomorrow our British Members will also have the chance to show solidarity with the European farmers who have got wet from imports.
- (EL) Mr President, this amending budget proves once again what is self-evident: that the EU has the mechanisms and adaptability to provide solutions to specific unexpected problems.
I should like to make three proposals for the package of two reports that we have discussed today.
Two of them concern the Solidarity Fund, and the third, the Galileo Programme.
On the issue of the floods in the UK, the time interval between July and the present response from the EU is very satisfactory.
It happens to be the quickest response throughout the operation of this fund, at least as far as I can remember.
However, it creates a precedent: in future we shall expect such an immediate response to similar disasters, and here I am referring to the environmental catastrophe that we suffered in Greece last summer only a month later, in August.
I therefore hope that next month the Commission will at last make a proposal through the competent Commissioner addressing the Greek request to activate the Solidarity Fund.
I do not need to remind you of the shocking images of the great fire disaster in Greece; we all saw them, throughout Europe.
I hope that, mutatis mutandis, we shall at last have the Commission's proposal in our hands within the coming month.
My second comment concerns the spectacle we are now making of ourselves.
I have no idea how Parliament manages it, but every time we have some good news, we are the only ones who know about it!
We are on our own, with no-one in the galleries, and probably not a single journalist!
When shall we finally learn to market good news properly?
My third and last comment concerns the Galileo Programme.
I agree with all my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and, as that committee's rapporteur for the Galileo Programme, I wish to be quite clear that we are not going to make any payment from the very considerable package of funds we have committed, unless we agree with the Council on the wider architecture of the programme.
If we do not know who is doing what - and we are still in the dark because we are negotiating with the Council - we shall not spend anything.
We are not going to throw money down the drain.
Tomorrow morning we have a very important trilateral discussion with the Slovenian Presidency.
There are two major outstanding issues.
I hope that we can conclude these negotiations so that we can set our minds on making genuine progress.
- (LT) The EU Solidarity Fund is a very important aid to Member States and qualifying candidate countries in the event of natural disasters.
However, in the light of experience, the need to reform the Solidarity Fund, adapt it to meet new challenges and increase its efficiency is obvious.
First of all, the minimum damage threshold of EUR 3 billion or 0.6% of GDP is too high, excluding any aid to countries suffering from disasters on a lower scale, which could nonetheless have serious consequences for the countries concerned.
Secondly, the fund cannot be disbursed to relieve the consequences of terrorism, public health crises and technological or industrial accidents.
Thirdly, a few problems arise with regard to funds that are disbursable in the event of exclusively regional accidents, the criteria for the use of which have not been defined clearly enough.
In conclusion, I welcome the reform of the fund and urge the Council to outline its position on this without delay.
(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw attention to the following points in this debate.
First, it is regrettable that the Commission's proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund has still not been adopted by Council, despite the fact that the European Parliament took a position on the matter at the first reading almost two years ago, in May 2006.
Second, the mobilisation of EUR 162 million to help make good the damage caused by the floods of June and July 2007 in Britain and Ireland, the total cost of which amounted to almost EUR 5 billion, deserves our support.
A pity that funds for that purpose are being allocated many months after the damage was incurred, which can make the aid less effective.
As the Polish proverb says: 'He who gives quickly gives twice.'
Third, since the ceiling for the Solidarity Fund has been set at EUR 1 billion, I would hope that, in the event of damage on such a scale as in Britain, appropriate funding will be mobilised speedily and that the needs of both old and new Member States will be addressed on equal terms.
- (EL) Mr President, as well as thank the rapporteur for the very good work he has done, I wish very briefly to raise just one point concerning the Solidarity Fund.
Mr President, every year we have bad weather in the EU.
It is also ironic that, just when we are discussing these important reports, Northern Europe should be hit by violent storms.
Thank goodness that the EU provides financial support in the event of such disasters, as is now the case in the UK, and as it has done in the past for Cyprus.
However, we must not forget that in addition to the financial aspect, there has to be a Europe-wide organisational unit capable of providing immediate relief to the stricken areas.
- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, solidarity is a fine word, and an even finer concept.
Unfortunately, there is a very great need for it: the facts show that this need is becoming increasingly pressing because of natural disasters, which we should no longer look on as natural, but rather as increasingly frequent occurrences in our lives.
In the summer months of 2007 alone, three very serious events occurred.
Firstly, there was the UK situation that we are discussing and voting on today; immediately afterwards there were the terrible fires in Greece, which you all know about, and not long after that, more floods in Slovenia.
All this shows us how serious these phenomena are, and also how essential it is for the EU to take action.
I am surprised when fellow Members say they do not understand why the EU should provide money.
It is a matter not only of money, but also of moral support and the feeling among the inhabitants of those areas that the EU is aware of their tragedy. In many cases it is a tragedy, and the EU is doing something about it.
This leads me to point out, as has been said before, that the example of the UK, which we applaud, for it elicited a relatively rapid response, should be emulated in the countries that are subsequently stricken.
It is no accident that our country, Greece, is next on the list for assistance from the Solidarity Fund, and we hope that in our case, too, help will be rapidly forthcoming.
However, I am not sure that this will happen, and I wonder whether this is due to the EU and to how it deals with requests, or to the way in which the request itself was submitted by Greece.
No matter: we hope that help will soon be given to Greece too, because I assure you that the situation in Greece is still very serious.
The problem is that the money for Greece, which was put into the Fund, has not yet been announced.
(PL) Mr President, the functioning of the EU Solidarity Fund is seen in a very positive light by the Member States, and particularly by EU citizens.
The Fund establishes the possibility of granting aid to those affected by natural disasters that cause considerable damage.
Its purpose is to help make good the losses incurred, which weigh heavily on the budgets of many families.
Such financial aid from EU funds is an example of European solidarity.
For the European families that suffer, our EU citizens, it is the best example of the advantages and benefits of membership of the European Community when such a need arises.
However, we must concentrate our action - and find the necessary funding in the EU budget - on combating the causes of such disasters and on establishing appropriate crisis management arrangements and an appropriate insurance system.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, I wish to thank all those who have taken part in the debate for their excellent, constructive input.
The Solidarity Fund is very young and so its limits have been set very high.
It has not been possible to rely on previous information concerning how much money is needed.
Perhaps the limits can be reviewed to some extent in the future.
I agree that speed is undoubtedly an advantage in this work.
The Committee on Budgets has given much thought to the use of the Globalisation Fund to overcome the problems resulting from lost jobs.
This is obviously an area where the EU in the future will have a lot of work to do.
In the same way, many have remarked on the issue of crisis management.
This year's budget also incorporates a pilot project to speed up the prevention of forest fires, and in that area we are aiming at new and good results.
As regards the Galileo project, there is not to be any increase in its funding.
This obviously has to be regarded as a basic principle.
The current level of funding is sufficient.
Its administration, however, needs to be efficient.
Especially now, when the levels of funding are considerable, there is a great danger that its administrative management will also become more bureaucratic.
It must be efficient, and for this reason we want to maintain Parliament's scope for negotiation, so that we and the Commission and the Council can together agree on what the best possible form of governance is to see this European and very ambitious, major project through to the end.
I am convinced that over the weeks to come we will achieve a satisfactory result.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (RO) I believe that the request formulated by Great Britain is pertinent and I support the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund in this case.
Romania was confronted with major floods over the last years; the latest floods occurred recently.
As in the case of Great Britain, much of the damage caused by floods could have been avoided by greater involvement in the prevention effort.
The existing infrastructure, as well as the response of the national authorities was nevertheless overwhelmed by the force of the natural phenomenon.
Consequently, I support two measures which the European Union can take to enhance national and European feedback: allotment of money from the structural funds for infrastructure works designed to mitigate the effects of natural catastrophes; secondly, the establishment -as soon as possible- of the European Intervention Force, consisting of specialist teams from all the Member States to intervene in emergency situations in any region of the European Union.
Another important aspect is the level of the funds allotted by the European Union in emergency cases.
Given that we envisage an extensive review of the European Union budget, I believe that we should consider an increase of the amounts allotted to the European Solidarity Fund.
EC/Guinea-Bissau Fisheries Partnership Agreement (debate)
The next item is the report by Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau - C6-0391/2007 -.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by extending my gratitude to the Committee on Fisheries and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, for his report.
On 23 May 2007, the European Community and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau initialled a fisheries partnership agreement for a period of four years.
This agreement forms part of the series of EC 'tuna agreements' in the Atlantic Ocean.
The financial contribution is fixed at EUR 7 million per year.
Of this financial contribution, 35%, or EUR 2.45 million, is earmarked to support the definition and implementation of a fisheries sector policy in Guinea-Bissau, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.
In addition, the European Union will pay an annual specific contribution of EUR 500 000 to improve sanitary conditions in the fisheries sector and to strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance in the waters of Guinea-Bissau.
In addition to the total amount of EUR 7.5 million, the protocol also contains a special financial provision for a supplementary allocation of EUR 1 million maximum per year, aiming at improving the use of fishing opportunities by ship owners.
This new protocol provides fishing possibilities for shrimps and for fish, in particular cephalopods, up to a total tonnage of 4 400 t per year for each of the two categories.
Furthermore, the agreement covers licences for 19 tuna seiners, 14 pole-and-line vessels and 4 surface longliners.
The agreement gives the Community a solid legal and political framework for monitoring the activities of the European Union fleet in the Guinea-Bissau fishing area.
It also allows the Community to support the development of the sector in that country, to the mutual benefit of both parties.
Turning to the amendments proposed, let me state that, whereas in many instances we share the objectives outlined therein, I am unable to accept them for the following reasons.
I fully share the concern that the flow of information provided to the European Parliament should be as complete as possible.
However, the Commission already provides all the requested information, in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements.
Moreover, every evaluation report, as well as the reports on the results of negotiations and of Joint Committee meetings, is immediately transmitted to the Committee on Fisheries.
In addition, I myself inform the Committee on Fisheries regularly of the state of play of international negotiations in special, restricted 'closed-door' sessions.
The issue of reporting requirements by the fleet is also being dealt with, since we have proposed a legal basis that will allow the Commission to refuse licence requests on the grounds of poor reporting from Member States.
This draft regulation is currently going through the adoption procedure in the institutions.
Regarding the proposal to reject the fisheries agreements in general on the grounds that they are not sustainable, it should be recalled that the Council, in its July 2004 conclusions, indicated that the aim of the new fisheries partnership agreements (FPAs) is to contribute to the sustainable management of fisheries resources.
As a matter of fact, FPAs only provide for access to stocks that are not fully exploited by the national fleet of the particular country in question.
The Commission believes that the FPAs can and do provide a political and legal framework that assists the efforts of partner countries in implementing a policy of sustainable and responsible fishing in their waters.
Finally, with respect to the proposal that vessels should pay the total cost of the agreement in proportion to their catches, let me just say that we have established a reasonable cost-sharing balance between shipowner contributions and the Community compensation.
This approach is in line with the July 2004 Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements, on which Parliament gave its opinion.
In our system, the shipowner licence fees are indeed calculated on the basis of their respective catches.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my report concerns the fisheries agreement signed with a small African country which, after over a decade of armed struggle for independence, has in recent years experienced serious political instability interspersed by periods of civil war.
Fishing is an important economic resource for this small country, and its financial contribution represents a very significant part of the State budget.
However, this fisheries agreement is not one that seeks to purchase fish.
According to its partnership philosophy, that is not the European Union's position.
European Union policy is based on other values and its essential concerns are the sustainability of resources and a position of effective partnership.
It is therefore an agreement with reciprocal advantages: for the European Union, obviously, because its fleet has access to important fishing grounds, but also for Guinea-Bissau, which, besides the financial contribution, will be in a better position to ensure more sustainable management of what is perhaps its greatest economic resource through support for research, monitoring, surveillance and improving the health conditions of fishery products.
It is therefore a balanced and mutually advantageous agreement, which is why I recommend that Parliament approve my report, with the amendment introduced by the Development Committee and with my own proposed amendments, which merely seek to reinforce Parliament's position in monitoring these areas.
I myself, meanwhile, although the Commissioner apparently claims that he is unable to accept these proposals, consider on the contrary that fishing policy can only gain from a more affirmative and more permanent stance by Parliament.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the only purpose of the fisheries agreement is to guarantee the short-term economic interests of yet another EU industry which does not come up to scratch in international terms.
There are three reasons why we have to vote against the fisheries agreement tomorrow.
The first is the environment.
The exhaustion of West African waters will soon be a reality.
Biological diversity is seriously threatened and a continuation of this insane fisheries policy will have long-term effects on the environment, both locally and globally.
My second objection is on economic grounds.
European taxpayers are forced to subsidise unprofitable fishing fleets by millions of euros each year.
Where is the economic gain in that?
Where is the sustainability?
Where is the value added for Europe?
If instead the vessels were compelled to bear their own costs, the pressure on fisheries would be reduced and both the taxpayers and the environment would be the winners.
The third reason is the importance of fishing to local development in the partnership countries.
Fishing is, for many of them, their only source of income.
The hoovering of the seas creates an unsustainable situation for the local population, who cannot compete with heavily subsidised European vessels.
It is time to put an end to these fisheries agreements, and the time is now.
Mr President, I really have to ask Commissioner Borg if he believes what he is saying now.
Has he been scripted and sent in?
Is he really trying to say that these FPAs are sustainable?
A very interesting article in the New York Times on 14 January 2008 talks about major fish populations collapsing in West Africa and the desire for money from foreign fleets to override concerns about the long-term health of fisheries - the desire for money from the EU also to override any concerns about the health of fisheries.
Guinea-Bissau, a nation of 1.4 million people: a prime example of how not to run a fishery.
According to Vladimir Kacyznski, a marine scientist with the University of Washington, no one has comprehensively studied the nation's coastal waters for at least 20 years.
And for two years Sanji Fati was in charge of enforcing Guinea-Bissau's fishing rules.
When he took the job in 2005, he did not have a single working patrol boat to monitor hundreds of pirates and dozens of industrial trawlers, most of them foreign.
An estimated 40% of fish were caught without licences or in violation of regulations.
Quite frankly, I wonder whether we know what we are doing here.
We have a huge conflict of interests.
These desperate economies need our money, and they are prepared to sell their fishing resources.
We should know better.
Let them have the money but let us not rape their waters.
Commissioner Borg, please think again!
(PL) Mr President, as a substitute member of the Committee on Fisheries present in the Chamber, I would like to say a few words about the report we are discussing.
It is a specialised, detailed report, but that is in the nature of the subject matter.
It would be hard to present it in a different way.
Nevertheless, the agreement has a much broader character, since it invokes other values that are important for both sides in this partnership.
May I thank the Commissioner once again.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say that I agree with the comments made by the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, that fisheries and the revenue that is derived from the fisheries partnership agreement form a very important part of the budget of Guinea-Bissau.
We are now working in a spirit of partnership as against the traditional fisheries agreements where the objective was to go and catch fish, pay for the fish caught and leave.
These fisheries partnership agreements are modelled on the basis of helping the country concerned to build its fisheries infrastructure and to build related sectors so that there could also be a diversion from pure fishing to fish-related activities like aquaculture, where that is possible.
The aim is also to see to it that the fishing activities that are carried out by our fleets under a fisheries partnership agreement relate only to the surplus.
For example, in this case, at our request, an evaluation study was carried out at the end of 2005 by an independent external consultant, whose recommendations in terms of management and conservation of resources have been taken into account, together with the scientific advice provided by Guinea-Bissau's Research Institute following the 2006 trawling campaign.
Furthermore, the protocol includes a number of binding measures in its Annex III, with a view to implementing a management plan for the global fishing effort in the Guinea-Bissau exclusive economic zone.
According to the fisheries plan, Guinea-Bissau committed itself to reducing the fishing effort on shrimps and cephalopods, maintaining in 2007 the existing agreements with third countries and the European Community, preventing the mobilisation in 2008 and subsequent years of fishing opportunities granted to third countries from 1 January 2007 which have remained unused, not granting any fishing opportunities for chartering in these categories, and revoking and formally terminating all agreements with European companies, associations or enterprises.
In addition, datasheets 1 and 2 of Annex II, applicable to fin-fish, cephalopod and shrimp trawlers, provide for the possibility of biological recovery periods.
With regard to shrimp fishing, Guinea-Bissau has also undertaken to increase the mesh size from 40 to 50 mm, in keeping with existing legislation in the subregion.
I would say that it is in spite of these fisheries partnership agreements that a lot of illegal fishing activity is carried out and a lot of private licensing is granted to third countries not belonging to the European Union, and it is by virtue of these fisheries partnership agreements that we can control and manage our own fishing fleets so that they fish in a sustainable manner in Guinea-Bissau and other waters.
So I have to say that, yes, I believe that it is beneficial to the third country concerned for the European Union, for the European Community, to negotiate and enter into such fisheries partnership agreements under the new regime.
I agree with you, however, that the previous regime did exploit the resources, but the new arrangement is that we are only interested in negotiating agreements on the surplus, so that if the stock in the third-country waters is already fully exploited or overexploited we do not enter into a fisheries partnership agreement.
If it is underexploited, then we only enter into an agreement for the surplus, and we do our utmost to see to it that our own fleets, at least, do carry out and do maintain the commitments undertaken under the agreement.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, I would like to say first of all that I deeply regret the 'moralistic' attitude that some Members are trying to impress upon this debate, which in my view only reveals great ignorance of what is reasonably at issue.
I am reasonably familiar with Guinea-Bissau and with its political, economic and social reality and recent history, and I am well aware of the assault on Guinea-Bissau's resources in the late 1970s by the fishing fleet of the then Soviet Union, and of the effectively predatory attitude of some of our competitors in terms of global fishing.
I believe that the philosophy underlying EU fisheries policy is a matter for pride rather than embarrassment, and it is regrettable that the other fishing powers do not follow our example.
And the proof of this is that the respective report was approved by all the members of the Development Committee, while an overwhelming majority of the Fisheries Committee approved my report.
I believe that this is the possible and politically realistic way forward, and the one that best serves the interests not only of the European Union but also of the people of Guinea-Bissau.
Therefore once again, Mr President, I urge Parliament to approve this report because it is politically balanced and it is a partnership agreement which is mutually advantageous for the parties concerned.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday, 11 March 2008.

Statement by the President
Today we are commemorating the fourth European Day of the Victims of Terrorism.
It is a day that we must keep in our memory in order to remember all those who have been the innocent victims of terrorism.
The terrorist attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 -four years ago today - and in London on 7 July 2005 claimed many victims and left many families torn apart by the barbarities of terrorism.
Just last Friday, the terrorist organisation ETA assassinated again.
IsaÃ­as Carrasco, a former Socialist councillor, was shot when he left his home in MondragÃ³n.
I wish to express our deepest condolences to all his family.
As President of the European Parliament and on my own behalf, I should like to reassure you that the victims of terrorism - wherever they are in the world - will never be erased from our memories.
Today, we shall commemorate IsaÃ­as Carrasco and all the victims of terrorism, in order to assure the victims of the madness of terrorist attacks of our respect and our sympathy.
They are and will always remain present in our hearts and in our work.
Sympathy for and solidarity with all the families of the victims is a duty for all of us.
The European Parliament is actively involved in the fight against terrorism and in supporting the victims of terrorist attacks.
I cannot repeat often enough that there is absolutely no justification for terrorism.
We must therefore take a united approach in this fight on the basis of the rule of law and with all the force of the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise from your seats for a minute's silence in memory of the victims of terrorism.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence.)

Annual policy strategy 2009 (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on the annual policy strategy for 2009.
President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to present the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009, which sets out the main policy priorities envisaged by the Commission for next year.
As you know, the objective of the annual policy strategy is to spark a dialogue with the other institutions, in particular the European Parliament, on where the priorities should lie next year.
This dialogue is essential to ensuring proper preparation of the Commission work programme for 2009.
2009 will be a special year, a transition year of great importance marked, I am confident, by the likely entry into force of the new European Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon.
2009 will also be symbolically very important because we will have a chance to celebrate 20 years of the march of freedom since the fall of the Berlin Wall, so it is a very important opportunity to commemorate freedom and the reunification of Europe.
It will also be the year of the election of a new European Parliament and a new Commission, so what we do in the first six months of 2009 will set the mood for the European elections.
The smooth implementation of the Lisbon Treaty will ensure a European Union fit to tackle the challenges of the future.
I hope and expect that we will see the finishing touches to the most ambitious system in the world to tackle climate change and promote energy security.
And it is particularly important that we do it in the first half of 2009 at the latest, so that the European Union can be ready to make a decisive contribution to the global negotiations at the Copenhagen Conference at the end of that year.
But first a word on 2008.
Given the institutional changes to come and, in particular, the end of the legislative term, the Commission has made every attempt to ensure that the new legislative proposals included in the 2008 work programme are scheduled for adoption by the College before the end of 2008.
Thirty-five legislative initiatives are foreseen in the work programme.
We will work hard to try to minimise those likely to come in the closing months of the year, such as the framework directive on consumer contractual rights, the review of the Energy Taxation Directive, and the directives on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers and trainees.
We will also make every effort to ensure that these proposals are presented according to the envisaged timetable to make this possible.
I very much hope that Parliament will be in a position to deliver its first-reading opinion on all the proposals flowing from the Commission work programme before the end of this parliamentary term.
I would like to underline that, as far as the Commission is concerned, we are fully on track to deliver all the strategic initiatives we have announced and, hence, to repeat our record performance of an implementation rate of 96%, which we achieved in 2007.
It is the highest implementation rate ever in the work of the Commission.
As regards 2009, the Commission will stick to its ambition of delivering a Europe of results, bringing concrete benefits to citizens.
We will focus on completing what has been started since the beginning of our mandate and make every effort to achieve the strategic objectives defined in 2005 and to address the challenges ahead.
This will, of course, require close cooperation between Parliament and the Commission.
The entry into force of the Reform Treaty will also require the Commission to present a number of proposals to give force to its provisions, and I will highlight here those proposals that will promote greater democracy for, and greater participation by, Europe's citizens, such as the citizens' initiative.
We look forward to discussing with Parliament in the coming weeks and months how we can best progress with these proposals in the first few months of next year.
The main policy priorities which the Commission envisages for next year are structured around five pillars.
First, promoting sustainable growth and jobs will remain at the heart of our agenda and of the renewed Lisbon Strategy.
We will also pursue the implementation of the innovation strategy, the deepening of the European Research Area and the follow-up to the single market review.
In this context, I am looking forward to the second-reading adoption of the European Institute of Technology - one of our flagship actions - later today, and I would like to congratulate this House on the excellent job it has done on bringing this to fruition.
Major effort will be put into promoting the transition to a low-emissions and resource-efficient economy.
The Copenhagen meeting will be a major rendezvous to reach a global climate change agreement for the period beyond 2012.
Europe must prepare its ground well and maintain its role as the pioneer on climate change.
Work on how to assist with adaptation to the impact of climate change will need to be pursued.
In an era of globalisation, we should strive to make a reality of the common immigration policy.
Work in this area will draw on the communication on immigration to be presented in June 2008.
We will also focus our attention on delivering policies of direct interest to citizens through a common area of justice, fashioning a European response to chemical, biological and radiological threats, the European Union health strategy and through enforcing food and product safety rules more vigorously.
The revised and modernised social agenda will also guide our actions in a comprehensive approach to enable Europeans to realise their potential and benefit from globalisation, and will cover mobility, integration, education and non-discrimination.
The key concepts for this social agenda will be access, opportunities and solidarity.
Finally, we will pursue our objective of consolidating the role of Europe as a global partner.
Enlargement negotiations will continue and the Western Balkans association and stabilisation process will be further developed.
We will implement the neighbourhood policy and launch operational partnerships with African countries under the joint European Union-Africa strategy.
The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty will significantly raise the Union's external profile.
To translate this new framework into action, a major task for the Commission will be to help establish the European External Action Service - all this for 2009, if all the timetables, as we hope, are respected.
The year 2009 will also be an important year in terms of preparing the ground for the future financing of the Union's policies.
The results of the consultation now under way on the budget review will help us to prepare the ground for the next multiannual financial framework, to be proposed by the next Commission.
As in previous years, the APS proposes communication priorities for 2009.
In the run-up to the European elections, the Commission will seek to maximise its work in partnership with the other institutions and to help spark a lively debate on European policies.
The annual policy strategy is only the beginning of the process, leading to the adoption of the Commission's legislative and work programme in October.
The Commission looks forward to regular dialogue with Parliament on the priorities to be taken forward in 2009.
I understand that Parliament intends to adopt a plenary resolution on the Commission's legislative and work programme in September, a couple of weeks before we adopt the work programme for 2009.
This plenary resolution will follow on from the summary report reflecting the results of our regular dialogue.
It should provide us with a fully-grounded, politically-backed indication of where Parliament thinks the Commission should focus its commitment and its policies in 2009, in good time for the drawing-up of the work programme, focusing on European added value and in full respect of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Therefore, my message to you today is that I am very much looking forward to this possibility of working with you on this very important programme for 2009.
Let us work together to keep up the pace of action in 2009, so that Europe continues to deliver concrete results for the benefit of our citizens.
(Applause)
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Nassauer, our Commission President is not so weak; he has already withstood many a criticism.
However, I do believe, Commission President, that our common aim - when I listen to your speeches and read your interviews - is that in 2009 we shall also continue to expand a social and ecological Europe in a globalised world.
You know that the social aspects lie especially close to our hearts and you also know that we were particularly concerned, for example, about the conclusion of the European Court of Justice in connection with the Laval case.
We hope that we - Parliament and you in the Commission - can work on this together so that citizens do not feel that the social successes we have achieved with some difficulty are being undone again by bogus quantitative competition.
We stand by qualitative competition within Europe, competition that Europe, of course, has to drive, taking account of environmental concerns.
The social element, however, is central for us as Social Democrats.
On the subject of the environment, I thank the Commission for its proposals, which are very forward-looking.
Like you, we declare our faith in the sustainable development of this continent; sustainability for us also applies to Europe as an industrial base - one which has to adapt and take on ecological targets and for which there have to be obligations and incentives.
Together we must work to ensure that industry and the economy have a major role in future in terms of production on this continent - in the interest of jobs - because the ecological targets are perfectly compatible with Europe as an industrial base.
This is also a task that we must perform together.
We can perform this task only if we also persuade the other partners - the United States, China and India - to take on the same ecological targets.
Moreover, we can perform it only if we also reach our neighbours, if we create a common policy with our neighbours.
You know that we are not entirely happy with many of the strategies that have been developed.
With regard to the Balkans, for example, we recently proposed that, alongside the Lisbon process, there should also be what is referred to as the Ljubljana process with the Slovenian Presidency, to promote the economic and social development of this region, because the hatred and existing conflicts there can be resolved only if there is also sound economic and social development in the Balkans.
With regard to the Mediterranean Union - now on everybody's lips, even on those of the Foreign Ministers - we want a clear position on this from the Commission.
You have already hinted at this, Commission President, but you must constantly make it clear that we will not consider any union that does not embrace the entire European Union.
It must be a community that does not cut straight through the European Union, but includes the European Union with the Mediterranean countries.
Similarly the debate should also surely be about the Black Sea region, and here we are also waiting for the Commission's initiatives because it is not only about our Southern neighbours, of course; it is also about our Eastern neighbours.
We cannot offer new memberships here either in the short term; that is not possible.
However, we can offer to develop stronger cooperation, together with these countries, and we expect more Commission initiatives on this than have so far been included in the existing papers.
Commission President, you have commented that it is also an election year.
It is an election year and hopefully the year in which the Reform Treaty will enter into force.
We do not expect the Commission to interfere in the political debates of this election year, but we do expect a clear vision from the Commission of how this Europe is to function in future as an ecological and social Europe.
We expect the Commission to make it clear that it has a strong voice - including in dialogue with our partners.
Only when we speak to the United States, China, etc. with a strong voice will we be able to assert the interests of our citizens.
In an election year, we want a strong Commission with visions for the Europe of tomorrow!
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I think I should present the compliments of my group on the policy strategy that President Barroso has put forward for what, as he has said himself, will be an important and challenging year.
The Commission has produced a strategy which is good in its political, financial and management content, and it has avoided what we sometimes call in my country 'end-of-term-itis'.
Of course, we need to concentrate to some extent on the weaknesses but, having heard Mr Nassauer, I would perhaps call them differences in points of emphasis rather than weaknesses, if I may put it that way.
Certainly, there is an issue about bridging the mandate gap.
If I look at the internal market area, issues like the European patent, patient mobility and the European private company law project are all issues which will read across.
President Barroso has perhaps mentioned one or two of them, but we need to make sure that they flow through in the next mandate, because they are all essential parts of the internal market.
In that respect I would have perhaps expected to see more of a theme emerging with regard to the need for what I would call financial security for our citizens in a world where we know there is financial turbulence at the moment and where people feel uncertain about the future - perhaps more of a theme in that respect.
It is, of course, also the year of implementation of the Treaty and, whilst we can welcome, and I do welcome, the concentration in the document on the implementation theme - and I think that the idea of working with the Member States in future to ensure implementation of law across the board in a much more coordinated fashion is excellent - I would have preferred to see something in the document about that piece of legislation that will be so central to our citizens, the citizens' initiative, but President Barroso stole my thunder by mentioning it this morning, so that is good.
But it is central, and we need to make sure that the Commission brings forward the legislation to deal with that.
Also, perhaps, some thought should be given to the relationship with national parliaments.
Then, briefly with regard to external relations, can we have some read across with regard to external relations, energy and climate change - all of those issues?
We know the Commission is discussing them.
They have a high priority, not only somewhere like the Arctic, but in other areas of the globe as well.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President and Vice-President of the Commission, I fully support the European Commission's policy work programme for the coming year.
This programme seeks to develop Europe's economic and political affairs.
This policy work programme promotes Europe and prioritizes the interests of the people of Europe.
I very much support the first policy of the programme; the promotion of employment and development in the European Union.
As we move into the year of the ratification of the Treaty, we who support the ratification of this Treaty by referendum in Ireland are hammering home the point of view that Europe must become more efficient, that it is essential that we recognise that the Treaties that were there for six, ten or fifteen countries no longer apply to a European Union of twenty-seven countries.
In particular, we want to emphasise the necessity for greater innovation, research and technology towards creating the dynamic new economy for Europe in the 21st century.
In particular, I am delighted that the President of the Commission and the other Commissioners did not throw everything into the annual policy strategy 2009.
It would be so easy to say that we are going to do so many things, but instead it has focused on key essential areas such as climate change, as has already been mentioned, and the issue of Europe as a world partner and as a world player - in particular when we look at the risks and dangers around the world that we face today, not just in the Middle East, not just in the Western Balkans, not just in Africa, but even in South America, where in the last week we have seen how tension can arise so quickly.
What is really required is a stabilising force, which the European Union can provide on that world stage.
Finally, the European Union must fully uphold the action required with regard to combating illegal drug importation, people trafficking and in particular the diminution of respect for individual human lives.
Please be assured that we, and my party Fianna FÃ¡il in Ireland, will be campaigning strongly to guarantee the ratification of the Treaty to allow for the future development of Europe.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commission President, ladies and gentlemen, with an annual strategy we have the choice of two paths.
The first would be maximum clarity and consistency between statements and financial action.
This would be particularly appropriate in an election year, because we are indeed promising that we will be - I quote -'Putting the Citizen First'.
Citizens are entitled to clarity.
The Commission, however, has unfortunately chosen the second path instead, namely to remain as general as possible in order to cover up opposition.
First of all the context itself is interesting.
We have to expect that the Treaty of Lisbon will be implemented.
We are in an election year and we are in a year in which Europe has also very extensively committed itself internationally to climate protection.
Unfortunately, words have so far been followed by far too few actions and this has not been made sufficiently clear in strategy either.
If we remain as hesitant about practical measures as we are about car emissions, for instance, then Europe's credibility is at stake and we cannot afford this in the long run at international level in debates with our partners on the subject of climate protection.
This is a negative example of our yielding to major lobbies, as with the implementation of the emissions trading system in air traffic, where we have also acted too hesitantly and not energetically enough and have therefore not managed to introduce the necessary measures for reducing climate damage caused by air traffic with the required efficiency.
There is also a conflict between the ambitious targets and the actual funding of research.
When we talk on the one hand about new sources of energy, but on the other hand about still assigning the lion's share of research funds to nuclear power, to the nuclear economy, this conflict cannot be resolved, nor should we then expect any sustainable solution, because there are no opportunities here whatsoever for investing in a truly concerted manner.
What I think this strategy lacks is a clear commitment to implementing Community law in the Member States.
There are far too few mechanisms here; there is far too little regard for the law.
In fact, the opposite is true: we are developing new plans before the old ones have been implemented.
Here I would simply refer you back to the energy action plan.
If citizens are so important to us, as you rightly stress, then their grievances, among other things, as well as the new opportunity for a referendum, must be the focus of our attention in this House.
Mr President, President of the Commission, we still have a practical work programme for 2009, on which we could comment.
However, it is apparent that no major strategic changes can be expected to the Commission's policy strategy in the coming year.
It reads: the Commission wants to improve its communications task, get the idea of Europe across and raise citizens' awareness of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Would a referendum on the Reform Treaty not be the right way to involve citizens in this process?
Do you really believe the voter turnout will increase when you continue merely to state how marvellously current policy is working and that we must therefore simply continue to pursue the existing concepts?
What many people experience in real terms is less social security, stagnating wage levels, serious curtailment of employment rights, rising prices for basic services in local public transport, health provision, energy and water supplies, education and child care - all of this when the profits of large enterprises are rising at the same time as these enterprises are threatening to relocate.
The Commission talks about the importance of lifelong learning for employability, the importance of flexicurity - so that I am frequently left wondering where security is hiding, when the Commission puts forward legislative proposals.
The Commission writes about the need to strengthen competitiveness and talks here again specifically of those who are already strong anyway, who are to be freed from taxes - in other words, social responsibility.
You refer to it as administrative burdens.
However, if we want to have social, ecological and consumer protection standards, these must also be agreed and implemented!
Nowhere do I find in your strategy the idea that perhaps the overall concept of the Lisbon Strategy, the concept of liberalisation and privatisation, simply does not work in the interest of the majority of people in many instances, and quite specifically not in the public services sector.
The foreign policy and foreign trade sector emphasises Europe's important role in the world in terms of peace, security and stability and talks about the priority of multilateralism and partnership.
Your paper states that the Doha Development Round remains a top priority.
However, it contains nothing that shows how the EU wishes to contribute to the success of the development round.
Instead, emphasis is placed on the familiar regional and bilateral free trade agreements, which for this reason make hardly any headway because they just do not meet the requirements of developing and emergent countries.
Moreover, the Global Europe foreign trade strategy is purely a strategy for promoting foreign trade for European conglomerates, which care little about regional and sustainable economic, social and ecological developments in partner countries.
It contains nothing about small and medium-sized enterprises, yet you wonder why states like China are fighting back with dumping measures.
Indeed you even wanted to continue cancelling the largely inadequate anti-dumping instruments!
The Commission talks about improving operational and conflict management capability in third countries.
After what has just been said, I would ask you: does it not make much more sense to fight the social, but definitely the economic, causes of crises and conflicts as well?
Change your strategy so that we can win citizens' support for a European Union!
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I love coming here to the regulation factory.
It is so amusing.
I have just looked through the headings under the Commission's annual policy strategy and it starts with 'growth and jobs'.
To be honest, this place would be very much better served to talk about growth and jobs if at least more than 1% of this Chamber had had any experience at all of commerce.
I am a businessman and I can understand growth and I can understand jobs.
Sadly, the more you regulate, the more you legislate, the less likely you are to produce growth and jobs, which is why GDP growth in Europe is positively dire and it is taking off in the rest of the world - China, India, the subcontinent.
We are even beaten by North America.
So, I would suggest that if we want growth and jobs, we get out of people's faces and let them get on with it, without interference from this place.
Sustainable Europe?
Well, fascinating, is it not?
We talk about the global footprint, we talk about all this sort of nonsense, despite the fact that the globe has not actually warmed for 10 years - the science is thrown out of the window.
If anybody wants to take any serious look at global science and global warming and climate change, they will see that, actually, most informed, not politically-biased, scientists regard it as fact that we will actually have a colder planet by 2050, not a warmer one.
But that does not suit our book, does it?
Because we like to tax and we like to regulate.
Then we look at managed migration.
Well, dear, oh dear.
As an Englishman, I can tell you: managed migration?
We have had a million people come into our tiny little overcrowded island in the last year.
Please, please, please, will this place, just for once, get real!
(NL) In my opinion, things go badly wrong even at the very beginning of the introduction of the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009.
I am talking about one of the main ideas put forward there, and I quote: 'Putting the Citizen First'.
This is adding insult to injury, as they say.
After all, nowhere does the European Commission put European citizens first, nowhere does it show respect for them.
What is the European Commission?
When all is said and done, it is little more than a body of politically appointed officials with extremely limited democratic legitimacy, belonging to the small circle of European mandarins who think they know better than citizens and believe it would be best if, supposedly in the public interest, they decided everything themselves, even over the heads of the citizens they purport to respect.
This is the democratic deficit about which everyone talks but no one does anything.
If citizens really came first, the Commission would insist on consulting these citizens, particularly in the case of the most important issues currently on the table.
When are citizens going to be allowed to give their opinion on the new, disguised European Constitution?
The citizens of the Netherlands and France gave their opinion on it not long ago, but it is clear that the European Commission does not put those citizens first.
When are European citizens going to be allowed to give their opinion on the disastrous immigration policy being shoved down their throats by the European mandarins?
When will these citizens be allowed to take their own decisions and enjoy respect for their opinions on vitally important matters such as the potential accession to our European Union of Turkey, an Islamic and in many respects, indeed all respects, non-European country?
The only time the European Union puts citizens first is when it comes to their paying taxes for the European mandarins and the policies that these privileged persons force on them over their heads.
That being the case, at least have the courage to say that Europe will never be a democratic entity.
(ES) Mr President, external action in 2009 should be marked by two fundamental facts: firstly the entry into force of the new Treaty which, on the one hand, establishes a new institutional framework in which, President of the Commission, Parliament will want to play its rightful role and, on the other hand, the External Action Service, which should, in our opinion, take up residence in the Commission and not be gobbled up by the Council.
Beyond this, the priorities presented by the Commission are correct: enlargement, relations with Russia on the basis of respect for human rights, and security of energy supply; the stabilisation and association policy in the Balkans and the case of Kosovo; the neighbourhood policy, with the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean Union that will be presented by the French Presidency of the Union.
There is also the situation in Central Asia, with the conflicts in Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr President, we will see the development of relations with China, India and the Asian countries, which are correctly set out in the Commission's proposal; the situation in the Middle East, in which the European Parliament unconditionally supported the Commission's proposal at the Paris Conference.
In addition, there is the strategic partnership with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific and, last but not least, relations with Latin America, regarding which we hope that conclusions will be reached at the Lima Summit in time for Association Agreements to be made with Mercosur, the Andean Community and Central America.
President of the Commission, we need serious, effective and viable external action by the European Union, which needs to speak with one voice in international organisations.
We cannot allow ourselves to be an International Red Cross destined to carry the cost of major contemporary crises.
The European Union needs to carry weight on the international stage as a global player, in line with its economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight.
President of the Commission, you have our support for this programme.
(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, here we are at last at the launch of the political priorities procedure for 2009.
It is an important step because there will be many changes - a new parliamentary term, the establishment of the Treaty - and it also marks a new way of responding in Parliament to the Commission's annual policy strategy, since we have decided that the political groups will speak rather than the Committee on Budgets.
The political choices of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are clear, and they have already been stated: they are for a social Europe.
They want a Europe that is in favour of making the fight against climate change a priority; they also want a Europe that favours common external action.
When I see that the Commission wants the EU's contribution to security and stability on the international scene to be increased, I wonder: Where are we going to find the money?
How are we going to make this pious wish a reality?
If we continue along the same path, the Council will put us in an untenable position, as it does every year: that of choosing which area of the world to sacrifice.
A fourth priority for us is our citizens. What the Commission tells us is that citizens should be put first in 2009.
It is high time, because our political project cannot go on being so remote from the people.
We therefore need to improve all our exchanges, information and communication, but where are the funds for this?
One thing is clear: budgetary resources are lacking!
The margins available have already been spoken for and we in the Committee on Budgets do not know now how these priorities are going to be financed.
We do not want to sacrifice the old priorities in order to implement new ones.
What are you going to do?
There is great urgency to lift Europe out of its budgetary and administrative muddle.
The political world is changing very quickly and we in Europe are coming up with ideas, but we have never been able to adopt the resources needed to implement them pragmatically as regards the political expectations of Parliament, certainly, but also of our citizens.
Mr President, by the end of this year we will have two reports from the Commission on free movement: one on the free movement of workers - and I suppose the Commission will probably advise the Member States to lift the transitional arrangements applied to workers coming from the new Member States - and the other on the implementation of the Directive on free movement of citizens, and we may see a number of Member States being sent to the European Court of Justice in this regard.
All the fears that governed the transitional arrangements put in place with the 2004 enlargement are now starting to dissipate.
No economic security or demographic reason remains for keeping the work restrictions for another five years.
On the contrary, a free European labour market is what is needed to present Europe as a model, as a partner and as a world leader.
We are regulating access to our labour market for third-country citizens.
That is fair enough, and much appreciated.
But, first, let us sort things out in our own back yard.
Let us have a coherent and a common policy on the free movement of workers inside the Union.
If we are to be true to the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and if we are serious about making the Lisbon Strategy a reality, the time has come to put an end to verbal action and start real action.
Finally, I would add that, from the outset, this Commission was given a green light to address the fundamental rights of citizens, and I was looking forward to seeing something very specific on those issues in the plan for next year.
(PL) Mr President, 2009 represents a year of enlarged prospects for Europe, prospects that will be offered by the Lisbon Treaty.
It is also a year of hope for deeper unity in Europe because of the new elections to the European Parliament.
As Mr Barroso mentioned, we shall celebrate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
May I take this opportunity to remind you that it fell in Warsaw.
This will also be the 5th anniversary of the accession of former communist states to the European Union.
This accession has not always been entirely equable: Polish farmers are still competing on unequal terms with farmers in the old Union.
In spite of this it is my belief that 2009 will erase the differences between our countries, at least on a psychological level, and will increase the sense of unity and influence of the European Union.
Mr President, I will use my speech to propose a reform of the way we deal with the annual programmes.
Until now the elected members of national parliaments and the European Parliament had no say.
The annual programme is initiated and adopted by the non-elected in the Commission.
Member States coordinate their priorities through the working programmes of the shifting presidencies.
We discuss both; we amend nothing.
We do not represent our voters in the very important agenda-setting function.
Instead, we should insist on one joint working programme for all institutions in the next year.
The Commission could draft a detailed proposal with annexes of all proposals for laws they intend to propose, including their legal base.
Then the national parliaments should deal with it in their sectoral committees for a first reading, then in their European committees and finally in their plenaries.
National parliaments should meet in COSAC and formally adopt the working programme.
Parliament should have its own readings, and then the European Union would be governed bottom-up instead of top-down.
It would be directed by elected representatives of our peoples instead of being governed by civil servants and lobbyists behind closed doors.
When the programme is adopted, the national parliaments could then start the reading of the concrete proposals for 'subsidiarity and proportionality' and decide the legal base.
Then the European institutions could take over, and all laws could be passed - both in the Council, with the support of 75% of the Member States, and in the European Parliament, with the normal majority.
Then Europe would be a democracy, instead of the mixture of the ideas of Machiavelli and Mussolini we build on today.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the principal actions planned for 2009 can mainly be supported, as regards the growth and jobs provided for by the Lisbon Strategy.
Certainly, there are points under the single market and competition of which I am in favour.
There are also valuable points under the sustainable Europe heading.
Regrettably, the common visa policy should be completely rejected because, in my opinion, apart from being anti-national, it is completely outside the mandate of this Parliament and what our intentions should be.
I am also entirely opposed to the enlargement to include Croatia and Turkey, as well as to the part that talks about Kosovo, regarding which I have already had occasion to criticise the flouting of international law that occurred when its independence from a sovereign state was recognised.
For this reason, I will be voting against the policy strategy.
(HU) Mr President, President of the Commission, we welcomed the Commission's policy strategy in the hope that it would also be put into effect.
There is one possible obstacle to this: fiscal constraint.
This may make it difficult to undertake new things.
Member States' willingness to contribute has fallen to less than 1%, with the result that funds for new ideas will have to come almost exclusively from redistribution of existing resources.
Let us not do this, however, without looking closely at the programmes currently running.
Let us examine where we get more value for money, and where we get less.
Let us not allow lobby groups to decide on our behalf.
As part of the reform of Parliament, a new type of cooperation is evolving between the specialist committees and the Committee on Budgets.
One feature of this is that the rationale and usefulness of expenditures on individual programmes can be laid bare in more detail than before.
Although it may be a painful decision, it is smarter to bring some programmes to an end, or not to begin them at all, rather than under-finance them.
Scanty investment is a pointless waste of money.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament need to act in concert to ensure that only programmes that can be adequately resourced and produce genuine results are allowed to run.
Parliament looks towards this year's policy strategy in readiness for concerted action of this sort.
Thank you for your kind attention.
(FR) Mr President, much has been said about foreign affairs in the Commission Communication, yet it leaves me feeling hungry for more.
Heading 4 is of course underfunded.
Unfortunately, we are indeed going to have to pay more for Palestine and Kosovo.
However, that is an observation, not a strategy.
I would have liked to know, for example, what political conditions are necessary for aid to be effective; not just visible but effective.
How could we use the financial instruments to make Europe a soft power that cannot be ignored, one that provides a democratic model and is not just a cash till?
How are we going to use conditionality?
None of these questions, however key, is addressed.
One example, and it is not the only one, is that never before have we paid so much money to Palestine, yet the people of Gaza have never been so poor since 1967, and violence continues to escalate in the Middle East, where we just keep rebuilding what has been destroyed.
What lesson can we learn from this?
Until there is perfect coherence between European foreign policy and its financial instruments, with the latter at the service of the former and not the other way round, Europe will never be the global player it wants to be, and in this regard I find the Commission's Communication singularly lacking in ambition.
(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I assume that today we are holding a debate on policy strategy for the last time in this form because we are to have a new model in the Treaty of Lisbon.
A plan is therefore already in place, at least here in this House, and I am already looking forward to this new model because it means that we can include the powers of the Council in this very important debate.
Please allow me, therefore, also to make a few comments for the last time from the point of view of budgetary control and to offer a few additional suggestions in keeping with the tone set by Mr Nassauer.
We are currently holding extensive discussions with the Commission on the protection of the Community's financial interests and the Commission has announced significant efforts in this regard.
We would like to have seen whether these significant efforts - for which we are grateful and which we also need - would also find their way into the annual programme.
The work you have promised to do would also have merited this.
We need new methods of retrieving the funds paid out illegally and we also need stronger cooperation between the Commission and the Member States.
All this is an impressive programme from Mr Barroso's Commission.
Our advice would therefore have been to include this, too, in the Commission's annual programme.
It would have merited this and it would also reassure us that you think it is as important as you are now saying.
(FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, as regards the European Union in the world, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament shares the Commission's desire to continue the work begun in 2006 to improve the effectiveness of the way in which it cooperates.
I recall in this regard that there are still very many areas being looked at, whether it is a question of the definition of development itself, coherence between different EU policies, coordination between donors or complementarity of actions.
As regards the economic partnership agreements, I would like to remind you that we European Socialists believe it is essential to consider them chiefly from the point of view of development, or in other words, from the point of view of their ability to improve the lives of people in the ACP countries significantly.
It is essential that the Commission's 2009 strategy is perfectly clear about this.
This does not seem to be entirely the case at the moment.
We all know, moreover, that additional funds will be necessary to finance the accompanying measures aimed at compensating for the announced negative impact of the economic partnership agreements on what are - I should not have to remind you - the world's poorest countries.
We would hope that the Commission would say where these funds will come from.
We also regret that the Commission document does not contain any specific proposals for the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals prior to 2015.
Is this through lack of ambition in this area or because 2009 will mark a radical shift in the paradigm of European development policy?
In the annex, the Commission's note also refers to implementation of the first Action Plan of the Joint Africa/EU Strategy.
We are delighted about this and are particularly keen that the Commission should really do everything it can so that the first actions to be taken as part of the new strategy meet the legitimate expectations of the millions of African men and women directly affected by the success of this strategy.
(NL) As the coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for regional policy, I have high hopes for 2009.
Why is that?
It is because implementation of these new programmes in all the regions, in all the Member States, has now been under way since 2007.
What has transpired?
Firstly, we can speak of new cohesion, and the funds are being spent to a greater degree than before on regions and cities, on the Lisbon Strategy, on growth and jobs.
It has also transpired that we are performing better in the field of innovation, whilst investment in research and innovation has more than doubled.
Indeed, in Ljubljana last week Commissioners HÃŒbner and PotoÄnik announced very good figures in this regard.
Thus we can talk of a quiet revolution in the use of these funds - something that must be publicised.
This presents an opportunity to greatly improve communication - to improve communication with citizens in 2009, which is also election year.
This is made possible by the thousands of projects being implemented in the various fields of the economy and ecology.
Failure to choose this very regional policy, this new cohesion policy, as the spearhead of communication with citizens would be a missed opportunity for the Union.
(SV) Mr President, as a Swedish Member with a background in the trade union movement, I would like to begin by endorsing what Hannes Swoboda said: if we are to avoid criticism of the Laval judgment turning against the Treaty, the Commission must make it clear that a free market in services is not a threat to the right of the trade union movement to take action against social dumping.
I just wanted to point that out, since it is relevant in this connection.
When it comes to the policy strategy for 2009, it is clear that we must seriously begin to discuss the mid-term review of the long-term budget.
In some areas, however, I do not think we can wait; we must make a start on changing priorities right now, in the budget for 2009.
I am thinking in particular of two areas.
The first one is climate.
As rapporteur for the budget in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I do not think it is enough to recognise that climate is a political priority.
That recognition must also have effects on budget priorities.
We must show that we are actually prepared to make concrete European contributions, even if they cost money.
That may mean addressing concrete situations when it comes to modern energy and environmental technology.
It may mean changing the use of the structural funds or the Seventh Framework Programme, but there is much that needs to be done.
The second area I want to mention is the Western Balkans, especially Kosovo.
Against the background of the new situation, we must quite simply develop a long-term strategy for our work in the Western Balkans.
It is unreasonable to have such a rigid budget model that the tightest budget margins are in precisely those areas where the needs are greatest.
(DE) Mr President, the Commission is planning the successful introduction of the health check in the agricultural sector for 2009.
As rapporteur on the own-initiative report, I am assuming that with tomorrow's vote, the Commission will have a much better idea of Parliament's position on this matter and I expect that this position will be taken into account in the legislative proposal we are expecting in May.
I welcome the fact that the Commission is making a special effort to promote the concept of quality in agricultural production, particularly with its confirmation of what is referred to as the 2009 Green Paper.
We are of the opinion that the value added through high-quality standards will become an increasingly important starting point for our farmers, even with regard to increasing competition from imports.
I have also noted that the Commission will be putting forward new proposals on the subjects of food safety, animal welfare and health, together with better supervision and better rules.
I appeal to the Commission to be reasonable.
Our farmers cannot be confronted with more regulations if, at the same time, imports from third countries are not subject to these regulations.
Mr President, the Commission intends to put forward a raft of proposals in 2009 for reducing the administrative burden that will change nothing in the level of demand for existing regulations or the political specifications.
I very much hope that this will apply to our farmers, particularly with regard to the cross-compliance rules.
I believe an important subject is missing in the annual policy strategy, and this is the issue of food supply.
The Commission has often used the term but our citizens must have a secure undertaking as to how they can organise continued supply.
(ES) Mr President, as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Fisheries I would like to make the following comments on the Common Fisheries Policy.
Firstly, with regard to the Key Actions envisaged for 2009, and those under item 2 of the Annex on sustainable development, we can see that fisheries policy is incorporated into the integrated maritime policy, something that our Group does not agree with.
While it is true that some aspects of the CFP are part of the maritime policy, so are some aspects of the transport policy, for example, but this does not mean that it is subsumed or hijacked under this heading.
Secondly, with regard to the changes in the allocation of financial resources and, in particular, with regard to heading 2, 'Preservation and management of natural resources', we do not agree that the EUR 6 million required to fund the preparatory action for the maritime policy should have to come from the already small budget for the CFP, especially given that at this point in the budgetary year there is no way of knowing what volume of outstanding appropriations could be made available for other uses.
Mr President, let me offer the Commission two promises, for a change, from Parliament.
One is that we will work with it on the package on climate change to get an effective and workable package in place as quickly as we can.
The second is that we will work to put in place, as quickly as possible, the new Commissioner for Health and, in so saying, let me ask the Vice-President to send our good wishes to Mr Kyprianou and thank him for what he achieved during his time with us.
Thirdly, let me say that the reference to health in this is remarkably thin.
It is true it talks about medical devices and other measures. However, I want to see the other measures, including that cross-border health promise, because if we do not have that in place quickly, then the courts will go on making policy for us in this area, and that is our job as politicians.
So, please make sure that comes through as quickly as the very welcome proposal that is coming, I know, on mental health.
(NL) I am speaking now as coordinator of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the Committee on Development.
I should like to compliment the Commission on its intention to put the broad strategic objectives, such as prosperity, solidarity and security, at the centre of its activities in the long term.
I find it regrettable, however, that little attention is paid to development cooperation and poverty reduction.
After all, these are also very important aspects of a strong, prosperous Europe.
In 2007 we established a Joint EU/Africa Strategy for the first time in history - a milestone.
The implementation of the eight thematic partnerships has yet to get off the ground, however.
We look forward to seeing tangible progress on this score.
Finally, I have to get one more thing off my chest.
European Commissioners are involving themselves increasingly often in national political campaigns.
This started with the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid.
I am concerned about the leadership vacuum arising as a result in crucial European policy areas.
My question to the Commission is whether it is prepared to draw up rules to ensure that, after the elections, the office of European Commissioner will be exercised without interruptions for national election campaigns.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the annual policy strategy paper is dramatically silent on one of the most vital issues for Europe's future: external energy security policy.
Our House, by an overwhelming majority, adopted the report recognising the need for an urgent energy supply security policy.
Since then, the situation has worsened, and we are looking at an increase in dependency, coupled with lack of progress in reducing it.
For example, the Nabucco Project - the diversification flagship of the EU, identified in 2007 by the European Council as one of the most critical projects of European interest - is, according to some, seriously threatened, if not dead.
Europe needs its common energy security policy now.
This should be reflected in the 2009 policy strategy of the Commission.
It is not, I deeply regret.
The whole strategy must not be short-sighted.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, priorities for 2009: priorities are credible if we are able to point out how we have dealt with past priorities in a serious and efficient manner that citizens can understand.
I should therefore also like to ask you, even in the election year of 2009, to take stock of which of the priorities of recent years were practical and implemented, and to involve citizens in developing a communications strategy on this.
Secondly, reducing bureaucracy is a permanent priority, generating confidence among citizens, as well as among small and medium-sized enterprises.
I miss the Small Business Act.
Please build up confidence so that we can also increase voter participation in the EP elections in 2009.
This, too, must be a political priority!
(Applause)
Mr President, I welcome this statement.
But I want to draw attention in particular - and I would like some answers - in relation to page 18 and one of the key actions in relation to 'the wider world': 'If appropriate, implementation of the Doha Development Agreement'.
Well, my concern is that there is a rush to do a deal, but that the only pain will be on the agriculture side of the agreement and that there will be no gain for Europe in terms of non-agricultural market access or services.
I would like some information because I believe that we are being kept in the dark about this.
Citizens in my constituency were at my door all weekend expressing their concern about 70% tariff cuts on beef and dairy which will decimate agriculture and dump the common agricultural policy which we hold dear in this House.
This issue is part of the debate on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland.
I wish it was not but I would like some firm comments from the Vice-President of the Commission to reassure my constituents that they will not be sold out.
(PT) Mr President, all the signs indicate that 2009 will be a year of opportunities.
One of the most positive results of finding a way out of the institutional impasse is the chance to direct our energies towards other subjects, which will enable us to concentrate more on policies.
For several years we have been discussing globalisation, climate change, insufficient security at our borders and instability in neighbouring countries.
For decades we have been thinking about the challenge of the emergence of new economies and about Africa's new role in the world.
It is important to theorise about major challenges and appropriate responses, but Europe cannot be a mere spectator, albeit an interactive one, as the changes take place.
Europe must play an active role, be a factor for reform, a catalyst for development.
The various political priorities indicated by the European Commission, Madam Vice-President, include communication.
There is no better communication policy than to confirm the results achieved.
Europe's importance and relevance for its citizens must be perceived, felt and recognised.
That is the way to win their confidence, the citizens' confidence, and to bring to our citizens what is required of us.
(HU) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to two matters.
The first relates to strengthening the new forms of cooperation; on the one hand we need to strengthen cooperation between the Member States and the European Union, and on the other reinforce cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and in connection with this we need to produce positive examples representing real results.
The other important issue in this context is always a key issue as far as the European Socialists are concerned, namely the issue of social Europe, in other words ensuring welfare, solidarity and security, which we tend to refer to simply as 'social Europe', and achieving the Lisbon objectives as soon as possible.
In this regard I would like to highlight the fact that very little attention has been given in this programme to the situation of women, although in the majority of Member States it is women whose social security is limited, and the spread of precarious forms of employment is on the increase.
I would therefore like special attention to be given to these two areas in 2009.
Thank you very much.
(CS) I would like to contribute to the discussion by pointing out that in the context of all policies there should be a more clearly defined space for small and medium enterprises, which represent the backbone of Europe's employment stability.
Much still needs to be done, especially in new Member States' parliaments, where the concept of flexicurity - a flexible labour market - is still to be put into practice so that companies can react better to new challenges and be able to offer a greater number of new positions.
Moreover, our motto should be to give priority to the small, but when it comes to individual directives and regulations, the Commission's analysis of their impact on small enterprises is lacking.
We do usually have, on the other hand, impact studies prepared by supranational companies.
I welcome the proposed Small Businesses Act and I trust that we will move beyond the stage of ideas so that in the European elections we will be able to say to the European citizens that we have fulfilled our objective of achieving a more effective and secure economic area.
- (LT) In 2009 the make-up of both Parliament and the Commission will change; nevertheless, the continuity of work will be maintained.
I would like to emphasise the importance of the common energy policy.
Since 2006, we have been discussing the issue of EU common energy policy, and Parliament has outlined the dimension of the external energy policy.
This policy is currently of great importance in view of our efforts to procure gas from various sources, and since it is the key topic of various discussions, such as those on new energy sources, the Arctic, etc., it will continue to be relevant in the future.
The European Union should not be the last to discover and make use of new energy sources, as is usually the case.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank all of the Members for their contributions to the debate.
I think that, together with the resolution that you will adopt and the dialogue with committees and respective Commissioners, this will provide a very good political input into the work programme for next year.
This is what I have always argued for: a more political approach to the APS.
I would like to comment on a few issues that have been raised here, which I think are very important.
First, concerning the Lisbon Treaty: as you know, the Commission is fully committed to this new Lisbon Treaty; we are fully committed to its implementation, and we are preparing - not anticipating, but preparing - to be ready for implementation as from early next year.
We are focusing, for example, on the citizens' initiative, mentioned by several speakers; the implementation of the new provisions for working with national parliaments; the accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, and also the external action service, just to mention a few of the things that need good preparation without anticipating.
This is the balance we will have to strike.
I hope there are no doubts about our commitment to the Lisbon Treaty.
We also engage - and this is very important - in the communication and information activities concerning this new Treaty because, regardless of the method of ratification, we have a democratic obligation to engage with citizens by informing them, by listening, and also by explaining what we are doing and the content of this new Treaty.
Regarding the political agenda and the balance between the social and economic agendas, also mentioned by several speakers, I think that this is a very important debate, and these are precisely the questions we will have to take through the dialogue with the committees.
Clearly, there are different emphases and priorities here on the different sides of this House.
I think this has to be dealt with in the resolution, which we look forward to; the results will be in the legislative and work programme in the autumn.
This is where I think we have to focus much of our attention on this political debate.
I would also like to comment on a question raised by Mr Bonde.
I am afraid I do not understand what he is saying, because for some time we have been sending our documents and proposals to the national parliaments.
This has been a very good exercise and has been very much appreciated by the national parliaments.
We have learned a lot from it, and it has increased the understanding of what goes on at European level in the European institutions at national level.
This is also good practice for what will come in the new Treaty; not only that, we have also engaged in a dialogue with national parliaments on the annual policy strategy and on our work programme, and we have been asked to go there to explain and answer questions that the national parliamentarians have had concerning our plans and work programme.
I think this has helped us a lot: we have learned from it, and national parliaments have an opportunity to anchor better and explain better what happens at European level.
Therefore, I really hope that this will be a good experience for us.
To engage the national parliaments in this is not lobbying; rather, it is shaping the European agenda.
This means more democracy, I would say.
Finally, concerning the financing: you will be having this discussion separately, because this is part of the problem - we already have a financial framework until 2013, and we are all facing the limits of the financial frameworks.
After 2009 we will have no additional human resources, so we will be careful to tell you not to ask us to do a lot of new things, because we will not have the manpower to deal with it.
We have to realise that we are conducting this debate on the financial framework separately.
I also want to say to Ms GrÃ€Ãle that, in the area of structural funds, the Commission has recently adopted a very ambitious action plan to ensure the integrity of the money spent in this domain.
Together with the Member States, which, as you know, spend the money on the ground, the Commission intends to undertake all the necessary controls to ensure that every euro spent is well spent.
We will regularly report on this to the Committee on Budgetary Control; this is our definite objective with the control of the money that we spend.
Finally, let me say that we can together focus on the communication priorities, because 2009 will also be a very important year in making sure we have a lively debate before the elections in 2009.
As you know, the communication priorities for 2009 focus on the Lisbon Treaty.
In the first chapter of this annual policy strategy, the Small Business Act is mentioned.
This is part of the Lisbon Strategy and our review of the Lisbon Strategy: to focus also on exactly the things that you have mentioned.
I think they are indeed very important.
We will deliver results from the Lisbon Treaty.
We will be reforming the budget, we will focus on growth and jobs, and we will have energy and climate change.
This will guide many of our communication priorities, and we hope for a lively debate on this European policy.
Finally, let me also draw your attention to the proposal to have an interinstitutional agreement on communication.
We hope this will provide a much better framework for our work together in this field, so thank you again for the debate.
We will have a follow-up on all of this and also the details that you have mentioned, which I think belong more to the dialogue between committees and Commissioners.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place during a later sitting.
Written declarations (Article 142)
in writing. - (PL) I read the Commission's annual policy strategy for 2009 with great care.
In view of the fact that problems concerning small and medium-sized enterprises and the economic context of integration are of particular interest to me, I shall take the liberty of referring to several important points that are contained in the strategy.
We need to look at the European SME sector from a different angle.
We must give it back its priority significance and open up the development potential due to it.
In the document in question I was very pleased to read that the Commission is continuing to prioritise the removal of unnecessary barriers that hold back the development of SMEs.
It also considers it important to undertake to continue work on the European Charter for Small Enterprises, through which I hope we shall learn to think first and foremost along the lines of what would benefit these smallest units before we seek to fit them into the global context.
It is very important to promote and support an innovation strategy, and to show due appreciation for the need for cooperation between scientific centres and businesses.
The section in which the document talks of the priority role of the Union's citizens, treated as consumers, is of equal importance.
There is a clear need for improvement in the way we inform and communicate with the public.
When I talk to voters I notice a general lack of knowledge among them about how the Union functions and about the benefits that all citizens derive from it.
It is important to send out a clear message to citizens on the matters they hold dear; the European Union must become an entity that our citizens feel is close to them, friendly and easy to understand, be they consumers, business people or both.
European Institute of Innovation and Technology (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Reino Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (15647/1/2007 - C6-0035/2008 -.
rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you all for your excellent levels of cooperation.
In our work that is always vital in order to achieve a good result.
There has been talk about setting up an Institute of Innovation and Technology for almost three years now, and time has passed because the Commission's original proposal has needed a good number of improvements made to it.
Parliament's committees, especially the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, have given the proposal a new look.
Parliament and the Council have been guaranteed greater powers without, however, endangering the EIT's autonomy.
The election of its governing board is more closely reminiscent of the election system employed with the European Research Council, which the scientific world has commended.
As someone just said, it has also been confirmed that small and medium-sized enterprises will be able to participate in the work of the EIT and enjoy its benefits.
These are where the impact on employment will be greatest and it is precisely these which have the flexibility and efficiency needed for the swift implementation of innovations.
Above all, it is the Institute's priorities that have changed.
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology, as its name suggests, is to focus on innovation.
The two other elements in the knowledge triangle, education and research, are important, but innovation clearly represents the triangle's apex; it is its point of focus and its main objective.
We will need to invest in quality education and basic research in the future but, as we all know, innovation is Europe's Achilles heel.
The Americans file over a third more patent applications with the European Patent Office than the Europeans themselves.
We need more knowledge-intensive products and services.
In 10 years China has increased its share of GNP spent on research and development from around zero to a current level of one and a half per cent.
In as many as 17 EU Member States the share is lower than in China.
The share of the EU's GNP accounted for by investment in research and development is still significantly lower than that of the other world economic powers.
More alarming still is the fact that here we have seen our share of investment decline, not rise, in recent years.
More or less as bad is the state of venture capital.
The Lisbon Strategy calls for a dynamic approach.
Why do we not have faith in our own schemes?
High levels of education and research produce far too few commercial and functional applications, or at least they are put into effect less often than in competitor countries.
Our patent system is also complicated.
Should the brain drain not be a serious matter for a Union aiming to be the world's leading knowledge-based economy?
The EIT will not eliminate these problems, but it may ease them through the example it sets.
It will provide the business sector with a new kind of link to cooperation in education and research.
It will create opportunities for the commercial exploitation of research, and it will establish closer bilateral ties.
The EIT will not become a super university which keeps the best researchers for itself; Parliament's amendments guarantee that.
After the initial problems which emerged with funding, the situation is now clear.
One of the Knowledge and Innovation Communities I have proposed will concentrate on information and communications technology.
We are already receiving significant amounts of money from the business world for it.
Funding is therefore not a problem.
Investigations and trials alone are not enough: we need cooperation, and for that purpose the EIT has been established.
The excellent compromise reached with the Council is such a favourable one that we can state we are in favour of it, and I would therefore ask everyone to show their support for it in the vote which is to start soon.
I thank you all.
(Applause)
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am really happy - and that is not just a diplomatic phrase - to be here today to speak on the occasion of this opportunity to boost Europe's innovations.
I think that Parliament's vote will be very important.
As Mr Paasilinna mentioned, we have come a long way since the beginning, but I would just like to remind the House that there was a lot of scepticism, reluctance and hesitation about the proposal to boost innovation by such an establishment and I am glad that we have been able to shift these original positions into a consensual and supportive position on the part of Member States, Parliament, the Institutions and partners.
I recall the efforts of the Finnish, then the German, Portuguese and now the Slovenian Presidencies.
In particular I would like to express gratitude here to Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, because he was very instrumental and supportive, and also to the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, as well as Mr BÃ¶ge, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the rapporteur of the Committee on Culture and Education, Ms Hennicot-Schoepges.
Without these efforts and contributions we would not have been able to arrive at this moment.
I think this is an opportunity to show that Europe has the capacity and also a strong commitment to improving its innovation capacity in the globalised world.
Technological innovation is the key to growth, jobs and competitiveness, and this is the basis for the social wellbeing of our citizens.
We are proposing to fully integrate the three sides of the knowledge triangle - education, research and innovation - by the cooperation of partners from business, research and academia.
These will work together in so-called knowledge and innovation communities.
I think that now is the time to set the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) into motion after all the preparations.
We have already taken some steps, as you know, and I have informed the committee that we have launched a procedure for the identification of the governing board.
There is a special high-calibre, independent identification committee which is now preparing criteria.
We will then try to set up a group of 18 persons to start as the governing board.
The identification committee works totally independently and autonomously.
I think this is essential for the success of the EIT and the legitimacy of the governing board.
Parliament and the Council will be kept fully informed of the selection procedure and the outcome.
The Commission will draw up an interim report after completion of the first step of the selection procedure and a final report once the procedure is finished.
Parliament and the Council will then have one month to take note of the proposed members of the EIT governing board.
Their excellence, their undisputed reputation, total independence and ability to represent their interests from the sectors they represent - universities, research and business - will, I think, be an essential ingredient for the credibility of the Institute in the short and the long term.
Allow me to underline an element of the utmost importance.
I would like to formally state that the European Commission is fully committed to respecting the principles of the autonomy and independence of the board, which are enshrined in the regulation, and it will not have any role in the EIT's strategic decision-making.
On this basis the Commission will provide administrative and financial support to the board at its request and to the extent that is necessary in the kick-off stage.
There must be some assistance at the beginning.
Such support is intended to enable the board to select the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) within the 18-month deadline and will in no way pre-empt its strategic decision-making.
It is in our common interest to see the EIT operational within the timeframe foreseen in the regulation.
I am really looking forward to the successful establishment of the EIT and once again I would like to express my deep gratitude for Parliament's commitment and contribution.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) Three years have already passed since the idea of establishing a European Institute of Innovation and Technology was first aired.
However, awareness of the fact that the key to greater competitiveness and innovation is appropriate care for the quality of human resources goes back much further.
The EIT offers a solution to this problem at European level.
The foundations are already in place.
Now is the time for speedy and effective implementation of the agreed measures.
I would like to thank the MEPs, the rapporteur and especially the members of my parliamentary group for enabling us to reach agreements and, in cooperation with the Commission and the Council, to prepare a good proposal containing most of our principal ideas.
Innovation is at the heart of the EIT.
Furthermore, our initiative has enabled the Institute to become a symbol of excellence and a recognisable mark of European quality.
One great achievement is the network structure of independent Knowledge and Innovation Communities, mentioned in the current proposal.
We have also been successful in finding a solution to the complex and complicated issue of the operational organisation of the Institute.
The current proposal offers a solution in the form of a strategic innovation programme that optimises the balance between responsibility for policy and independence of the specialists, and clearly defines the competences for long-term strategic planning.
We can do a lot with the financial resources mentioned earlier.
The starting points are good, but effective implementation depends as usual on us and our will and persistence.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to apologise at the outset that I have to leave after my speech because I have to be at a meeting with President PÃ¶ttering.
I should like to thank my colleague Mr Paasilinna most sincerely for his commitment to this matter, and also the Commissioner, who has always strongly supported this.
I actually do believe that this EIT is an important European instrument.
Mr Paasilinna has already stated this: we spend too little in Europe on research and development and we spend too little on excellence in research.
In Europe as a whole, as in most countries - at least in most of the Member States - it could, should and must be more.
The EIT is not exactly a competitive institution, but it should be driving this research, it should be creating new initiatives.
I am thinking, for example, of how important it is in the energy sector alone that we make greater efforts in research to develop new energy technologies.
Because it is so important, I would ask the Commissioner to insist that the necessary decisions are made quickly.
One decision, of course, relates to the headquarters of the administrative office.
As someone who hails from Vienna, and as an Austrian, I would naturally want the headquarters to be in Vienna.
Whatever decision is made, however, it should be made quickly so that the EIT can start work soon.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first of all my sincere congratulations to Reino Paasilinna, our rapporteur, as well as to Commissioner FigeÄŸ.
That we carried this off here in such a short time was truly a crowning achievement!
The rapporteur has been diligent and circumspect and has very much included us all.
I should also like, however, to offer very particular congratulations here to the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso.
We must indeed be very clear that this project was his own initiative in January 2005.
We have got it up and running in three years.
That is awesome.
We are fast in Europe and this, it must be said at least once at this point, is a crowning achievement by us.
It took only three years, although it was indeed a critical subject.
We have to get involved through education.
Education lies at the heart of cultural and educational sovereignty in the LÃ€nder of Germany, the country I know best and of course, the Member States are keeping a close eye on it.
We have nevertheless managed to wangle a compromise.
I refer to the finances.
We wrestled for a long time over the question of where the money should actually come from.
In addition, we managed to set the EU budget at the first attempt from beginning to end.
In the past it was just: subsidy, subsidy, subsidy.
You are familiar with the debates.
Now, though, for the first time, it is: innovation instead of subsidy!
That is awesome!
I should like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development very specifically, because they had to agree to and then make compromises here.
We have also been able to resolve disputes very quickly, such as the issues of how independent the EIT should be, how long the pilot phases should last, what the EIT's relationship should be to the Seventh Research Framework Programme, cannibalisation and even what is referred to as the 'EIT label', i.e. the issue of whether everything should be shown on this label when a project is launched under an EIT flag.
We have resolved all of this.
Now to implementation.
At present - as Commissioner Figel' has said - the Governing Board is being prepared, and the European Parliament (thank you for including us) will be considering who will be sitting on the Board, because we regard this as very, very important.
The subjects will also have to be selected, however.
Mr Swoboda has just been addressing the subject of energy.
In fact we should be focussing on Europe's overall response to climate change as well as managing the EIT and therefore, for example, the issue of energy efficiency etc. However, we must also talk about the location.
I still regard Strasbourg as a choice location.
This has never been raised so clearly before, but we do have to address it once and for all.
This building is a choice location for an EIT and for a European Research Council.
Strasbourg could become 'Scienceburg', and we should all be taking up this cause.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, it is fortunate that today we are completing the legislative work involved in setting up the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
The sitting of the Governing Board and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities will be the next step towards a common market in knowledge in the European Union.
During his recent visit to Poland, Commissioner Verheugen repeated that the inclusion of the new Member States in the structures of the common market had strengthened its potential and had been a success for all parties.
I would strongly appeal for this positive experience to serve as a pointer for us in this matter too.
Locating the Institute's Board in WrocÅaw will be a step that brings benefits in terms of cohesion in Europe.
It will make it easier to gain support from the new countries for an increase in funding for research and development in the forthcoming Union budget.
Ultimately it will release innovation potential throughout Europe.
Support for WrocÅaw's candidature is not just a matter of parochial self-centredness; it is a natural consequence of reasoning aimed at serving the interests of the whole of the European Union.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) I would like to say that since Kondratiev's long wave theory it has been known that creating innovation and implementing innovation in society is an objective process, a process with its own specific and objective patterns.
As people who are active in the political arena we can promote innovation.
I personally believe that as far as institutions go, the EIT is more important for the future of Europe than, for example, the European Commission.
I believe that there are three fundamental things that can help raise awareness in society of the importance of science and make it more popular.
Firstly, scientists should be seen as role models in society.
It is vital that scientists such as Mr HolÃœ, an outstanding Czech chemist with dozens of patents to his name, be presented as a model of values for young people rather than sportsmen or singers.
Therefore, we should strive to achieve - to use a sort of slogan - a new 'value pattern'.
Secondly, we should aim to achieve a renewed 'value leadership'.
Europe has given the world more outstanding scholars than all the other continents combined.
The value of scientific endeavour has always been fundamental for Europeans.
We should make every effort to ensure that Europe regains its leading position in this respect.
Thirdly, we also need what I would like to call a 'pioneering spirit', which would show Europe the way forward.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, World Intellectual Property Organisation figures clearly show that Europe's problem is not a lack of new ideas; what is missing is their transformation into business opportunities.
It will not be the European Institute of Innovation and Technology that will ensure success in a global economy.
Innovative competitiveness will be helped only through a greater availability of funds, including risk capital, and by a creative environment and a true academic and entrepreneurial freedom along with an appropriate reward system for outstanding scientific results.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am fundamentally against the establishment of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology.
It will not guarantee the EU a competitive advantage.
It will be only be a superfluous structure, duplicating structures that already exist for the promotion of science, development and education.
It will be yet another place that will gobble up the taxpayers' money without any value added.
Moreover, it threatens to follow the failure of the Galileo system.
The private sector, whose money the Commission and the Council are relying upon, does not see why it should finance a senseless dream of politicians and officials.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, please forgive me that I was not able to be here at the start of the debate.
The previous speaker has just been speaking about Galileo.
I had to lead the negotiations on the Galileo trialogue and was therefore late.
My thanks go first of all, of course, to our rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, who has carried out outstanding work together with his shadow rapporteur.
My thanks, however, also go to Commissioner Figel', who has been heavily involved in the consultations so that today we are now able to vote on a report that will also find broad acceptance amongst us in Parliament.
Three years ago we began our debate with the question: do we need a European Institute for Innovation and Technology?
I say very firmly: yes, we do need this Institute.
We have backlog demand in the transfer of technology.
We have excellent scientists and researchers in all 27 countries.
What we do not have, however, is the conversion of the excellent results from research into marketable products and services.
The Institute of Technology - the Institute of Innovation - should be making its contribution to this.
The Commission's proposal currently goes some way towards building a new Institute in isolation.
We in Parliament have said no, we do not want that!
We want to build a network structure that integrates businesses, universities and research institutes in Europe.
We have created this with our report.
I hope for broad agreement.
We are on the right path here.
It was also good that during our debates we did not discuss the location.
Otherwise, Mr Chatzimarkakis, we would not be ready today, nor would we be able to complete this project, and in five years' time we would probably still be debating whether we needed an Institute of Technology.
Mr President, science and technology are our real chances to get with the global competition.
For many centuries, our continent has been the centre of scientific and technological development, and European science has always been international.
There has been an intensive exchange of ideas and visits by scientists, even in the times of the Iron Curtain, and the scientific community is almost borderless these days.
Setting up the European Institute of Innovation and Technology is an important step to keep on with this ancient tradition of our continent.
I highly welcome it and, of course, I welcome the excellent report by my colleague Mr Paasilinna.
On behalf of my Government, nation and scientists, I offer Budapest as a seat for the EIT headquarters.
Our achievements in life sciences, in the combat against climate change and in environmental studies are the best arguments.
But my home city, Budapest, could provide a pleasant and exciting atmosphere as well.
Mr President, we want a Europe that is competitive, environmentally friendly and socially responsible.
However, there is tough competition in the world market, and to be able to participate in this competition we need European projects and we need to pool our resources, like the US did when it decided to put a man on the moon.
I think that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology can be our platform for a 'putting-a-man-on-the-moon' project, meaning the connection between excellent researchers and the pooling of our resources.
The areas defined so far, like climate change and telecom, are areas that have importance for Europe and for European competitiveness and how we can have this future for Europe that we so much need for the European citizens.
I think that the change where we guarantee academic training is extremely important.
Finally, I would like to support Mr Chatzimarkakis in his wish to use the premises we already have.
(PL) Mr President, in just three months' time the decision will be taken on which European city will become the headquarters of the Governing Board of the European Institute of Technology.
This decision will be both political and based on fact.
In order to try to even the odds between the old and the new Union, a conglomerate of countries that have recently joined the European Union will appear.
Based on the facts, yet not forgetting the political criterion I mentioned, I feel that the perfect, ideal centre would appear to be the Polish city of WrocÅaw, whose history has been created over the centuries, in part by the Czechs, Austrians, Jews and Germans, as well as the Poles.
The arguments in favour of WrocÅaw are: its considerable intellectual potential; the fact that it is already a strong academic centre; the large concentration of capital and major companies, including foreign companies, in the Lower Silesian region, which could become partners for the EIT; and finally the close proximity of two other EU Member States: Germany and the Czech Republic.
A number of Nobel Prize laureates in various disciplines have originated from WrocÅaw.
The city is currently engaged in very well-developed scientific cooperation with many educational institutions and scientific centres throughout Europe and beyond.
I believe that a decision to settle on WrocÅaw as the headquarters for the Governing Board of the European Institute of Technology would be optimal as regards harmonious scientific and technical development in the EU, which must do away with the divisions between the old and the new Europe.
(PL) Mr President, there are naturally certain consequences of having one's speaking time restricted to just one minute.
I must, for example, leave out the subject of funding.
The cement for the programme discussions, for which much credit is due to the rapporteur, was the idea of innovation, which is to become a reality through the knowledge communities.
My country, which is not concealing its direct interest in the idea of setting up the Institute, sees an opportunity for the communities to function through a shrewdly conceived bond with the Institute, though with no limitation on their wide-reaching independence.
Government organisations understandably place emphasis on the practical virtues of the communities, treating them as a kind of uplifting force for the triangles of knowledge: education, research and industry.
At the same time they confirm the willingness of European research centres to set up communities that begin by concentrating on three sectors: renewable energy, climate change and information technology.
It is my duty as an MEP, though I derive a certain satisfaction from performing it, to affirm that the city of WrocÅaw, well known as a centre of science in Poland, has a claim to being somewhere special in this regard.
(ES) Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on arriving at a good agreement on an issue that was not at all easy from the start.
Financing was the major outstanding issue at first reading, and we welcome the fact that a common position has been reached.
It should not be denied that the initial idea of the Institute was inspired by other models of excellence already in existence, but it should also be made clear that a great deal of effort has been made to make it viable, with the necessary adaptation to the complexity and diversity of Europe.
The result has been a new instrument with the capacity to integrate the three axes of knowledge - education, research and innovation - which should serve as a catalyst for the culture of multidisciplinary innovation that is so essential for improving competitiveness.
We are therefore convinced about establishing communities of innovation and knowledge as strategic integrated networks of universities, research centres and businesses, in which students, researchers and knowledge could circulate freely and where work could be carried out on areas of maximum scientific and strategic interest, such as renewable energy or information and communication technologies.
We hope that the EIT will, in the not too distant future, bear the fruit that we are all hoping for.
(PL) Mr President, I would like once again to express my pleasure at the importance that the Community attaches to the need for innovation in Europe.
This is of particular importance for the new Member States, for whom innovative technologies are a great opportunity to make a leap forward in civilisation and accelerate their own development.
We therefore warmly support the excellently drafted project put forward by the city of WrocÅaw, which is competing to host the offices of the Institute's Governing Board in the city.
What, besides Strasbourg, would save us having to make expensive excursions once a month?
Well, it would be WrocÅaw - WrocÅaw, which lies on the boundary between the old and the new Europe; not a capital, but a thriving city with excellent universities and almost 150 000 students.
The Polish national authorities, WrocÅaw's local authorities and the Polish academic world are fully prepared for this assignment.
Siting the headquarters of the Institute of Innovation and Technology in WrocÅaw would be a symbolic gesture and would not in any way be at odds with the criterion of excellence.
The network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities that forms part of the European Institute must also be dispersed evenly throughout the European Union.
The Institute should be an instrument that mobilises the entire territory of the Community and must lend itself to an increase in competitiveness, innovation and technological progress, as the precursor to economic development for the whole of the European Union.
It is my belief that through such initiatives as the EIT we can meet the challenges of a knowledge-based global economy in realising the ambitious aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
(FR) Mr President, we are reaching the final phase in the establishment of the EIT.
I applaud the negotiations that have taken place between the various institutions in order to reach a balanced solution to make this Institute a symbol of innovation in line with our greatest ambitions.
The stress is therefore placed on innovation, a fundamental value within Europe.
The first Knowledge and Innovation Communities will focus on key areas such as climate change and renewable energy sources, not forgetting nanotechnologies, which need proper support.
The European Union will have a definite focus on innovation.
A Europe of innovation, the innovation of Europe - the EIT is the missing link between these two concepts: a missing link that, if it is adopted in tomorrow's vote, will enable the European Union to progress.
It is by believing in roses that you make them bloom, as Anatole France reminded us.
The EIT is like a rose in the garden of Europe.
For the EIT to bloom, all the climatic conditions have to be right.
At first reading, I expressed my regret at the meagre financial resources allocated to the EIT, at the inadequacy of this support: EUR 308 million is not a sufficient response to fulfil our ambitions.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we therefore need to change the financial climate and provide the resources necessary for our very real ambitions to take shape.
(NL) I am pleased to be given this opportunity.
In fact, it is great to start with this gem, which starts small but has great power, particularly from the bottom up, if that is recognised in future as a special designation for quality.
My second point is as follows: together with Mr Paasilinna, I have been making efforts towards this bridge with industry, towards this nomenclature concerning innovation, and in this regard I am very happy with the name 'Institute of Innovation and Technology'.
It strikes me on reading the documents that we still have some difficulty with this.
Sometimes Commission documents use that name but Parliament documents do not, and so it is important that, as from now, the institute be called by its proper, correct designation.
My third and final point concerns the seat.
I should like to join with the non-native speakers, the non-French speakers, such as Mrs Ek and Mr Chatzimarkakis, who have today called for us to support Strasbourg - 'Scienceburg', as Mr Chatzimarkakis called it.
It is a city with an administrative character, and this is an administrative establishment; it is not the big institute.
That would also solve a lot of political problems.
(PL) Mr President, the idea of setting up a European Institute of Technology was greeted with considerable scepticism when it was first conceived three years ago, so we should view the current compromise text of the regulation as a major success.
The Institute may begin functioning as early as this summer following the Council's decision in June regarding its headquarters, and the proposed structure of the network of Knowledge and Innovation Communities bids fair to become an excellent stimulator of innovation throughout the EU.
As rapporteur of the Committee on Legal Affairs, providing a proper legal basis and thus enabling the Institute to be continuously funded was one of my priorities.
I am pleased that the Council has accepted these proposals.
The review of financial prospects for 2007-2013 has already enabled the Institute to receive funding of approximately EUR 309 million, and this is a good start.
I hope that the mid-term review will enable the EUR 2 billion that is still required for the project as a whole to be found.
The appearance of an elite is of particular importance for the scientific sphere in the new Member States, which possess a considerable and hitherto untapped potential.
I am therefore of the opinion that the proposal to site one of the EIT's structures in WrocÅaw - a city of more than 140 000 students - will be an excellent European investment for the future.
Finally, may I warmly congratulate and thank Mr Paasilinna for his splendid cooperation.
(PL) Mr President, my Hungarian colleague, an MEP from Budapest, has said that even during the years of the Iron Curtain there was cooperation between scientific institutions in Europe, but the truth needs to be told: the Iron Curtain also divided science into two camps in Europe - the Western camp, which developed in the free world and had financial support, and the Eastern camp.
It would be good if the European Institute of Technology, which we will establish either today or tomorrow, were not only to provide an opportunity for the European Union to take part in global innovative competition, in the global battle for knowledge, but also to serve to unite these two camps that have been divided by history.
I would join with my Polish colleagues who have recommended the city of WrocÅaw as a location either for the headquarters or for one of the Institute's departments, and I would like to see the authorities in that city be prepared to invest the money that is so essential for the success of this project.
(FR) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, and the Commissioner, and I would like to mention something that was not said during the debate, namely that without the academic world and its support, we would not be here today.
If the universities had blocked the establishment of this new Institute, which is introducing cooperation between industry, the private sector, research fields and academic institutions for the first time, this Institute would not have seen the light of day.
Given that our President launched the establishment of this Institute at rather short notice without providing a suitable budget, and the Commissioner for Science and Research did not want the Institute at all, all the credit for its establishment goes to you, Mr Figel', because, as Commissioner for Education, you have worked to pacify those circles that were worried about the awarding of degrees and diplomas and about their own competencies.
I hope that this Institute will be a great success and that you just have to find the rare bird you are looking for, since for the Governing Board you are seeking people with experience in several domains - academic and industrial - who are not actually involved in any of them, and also who are young.
I wish you a lot of luck in finding them!
(BG) Mr. Commissioner, The document that the European Parliament is going to adopt is very important indeed.
I commend you, I commend the rapporteur and all colleagues who have contributed to the submission and adoption of the existing proposals.
It is very important that a key policy is in the making.
The development of the European economy needs exactly technological innovation.
This is what makes the world develop.
It is particiularly significant that the knowledge-based societies working on the basis of the project principle will be able to take into consideration the priorities of the common European development policy, on the one hand, and the capabilities of individual Member States, on the other.
It is necessary to incorporate and develop the best achievements of individual research structures and universities to ensure the link to the priorities in the energy sector, the climate change, the new progressive materials that are indispensable to the development of the world.
This institute should turn into a genuine symbol of unity, as well as into the best mobility centre for the best research practices.
And perhaps it would be a good European policy to locate it in a new EU Member State.
(PL) Mr President, we are all agreed here today that we should do everything we can to promote an open, knowledge-based society in order to catch up with the world standard, to keep pace with the developing world economy; we should inject as much funding as we can, and as much discussion, in order to keep Europe in the running.
I would also like to make the point that the siting of the future Institute is no trivial matter.
It should be in an innovative region, a region of young and open minds, a region of great potential, a region - and this is very important - with a pioneering spirit, a region that will be suspended between Eastern and Western Europe.
All these requirements are met by the Polish city of WrocÅaw, which I would like to commend to you.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and everyone who has taken part in this inspiring debate.
(SK) The main objective of the Lisbon Strategy is to promote competitiveness within Europe and in doing so to keep up with other global economies such as the US and the new emerging Asian centres (China, India).
Part of this strategy is the establishment of the European Institute of Technology, which has gained strong support within the PPE-DE Group.
I have been following with growing interest the beginnings of this Institute, which will require significant financial support to enable it to accomplish its goals.
These goals are vital for maintaining the EU industrial, competitive and innovative base.
I therefore call for an increase in the budget which has already been approved.
I would stress that this is a project that must succeed, and in this context it is particularly important, in my view, to promote innovation, which brings with it progress and competitiveness.
In this respect, I feel that it is appropriate to include the term 'innovation' in the Institute's name, originally supposed to be the European Institute of Technology and Innovation.
This initiative needs to have an important mandate in the field of the knowledge-based economy and in promoting research and innovation within the EU.
I would like to express my admiration for the energy and determination of Commissioner FigeÄŸ in his implementation of this project.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Commissioner FigeÄŸ and the rapporteur, Mr Paasilinna, for all their work on this project.
Both positive and negative views on the EIT were heard and there will undoubtedly be more discussions before the EIT comes to life.
In this forum I would like to highlight one idea in favour of the EIT: that is that all funds allocated from the EU budget to science, development and education are funds that are well allocated, not gobbled up.
This holds true particularly if the best European brains are likely to be taking part in the EIT project.
(PL) Mr President, the creation of a coherent economic area, a single European market, was the underlying reason for the appearance of the Communities, and later the European Union.
The next stage is to give the European economy a modern and competitive dimension.
This will be possible only when we stake our money on education, research, new technologies and, in its broadest sense, innovation.
We shall not meet these challenges if industry fails to support scientific developments and new technologies, and if local authorities fail to invest in education.
Governments should become involved in education at tertiary level and in supporting basic scientific research.
The European Union, meanwhile, should concentrate on supporting and guiding innovation.
We can see that these tasks rest with both the Member States and the EU institutions.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the House for a very interesting and supportive debate. Although there was some criticism of lack of money or that we again want to establish something.
I think the most important innovation starts with openness and promotion of creativity.
The result of the consultation and legislative process is really an example of openness, contribution, commitment and even a creative innovative approach.
We have shown innovation in coming to this consensus and also in the context and content of this result.
This is the most important thing.
The mission of the EIT is, first of all, innovation.
It is one of the moments or follow-ups of the Lahti Summit of October 2006 and actually we only proposed the draft text one day before the summit.
We never supported green-field investment to establish something new; rather, we wished to come up with a new approach on how to promote, organise, motivate and mobilise resources and partners in order to make innovation in Europe more successful.
I would like to recall that the Commission never had the option to build new buildings for the EIT, but to come up with the new approach.
It took one and a half years: we started it as a part of the Lisbon Strategy in February 2005 and since then we have had many coffees and many talks that were very inspirational and very interesting - also in this building - showing that there are a lot of options or opinions on how to promote innovation.
