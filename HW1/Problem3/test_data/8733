In view of the fact that 35 programmes from 1989 are still on the Commission's books, nine years after payments were due to finish, it is imperative that suitable measures are introduced now to bring projects in on time and on budget.
Therefore, the n+2 principle should be rigorously applied across these funds, so that the European taxpayer is not left to foot the bill for projects which run on over their funding deadlines.
Similarly, Member States are not blameless in this funding fiasco.
It is amazing that reportedly over EUR 100 billion remains unspent, due in large part to lack of action by national governments.
The UK is one of the worst offenders in this respect.
I am appalled that, for example, less than 5% of available EU funding had been taken up in my own region at the beginning of the year.
These funds are not and should not be infinite.
If neither the Commission nor the Member State can get their act together, they should be returned to where they belong - the pockets of the European taxpayer.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am taking the liberty of speaking here in response to the problem of asylum seekers from the PECO countries.
I feel this problem clearly raises the question of the European Union's ability to determine the rights and statutes of European citizens or future European citizens with regard to the right of asylum, on the eve of the great challenge of the decisions on enlargement.
The addition of the protocol on the right of asylum to the Treaty of Amsterdam prohibits Member States of the European Union from considering a request for asylum submitted by a national of another Member State.
In doing so, the Treaty introduces discrimination against European citizens based on their nationality.
This runs counter to Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, which defines a refugee as 'any person who [has] a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion'.
The grounds for the incorporation of this protocol are, on the one hand, that the Member States have to respect the rule of law, democracy and human rights and possess the internal and external legal resources to put an end to violations of these legal principles, and, on the other, that nationals of the Member States already have rights in the other Member States which render useless the right of asylum, the right to free movement, free establishment, free choice of residence and other laws relating to citizenship.
What can be said, however, of the recent condemnation of various Member States by the European Court of Human Rights, or the Amnesty International reports which, every year, denounce violations of fundamental rights in most of the Member States?
Moreover, how can we know what the future holds and state with absolute certainty that the Member States or future Member States of the European Union are above any form of abuse?
The attitude to minorities is a good example of this.
Let us ensure that everyone can claim the right of asylum within the European Union.
Let us ensure that everyone can have their request for asylum considered.
Would that not be the best way of testing our democratic commitment?
Mr President, as vice-chairman of the Lithuania delegation I would like to concentrate on that country and in this connection on the Ignalina nuclear power plant.
I expressly welcome the fact that we heard officially from that country at the beginning of the week, from Prime Minister Brazauskas, that Lithuania also intends to shut down the plant's second reactor for good in 2009.
That was made possible because the European Union has entered into obligations for the period from 2004 to 2006 totalling approximately EUR 245 million. But I say, too, that we shall also have to assist this country after 2006 with the entire decommissioning of the nuclear power plant.
Of course I have my doubts as to whether the Union will have to pay all of the EUR 2.4 billion that Lithuania wants for that, spread over 20 years, because every country that operates a nuclear power plant in the normal way has to make provision for the time after it is closed.
One thing I find interesting in this connection is that with respect to Ignalina we are for the first time rightly demanding something of a candidate country that cannot be found in the acquis communautaire because - lamentably - we have as yet no Community acquis concerning the safety of nuclear power plants.
I consider that really to be a political scandal and I hope we will arrive at a common standard for that for the future.
I hear that some members of the Council, the usual suspects, are already objecting to the closure of the plant and the reasons why they must close it being so expressly included in the accession treaty for Lithuania because they are afraid that could indirectly create an acquis.
I hope that Commissioner De Palacio will be successful in pushing through her announced package of measures laying down for the first time common standards for the safety of nuclear installations under Euratom auspices.
If we want to continue with nuclear energy, that can only be the highest standard technically possible, but I really want to use this as an opportunity to say one thing: we must not be unreasonable in asking from the candidate countries what we do not ask of ourselves.
In the present case we are right to ask that, but then we within the Union must take the appropriate steps ourselves when it comes to safety standards for nuclear installations.
Mr President, I wish to express my agreement with the report drawn up by Mr Turco.
Regional development programmes are intended to promote the competitiveness of employment and the creation of conditions that will ensure sustainable development in Europe's least-favoured regions, in an enlarged Community.
In order to ensure that Community aid is effective, an assessment should not focus solely on cost-benefit analysis but should also include other quantitative and qualitative indicators.
The priority of the funds is to improve the quality of the programmes, to link these with reducing regional asymmetries within the Union and to use them to improve the quality of life of the citizens.
Programmes for the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy and for the research and information society must be incorporated into economic and cohesion policy so that the asymmetries are not increased in favour of the richer countries.
The Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds must be used to develop the trans-European networks and, in particular, the high-speed European rail network, so that this can be extended to the outermost regions of the enlarged European Union.
Mr President, allow me, in common with many others, to thank Mr BÃ¶ge for his extraordinary work on a report in which the focus lies so incredibly clearly upon enlargement and its necessary economic conditions.
As Members of the European Parliament, we have the opportunity - especially during the forthcoming Seville Summit - to put that pressure on the Council which is obviously needed in order to make it clear what the remaining enlargement negotiations are about.
Enlargement is the EU's absolutely most important priority.
It is quite unacceptable again to postpone clarifying matters and taking a stance now that enlargement is effectively around the corner.
Continued delays and conflicting signals on the part of the Council concerning the ground rules in the common agricultural market for established and new Member States in an enlarged EU are in danger of causing us not to have the privilege of welcoming ten new Member States at the beginning of next year.
It is also important in this context to bear in mind that it is not in actual fact only the EU which is to decide on this matter.
Support for an enlarged EU is also required in terms of the referendums being held in the new Member States for the purpose of ratifying the treaties.
Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern Europe is an historic task, and the biggest and most important that any of us will ever get to experience.
Anyone who tries to prevent or halt this process is assuming a very large responsibility.
I hope that this is also appreciated by the Heads of State and Government meeting in a few weeks' time at the Seville Summit.
Mr President, I would like to talk about the Sommer report and the way in which it promotes and affects the future of enlargement.
I would like to make it clear from the outset that we agree with what the Commission says in its communication with regard to the impact enlargement will have on regions directly bordering candidate countries, and we fully support Mr Sommer's report, which has the merit of accurately identifying the specific problems facing these border regions, problems which they will have to address quickly because of their proximity to countries which are still very far off achieving European economic standards.
We also fully support the amendment we have tabled, which has been adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, calling upon the Commission to undertake to provide a clearer, more exhaustive definition of a 'border region', duly allowing for both land and sea borders, which takes into account changes in the Union's political priorities as well.
Mr President, since enlargement of the European Union is an undeniable reality, we must also take the opportunity it provides to produce a balance-sheet of the Union's own policies, given that many inequalities still remain within the Union and that enlargement cannot be allowed to take place at the expense of the poorest members of the current European Union.
I feel that the proposal put forward by the Commission for the negotiations on farming is, on the whole, a reasonable one.
The most controversial issue is that of the implementation of current direct aid, created by the 1992 and 1999 reforms of the CAP to compensate for the price reductions decided on at that time.
Looking at the matter objectively, these countries are not entitled to receive this type of aid.
This aid was created with the sole aim of compensating for price reductions.
In the new Member countries, however, not only have there been no price reductions, there are even likely to be price increases.
The mistake the Commission proposal makes is to suggest that the current model of direct aid should be maintained beyond 2006.
The current system of direct aid under the CAP was justified in the medium-term to prevent falls in farmers' incomes.
This is unsustainable, however, in the long term because, since not all forms of farm production can continue to expand, it is highly discriminatory.
By 2006, therefore, we need to create a new system of aid for agriculture based on farming's multifunctional role in society.
Will this mean, however, that no aid must now be granted to the new countries of the East?
It does not.
I feel that the Commission proposal to present 25% of aid at this stage will be acceptable if this aid is paid out on an objective and horizontal basis - for example, on the basis of farms or of areas - without tying this to specific crops or forms of production.
If this is done, the proposal will already be more technically consistent and will be fairer, both in the present and in the future.
Mr President, the challenge of enlargement is an inalienable political objective, and it is unacceptable that negotiation of the agricultural chapter should put the aim or the timetable of enlargement at risk.
It is therefore absolutely essential that we should continue working to support the efforts that the candidate countries are making to restructure and modernise their agriculture, under the requirement that the candidate countries should comply with the Community acquis, but we must be quite clear that we too must comply with this Community acquis.
Direct payments form part of this Community acquis and the Commission's proposal that they be phased in, which we support, should ensure that there will soon be a single agricultural policy for the expanded European Union.
The rural development measures must ensure that there are active rural areas with diversified production in the candidate countries and especially that they guarantee employment.
Lastly, it must be remembered that enlargement cannot be associated with the reform of the agricultural policy.
Reform of the CAP goes at its own speed and according to its own timetable, and to a great extent it depends on the results of our negotiations in the World Trade Organisation and their effects on world market trends.
Mr President, I would like to speak about the Turco report.
It is a very critical report, rightly so, and what strikes me is that our criticism is still the same as it was years ago concerning the annual reports on Structural Funds.
Back in the first assessment year, the Commission noted serious delays which led to considerable underspending.
Not enough attention is given to additionality, which is a fundamental criterion, after all.
Member States should monitor European money as well as their own money, starting with my own government.
None of this has changed, and certainly not improved, since the eighties.
The amount of money that remains untouched is still enormous.
This applies to both Objectives 1, 2 and 3 and to the new initiatives.
I consider this to be a missed opportunity for the Union and the regions.
It is perplexing that no greater attempts have been made at Member State level to spend the money available.
What kind of message is this sending to the accession countries?
If our Member States cannot cope with our funds, how will the new Members be able to do so?
We can no longer wait for administration to be simplified.
This should happen now.
It is impossible for the newcomers to comply with our administrative requirements.
ISPA is a case in point.
As a result, the money of the funds will not be spent, and we will miss a major opportunity for development in eastern Europe.
The late submission of projects within the framework of ISPA, if no technical support is offered by the Commission, should not be a reason for rejection.
I should very briefly like to broach another topic.
We insist on the Commission now finally completing old projects dating back to the eighties and nineties.
It will soon no longer be possible for the services of the Commission to tie up the loose ends of these projects once ten new Member States have joined.
I call for reorganisation now.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
Mr President, the citizens of the applicant countries now have the chance to participate in the Union's most important multiannual programmes, and, in fact, many states have started participating in the Socrates, Leonardo and YOUTH programmes.
Some of them are also involved in the Culture 2000 and Media Plus programmes.
This development should be wholeheartedly encouraged.
It is leading to genuine cooperation and feelings of solidarity between the citizens of the applicant countries and those of the old Member States.
The programmes offer young people in the applicant countries the chance to boost their human capital with language skills and cultural know-how.
Relations and contact between the citizens of the old and future Member States are also necessary when providing information on membership.
Although the main responsibility for information rests with the governments of the applicant countries and the EU institutions, it would be good if civil society could be involved in letting others know about their experiences.
The discussions that preceded the referenda in Finland, Sweden and Austria are still fresh in the memories of people there.
Perhaps that would help in approaching the aims for 2004.
Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union is going to be the greatest project that Europe takes part in during the next ten years and we have to be careful, not only how we enlarge for the sake of the present Member States, but also how we deal with the countries that are coming in.
I want to deal with the agricultural side because I want to see a proper reform of the common agricultural policy before enlargement takes place.
What worries me is that we are not going to do that properly.
We are going to get to a situation where the budget of the common agricultural policy does not fit the size of the new European Union.
Then we will have to make cuts in places, which is perhaps not the right way to do it.
I know the Commission is dealing a lot with this, but we also have to look at how we get the Sapard funds into enlargement states to help them build up their infrastructure, including their education systems.
On a recent visit to Poland I found there were lots of problems with education, especially in the rural areas where very often young children were not going on to secondary school because they stayed at home to work on the farms.
We must face up to the huge number of farmers in these enlargement states and we must find some way of helping them to restructure their agriculture as and when they come into Europe.
I am also very concerned to avoid food coming into the European Union that does not meet the high standards of our production.
We have to be very clear on this.
With those reservations, much as I support enlargement, we must be careful how we do it.
Mr President, I congratulate the Council and Commission on having endured a five-hour marathon of listening to everything the European Parliament wants for the accession process.
As you have heard, we have a lot of comments and requests concerning this historic project.
I myself am a member of the Romania delegation and an acting member of the Bulgaria delegation.
So I have just one point to make: these countries are naturally very anxious that they should not be forgotten.
If the door opens for ten countries in Copenhagen at the end of this year, then in Bulgaria and Romania they will want to know where they stand.
I would like to ask what signal we will be giving these countries at the end of 2002.
Is there a timetable for the second round?
Will there also be more aids for accession so that we can improve the process of adaptation?
That need not always be money, Mrs Schreyer.
There are other forms of aid.
We must not forget these countries.
The first accession process is only the first stage.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mr Brok and the many speakers who have helped to present the report before us today on their work.
I share the position of the many Members who have called for caution and rigour as well as boldness when we bring the accession process to a close for each individual country.
The entry of the candidate countries is a decision, a political objective and a necessity for the Union's States.
The decision to allow individual countries to enter the Union is based on merit and strict compliance with the Helsinki Council and the Copenhagen criteria.
I welcome the participation of the candidate countries in the Convention's work, for it will become quite clear to them from that debate that, as well as the need for good government and combating corruption and crime, as well as economic, judicial and social reform, as well as agricultural and fund distribution policies, there is another point on which the Union is not prepared to compromise: civil rights and equal opportunities, which must be non-negotiable preconditions for EU membership.
In actual fact, the present time is a phase in the enlargement of Europe.
It is true that previous enlargement has been gradual, with Europe growing from the six original countries to the 15 it comprises today.
What frightens us is the speed with which this new phase of enlargement is taking place, particularly considering that ten countries are joining the Union which have not long been democracies.
It is for precisely this reason that we both fully support the political decision and advocate caution and the need for rigorous respect for the acquis.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to sincerely thank all the rapporteurs who have been involved so closely with the subject of eastern enlargement not only this year but over the last few years.
I think as Parliament we have set something revolutionary in motion here.
Political support and the support of the people in the enlargement process is the decisive point and that can of course only be given by democratically legitimised forces such as Members of Parliament as representatives of the people of Europe.
In that respect we are performing an important task here.
I want in particular to thank Mr BÃ¶ge, the rapporteur, also as a member of the Committee on Budgets, because I think the financing of enlargement is naturally the most serious question being put to us from all sides and one which is naturally of particular concern also to the people of the European Union - just as it is in the candidate countries.
I think the approach that Mr BÃ¶ge has found, that we in the Committee on Budgets have found, deserves to be taken seriously.
Of course whatever is available through Agenda 2000 must be included in this enlargement process, but we cannot at the same time commit ourselves for the period after that in such a manner that we no longer have any freedom to take decisions after 2007.
I think that is a very wise approach.
I am also very grateful to Mrs Sommer, because I think that in her report on the border regions she has managed to highlight the problems of the people directly affected by enlargement and who are already experiencing in their daily lives what it means to live in a region where there is a marked economic disparity and to ensure that we in Parliament send out a strong signal that appropriate support must be given, because we in Parliament can make those funds available in the budget procedure for 2002.
It was a hard struggle, but at the end of the day we succeeded.
I assume that in the 2003 procedure we shall be able to find a euro or two to make additional resources available for these areas.
Mr President, enlargement of the EU is an important step, and the right one, on the road that leads to Europe's future, but this is not a time for unmitigated jubilation.
On the contrary, the enlargement process needs to be carefully prepared and negotiated, both as a whole and even more so in all its many details, so that they too, being the proverbial lair of the devil, may be right.
It is important from that point of view that Parliament have an associated debate to thrash out enlargement as a whole - the progress of the accession negotiations, financial issues and, last but not least, Community action for the border regions.
It is this topic that numerous Austrian MEPs have, for five years and initially in the teeth of virtually universal opposition, repeatedly highlighted as an indispensable back-up measure, and they have done so for very good reasons.
Now that the date for accession is looming ever closer and more and more people are giving thought to what this event will actually amount to in detail, we can scarcely restrain ourselves from indicating our agreement.
To be sure, most are not only willing to agree with us, but they also, and above all, want a share in the financial resources and to share them with us.
As has already been said today with reference to support for border regions, the Commission was not particularly helpful at the outset.
Even now, we are not completely satisfied with the communication from the Commission.
What is being provided for should be welcomed as an initial measure, but there will be a need for further steps - for which read funds - to make a wholesale success of enlargement on our side of the border as well.
There will also be a need for a number of other back-up measures.
Above all, we need a better de minimis rule, to give additional support, in the form of European subsidies, to the efforts of our Member States and regions at restructuring using their own resources.
Only when that happens will people in the region immediately adjoining the border be able to say 'yes' to enlargement with a clear conscience.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we meet this afternoon under the banner of 'enlargement of the European Union'.
The speeches made by Members confirm my belief that we are all agreed on one thing, namely that we want enlargement of the European Union, and we are working at every level to realise this objective in a responsible manner.
The timetable is an ambitious one.
The end is in sight, although chapters on such things as agriculture and regional policy have yet to be sorted out.
Let me, in this context, refer back to yesterday, when farmers from the present Community demonstrated in front of the parliament building.
They presented the concerns that they have about their future and demonstrated about the mid-term review of Agenda 2000.
What they were concerned about was a fair chance for their businesses, and thus for their families, in the future.
What made the greatest impression on me was the solidarity our farmers showed with their counterparts from the future Member States, despite the adverse situation they themselves have been put in by falling prices for milk and cereals.
This was for me an appeal for everything possible to be done for the people in the present EU and in the candidate countries not to be left alone with their concerns and needs.
So we too have to talk about their problems.
Let us take Sapard as our first practical example.
The flow of funds here is quite inadequate.
They should be kept for agriculture and rural areas.
Secondly, the funds that continue to be needed for the development of rural areas must be provided by all the structural policy measures and not just from the common agricultural policy.
Thirdly, full harmonisation is absolutely necessary in the internal market.
I will stop there and thank you for listening, as there are a few people who have been waiting a very long time already.
Mr President, in my speech I shall focus on the practical implementation of regional and structural policy, which is a key element in successful enlargement as well as preparations for it.
The Commission and the applicant countries must prepare for enlargement in a way that avoids needless delays in the start-up of programmes and so that the money set aside for these preparations can be used effectively.
The Structural Funds must also be used in a way that is as uncomplicated and efficient as possible.
There is much room for improvement here, which is evident, for example, from Mr Turco's report.
Aid must be allocated and staggered so that the funds get to the local players as directly as possible and primarily to the poorest regions of all.
Structural work must adopt the principle of phasing in increased batches of aid.
It is reasonable to use the Cohesion Fund in the early stages, but in the future the programme-based financing share must be increased.
Skills, know-how, new technology and good levels of networking between SMEs and regional players are essential in implementing effective regional policy and promoting the positive impact of enlargement.
The particular challenge is not so much the adoption of Community legal provisions but their implementation and monitoring.
Mr President, you can imagine that after five hours of debate I have no desire to add anything new, because I think everything has already been heard.
Besides, I am not going to tire this House, because it would be the seats that get tired, anyway, since there is practically nobody left except the long-suffering European Commission, which, of course, has been sitting here, like the Presidency, for these five hours without a break.
I should just like to say that we have taken very good note, because naturally that is part of the exercise: the Presidency has taken good note of everything the honourable Members have said; I cannot say I agree with everyone, but I have gathered some very important points.

Secondly, I must tell you that enlargement has been a priority for our Presidency, and it will continue to be one for the Seville European Council, and we therefore hope we can draw some conclusions to further this process.
Of the road map we had to follow, all that is left for us is to conclude a consensus, that we hope we can reach, in order to achieve a common position on agricultural matters.
If, for any reason that I can understand, this consensus that we are going to fight for in the Council cannot be reached, I imagine that the countries that do not subscribe to the common position will answer politically to this Chamber and to European public opinion.
This is because I think the subject of direct payments, as can be deduced from the Commission proposal, forms part of the acquis and is not for discussion, and therefore it is not good for accession to be conditional upon a hypothetical or future reform of the common agricultural policy.
This is a subject that I do not want to prejudge; there is always room for hope and for seeking a formula that pleases everyone, and that is precisely the Presidency's objective: that everybody should be able to find their own position and solve their own political problems.
I am convinced we shall succeed.
Thank you, President-in-Office of the Council.
I am sure that a great many of the Members have listened to your speech from their office.
Mr President, I will be even more brief.
I just want to thank the House for what I feel has been an extraordinarily constructive and helpful debate, which the Commission also sees as an encouragement to pursue its present course, in which certainty of Parliament's support is a great help to us.
This debate has thrown up a large number of questions, but we would need another hour if I were to try and answer them now.
So, with your permission, Mr President, I would ask you to let me answer in writing the questions raised in this debate.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to start by associating myself with the thanks expressed by Commissioner GÃŒnter Verheugen, who spoke before me.
I too would like to thank you for the broad support with which the Commission's proposals have met in this debate.
I just want to address one or two points, and do so briefly.
The first concerns the Sapard programme, which was referred to by a very large number of speakers in the debate. I would, firstly, like to point out that seven programmes are currently up and running; the great question is, of course, in which candidate country.
I am able, though, to give you the good news that another country is to be added this month, namely Poland, which is to be given more funds than the other seven countries participating to date.
You can take that as an indication that it is a bit too simple to concentrate only on percentages and amounts.
This way of looking at things must, I believe, take account of the differences between the candidates, and also, of course, of the need to establish a system that will subsequently meet, for example, with the approval of this House's Committee on Budgetary Control.
It is the case that the introduction of this system has been very demanding in terms of effort, and that it has also resulted in delays, but it is not true that these setbacks and delays can be laid only at the Commission's door.
I would like to give you something of a warning against resuming the debate on an INRA programme or whatever the thing is called, by which I mean a warning that we would only be delaying matters still further if we were now to start a debate about amending the financial legislation or even the Financial Perspective, or if we were to invent new bureaucratic structures that first needed to be developed.
I do, though, understand that the concerns of civil society are having a greater influence on the administration.
We will have to do some thinking about that.
My last point is that a very large number of you have mentioned the agricultural reforms.
Let me make it quite clear that I am committed to them, and have always affirmed that we need them, and that agricultural reforms are a process with which we have to press on.
I only hope, when we in the Commission decide on our proposals for the mid-term review on 10 July, that they will meet with just as much approval in this House, especially from all those who have, today, called for further reforms.
I would, though, like to reiterate that conflating the enlargement process in any way with further agricultural reforms or even making the one dependent on the other will not just create difficulties for enlargement, but will delay both it and further reforms.
We are therefore firmly convinced that the two must be kept separate and progress made on both of them without delay.
Mr President, various comments have been made on the Structural Funds.
Having taken part in the debate with, so to speak, the aid of Mr Barnier's ears, I would like briefly to respond to what has been said about the Structural Funds.
The outflow of resources is unsatisfactory at the moment, but it is not quite true to say that major delays are occurring; it is simply that the Member States are, as it were, delaying implementation until the last moment at which the legislature has allowed them to put the programmes into operation.
Parliament played its part in enacting the regulations in question.
As regards the debate on the financial framework for enlargement, let me, as Budget Commissioner, reiterate that, in producing its proposals, the Commission has had to be guided by the principle that a proper balance has to be struck between the interests of the present Member States and those of the new ones.
It is my opinion that we have succeeded in achieving this balance.
When the proposals were put forward, the new Member States initially complained that they were not receiving equal treatment.
Although we provided for direct support to be phased in, the Commission proposal envisages that, as early as 2006, the financial obligations in respect of the new Member States should, in per capita terms by reference to the population, be equal to those in the present Member States, so that there is equal treatment already.
Does the Commission proposal put the present Member States under excessive financial strain?
Let me observe that we have kept strictly to the limits of Agenda 2000, and that we in the Commission have, in addition, proposed that the new Member States should make contributions to the EU Budget from the very outset, something that the Council has accepted.
That means that the net cost to the present Member States is even less than the amount stipulated in Agenda 2000 as the maximum burden resulting from enlargement.
I think it is important not to lose sight of that.
Let me emphasise one more thing. The reports we are considering, and our debate today, sometimes give the impression that the costs of enlargement will be borne only by the present net contributors.
That is false.
All the present Member States will be paying the same amount in relative terms towards enlargement, leaving out the special arrangement for Great Britain.
The same effort, though, is called for as an expression of solidarity.
As Member States differ in size and gross domestic product, that of course means in absolute terms that 80% of the enlargement costs will in fact be borne by the five largest Member States: Germany, Great Britain, Italy, France and Spain.
But this is a joint effort for the sake of solidarity, and the financial aspect is of course of great importance in public debate, and also in debates in Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
However, it must not be forgotten that this debate is not about whether or not to build a new stretch of motorway, but about the unification of Europe.
It is about the stabilisation in Europe of peace, democracy and the rule of law.
One cannot put a price on values such as these.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
I would also like to thank all the speakers.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Mr President, distinguished Members, it is indeed an honour to address the European Parliament.
Your forum is home to an historic experiment that attests that even after the most terrible of conflicts people of different nations of unique cultures can together create a future peace.
I need not tell you that your work has lessons for the world.
Jean Monnet said it very simply 50 years ago.
Your Majesty, it is always a wonderful privilege, in a Parliamentary context, to be addressed by a leader who has conviction, reason and vision.
You have all of these qualities.
You have touched our emotional intelligence as well as our rationality.
In doing that you have touched so much.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

(The formal sitting was closed at 12.28 p.m.)
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now examining a Commission proposal for a Council decision on the indirect tax in force in the Canary Islands.
The purpose of introducing a tax known as 'the AIEM tax on the import and delivery of goods in the Canary Islands' is to allow Spain to apply lower rates of tax to certain products manufactured in this outermost region.
It must be stated, of course, that the purpose of the Community authorisation is not to create the AIEM, because the Spanish authorities are free to do this, as long as Community directives on VAT and on special consumer taxes do not apply in the Canaries.
The Council decision is, consequently, necessary, but to validate tax exemptions and their extension to Canarian regional products, an aspect that is not properly clarified in the Commission proposal.
The aim of most of the amendments that I tabled, and which were approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, was to ensure that this clarification was made.
The central tenet of the Commission proposal is, therefore, the establishment of tax exemptions under Articles 23, 25 and 90 of the Treaty, on the grounds that discrimination is practised in favour of certain industrial goods manufactured in the Canaries over imported industrial goods, since the former can be taxed at rates 5, 15 or 25 percentage points lower, depending on the type of product concerned.
Article 299(2) of the Treaty provides the justification and the legal base for these tax exemptions.
This article acknowledges the unique situation of what are known as 'outermost' regions and the corresponding need for the European Union to take special steps to help those regions.
The proposal now under consideration deserves my total support.
It seeks to enable regions such as the Canaries, which suffer serious competitive disadvantages in the industrial sector as a consequence of their remoteness, better to integrate and exploit the highly competitive dynamic of the single European market, of Economic and Monetary Union and of globalisation itself.
This type of specific measure is crucial to ensuring the survival and modernisation of industrial activity in the Canaries, which now produces little more than 5% of regional GDP, when historically it has always generated very high levels.
The integration of the Canaries, however, into the customs territory of the European Union in 1991, and the gradual dismantling, by 1999, of the tax then in force, which was also intended to protect regional production, have accentuated the fragility and the vulnerability of the Canaries' industrial sector to external competition.
As the situation in the tobacco industry shows quite clearly, the decline has been steady.
Between 1985 and 2000, the tobacco industry shed more than 3 300 jobs, or around 67% of its workforce.
It is, therefore, imperative that we ask ourselves the following question: should the full integration of the Canaries mean that their industries are all but wiped out?
Should the Canaries depend almost exclusively on tourism-related activities for job and wealth creation?
Is this not too heavy a price for the Canaries to pay for their full integration into the European Union?
The Commission proposal that we are now looking at is, therefore, a legitimate and appropriate instrument for guaranteeing a minimum degree of economic diversification in a region with the specific characteristics of the Canaries.
This proposal is also justified, however, in light of other considerations, not least the competitive inequality suffered by industrial firms in the outermost regions.
It is well known that remoteness imposes additional costs on industrial activity in these regions and that, in the specific case of the Canaries, these costs are estimated to stand at around 8 percentage points for large undertakings, 9% for the SMEs, and even reaching 29% for tobacco production.
This situation forces us to draw a conclusion of paramount importance, which is the following: instead of being harmful to free competition, the tax measures proposed by the Commission are designed to level out conditions for competition. This is the only way we will be able to guarantee genuine equality of opportunity for Canarian industrial operators or, rather, for some of them, provided that the tax measures proposed are not universal and systematic.
I therefore believe that we are discussing the appropriate instrument with which to respond to the specific needs of the Canaries as an outermost region and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism expressed the same view when it approved my report by overwhelming majority.
If the European Parliament is to be consistent with its previous positions demonstrating clear solidarity and support for the outermost regions, it must deliver a favourable opinion on the Commission proposal we are now discussing.
Mr President, as the rapporteur has already said what this is about, I do not need to enlarge on that, but I have to make it unmistakably clear that giving local products 15% or 25% advantage is excessive.
We do not agree with the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and, in the opinion I drafted, we proposed that these tax differentials be scaled down from 25% to 15% and 15% to 10% respectively.
I regret the fact that the lead Committee on Regional Policy has not followed us in this.
As regards the products listed in the various categories, various inconsistencies are apparent, which have been pointed out in the many comments I have had from Spanish producers and also from Members of this House, and I would like to point them out to Mr Bolkestein, who is, after all, such a great defender of the principle that there should be no market distortions in the common market.
This is what I have to say to you.
Category B includes rum, which, as we all know, is made from sugar cane.
There are no sugar cane plantations in the Canary Islands, and the product, already distilled, is imported from abroad.
The two dominant local manufacturers control 73% of the market and add aromatic substances and colourings to what they import from South Africa, selling the concoction as 'rum from the Canary Islands'.
So one cannot speak in terms of rum production in the Canary Islands supposedly maintaining jobs; there may well be a hundred jobs, but two families with an oligopoly of the Canary Islands market reap an immense profit from them.
That is something of which you should take account.
I also have to point out that there are a few other inconsistencies, for example, the levying of the new tax on gin, vodka and liqueurs, but not on whisky or other spirits.
Make of that what you will.
I suggest to you, Mr Bolkestein, that you take a good look at what you or your department have wrought there, and then you will see why we feel like giving you a clip round the ear when you keep coming back to us and telling us about inconsistencies!
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I naturally want to thank Mr Marques and congratulate him on his report and also on the way he has presented it.
Perhaps I should begin by reassuring Mrs Lulling - reassuring her and clarifying things a little for her, because last week I was in Luxembourg, Mrs Lulling's own country, right in the middle of the European Union. In fact, the problem they have in Luxembourg today, as I could see last week, is that the country has too much economic activity, which is attracting hundreds of thousands of workers to work there.
The situation in the outermost regions of the Community is completely different.
We are, one might say, the other side of the coin to Luxembourg.
Any economic activity we perform has to overcome the enormous obstacle of distance.
At the moment, therefore, it is quite impossible for any industrial company to set itself up in the Canary Islands to compete within the Community.
We had developed a small industrial sector on the basis of some rules which are certainly quite ancient, going back to the time when the Canary Islands were brought under the Crown of Castile, before Spain existed.
There is a fifteenth-century Royal Charter by the Catholic Monarchs exempting traders in the Canary Islands from paying a number of taxes, and this has continued over the centuries. The Spanish constitution recognises it.
When Spain joined the European Community, the Spanish Government took care to include some special provisions in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community to guarantee this special regime, and there is a protocol on this, which was amended by a Council decision in 1991 to adapt it to the internal market.
I would say that the special regime for the Canary Islands compared with the rest of the Community territory is less special now than at any time in the whole history of our country and the European Community.
What we have done is to replace old forms of taxation, which were much more restrictive, like the APIM (Tax on Production and Imports) or the special tariff, with some new forms of taxation which conflict much less with the operation of the internal market.
In other words, what the Commission is proposing and I hope the Council will approve is to try to reduce the impact on trade. In this way, the measures we are adopting now are measures that will facilitate trade within the European Union.
Mrs Lulling may be right in some respect; I do not deny it. That is, I would say we have now had a first go, a first attempt at outlining what this neutral tax system will be, allowing trade to function but with a slight preference so as to be able to maintain traditional activities.
If Mrs Lulling looks, for instance, at the amendments approved by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism - Amendment No 10 to Article 2 and Amendment No 11 to Article 3 - she will see that there are some adaptation mechanisms, so that the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, can review the conditions and adjust the rates and other situations.
Besides, I am aware that the same concerns voiced by Mrs Lulling have also been voiced specifically at a local level by economic and political actors.
This means that, once the Council approves the system, we shall have the opportunity to go on reviewing and adapting it in order to achieve the objective of the functioning of the internal market.
It is not a matter of putting up insurmountable barriers but of letting some small, traditional activities continue, and that explains why there is, if you like, a certain discrimination.
That is, products are included according to whether there are economic activities that have to be kept going.
It is not a question of developing new economic activities but in practice of keeping existing ones going.
Of course, I agree with Mrs Lulling that there may be differences, but we shall have to look at these differences a little later.
At the moment, I believe the objective for the Spanish Government in making the proposals and for the Commission is to liberalise the internal market and to facilitate the integration of this region - so distant and facing so many difficulties - into the rest of the internal market.
It must also be remembered that there is not even such a thing as a Canary Islands market, because there are seven islands and each island has a market, with its own obstacles. In other words, it may be much easier to export from Luxembourg to Gran Canaria than from Tenerife to Gran Canaria, unless these small differences are established.
I hope that tomorrow this House will approve the proposal as formulated by the Committee on Regional Policy, and the Socialist Group is, of course, against the amendments tabled by Mr Helmer, which attempt to demolish or weaken a system which I believe has now been precisely calculated to prevent these businesses or occupations from disappearing.
I am grateful to the Commission and its staff for their efforts and, of course, I am grateful to Mr Marques for the work he has done in presenting this report to us.
Mr President, the Committee on Fisheries has voted in favour of the Commission proposal that we are now discussing, as we have done for previous resolutions adopted by this House.
With regard to fisheries, the proposal affects fresh and chilled fish belonging to certain species such as sea bream, hake and sea bass, as well as smoked fish and salmon.
The exemptions authorised - as those who have spoken before me have pointed out - must form part of a strategy for the economic and social development of the Canary Islands and thus contribute to the promotion and diversification of local activities.
These tax measures are exceptional, specific and designed to compensate for the disadvantages suffered by the islands as an outermost region and are therefore fully covered by Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
This is a legal basis which is aimed at allowing the local economic activities of the outermost regions to compete, despite the considerable disadvantages of their insularity and isolation and the small size of their local market.
It is a legal framework that is not limited to this type of tax measures.
In the area of fisheries, now that the common fisheries policy is to be reformed, for instance, the specific conditions deriving from their nature as outermost regions must be taken into consideration in the framework of Article 299(2), as indicated by the proposal which the committee itself has already adopted.
Mr President, I must first of all offer my congratulations and thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Marques.
I congratulate him because he has produced an excellent report responding to a demand from the Canary Islands - one of the outermost regions of the Union that has some specific tax features, supported on a sound legal basis (Article 299(2) of the Treaty). I thank him because, through his excellent work and his flexibility, he has managed to gather a solid parliamentary majority around him which makes it seem likely that the report will be approved within the next few hours, which will put an end to a long parliamentary journey that began almost two years ago.
The economic and fiscal regime of the islands is the backbone of the statute of autonomy and self-government of the Canary Islands, the current version of which derives from the Treaty on European Union and Spain's Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, although over the centuries - ever since we were brought under the Crown of Castile, even before Castile was Spain - it has often been modified to suit the circumstances of the moment.
The question is therefore about certain historical rights, which are no lower in status than the fiscal peculiarities of Luxembourg or some of the British Isles, to mention only the case of countries where these measures have come up against some stiff opposition, paradoxical though it may seem.
Those Members who have tried - and are still trying - to change the rapporteur's text with their amendments are upholding legitimate interests - there is no doubt of that - but interests linked especially to the tobacco, alcoholic beverage and spirits lobbies, which do not now coincide with the interests of the Canary Islanders, the vast majority of whom have, through their legitimate representatives, declared their position along the lines of the Marques report.
Just as the Spanish Government has done, by virtue of its Constitution, just as the European Commission is doing - it has seen that this project is valid and does not run counter to Community law - and as is reflected by the broad agreement within the Council, which may well approve it in a few days' time, once Parliament has pronounced on it.
The Canary Islands will thus have a good economic policy instrument, which will allow them to diversify their resources and enhance their economic and social development, stop the decline of their already weak industrial sector and, if possible, stimulate its growth, especially in the food processing sector.
If this happens, it will help retain jobs and create new ones in a region of high unemployment, while offering alternatives to the islands' risky dependence on the tourist industry.
The Canary Islands cannot continue to grow just on the basis of receiving a few hundred thousand more tourists every year.
This year we will have had twelve million visitors; this brings benefits, of course, but it also has sometimes devastating effects on our sustainable development: on some islands the annual number of tourists far outweighs the total number of permanent residents, generating a number of problems.
These will only increase in future if we do not step in to correct this trend, which is what this regulation aims to do.
For all these reasons and others mentioned by the rapporteur and some of the speakers, this report must be approved and, as a member of the European People's Party, that is what I hope will happen.
Mr President, I too wish to congratulate Mr Marques on the excellent work he has carried out here, not least with regard to the clear distinction he has made between the existence of the Canary Islands' having their own tax arrangements as a right and the possibility of discrimination in favour of certain local products to boost their economic development.
I also wish to welcome our fellow Members from the Canaries who are present and say that, speaking on behalf of the Azores, we stand shoulder to shoulder with you and that we fully support your objectives of achieving the most balanced possible form of development for the Canaries.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing we must understand: what we have here are not proposals for tax exemptions for some rich countries at the centre of Europe, such as Luxembourg, for example, which would seriously undermine the balance of the internal market, which would create economic imbalances, and even a concentration of economic activity that in fact benefits no one.
What we have here are one-off measures intended to support industries and small-scale activities which would otherwise not survive.
We cannot compare the survival of small rum producers in the Canaries with the situation of sugar in the European Union, which is a cartel providing massive profits for a industry that is highly protected and which the Commission is not able - or willing - to end.
In fact, it is doing the opposite.
We saw proof of this here only yesterday.
I therefore call on all my fellow Members resolutely to support the proposal submitted by SÃ©rgio Marques.
Mr President, the AIEM is a tax that is being talked about a lot this year, both in the Canary Islands and in this House, to the extent that this is the second time we have debated and voted on it.
Furthermore, it replaces another no less categorical tax, the APIM. As an outermost region of the European Union, the Canary Islands have seen a review of their model of integration into our European Community, which led to the APIM falling apart when certain basic products or goods were imported, resulting in job losses in the Canary Islands' industrial sector and a fall in the export of local products.
The European Commission, in collaboration with the competent authorities, has therefore put forward a proposal for a decision on special fiscal measures designed to correct the costs of being an outermost region.
However, the most important fact from a political viewpoint is, I believe, that the Commission has, to this end, taken Article 299(2) of the Treaty as the legal basis for implementing a temporary and proportional derogation from Articles 23, 25 and 90 when applying the Community provisions that allow the Spanish authorities to discriminate in fiscal terms regarding certain Canary Island products.
Hence our congratulations to the Commission, the rapporteur, Mr Marques, and also Mr Casaca for his support.
We hope the Council - and Parliament - will be receptive towards this proposal, because amongst other things this tax is recognition of the Canary Islands' fiscal regime, and it is also coherent with the economic diversification strategy drawn up by the European Union for the outermost regions and prevents job losses.
Mr President, firstly I should like to say that this proposal was introduced earlier this year by the Commission under the procedure without debate.
Had it not been for the initiative of one of my colleagues, Mr Helmer, in overturning that procedure, this House would not have had the opportunity to discuss it.
Let me make it very clear to the House at the outset that, recognising their ultra-peripheral status, I have no problem with special treatment for the Canary Islands, - my goodness, I would quite like it for my own region, but that is not very likely.
This was accepted at the time of Spain's accession to the European Union and special tax arrangements were put in place to assist local industries.
But those derogations from the rules of the single market were intended to be temporary and to be phased out.
Far from phasing out these measures, the Commission's proposal effectively doubles the level of protection for a wide range of goods, impacting especially heavily on spirits and tobacco.
The large tourist industry of the Canary Islands is an important outlet for these products.
The proposed measures will impact negatively on liquor and cigarette manufacturers in many Member States.
By raising consumer prices in the Canaries they may even damage the island's tourist trade.
In particular they will damage Gallaghers in my own constituency and Imperial Tobacco in Nottingham, to name but two.
Bizarrely, as I understand it, the proposals will protect an American cigarette manufacturer in the Canaries.
The rapporteur says that jobs have been lost in cigarette factories in the Canaries, but they have also been lost in cigarette factories across the European Union.
With changes in consumption and improvements in productivity, we all have industries in our own regions that suffer from overseas competition, but in the single market we do not raise protectionist taxes.
The original intention was to phase out these measures.
The Commission's proposal is to double them.
I put it to the House that a reasonable compromise is to leave the levels as they were in 2001, and I call on colleagues to support the amendments to this effect and reject the Commission's proposed increases.
Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor on this important matter.
I shall begin by saying that this Commission proposal represents the implementation, in the tax field, of Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
That article recognises the specific nature of the outermost regions, which include the Canary Islands, and it provides for specific measures to be adopted, particularly in taxation, to take into account the special characteristics and constraints of those regions.
On the basis of a memorandum and notifications from Spain, the Commission proposed a Community framework for a tax known as "Arbitrio sobre las Importaciones y Entregas de MercancÃ­as en las islas Canarias", or the AIEM tax, which would apply to the Canary Islands from 1 January 2002.
As has been remarked by many Members of this Parliament, a number of handicaps affecting local manufacturing firms were identified, and this justifies the introduction of a specific measure to encourage industrial production and increase its share in the Canary Islands' gross domestic product through exemption or rates reductions granted to local products.
For that reason a Community framework has been proposed which selectively authorises maximum tax rates of 5% and 15% for various sensitive products to which Spain may apply exemptions in the light of the need to promote local production activities.
The rates applicable to tobacco products is fixed at 25% because local production of tobacco products has significantly diminished in the Canary Islands in recent years.
Mr Nicholson referred to the exemption, or, rather, the maximum rate applicable to tobacco products; it was 15% in the past; 25% is now proposed.
Local production is still being lost, so there does not appear to be a link between the lower tariff that has been applied in the past and the level of local production.
The rates and exemptions contained in the Community framework must be seen as options subject to ceilings which the national and regional authorities may use in combination with the support needed for local production.
This decision is to be applied for a period of ten years.
It will nevertheless be necessary to evaluate the proposed system after five years.
An evaluation is therefore to be made of the arrangements and, if necessary, the decision can be adapted on the basis of this evaluation.
The Commission is very pleased that this proposal has been welcomed by the European Parliament.
I would in particular like to welcome the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mr Marques, as well as the opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Fisheries.
Examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council, and the Commission very much wants to address this issue in a timely manner.
The most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament, but to endeavour to take them on board as far as possible with a view to adoption of the proposal by the Council.
This applies to Amendment No 1, which proposes to introduce a reference to the Commission report of March 2000 on the measures to implement Article 299(2) of the Treaty.
This also applies to Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9, which propose basing the European framework of this AIEM tax on the limitation of maximum exemptions instead of the tax itself, Amendment No 8, proposing introduction of a recital to justify the date of application of the proposals, and Amendments Nos 10, 12, 13 and 14, which are purely formal.
On the other hand, the Commission does not agree with Amendments 7 and 11, which allow the extension of the list of products concerned by the fiscal exemptions under a comitology procedure.
Since those exemptions constitute fiscal discrimination, the content of such provisions must be decided by the Council itself.
Amendments Nos 15, 16, 17 and 18, which were introduced at a late stage, propose rates of 5% and 10% for products and 15% for tobacco and are not acceptable to the Commission.
The 5%, 15% and 25% rates proposed by the Commission correspond globally to the rates allowed under the previous regime, the purpose being to focus on the products for which the measures are most needed.
I would now like to reply to some of the comments made this evening.
First of all, I agree with Mr Medina Ortega, who said that the AIEM equals the APIM plus the special tariff.
These two latter taxes were amalgamated in the 1991 regulation, so once again I agree with the analysis, which was shared by Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a.
Both Members of Parliament have the Commission on their side as regards that analysis.
Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n then said that maintaining local industry maintains local employment and activities other than tourism.
Of course, he is right and the Commission would like to express its agreement with that statement.
I have already replied to Mr Nicholson on tobacco products, stating that local production is decreasing in spite of the fiscal advantages.
That apparently ensued from Amendments Nos 16 to 19 put forward by Mr Helmer.
The reduction of the exemptions is not acceptable to the Commission since it would defeat the whole purpose of the exercise.
Lastly, I was struck by the vivacious nature of the comments, questions and remarks by Mrs Lulling.
I can assure her in the case of rum that there is indeed traditional local production.
I can testify to that myself, having been at various times to the Canary Islands.
I have even seen the plants.
If Mrs Lulling does not believe me, I suggest that the two of us visit the Canary Islands and look at the plants and on our trip we can also discuss the possibility of excise taxes on wine.
I have to reject the last proposal of the Commissioner on moral grounds.
Mr President, since I have been personally implicated by certain speakers, I must ask to take the floor for personal reasons.
First of all, I have been attacked as a Luxemburgish MEP.
Mr Medina Ortega complained that we have too many economic activities...
(The President cut the speaker off)
No, no, Mrs Lulling.
Excuse me, but that is not permitted.
You may speak on a point of order, but that is what you already have done.
No, pour un fait personnel - on a personal matter.
I do not know what that is in German, but you, as Vice-President, should.
A personal attack has been made on me.
Mr President, I have been in Parliaments for thirty-seven years, so I know what a personal attack is, and that one is permitted to respond to it.
I ask you to let me have the floor, so that I may answer this personal attack.
If you had listened to me, this matter would have been sorted out long ago!
Just to clarify matters, Mrs Lulling, I will read out to you Rule 122 on personal statements: 'A Member who wishes to make a personal statement shall be heard at the end of the discussion of the item of the agenda being dealt with or when the Minutes of the sitting to which the request for leave to speak refers are considered for approval.
The Member concerned may not speak on substantive matters' - which you did - 'but shall confine his observations to rebutting any remarks that have been made about his person' - not about mine - 'or opinions that have been attributed to him, or to correcting observations that he himself has made.'
I say this only for the sake of good order.
I allowed you to speak, but you were not actually entitled to your contribution.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by giving the apologies of our rapporteur, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, who has, at short notice, an important appointment in his home region and has therefore had to leave Strasbourg for a few hours.
He has asked me to present the report on his behalf and on behalf of the committee.
The Fiscalis programme has demonstrated its effectiveness as an instrument for the promotion of mutual understanding between the European Union's tax officials and it is therefore the committee's view, and that expressed in the Commission proposal, that it should be continued.
We have, however, tabled seven supplementary amendments.
The committee gives its unreserved support to the Commission's proposal that the programme be proceeded with for a further five years.
We consider this a matter of urgency in view of the difficulties confronting the European Union in its attempts at preventing tax discrimination and tax fraud in the internal market, as mutual understanding and greater cooperation between the various tax authorities is of vital importance not least because of the difference in competences between internal market legislation and tax law.
What are this programme's objectives?
Firstly, the efficient operation of the internal market, which is substantially impaired by tax evasion, which damages legitimate business, has a detrimental effect on employment and undermines trust in the Community's tax systems.
That requires effective monitoring and measures to combat fraud.
We need a network of tax administrations working together as if there were only one European tax administration, and this programme also contributes towards achieving the Lisbon objectives.
We also welcome the innovations in comparison with the old programme, which was a successful one, in the shape of the Commission proposals, chiefly for the increase in operational expenditure from EUR 40 million to EUR 56 million.
Secondly, the programme's scope, which formerly covered the treatment of indirect taxes, has been extended to officials dealing with direct taxation.
We also welcome its clearer alignment and extension through the programme's objectives being directly linked with those of other Community policies in the field of taxation.
Let me also say that we think it right for the programme to be open to candidate countries, as that already facilitates participation in seminars and exchanges and as administrative cooperation is very much of the essence in preparing the accession process and to make adjustments to regulations as and when necessary.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' amendments relate mainly to the following areas. Firstly, we hold fast to the view that finance after 2006 will have to be agreed to by the Budgetary authority; secondly, that the EU is in urgent need of a VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, and that the direct taxation field needs increased awareness of Community policy in this area as well as of other Community policies and general principles of Community law affecting the taxation of individuals and of enterprises.
You will find, in addition to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' seven amendments, an amendment by the Liberals and another by the Greens accompanying the reports from the Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and serving as bases for discussion.
What is crucial is that we include the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' amendments in the Commission's programme, for that is the way we have taken, and it is the right one.
Mrs Lulling, I would seriously ask you to carry on your private conversations at a lower volume or outside the Chamber, as you really are disturbing the debate.
When you speak, you do not need a microphone!
Mr President, I am speaking not on behalf of my group or my committee, but on behalf of the British Conservative delegation in the European Democrat pillar within the PPE-DE Group.
We do not support the extension of the FISCALIS programme to cover direct taxes, in particular income tax and capital tax.
These are areas which should remain a matter for the exclusive competence of Member States.
The right to tax citizens is one of the hallmarks of a government.
Increasing EU involvement in taxation could spell the death of the nation state.
I know the response will be that this is just a technical scheme to exchange information and run seminars for tax officials, but I say it is one more step that takes the European Commission and the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States.
As Commissioner Prodi himself recently stated, very high political ambitions have often been achieved in the EU as a series of small, almost technical, steps.
I suggest that this is happening with tax, in the numerous different tax initiatives and ways in which the European Commission and the European Union are seeking to enlarge their competence over areas of tax.
I reject the technical steps that take the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States, just as I reject the ultimate objective of allowing the European Union to levy taxes on individuals in the European Union.
Democratic national governments should levy taxes. Undemocratic supranational organisations should not.
Mr President, as Mr Karas said in the first speech, the Fiscalis programme currently in operation has had real benefits.
It has allowed knowledge to be disseminated and it has added to the experience of those who participated in the programme.
It has definitely helped the fight against fraud and in doing so has improved the workings of the internal market.
It has allowed officials to adopt new administrative practices and cooperate more with each other.
All of these things have been very beneficial since 1998.
It has also improved mutual understanding of Community tax law on indirect taxes such as VAT and excise taxes.
There have been exchanges of officials from the EU Member States, seminars on indirect tax issues of common interest, multilateral control of excise duties, development of common professional training across the European Union, including improving audit skills for the officials concerned, and, significantly, development of language training.
There has also been funding for the maintenance and development of communication and information systems and schemes.
Overall, we are enthusiastic about the Fiscalis programme and believe that it has been very successful and that it should be continued, but only in its present form.
It should also be extended, but only in its present form, to the candidate countries, which could benefit very much from this programme for the objectives and the kind of things that the Fiscalis programme has been carrying out.
They could certainly benefit from implementing the necessary legislative, organisational, administrative and technical measures in the programme as it exists at the moment.
I have stressed the notion of the programme as it exists at the moment because I agree with Mrs Villiers that the Fiscalis programme should not be extended to direct taxation.
Unlike value added tax, there is little by way of a shared body of knowledge of direct taxation across the EU Member States and different Member States impose indirect taxation in very different ways.
The fact needs to be borne in mind that the Fiscalis programme as it stands has not really been properly evaluated yet and it would not, therefore, be a good idea to carry it forward on this basis.
The programme as it stands at the moment has been a success.
It should be continued in its present form and we should not extend it beyond its current boundaries.
Mr President, Commissioner, few issues contain so much political dynamite and evoke so many feelings as tax issues.
In a poem, the Swedish Nobel Prize winner, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, writing at the turn of the nineteenth century, highlighted five dangers in life: sheriffs and their constables, alcohol, women and the Devil.
'First comes the sheriff with his hard and overbearing ways; he'll rob you of inheritance, prosperity and farm.'
The fact that taxes have a special role to play in my own country, in which we have the world's highest taxes, doubtless does not surprise anyone.
It is not, however, only in Sweden that the issue of taxes, particularly at EU level, is difficult to deal with.
There is also anxiety that, as Mrs Villiers and Mrs Honeyball pointed out, the next step after the common exchange of information might be the harmonisation of taxes, including direct taxes.
We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are not prepared to allow the EU to decide about direct taxes.
What, of course, we can appreciate, however, are the advantages of, and need for, greater cooperation within that area too.
It is a question of increasing tax officials' understanding of the Member States' tax systems and the fact that, for example, one country might wish to reduce its high taxes; it is a matter of raising the level of training and, in that way, improving the way in which the tax system operates in the internal market; and it is about combating fraud, promoting developments in the computer field and ensuring that the candidate countries are fully involved.
We therefore support the Commission's proposal and the report by Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, we endorse the rapporteur's observation concerning the VAT system and country of origin principle and we also support the amendments by the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Allow me to emphasise how important it is for issues concerning personal privacy and the use of personal data to be dealt with in accordance with existing EU and national regulations.
That is important, especially in the area of tax.
Mr President, in spite of their good points, both the Commission's Fiscalis 2007 programme and the report by my esteemed fellow Member, Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, seem to be lacking something.
I think that the report, and the programme, have forgotten the fiscal competences of certain regions that the Lamassoure report, as you will recall, terms 'regions with legislative competences' and 'constitutional regions'.
In fact, these are often nations that are already highly restricted by their own legal framework.
This is the case of my country, Catalonia.
With regard to taxes, situations can obviously differ.
Thus, the Basque Autonomous Communities possess real power.
The Catalan Autonomous Communities, meanwhile, do not have as much.
In any case, all these political bodies would like to be able to establish direct links with the Commission.
They would also like to be able to participate in Council meetings when their competences are at stake.
The amendment we have tabled is along these lines.
Mr President, tax evasion and fraud are, unfortunately, common features of the tax systems of all European countries.
Tax fraud and evasion take on a specific national dimension for each country, in line with its culture and varying according to the degree of citizenship felt in that country. They also have a supranational dimension, however, based on the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes for getting around the law.
It clearly falls to each country to adopt appropriate measures for eliminating tax evasion, although some of the stimulus for this must also come from Community policies.
In Portugal, for example, we know, as a result of studies of unquestionable scientific merit, that more than 25% of potential tax revenue is lost every year.
Consequently, recovering around one-third or EUR 4 billion of this tax revenue would be enough to ensure that we easily meet the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact and, not least, balance public finances in 2004.
This is leaving aside, obviously, the social damage caused by the injustices and inequalities - in other words, the iniquity - that such a permissive tax system allows and encourages.
In this context, all the Community measures favouring this effort, and specifically the continuation of the Fiscalis programme, which has been updated and strengthened under the proposals put forward by the European Parliament, which also apply to the candidate countries, are correct, welcome and are measures that we can support.
Tax evasion and fraud also have a supranational dimension, however, and in order to combat these practices, harmonising technical approaches or standardising administrative procedures, although important, are not sufficient.
We must move resolutely towards achieving legislative harmonisation itself.
Economic and Monetary Union means all countries sooner or later having a similar and harmonised tax model.
Although steps forward and progress in this field (sufficiently supported by common policies, which would entail various concessions being made) must be cautious and gradual and this policy must be formalised in accordance with the objectives set for Europe at the Lisbon Summit.
In accepting the renewal of the Fiscalis programme as a crucial instrument for the efficient functioning of the internal market, the European Parliament must also give a clear indication that this will simply be the other side of the coin of the requirements for economic competitiveness and financial consolidation that we so often demand - and rightly so.
Mr President, the programme that we have been discussing tonight, known as the Fiscalis 2007 programme, will continue and extend the existing Fiscalis programme which has been in place since 1998.
Before the Commission decided to propose the Fiscalis 2007 programme, it evaluated the activities and the results of the existing Fiscalis programme.
That evaluation was based on Member States' reports on their experience with that programme.
The evaluation indicated that Member States viewed the programme as being an essential tool in fostering administrative cooperation between administrations responsible for indirect taxation.
Accordingly, the Commission decided that the existing programme activities should continue to be funded by a Community programme.
The Commission also felt that it was necessary, particularly taking into account the conclusion of the Council's ad hoc working party on tax fraud, to propose the extension of the programme to direct taxation.
That will mean in future that direct tax administrations will have a tool to help them to work closer together in a manner which has become second nature to indirect tax administrations by means of the Fiscalis programme.
The Commission also believes that it is important to give as much support as possible to the countries preparing for the enlargement of the European Union.
For that reason, candidate countries are put on an equal footing with Member States in this programme, which has special objectives to meet the needs of those administrations.
I should like to add it is very important that this programme is adopted before the expiry of the current Fiscalis programme.
I and the Commission are therefore extremely pleased that this proposal is supported by the European Parliament.
I particularly welcome the positive contribution of Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in Council and given the Commission's strong desire to have the programme adopted as quickly as possible, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not so much to accept the amendments put forward by the Parliament.
In particular, as regards the budgetary issues raised in the reports, Amendments Nos 1 and 2 appear to be counter to the agreements between our respective institutions on budgetary discipline and in substance do no more than repeat what is already found in the proposal as regards the programme's financial framework.
Amendments Nos 3 and 4 go beyond the scope of the Fiscalis 2007 programme which is a purely administrative measure.
Amendment No 5 is superfluous, because Parliament is already entitled to obtain the relevant documents.
Amendment No 6 would interfere with the proper implementation of the programme.
Amendment No 7 is superfluous because the decision already contains provisions on a regular follow-up of how objectives are achieved.
Amendment No 8 is also superfluous because the present programme does not have any direct impact on local fiscal authorities and I say this in particular in answer to remarks made by Mr Mayol i Raynal.
May I say that I am personally confident of the fact that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues.
The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail.
It will do its best to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
Your support for the proposal is very important in achieving that result.
I should like to thank Parliament for that support.
To reply in further detail to Mrs Villiers' remarks, the Commission believes that there are convincing reasons for the programme to be extended to direct taxation, not least because the Council itself, in its ad hoc working party's report, explicitly recommended improved cooperation in direct tax matters.
I am very much aware, as perhaps Mrs Villiers knows, of the fact that direct taxation, except where it distorts the internal market, for example in the case of contributions to pension funds across borders, is very much a matter of national political preferences.
That is a position I have often defended, both in the Commission and in outside discussions.
On that point I agree with Mrs Villiers.
But here we are talking about administrative cooperation and the basic issue is combating fraud.
I am sure Mrs Villiers dislikes fraud as much as the Commission.
Disliking something is one thing, doing something about it is another.
If we want to do something about fraud in the area of direct taxation, we must facilitate cooperation between fiscal authorities.
With all due respect to Mrs Villiers, I cannot escape the impression that perhaps she is looking at water burning if she objects to cooperation between the fiscal authorities in the field of direct taxation.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Mr President, we have now reached the home straight in a Commission initiative - I would call it a good Commission initiative - designed to achieve harmonisation of legislation on insurance mediation.
This is a field which so far had not been harmonised. This gap will now be filled and fortunately, I believe, for the better, because the internal market in insurance is crippled if there are no common rules for the commercial networks.
If the insurance companies can act within Union territory without any borders, it is clearly also necessary that those who offer their products should be able to act under common rules, with freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, once and for all in the internal market.
That, however, is not all that is needed: we must also harmonise our laws to achieve high standards of consumer protection in an area such as this, where there is a highly significant imbalance between the information held by the vendors of the products and that held by the purchasers.
This is one of the objectives in this proposal for a directive.
At first reading, Parliament adopted a total of 40 amendments, some admittedly by a tiny majority.
In the common position, just over half were accepted either as they stood or at least in spirit.
Now, at second reading, Parliament has repeated some of the amendments that were not adopted, although it has done so in terms which I think make their approval by the other institutions likely.
While on this subject, I should like to reflect a little on the codecision procedure, and this makes me think that, if this procedure is generalised, it cannot and must not lead to proceedings becoming unnecessarily lengthy or, if the co-legislating institutions start from different positions, to each one sticking to its own position without coming to any reasonable agreement.
If this agreement can be reached without going into the conciliation phase, so much the better and, if so, that is an objective I believe can be achieved in the processing of this directive, because Parliament has shown how it can play a full part in the legislative process by collaborating with other institutions, without the legislative procedure becoming unnecessarily lengthy because of it.
The procedure, however, also has its problems, and perhaps the most important of them is the debating system in this Parliament.
In contrast to what occurs in other parliaments, here we do not debate proposals in a contradictory fashion. Therefore it seems that any effort one may make to try to convince you that certain amendments are good or bad is a wasted effort.
Even so, I cannot help at least trying to put across my reasons for opposing or proposing a vote against certain of the amendments that have been adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I hope it will not be a wasted effort, because a thinker from my country used to say that wasted effort leads to melancholy, and at this time of night I do not want to get melancholic.
I oppose adoption of Amendments 2 and 14 approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I am opposed more strongly than I can tell you to the content of Amendment 2, for various reasons.
First, on technical grounds: the amendment tries to exclude from harmonisation certain possibilities that, if approved, would contradict other points in the directive.
Other points, ladies and gentlemen, that were approved in the text and accepted by the Council and Commission as a consequence of this Parliament's amendments at first reading.
How are we going to adopt this amendment if it conflicts with our own texts?
Secondly, but no less importantly: if, as Amendment 2 would have it, certain types of intermediary are to be excluded from harmonisation, this means, no less, that a large part of the sale of insurance contracts would fall outside the consumer protection mechanisms contained in the directive, and this should not be accepted.
Mr President, first of all, as PPE-DE shadow rapporteur, let me congratulate my Socialist colleague, Mr Berenguer Fuster, on an excellent piece of work which has achieved a remarkable degree of cross-party consensus within Parliament and the committee.
I am very pleased with this Council common position document, which reads far better and more intelligibly than the initial Commission proposals.
It is internally consistent and incorporates some 20 first reading amendments from Parliament, including several that I submitted, such as the need to cater for the electronic age and Internet age by allowing for computer and disk storage of data, exemptions for telephone selling, exemptions for the travel industry for small contracts and action to ensure that the scope of the directive does not extend to the mere provision of information on products.
I fully accept compromise Amendment No 15 relating to transitional provisions to exempt existing brokers and also compromise Amendment No 7 for a regular review of registration as opposed to my original proposal for a three-yearly review.
This was originally carried by the committee in order to ensure the maintenance of high standards of probity and professional standards of the intermediaries, or brokers, as we call them in the UK.
I particularly support the Council proposal for information exchange between competent registration authorities and the fact that the role of the insurance undertaking is prescribed in the intermediaries' registration process, particularly for the tied intermediaries category.
After much deliberation I too will oppose Amendment No 2 as I realise this would pose problems to the Council by considerably reducing the application of the directive.
If passed, it would necessarily have to go to conciliation.
I shall support compromise Amendment No 16 to get rid of the best-advice principle, which would impose unacceptable burdens on the industry.
I continue to support Amendment No 18, which is designed to reduce the burden on the industry by ensuring that the obligation to provide information applies only when a customer requests it.
In summary, this has the making of a good piece of pioneer legislation which will be an integral part of the financial services action plan and the first designed specifically for insurance brokers.
It will serve as a model for other types of brokers in financial products and, not doubt, in other areas as well.
This definitive measure will provide a useful service to Europe's consumers in facilitating a safe and competitive pan-European insurance market with mutually recognised and acceptable standards of professional competence by using the financial passport, with only minimal standards being set, rather than prescriptive harmonisation proceedings, as some would have claimed necessary for such an undertaking.
I congratulate the rapporteur. I look forward to this speedily becoming European law.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am replacing Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, who has other important commitments this evening.
To begin with, I wish to thank Commissioner Bolkestein who has once again presented a well-balanced proposal for completing the internal market, this time within the field of financial services.
I also want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for a sound piece of work, from the first reading to today's second and very rapid reading.
It is gratifying that the Council is, for the most part, adopting Parliament's position from the first reading.
This proposal will make it possible to make cross-border offers of insurance while providing a high degree of consumer protection.
There is a good balance between a freer market, benefiting consumers by offering them more choice, better competition and lower prices, and the requirements governing the protection of policyholders.
The fact that this balance between the market and consumer protection has, in the end, been established at the right level and feels reasonable is incredibly important for an increasingly cross-border market.
It is basically a question of confidence, which is something we are seeing right now in the financial markets.
The regulations must be designed in a way that creates confidence in those who constitute the market, that is to say the consumers.
As Dr Tannock stated, it is not a question of harmonising all the regulations but, rather, of finding methods of achieving a mutual acceptance of current rules in the various Member States.
I believe that is a wise approach.
In general, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party assent to most of the amendments, even though we question the wisdom of adopting a number of them.
Allow me to mention the most important amendment which, in important respects, alters the whole proposal.
In common with Mr Berenguer Fuster, I am talking about the second amendment, which we cannot accept.
It would be unfair to consumers and their demand for security.
It would also be in danger of distorting competition.
We shall therefore vote against this amendment.
Mr President, the current draft proposal on cross-European insurance mediation ensures a high level of professionalism and competence among insurance intermediaries.
Our common aim is to guarantee that all persons, natural and legal, pursing the activity of insurance brokerage are registered by a competent authority on the basis of a minimum set of professional requirements.
A single registration system for intermediaries facilitates cross-border activities by way of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
The proposal also guarantees a high level of protection for customers' interests.
Unfortunately the original Commission proposal did not take sufficient account of the diversity of European insurance markets.
It would have imposed an unnecessarily heavy bureaucratic burden on many intermediaries, without increasing customer protection.
Our amendments from the first reading referred explicitly to those whose main activity is not to sell insurance but rather to offer the standardised insurance contracts that have been in use in many countries for decades, for instance tourist assistance packages or car insurance offered by travel agencies and car dealers.
Customer protection is a primary value in the insurance business of my home country and, yes, travel agents and car dealers are entitled to sell standardised products.
Trouble-free years of experience have shown that the current practice is in the interests of both intermediaries and customers.
Costs of insurance mediation must not be increased, especially when there is no benefit to customers.
Nor is it useful for certain Member States to adopt more stringent provisions regarding information requirements, which bring no added value to the customer but merely distort competition between European providers.
I am happy that my colleagues supported my amendments in the committee vote and I hope they will also support them tomorrow.
The directive as it now stands in the second reading is a good draft, providing a reasonable compromise between the legitimate interests of Member States, insurance providers and customers.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to enlarge on my speech of 13 November 2001 by discussing the following areas. I would like, first, to thank the rapporteur and the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur for the excellent work they have done.
I believe that both the Commission proposal and Parliament's report make a further contribution to a stronger financial internal market, to facilitation of cross-border activity and to greater harmonisation in this area, which is dependent on public trust and of importance to transparency.
A number of amendments have already been discussed.
For my part, I would like to deal with Amendment No 6, which concerns itself with greater transparency, because we want to see to it that the register, in addition to the proposed methods, shall indicate the country or countries in which the intermediary conducts business under the rules on establishment or on the freedom to provide services.
On the other hand, we want to ensure that there are greater possibilities for monitoring, by using Amendment No 10 to allow consumer associations to register complaints.
Then Amendment No 12 has to do with sorting out the frequently-discussed question of whether information should be supplied without being requested, by stipulating that information on the customer's rights must be supplied, whilst detailed information may be requested.
I would like to say that Amendment No 2 should not be misunderstood.
It is not opposed to harmonisation.
Many countries, though, have stricter rules of various kinds, so that, for example, credit institutions are already subject to many requirements contained in this directive.
Amendment No 2 is therefore intended to take account of these different rules, which already impose higher standards, by making different approaches to it possible, without, though, undermining the directive's basic tendency.
Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Berenguer Fuster, for their judicious and efficient handling of this matter.
After the second reading in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, only 18 amendments were submitted to plenary.
This is evidence of the balanced quality of the common position text which Mr Berenguer Fuster mentioned to the committee last week.
It was not just a compliment.
Indeed, the common position to a large extent follows the line taken by Parliament at first reading.
It took account of the most important amendments adopted, which improved our initial proposal.
The action plan for financial services identified insurance intermediaries as a priority objective.
Insurance intermediaries are indeed confronted with obstacles which prevent them from taking full advantage of the freedoms of the Treaty.
This hinders the proper functioning of the internal market.
The directive following the text of the common position will ensure that, once registered in his home Member State, which is responsible for checking professional and financial requirements, an insurance intermediary will be able to conduct his activities throughout the internal market.
That will improve the functioning of that internal market in insurance, particularly as regards retail markets.
At the same time, the directive will guarantee the protection of customers by setting appropriate information requirements.
The Council common position now submitted to this Parliament is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission's proposal.
The Commission supports this text.
But it is vital to ensure that the difficult balance reached in the common position is not put in jeopardy by amendments which would not be compatible with its fundamental objectives.
Let me now turn to the amendments which were submitted to plenary.
The Commission can accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 16.
With regard to Amendment No 17, which aims to clarify the scope of the directive, the Commission can accept it, even though it considers that minor redrafting is needed in order to avoid any misunderstanding.
The Commission is not, however, in a position to accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 2, 9, 13, 14 and 18, for the following reasons: firstly, Amendment No 2, on which Mr Berenguer Fuster, Mr Tannock and Mr Schmidt have spoken just now.
That amendment aims to exclude from the scope of the proposal a large number of insurance intermediaries, such as car dealers selling motor insurance, travel agencies, veterinary surgeons, captive intermediaries of industrial firms and some bank insurance activities.
Such exclusions would affect the sale of a large number of insurance products involving important risks.
They would deprive the directive of a major part of its content.
Furthermore these excluded intermediaries would not be able to make use of the advantages provided for in the directive.
Should these intermediaries be excluded from the benefits of the internal market, I very much share Mr Berenguer Fuster's concern about that amendment.
The Commission cannot accept it.
Amendment No 9 introduces a transitional provision aiming to facilitate the application of the directive to those intermediaries already carrying out activities before the date of adoption of the proposal by the Commission, namely September 2000.
The Commission already welcomed this idea at first reading, but, as Amendment No 15 better meets the concerns of the directive, the Commission would prefer it to be adopted rather than Amendment No 9.
While a fundamental element of the proposal and the common position is to ensure a high level of consumer protection by providing customers with appropriate information and advice, Amendment No 13 would devalue that requirement.
It provides that the advice given by an intermediary has to be based on the best possible advice principle.
The Commission cannot accept that amendment.
It would imply enormous difficulties for the work of any insurance intermediary.
It would also lead to great legal uncertainty and may be a source of legal conflict.
Last, but not least, it would increase the costs of insurance mediation.
The text of the common position already contains a balanced provision which makes it mandatory to provide appropriate advice on the basis of a fair analysis of the insurance contracts available on the market.
That provision fully ensures a high level of consumer protection.
Amendment No 16, which refers to an objective analysis, is along the same lines as the common position and may improve the text.
The last amendment that I wish to discuss is Amendment No 14, which provides, in the case of immediate cover, for a derogation to the principle that the information requested by the directive must be given in writing.
That would jeopardise the objective of a high level of consumer protection.
The common position already takes account of the spirit of Amendment No 44 proposed at first reading.
Accepting this new amendment would deprive the consumer of written confirmation of the information required by the directive.
The same reasoning also applies to Amendment No 18, which reduces the obligation on insurance intermediaries to specify the demands of the customer.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a report (A5-0177/2002) by Mrs Stihler, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on measures for the recovery of cod and hake stocks [COM(2002) 724 - C5-0095/2001 - 0299(CNS)].
Madam President, the background to this report is well known, but worth repeating as it is crucial.
In November 2000, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) warned that cod stocks in the North Sea and west of Scotland waters and the northern hake stocks are at serious risk of collapse.
ICES estimates that cod stocks in the North Sea are at their lowest level since 1963 and that technical measures and TAC reductions alone will not be enough to restore them to within safe limits.
Cod stocks in the Kattegat, Irish Sea and west of Scotland waters are in similar condition.
For hake the decline in stocks has been less dramatic, but stocks are thought to be around only half of their 1980 levels.
At the December 2000 Fisheries Council meeting, it was agreed that more long-term conservation measures were necessary in addition to TAC reductions for 2001.
The Commission was invited to submit proposals for a multi-annual recovery plan.
During 2001, the Commission adopted various emergency regulations to restrict the fishing of these species and in June 2001, it issued a communication outlining its strategy for rebuilding cod and hake stocks in Community and adjacent waters.
The current proposed multi-annual recovery programme for cod and hake follows on from that communication.
I welcome the overall approach, which includes targets for recovery of each of the stocks, total allowable catches allowing for an annual percentage increase of 30% for cod and 15% for hake, with an upper and lower limit to the permitted change in the TAC of 50% from one year to the next, a system of fishing effort limitation, enhanced controls in relation to satellite tracking for vessels over 50 metres in length, position reporting, landing conditions, retentions on board and conditions for weighing and transport. The potential use of temporary closed areas for up to 60 days.
I believe that successful recovery of stocks must be a priority.
We must at all costs avoid a Canadian-style disappearance of cod and hake from these northern waters.
In Canada, a cod moratorium was introduced in 1992.
Some 30,000 people lost their jobs, the biggest lay-off in Canadian history.
The cod disappeared due to a complex mix of factors, including over-fishing, and a decade later the stocks have not recovered.
We cannot ignore the ecological warning signs.
At the committee vote, references to hake were removed from this report.
I hope colleagues will support me as rapporteur in trying to reinstate hake in this report.
Although there is disagreement over whether cod and hake should be treated together, the Commission's approach seems to me acceptable, provided that sufficient account is taken of the specific situation of the two species.
The figures and the levels of hake stocks have been questioned and we should be guided by evidence.
On the measure proposed for hake, new scientific evidence may allow a relaxation in the targets and the percentage stock increase expected.
We need a package of measures which first of all work and secondly minimise the pain to the sector.
Finally, while the success of the recovery plans must be the priority, an annual review of their progress and socio-economic impact should be undertaken.
However, if recovery is not achieved the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship.
In any event, without fish there cannot be fisheries.
I ask colleagues to vote for Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 and against Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 9 and 14.
Madam President, I must start by regretting the absence of Commissioner Fischler.
I believe this debate is important enough to deserve his presence here today.
Rigorous, transparent, verified scientific reports, carried out together with the industry, should be the first pillar of the CFP reform in order to have credibility in the conservation of our fishery species.
We need to diagnose the true state of the stocks precisely and accurately, because otherwise we could be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
The European Union should be a global example of marine research, but it is not, not even - and I say this to Commissioner Fischler - with his proposed reform, which pushes science into the background.
Last week at a meeting of marine scientists, Mr Robin Cook, of the Aberdeen marine research laboratory and an advisory member of the ICES, stated that the fisheries reform proposed was based on scientific reports that were very poor and which lacked transparency.
John Molloy of the Dublin Marine Institute - as you can see I do not mention any Spanish scientists here - said that 'fishermen are scientists' and that we need to use the raft of first-hand information they have, which is currently being ignored.
The Canadian scientist McGuire has also rejected the hake catastrophe reports.
The industry rejects them outright.
We are aware that the ICES and the Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries do not agree, and they again brought up the review of current hake reports at Lisbon and Copenhagen.
Mr Fischler, without an economic, social and regional impact assessment, proposes equating cod and hake, which are very different species and very different situations; and he adopts drastic, irreversible measures to cut down the fleet as if there were no other alternative measures that would maintain the stock while we wait for conclusive reports.
I call on the Commissioner to think it over for once.
The Committee on Fisheries approved Amendment 1 - I see the rapporteur is against separating the two species - and I hope the House will adopt it.
If not, I hope the Council can bring it back in.
We want to protect stocks but not at just any price, not through just any measure.
We want the ecological reports to include economic and social reports, and we must take into account the industry which has been fishing in the same waters for several generations, and they do not understand the Commission's proposal, in view of the results they are getting, and they want other biological reference points to be selected that are broad in scope and more rigorous.
I therefore call on the Commission to go deeper into CFP reform and marine research, and to devote more human and material resources to it.
I call on it to review the proposal for hake, since the industry that depends on it demands more transparency, more participation, more dialogue, more objectivity and more reliability before it will accept the proposals that the Commission puts before us.
Madam President, I offer my sincerest congratulations to my colleague, Catherine Stihler, for her excellent work, which gives the Council the opportunity to approve a much more balanced plan for these two species.
I cannot, however, agree with her desire, as rapporteur, to reinstate hake in this report.
As she well knows, I had tabled 13 amendments in committee aimed at softening the measures for hake, and more than half lapsed when the committee adopted the amendment tabled by Mr Varela, which separates the two species.
Therefore, if we now approved the report for both species together, it would be highly unbalanced.
The Community fisheries policy has to find a balance among the measures on stock conservation, the reasonable adjustment of the fleet to each Member State and the maintenance of economic activity in fishing-dependent regions.
It is a complex approach. First of all, because overfishing is not the only cause of stock depletion: the indiscriminate catching of species for fishmeal production interrupts the food chain for cod and hake and to a great extent causes the situation both species are going through.
There are certainly highly significant differences between these two fisheries as regards their mortality and growth rates and the conservation measures needed.
The situation of cod in the North Sea and off Scotland is different, just as the situation of northern hake off south-western Ireland differs from that off the French coast.
Not all species - and this is something we have to say out loud - and not all fishing grounds are in the same state.
In this respect, the Committee on Fisheries considered that the hake and cod situations are different, and that hake should have different measures from cod, which should be adopted based on confirmed scientific reports.
There is no single, unified and indisputable scientific basis to indicate that the northern hake stock has fallen below the biological safety limit, and there does not seem to be a need for drastic management measures to save this stock.
We cannot forget the great economic and social impact that these measures will have on the fishing communities.
The Commission has not undertaken any study of these consequences or of those that must be taken into account when the plan is implemented, nor has it shown us an evaluation of the emergency measures it adopted in 2001.
It must be remembered too that the TAC for hake was cut by 51% between 1999 and 2001.
The European fishing fleet quite reasonably needs to know what prospects there are for this activity.
My group is therefore opposed to drastic cuts, which can be brought in over longer periods.
We therefore support the rapporteur's Amendment 8, and once again I sincerely congratulate her on the excellent work she has done.
Mr President, this is a very important report because the European Community is discussing recovery plans for fish stocks for the first time.
Since this is the first time, it is very important that we get it right.
We must make sure that the actions we take will reverse the declines in several cod stocks and northern hake and allow them to recover.
The Commission proposals were tough and will definitely have an impact upon the fishing communities involved, but they had to be tough because the state of the stocks is so poor.
As the rapporteur has said, if we do not do something about fish stocks, there will be no fishing industry in the future as there will be no fish.
ICES says that cod in the North Sea is at its lowest level since 1963.
While hake may not yet be in such dire straits, it is still far below the level which is appropriate, and the warning bells have been ringing now for quite some time.
The Commission, the Committee on Fisheries and the Council all claim to agree with the precautionary approach, which states that the absence of definite proof should not be used to refuse action to prevent a decline in fish stocks.
In other words, as soon as there are reasonable grounds to believe that cod and hake stocks need a degree of protection, we should act.
That is exactly what the Commission has done.
However, what did the Committee on Fisheries do?
It argued that there is no crisis involving hake and completely removed it from the proposal.
We must vote against this amendment.
I agree with the rapporteur on this point.
It is completely unacceptable.
This is not a precautionary approach to fisheries management.
The committee is simply paying lip service to the idea and continuing with business as usual.
We are not going to solve the problems if this is the way we go on. We cannot keep refusing to face up to reality.
We must realise that these stocks are endangered and we must protect the fishing industry.
It is doing the fishing industry no favours in the long term if this is the kind of simplistic, nationalistic short-term approach that has been taken.
If the report goes through plenary as it is, the Verts/ALE Group will have to vote against it.
Madam President, during the course of 20 years, cod stocks in the North Sea have shrunk by three-quarters.
At the same time, the number of cod fishermen has fallen considerably in my country.
In 1980, there were still 310 cutters that fished for cod under the Dutch flag, while these days most fishermen have switched to flatfish, and there are only a handful of cutters left that fish for cod.
Nonetheless, this reduction in the number of fishermen does not seem enough.
The Commission is right to table proposals for multi-annual recovery programmes for cod and hake.
However, in the Commission's proposals on reform of the European fisheries policy which Commissioner Fischler presented recently, those very fish-stock related reductions are missing.
The link in the case of cod and, to a lesser degree, of hake, is evident.
I share Mrs Stihler's view completely when she states in the explanatory statement to the report that successful recovery of the stocks must be the priority.
The package of measures must be effective, but must also take account of the socio-economic damage to the fisheries sector.
There is no point putting the sector under pressure if the measures implemented do not have the desired effect on the stocks.
This is why it is important to monitor the effectiveness of the measures.
Measures must be reversed as soon as it is evident that they do not have any positive effects.
As a bad example of such a futile measure, I would remind the Commission of the cod contingency plan which it launched for the North Sea in the winter of 2000.
This contingency plan, by means of which part of the North Sea was closed for fishing, had the opposite effect.
In the open areas, fishing pressure rose enormously, while in the closed areas, the fish stocks were quickly caught following their re-opening.
According to fisheries biologists, the closed areas did not correspond very well with the mating areas of cod.
Due to the fleet concentration in the open areas, vulnerable areas are being over-fished.
In my view, fishermen and biologists were right to conclude that the Commission was not so much concerned about effectiveness as it was about political viability.
A repeat of this debacle and the lack of proportion must be avoided.
It is unacceptable for Dutch fishermen who are allowed to catch 10% of the Total Allowed Catch, the TAC, for cod, to be far more restricted in their fishing activities than British fishermen who account for 40% of the TAC.
I will make a few observations to the measures included in the Commission proposal.
First of all, the aforementioned area closures are a good example of how things should not be done.
Real-time closures, closures in an area where a high concentration of young fish is found, on the other hand, can be an effective measure.
Technical measures can be of particular importance for the fishermen who fish for cod as a secondary activity.
Secondly, the reduction in TAC for cod entails the risk that the fishing pressure on unquoted species will increase enormously.
Pro-active policy should ensure that unquoted species are quoted as quickly as possible.
This is all the more important when in 2003, Spanish and Portuguese ships will also be heading for the North Sea.
If the Commission abandons TACs and quotas for these species, we can expect recovery plans for these species in ten years' time.
Thirdly, a reduction in effort is achieved most quickly by applying the sea-days' scheme.
It is delightful to see that a system used in the Netherlands, that was always met with criticism by the Commission, is now finally being adopted by the self-same Commission.
I hope that the Commission will apply this method more widely.
A weekend ban, well-known in the transport world, is being recommended by Dutch fishermen.
Fourthly, the Commission should not simply leave the details of the sea-days' scheme and the financial compensation to the Member States.
This would lead to unfair competition.
The Commission must prescribe reduction figures for each Member State.
These figures can be based on the quota and the observed over-fishing in recent years.
Finally, we must ensure that fleets that have found a balanced relationship between effort and quotas do not undergo further re-organisation.
By that, I mean that if a fleet, in the event of sound quota management, is capable of working profitably and effectively, then this should not be disturbed.
It is therefore positive that subsidies for the building of new vessels will be abolished.
But even when FIFG funds are used, the fishing capacity should not be maintained artificially.
It is important for the impact of the plans to be assessed in good time.
It is also important that we then take account of the socio-economic damage to the sector.
If the recovery plan fails, the damage to cod, hake and to fishermen will be incalculable.
Mr President, I shall start by also congratulating Mrs Stihler on her excellent report and on the excellent speech she made this evening in this House.
Everyone in this House is aware that fish stocks are in sharp decline across the EU.
That is why the Commission has come to us with a radical new package of proposals for reform of the common fisheries policy.
That is why we are facing an 18% cut in overall gross tonnage in the EU fleet, with the attendant massive impact that this will have on jobs in many economically challenged and remote peripheral areas of the Community.
However, we also understand that the two species at most serious risk of collapse are cod and northern hake.
There is at least no doubt about the state of cod stocks.
I would admit that there are, however, some doubts about the state of hake stocks.
The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) claims that hake stocks are on the verge of collapse.
Other independent scientists claim the stocks are still at sustainable levels and they challenge the ICES findings.
As Mrs McKenna has pointed out in her speech this evening, we are pledged in this House to apply the precautionary principle whenever such doubts exist.
In these circumstances, I would appeal to this House to reinstate hake in the Commission's recovery plan until such time as the scientific evidence can be analysed and verified in exactly the way Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has called for this evening.
Yesterday, as we all know, a substantial number of Member States voiced their opposition to certain aspects of the Commission's proposals for reforming the CFP during the Fisheries Council.
They want public aid to be used for building new vessels, they want open access to Community waters, they support short-term profits over long-term sustainability, they oppose change, they support the status quo.
Theirs is surely a policy of despair.
We cannot continue as we have done in the past.
If we do so, it will not be only cod and hake that disappear, our fishing industry will disappear as well.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, fishing exploits natural resources which are, admittedly, renewable, but they are also fragile and easily destroyed.
Because for centuries catching methods were of limited effectiveness, the idea arose that stocks were inexhaustible.
This feeling still exists in some reactions against conservation policies.
Nevertheless, in the face of a public opinion that cares about protecting nature and of the economic risks created by the collapse of some fish species, fishermen are realising that they must be marine life's allies and not its enemies.
It is in this context that any reform of fisheries policy must be seen, whether it is a wide-ranging reform or one designed to address specific situations, such as this one.
The aim of the legislation currently under consideration, which is the subject of the excellent Stihler report, is to prevent the disaster that the extinction of fish as popular as cod and hake would represent.
We can discuss the relative values of the recommended measures and the effectiveness of the method of implementing them; we can discuss the accuracy of the scientific data on which this method is based, but what cannot be underestimated is the danger threatening cod population units and, on a smaller scale, those for hake as well as the need to turn the situation around and to recover these population units.
In our debates on fisheries, we have frequently come up against the uncertainty and the unreliability of scientific data.
This is the justification for the Committee on Fisheries' decision to make its proposals for hake more flexible.
I wonder whether this is a step in the right direction.
I have my doubts.
For these reasons, I call on the Commission to set up a system of scientific and technically credible research on which to base our decisions.
It is crucial that the Commission does this.
Cod, as everyone knows, is one of the cornerstones of Portuguese cuisine, but man does not live by haute cuisine alone.
Cod fishing in Newfoundland is deeply ingrained in the minds of our fishermen and has left indelible traces in Portuguese literature.
We must, therefore, fight to save the cod!
Mr President, this proposal highlights the desperate state of some of our fish stocks and underlines why it is so important that the Commission and the Council get the reform of the CFP right.
There must be no bowing to political pressures.
They must ensure that the objective of sustainable fisheries is at the core of fisheries management.
While I accept that recovery plans for hake must be specific to that fishery, I do not believe that hake should be excluded from the proposal.
As to the details of the proposal, I have some concerns to highlight.
Firstly, the Commission must take greater account of mixed fisheries which are impacted by recovery plans.
Crucially I am not convinced that the Commission has learned the lessons from the dangers of displacing effort, as we saw in the north of Scotland last year.
The Commission must ensure that scientific advice is reliable and verifiable, not just in determining what areas should be closed but determining the effect of such closures.
The removal of ceilings on financial contributions under the FIFG is to be welcomed.
But the Commission has failed to propose a system which ensures that there is equal treatment of fishermen subject to recovery measures and that it is not promoting unfair competition between fishermen from different Member States.
I hope the Commission will heed the committee's amendment calling for Community funding which is not dependent on cofinancing to compensate fishermen under these plans.
Safety is of paramount importance.
While public aid for modernisation and renewal should not be a bottomless pit, it should be available for improvements to safety.
A combination of ageing vessels and days-at-sea restrictions could be a lethal combination.
It is vital that safety be taken into account when measuring the impact of recovery plans and, for that matter, fisheries management in general.
Madam President, I hope we have all been able to fortify ourselves with the delicious Dutch herrings that have been provided for us.
I would like to thank Mr Albert Jan Maat from the bottom of my heart.
That was a great occasion, and I can only confirm - as I think you will too - that fish are a good thing.
I do not want to talk up the vote on stock rebuilding as the fateful question in the run-up to the fisheries reform, but I do hope that those who reject the Commission's proposal for a regulation as submitted, will after all agree to a compromise tomorrow morning, a compromise that would again permit hake alongside cod, just as the Commission had rightly proposed.
I, too, have had second thoughts in the meantime.
Like others, I still have hope, as I have in the meantime re-examined the matter; I have not done this completely off my own bat, but have taken scientific bases, ICES for example, as my starting point.
Who would seriously call their data into question?
Has the Commission submitted a proposal including measures to recover the stocks of cod and hake?
That stocks of both species are severely threatened has been disputed by nobody here this evening, and so, if we want to be consistent, hake must not be left out, and the sceptics should bear in mind that prevention is better than cure.
We have to get to grips with the biological realities and the problems nature creates for an exact analysis of the stock.
Fish swim.
That is why nobody can count their precise number, and also why casting doubt on ICES' recommendations is a popular sport.
We have for a considerable time been able to see where that leads, not only with cod and hake, and not only in European waters.
I would like fisheries to be economically sustainable, environmentally responsible and socially acceptable.
If this is to happen, our prime need is for healthy stocks.
Action is needed to break the vicious circle of more and better boats chasing fewer and fewer fish.
Now!
Excess capacity is being cut back in other sectors of the economy as well, and that is something that fisheries will, unfortunately, have to get used to, as European fisheries have to be maintained, but standing on their own feet, not kept alive by Europe, and not without fish in our own waters.
Madam President, I have conflicting feelings about this proposal for a regulation and this report.
On the one hand, I feel I must make my rejection of this regulation clear, particularly with regard to hake, which suffers irrational and unjustifiable damage as a result of being treated together with cod. On the other hand, however, I believe that this will provide a valuable tool for calling into question the reform of the CFP, which was proposed by Commissioner Franz Fischler and presented by the Commission to the Council.
The weakness of the Commission's arguments becomes apparent simply from reading the Stihler report's explanatory statement, particularly when the Commission attempts to base the regulation on supposedly reliable scientific studies.
As the rapporteur points out, the proposal for measures was approved in 2001, on the basis of the information supplied by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, even before the drastic reductions of the TACs agreed for 2001 had been implemented.
As the rapporteur points out, the scientific considerations are full of ambiguities and uncertainties.
To quote from the text: 'For hake, the decline in stocks has been less dramatic and therefore the scientific evidence is less clear cut and indeed the subject of some dispute'.
I continue: 'Disagreement occurs over whether the two species [hake and cod] should be treated together, the speed at which recovery should be attempted and hence the severity of the measures necessary and what precisely those measures should be.' etc.
The report highlights, furthermore and above all, the impact and the economic effects that have not been addressed in the draft regulation.
These, Madam President, are the many consequences that will occur or which are already occurring, in a sector which will become much more crucial and dangerous as a result of the unfair and irrational Fischler reform of the common fisheries policy.
Madam President, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very courageous report.
This is going to be very painful for all fishermen, because it will mean that there will be many reductions in the catch and many job losses.
She refers to that in her report.
There are some measures there to help fishermen.
One thing we can be sure of is that fish do not recognise any border or boundary.
We must also recognise that this is a cod and hake report.
I want to make sure that we urge all colleagues to vote for hake to be reintroduced to this report. Otherwise we will be sitting here in the not very distant future saying that the hake stocks have been reduced so dramatically that we need even more draconian measures in order to reinstate them.
The rapporteur said that hake stocks have been reduced by 50% since 1980, so we must take measures to make sure that they improve.
We also have to accept that when fish are swimming in the sea they do not separate themselves out neatly, so when you go out to fish one particular species you cannot always be sure that is the only species you catch.
We have to take a wider look at all the conservation measures.
We must in particular find a solution to discards of fish, tradable quotas when you come ashore or whatever it may be.
There must be a way to stop discarding healthy fish, because the stocks are not there and we must make sure that they are built up again.
We have only to look at what has happened in Canada to see that if you carry on fishing then there is going to be no fish for anybody.
It is also wrong for one particular Member State to exert enormous political pressure to try and have hake removed from this report and then try to get more fish for itself.
At the end of the day it does not matter what nationality we are.
If there are no fish, there are no stocks and nobody will be able to fish.
We have to be sure that these measures are put in place.
I again congratulate the rapporteur and ask that we all vote for what was originally a cod and hake report - and make sure that we do have a cod and hake report.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor in this House to support the proposal by the Committee on Fisheries, principally to uphold the need to exclude northern hake stocks from the scope of the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of cod and hake stocks.
I do so because the situations of the cod and hake stocks are very different.
If they are not excluded, we will be putting at risk thousands of jobs and an industry on which many coastal communities in the European Union depend for their living, on no verified, irrefutable technical-scientific grounds.
This socio-economic consequence should be a good enough reason to make us think, but there are other reasons too: the proposal is based on an alleged scientific study, but by November 2001 the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries was pointing out that the precautionary points of reference used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea were not currently valid and, besides, recommended that they should be reviewed immediately.
As nobody, no administration, has a monopoly on common sense and doing the right thing, there is an obvious need for a scientific advisory appeal mechanism, a need for peer review and, of course, a need to listen to and analyse in depth what the affected sector seriously has to say with their verified and verifiable arguments and studies.
When decisions of great social significance are to be adopted, they need to be very well grounded; the studies on which they are based have to be irrefutable.
All that has been said so far, ladies and gentlemen, does not mean opposing other serious and responsible alternative measures for conserving and improving hake stocks until such time as the studies have been completed and confirmed, but we must not support measures that may have irreversible consequences.
It must, of course, be possible to apply the precautionary principle without causing economic disasters or social upheavals.
A balance is possible, and the Commission must seek it.
A first step will be verified, confirmed studies, which will show we are quite right and provide us with arguments.
Things have to be done properly, especially when our fishermen are clearly at risk of being seriously harmed.
Madam President, may I begin by saying that I shall not speak about the proposal itself, other than to emphasise that the Commission regards this as one of the most important steps to be undertaken under the common fisheries policy.
As many here are aware, this proposal foreshadows many aspects to be discussed in future on the overall reform of the common fisheries policy.
If we cannot collaborate to secure recovery of our fish stocks, the future of fish and fishermen cannot be ensured.
Let me now comment on the amendments.
On Amendment No 1, the Commission cannot accept this amendment, which would remove reference to hake from the proposal.
ICES has advised that the stock of hake is in danger of collapse.
If this is the case, the Commission must act to rectify this situation.
The only alternative assessment of the state of the stock is that prepared at the request of the Instituto EspaÃ±ol de OceanografÃ­a by Canadian fishery scientist, Mr Maguire.
During the discussions in Council working parties, Spain has not challenged the validity of the ICES assessment of the historical development of the hake stock or of the current state of that stock.
Spain has challenged one of the so-called precautionary reference points against which the state of the stock is judged.
In detail, the Spanish officials have proposed that the value of 165 000 tonnes in the Commission proposal should be changed to 145 000 tonnes.
This position does not contradict the perception that the stock is in danger of collapse.
It perhaps means that it is in less danger, but the dangers still exist.
Regarding Amendment No 2, the Commission feels that this amendment is unnecessary since account is already consistently taken of scientific reports on environmental effects, to the extent that these effects are scientifically documented and quantified.
An example is the effect of low salinity in recent years on reproductive success of cod in the Baltic.
The other factors mentioned in the amendment lie beyond the scope of the common fisheries policy and therefore it would be inappropriate to refer to them in this proposal.
Furthermore it remains a fact that for cod, hake and many other fish stocks, fishing is the main cause of mortality and the reduction of fishing is the most likely way to achieve recovery of the stocks.
Regarding Amendment No 3, the Commission is already working on improvement of all aspects of scientific advice.
Any communication on this topic will be included in the second package of reform proposals, which will be presented to this Parliament in the near future.
Furthermore, it is not correct to say that the necessary analysis of the correlation between fishing effort and mortality rates or the appropriate level of tax has not been made for the year 2002.
For those reasons the Commission cannot accept that amendment.
Regarding Amendment No 4, the Commission can agree in principle with this analysis, since TACs are not instruments which will necessarily solve the problem of discards.
The problem will only be solved if selectivity of fishing gears is increased or if fishing is reduced or prohibited in geographical areas in which small fish congregate.
That aspect has been dealt with in a series of Commission and Council regulations emanating from the emergency situation with cod and hake.
Also the Commission is currently working on an action plan on discards in the framework of the CFP reform.
This amendment is therefore not necessary.
Regarding Amendment No 5, the Commission cannot accept this amendment, since it takes the view that public aid for vessel modernisation should be used only for the safety of fishing vessels, whereas the amendment implies that other objectives might also be eligible for aid.
Aid which is likely to enhance the fishing power of fleets is no longer acceptable.
Regarding Amendment No 6, the Commission cannot accept this amendment since real time closures need to be enacted very rapidly.
The inclusion of the Council in this mechanism would take much more time.
Once the Council has taken a decision, real time closure would no longer be efficient.
Amendment No 7 is accepted: there has been a typographical error.
Regarding Amendment No 8, the Commission is in the process of considering the impact of a lower annual variation in TAC level on stock recovery.
That is a point on which the Council has also expressed some reservations.
Regarding Amendment No 9, the Commission cannot accept that amendment.
Technical measures are dealt with in a different legislative proposal.
Technical measures which are acceptable to Member States will bring about some improvement to the present situation, but do not go far enough.
The Commission indicated earlier that only about 20% of the desired reduction in fishing mortality will be achieved by the application.
A limitation of fishing effort is therefore also required.
Compulsory scrapping of vessels is not mentioned in the proposal and it is not intended for the future CFP.
TACs will be proposed at levels concordant with scientific advice.
Regarding Amendment No 10, the Commission cannot accept that amendment.
Hake are not caught only by industrial fishing vessels and cod are caught in very small quantities.
A proposal for 5% reflects the probable catches of cod and is therefore proportionate to the objective pursued.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11.
While it is difficult to calculate the amount of a supplementing premium needed to generate more interest in scrapping, 20% is already a significant increase and corresponds to previous practice in similar situations, for example structural measures for the ex-Morocco fleet in Spain and Portugal.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 12.
We see no reason to restrict safety-related aid to smaller vessels, that is, those of less than 12 metres.
The recent proposals for CFP reform propose that all vessels should be eligible for such aid, provided that it does not affect the fishing capacity of the vessel.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 13.
This is a very expensive form of aid, which does not reduce the underlying problem of over-capacity.
Only short-term measures of this kind can be justified.
To accept Community co-financing for a longer period would significantly reduce the availability of Community funds for co-financing of scrapping, which is clearly the priority objective in this case.
Amendment No 14 is not acceptable to the Commission, since the Community cannot accept full responsibility for aid of this kind.
Co-financing is a fundamental principle for structural aid.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 15.
A specification of the duration of the plan is not acceptable.
The stocks will be deemed to have recovered whenever, for two consecutive years, science indicates that quantities of mature fish have been in excess of defined levels.
Reference is made in the last Paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's intention to conduct an impact study within 18 months of adoption of the proposal.
This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.
Regarding Amendment No 16, a review process can be envisaged, but not on an annual basis.
It will take some time for the proposed measures to take effect.
The earliest point in time would be after two full years of operation.
Reference is made in the last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum to the Commission's intention to conduct an impact study within 18 months of adoption of the proposal.
This might be supported by the addition of texts in an article of the proposal, but the reference in the explanatory memorandum should be sufficient.
I should like to refer to some additional remarks made by Members of Parliament.
To begin with, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna referred to the scientific advice on which we base our proposal.
That advice is the advice of ICES.
Despite its shortcomings, which nobody denies, the ICES advice is by far the best available.
The reform of the common fisheries policy prioritises the improvement of scientific advice.
In the meantime we have to work with the best advice we have, which is the ICES advice.
This is also in reply to Mrs MiguÃ©lez Ramos.
Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.
The next item is a report (A5-0198/2002) by Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Common Organisation of the Market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin [COM(2001) 101 - C5-0095/2001 - 2001/0055(CNS)].
Madam President, two months ago we were debating this same report, because the agricultural alcohol problem is actually one that has arisen owing to the large amount of agricultural alcohol produced in the candidate countries for accession, because the future negotiation with the WTO may give rise to further reductions in border production, and also owing to the foreseeable growth in demand for bioethanol as fuel in the European Union.
Because of this, the Council of Ministers of 17 July 2000 called on the Commission to introduce a regulatory framework for alcohol of agricultural origin, but the Commission went much further and proposed a COM, which did not include any financial measures but did allow for the possibility of establishing tariff quotas and safeguard clauses, prohibiting or restricting the use of inward processing arrangements, and a specific provision on aid.
This proposal, however, made by the Commission did not include synthetic alcohol, although 70% of ethyl alcohol users can use it industrially; only the 30% involved in the production of spirit drinks can only use alcohol of agricultural origin.
Because synthetic alcohol was not included, and because at the time no legal basis could be found for bringing it into a COM, Parliament referred the report back to committee two months ago.
Afterwards the Council continued its deliberations and has reached an advance agreement to include synthetic alcohol and has asked us for a second report.
The Council and Parliament are now in agreement, and I think the Commission should take this into account.
This report proposes in one of its amendments - the most important one - to change the title: instead of a COM, what is proposed is a Council regulation laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin within the European Union.
It is proposed that synthetic alcohol should also be included in these measures, especially with regard to statistics.
It is also proposed that the Management Committee for Wine should have competence in these matters, but that a specific working party should be set up within the Management Committee for Wine to deal with alcohol of agricultural origin.
It is also proposed that Article 10 should be deleted because, as this is not a COM, an article referring to aids does not make sense.
Besides, as these are national aids, I think they come under the heading of all state aids, regardless of whether they are for agricultural alcohol or for some other matter.
Commissioner, please pass on all these amendments, which I ask should be voted on in the House tomorrow, to the competent Commissioner, together with the understanding that the Council and Parliament are in agreement on this aspect.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening's debate is about something that was the Council's sole request, namely the question of how to introduce transparency and the statistical dimension into the agricultural alcohol sector.
I am extraordinarily grateful to our rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, who has made exemplary use of the limited room for manoeuvre available to Parliament.
We would, Commissioner, have liked to reject the Commission proposal as a whole, as it took no account whatever of the Council's request.
Close cooperation with all concerned parties has enabled the rapporteur to lay before us a genuine compromise on which all of them were able to agree.
Thirty years of discussions have now got us to the point where we can give this sector a regulation that provides for the required statistical surveys, and does so primarily within the framework of a simple Council regulation.
Secondly, this regulation does not, in essence, call for any statements on aid legislation.
Thirdly, it includes industrially produced alcohol, agricultural alcohol's direct competitor.
As a matter of urgency, I appeal to the Commission to stop resisting this compromise approach.
In the event of a qualified majority in Council, it has previously been the practice for the Commission not to insist on a unanimous vote unless there are legal difficulties, but, in this instance, there is no sound reason to insist on unanimity.
The Commission's instruments are perfectly adequate for the purpose of monitoring this sector, in which no distortions of competition occur.
Not one of the candidate countries wants to adopt or copy the German model which is the subject of this dispute.
If the Commission holds fast to its legal position, then I appeal in equally urgent terms to the Spanish President of the Council.
When it comes to the interests of German distillers and the interests of our cultural landscape, I appeal to Mrs KÃŒnast, the German Federal Minister for Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, to vote on 27 June in such a way as to achieve unanimity in this matter.
Throughout long negotiations, Parliament has done everything in its power, and now we are counting on your support.
Mr President, because of the various discussions that have taken place the rapporteur has had an unusually long time to work on this report and she is to be warmly thanked for the efforts that she has made.
I was interested to discover that the United Kingdom appears to be the second largest producer of ethyl alcohol and, along with other producers, is of course concerned at increasing imports but rather static Community demand.
We know that imports into the Community have tariff concessions which have been agreed by the Council of Ministers.
The industry tells me that there are subsidy regimes in the exporting countries which naturally they do not view very favourably.
Our producers are also concerned about the prospect of duty-free entry from the 48 least-developed countries.
We understand these concerns, but I do not believe that removing the prohibition on state aid provisions, which are provided for in Amendments Nos 7 and 19, is a solution to the problem.
I would certainly hope that these will be opposed and I will be voting against them.
On the positive side, the specific measures proposed by the Commission are welcome.
They are certainly preferable to an interventionist organisation and I welcome the change in nomenclature that the rapporteur has introduced.
I hope that the provisions are non-discriminatory, that they will provide for the continuance of the trade without any great hindrance, and that our competitiveness will not be too much affected by imports.
The proposals do involve a minimum degree of administration and documentation.
I hope that Parliament will reject Amendments Nos 7 and 19, in which case I will be able to support the report.
I cannot say that this is the view of all the Members of the PSE Group, but it is certainly the view of some of us.
Mr President, may I begin by thanking the Members of this Parliament for the work they have put into considering the proposal for a common market organisation for alcohol.
In particular my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez, for her analysis of the proposal and the report.
Before I comment in more detail on the amendments proposed, I would remind you that this is another proposal to establish a set of common rules for the alcohol sector after several attempts in the past, all of which failed for various reasons.
The Commission is of the opinion that the actual market situation in this sector makes it necessary to propose at least a minimal set of rules and that, accordingly, the chances of success this time are fairly good.
Most of the amendments proposed can be accepted by the Commission.
All amendments relating to the change of title are acceptable.
