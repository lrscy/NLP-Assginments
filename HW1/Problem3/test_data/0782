It is important that the European Employment Strategy be coordinated with national employment policies.
In this connection, the parliaments are a key factor, because they allocate the budgets for the national employment strategies.
I think that it was good, therefore, that Mr Hjort Frederiksen, as well as the Commission, emphasised the role of the parliaments.
I should, however, like a clarification.
It is good that the parliaments are to play a greater role.
Is there a firm commitment for them to hold debates and for them to take decisions?
As we know, the parliaments do take decisions on national employment strategies.
Is there another, different, European employment strategy which the parliaments should not be allowed to take decisions on?
That is a practical question.
I also want to bring up something Mrs Diamantopoulou said, which I had heard earlier; that is, the meaning of stability as far as the guidelines are concerned.
I can understand this wish for stability, and I fully share the view that there must be stability in the goals.
The guidelines also speak of the means, however, and I am slightly more doubtful about the contention that the means must be just as stable.
I believe that we must keep a grip on reality and focus on what is tangible.
May I say by way of conclusion that both the enlargement process, with its very particular problems for the candidate countries, and the recent rise in unemployment present new challenges which demand a sense of reality.
It must not then be said that the means have to be extremely stable and unchanging year by year.
Mr President, I welcome Mr Frederiksen and Mrs Diamantopoulou.
I shall keep my comments brief, for small groups have little speaking time.
I thank our fellow MEPs Mrs Bastos and Mr Bushill-Matthews for their contributions.
I should like to outline a number of key areas.
We are discussing the revision of the employment strategy. If we look at the current guidelines, and the priorities as they are at present formulated, then it is clear that the employment strategy has, in fact, partly been overtaken by the Lisbon process, and the Lisbon process, has, in turn, been overtaken by an economic downturn.
This means that a great number of things are actually in the balance.
Labour participation targets are probably not realistic; there is no employment; it is only possible to offer incentives if employment is on offer and if the offer of employment is promoted.
The question is, however, whether we are always able to do this.
I am very interested to find out about these new guidelines and also very interested to see what we can get rid of.
How can we sum this up?
I can understand that things are different for youth unemployment, but a number of other types of work, such as jobs for the elderly, cannot always be promoted.
I welcome new guidelines and do not believe there is always a need for pillars.
These guidelines should, however, be clear and simple, just like the new relationship with ESF and the funds.
With regard to streamlining, I actually endorse Mr Pronk's view on this, namely that streamlining and integration are closely connected.
If we talk about integration, we should also take account of the economic and socio-economic policy aspects in the re-assessment of what we refer to as the social and employment policy.
Finally, I would ask the Commissioner or the Council why the Social Security Directive has not, to date, been reviewed.
I have seen the annotated agenda and cannot make out any progress. I wonder when this will happen when we talk about flexibility on the one hand and social security on the other.
Commissioner, I feel that there is not much point in constantly referring back to the Lisbon objectives if our goal is to define at European level and, most importantly, at national level, action plans and legislative measures to create an environment which will encourage firms' competitiveness, particularly in this period, and thus create the right conditions for high-quality employment.
In my opinion, there are a number of things we should do - and we can choose whether or not to do them - at national level.
Here are a few considerations. I feel, for example, that the constant focus on the action of the social partners is not just excessive but is in danger of leading us along a path which will increase the rigidity of the labour market, the path of protecting workers and firms that are already part of the production cycle and providing them with guarantees, safeguards and opportunities, in other words protecting those inside the labour market and the economy and thus creating greater barriers for those outside the market, those who need it most, those who are seeking work.
As regards intracommunity mobility - and I feel this is an important goal - I believe that we must concentrate on creating the right conditions for effective access to this mobility.
I would point out, however, that there are mobility problems within the Community and within the individual countries, and I am thinking here of Italy, for example, where there is extremely little, if any, labour mobility within the country because of labour market legislation, because of national collective agreements - and I hope that nobody is going to propose European collective agreements for the different sectors of the labour market - agreements which do not recognise specific situations or even the different benefits that the individual areas might present for an efficient labour market; we therefore need to create worker mobility but also investment mobility.
Another aspect of the same subject is the mobility of professional labour and professional categories of workers.
Many countries such as Italy have a corporative system for regulating the professions, which makes access impossible since the partners would be bound to the corporations and creates a legislative barrier to mobility, for example to access in Italy for those who wish to exercise some of the most important liberal professions.
I believe that we must reflect on this issue, and we must also reflect on the fact that it might be better for Europe to concentrate on the need for a constant increase in the role of the social partners rather than trying to introduce the most effective market rules possible.
Madam President, Commissioner, whether we like it or not, today's debate is being held in negatively-charged times, what with the economy in recession and the threat of war with Iraq, which was the subject of the previous debate.
As employment statistics show, labour market reforms have not, unfortunately, been strong enough to create the sort of momentum which translates into new jobs, to the point that, even in countries such as Greece which has growth of around 4%, unemployment is still a problem.
This means that growth does not always bring jobs, mainly due to weaknesses and rigidity on the labour market, such as the difficulty young people and women have accessing the labour market, the mismatch between the demands of the labour market and the skills of graduates of our educational establishments and the survival in numerous areas of the Union of anachronistic and outdated perceptions of work and the value of women's work.
The new generation of guidelines on employment you referred to, Commissioner, need to take account of the fact that the labour market is still, unfortunately, split along the gender divide, that women earn less than men, that only 25% of companies are owned by women and that the glass ceiling is still very firmly in place.
I think that quality of work, which is the core concept of the guidelines, sustainable development and individualised rights may well be the driving force behind longer careers for women and I should also like to stress, as Mrs Evans said on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, that the new employment strategy should be predicated on mainstreaming.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Council and the Commissioner for their words and, of course, congratulating the rapporteurs, Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Bastos.
Chapter II of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, entitled 'Freedoms', in Article 15, tells us that 'Every citizen of the Union has the freedom to seek employment, to work, to exercise the right of establishment and to provide services in any Member State'.
I believe that this article should be promoted to the category of a fundamental right in terms of the free movement of services and persons.
However, there are still many obstacles to the mobility of the workforce, qualified or non-qualified, between the Member States, which prevents us from having European labour markets open to all and, probably, as a logical consequence of this, causes territorial imbalances and situations of injustice, social exclusion or poverty.
These are all obstacles to the achievement of the objective set at the Lisbon European Council and ratified at the Barcelona European Council.
The European Union must become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, accompanied by more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
Hence the need to modify and simplify social security systems and enshrine the principle of the transferability of supplementary pension rights. It would be appropriate, and perhaps necessary, to create a mobility plan which has a real effective impact on the lives of the citizens, and mainly in specific regions such as cross-border areas, with the involvement of the local authorities, reinforcing the local dimension of employment.
This impact must also be felt in specific material areas and areas of competence, such as the service economy and the environment and of course, with the participation of social agents, in a fluid and easy communication between the professional and educational sectors, taking particular account of the importance of training and education systems in relation to the development of a culture of mobility, creating horizontal policies, such as policies on equality and others, because the different options are not exclusive and self-contained compartments, but part of a whole, a series of actions intended to develop the European social model and realise the principles that certain visionaries - I say this with respect - perceived more than 50 years ago.
At the end of the day, as the Commissioner has said, it is a question of those who want to move around throughout the European Union being able to do so.
Madam President, allow me first to address a query to Mr Frederiksen, who chaired his first Social Affairs Council yesterday.
I have been informed, to my great surprise, that it was impossible to reach agreement on the tripartite social dialogue summit during that meeting, and in my view, one of the very things that are important in the employment strategy and that we must try to promote is to involve the social partners in this employment strategy based on their responsibility in wage-base determination and working conditions policy.
I should like to express my great astonishment and sadness at this and ask him why no agreement could be reached.
I should like to make two comments on the report by Mr Bushill-Matthews, who has for the second time drafted a report of this kind on this annual report and whose shadow rapporteur I have now been for the second time.
I am also a little surprised at the fact that the report features on the agenda of this plenary meeting, since we tried very hard to reach agreement within the committee on a number of important points.
I have two observations to make in this connection.
Firstly, with regard to the JEVs, that is, the joint ventures with the accession countries, I fully endorse what Mrs Gill has said on the subject, namely that it is important to analyse carefully why that project is running so badly, whether this is indeed due to the publicity, the bureaucracy and long-winded administrative procedures, and whether it is not regrettable to mess up a project of this kind if there is a possibility that the procedures might be improved.
I should like to ask the Commission to pay particular attention to matters of this kind during this assessment, because I believe that it could in itself present a very important opportunity to promote entrepreneurship and cooperation.
My final point concerns Mr Bushill-Matthews' report.
I should like to briefly draw attention to the request that has also been included in his report to obtain a report from the Commission about corporate social responsibility and the SME.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the two items on today's agenda, the action plan on mobility and assistance for innovative small and medium-sized enterprises, are instrumental in invigorating the economy, increasing employment and achieving economic and social cohesion in the European Union, especially with enlargement imminent, which is why I welcome the European Commission's initiatives and the input from our rapporteurs.
I should like to comment on the question of mobility, which is very limited - the statistics have already been quoted and there is no need to repeat them.
I merely want to point out that this abysmal state of affairs is not just a weakness in the market.
It is illustrative of the weaknesses and difficulties inherent in European unification.
It is a complex issue to do with education, vocational training, social insurance, taxation and, of course, language skills.
So we have our work cut out in all sectors and at all levels; at national level, where we need to coordinate and mobilise central policies, the social partners and local policies on employment, and at European level, where we need constant coordination and initiative.
At both levels we need to set clear targets and timetables, as the rapporteur has pointed out and, more to the point, we need policies which are coordinated without overlapping.
I would also suggest that we need to make use of important instruments for finding innovative ways of promoting mobility, such as Article 6 of the European Social Fund.
In its resolution, the European Parliament calls on the European Commission to take account of this need and of the facility to reset priorities.
Finally, a few words on higher education.
The ERASMUS programme, which has already been mentioned, and the figure of one million students moving round Europe do not add up to a serious endeavour to increase the cross-cultural dimension of education and to familiarise students with educational systems and prepare them to become mobile European workers.
They need to be prepared at all stages of their education and we need to make it easier for students to move from one university to another.
One study, albeit somewhat superficial, of the differences between the systems and the lack of reception facilities for students moving from one university to another illustrates quite clearly that the borders to education have yet to fall and that this is an area on which we need to bring initiative and daring to bear.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Bastos' excellent report highlights the dual necessity to integrate Eures into the Member States' employment services and to involve local authorities and the social partners in the activities of Eures so as to bring about ever-increasing decentralisation of labour mobility initiatives.
It will thus be possible to enhance and extend cross-border cooperation in training, the recognition of qualifications and the protection of pension rights, to which the social partners have made a decisive contribution with the promotion by Eures of at least 39 interregional trade union councils in the territories bordering on the States of Europe.
This experience must be exploited and must certainly not go to waste, which is what would happen if the interregional trade union councils were detached from Eures and their existence and the funding of their activities somehow made dependent on the goodwill of each individual Union State, as would appear to be the intention of the Commission.
The need for greater involvement of the Member States in the funding and running of Eures and the associated structures is certainly something we support, but the form and extent of this involvement can only be defined at Community level and involve all the Member States jointly and severally: in other words, it must not lead to the Commission casting off its responsibility for the running or even the continued existence of the interregional trade union councils.
We have therefore tabled an amendment before the House with the consent of the rapporteur, Mrs Bastos, which proposes that the Commission and the Council be asked for reassurance on this point.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Bastos on this exhaustive report on a subject - mobility - which is so important, so crucial for a Europe which is hoping to achieve greater competitiveness through the creation of new, higher-quality jobs.
I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Commission's Action Plan, which contains practical measures for creating a more favourable environment for the European labour market by 2005, making it more open and accessible for all.
I am pleased to find included a number of recommendations which I and Mr Evans made two years ago in our report on mobility within the Community, in particular the mobility of students, people undergoing training and people doing voluntary work as well as teachers and researchers.
Then, last but certainly not least, there is a special section which deals with the mobility of people with disabilities.
We need to go further, however.
If, indeed, we want a Europe with more and higher-quality jobs, with greater social cohesion - in other words, if we want to achieve the ambitious but necessary Lisbon objectives - it is essential that we continue to concentrate on eliminating once and for all those barriers which still exist, restricting the professional and geographical mobility of the European citizens and, indeed, limiting their potential.
We cannot afford to let this absurd situation continue any longer. It is easier for money, goods and services to move within the European Union than the European citizens themselves.
Consider the strategic role of the local authorities, the opportunities provided by teleworking and the need to modernise and fully exploit the potential of the Eures system. This is something I stressed in my report on the Sixth Framework-Programme for Research too.
We therefore need to update and simplify coordination of social security once and for all, speed up revision of Regulation No 1408/71 and address and resolve together the complex issue of supplementary pensions.
A key issue, then, which Mr ZappalÃ  is currently addressing in committee, is that of academic and vocational qualifications and the mutual recognition thereof. We must, at last, achieve that European area of qualifications which will complete the reform of the internal market, increasing mobility between the different Member States of the Union considerably.
I should like to express my thanks for the many sound contributions during this debate.
I agree with Commissioner Diamantopoulou that, following yesterday's Council meeting, we now have a common platform for revising the Common Employment Strategy.
I also agree that we must use this platform as the basis for a broad debate on future employment in the EU.
Let there be no doubt that the debate is open to all players and that the role of the European Parliament in this debate is absolutely crucial.
I should also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his observations to the effect that we must create jobs in practice.
It is in this area that the European Employment Strategy must be put to the test and demonstrate its worth.
I should also like to express my thanks for the many practical proposals contributed by Mr Bushill-Matthews for promoting employment in Europe and increasing flexibility in the European labour markets.
I am also keen to stress, as several other speakers have done, that the two sides of industry must take an active part in the process.
They must feel that they own the process and so feel an obligation to participate.
I know that the basic conditions for doing so vary from one Member State to another, but it is on a day-to-day basis that the results are to be achieved, and I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament are emphasising this.
I think I have unfortunately to say to Mrs van den Burg that she has misunderstood the outcome of yesterday's Council meeting.
I agree completely that the social dialogue and the tripartite summit are important, which is why we scheduled these matters for discussion over lunch at yesterday's Council meeting, where it was agreed that we should establish a tripartite social dialogue summit.
We shall therefore try to have this endorsed at the next Council meeting.
I should like to say to Mr Herman Schmid that, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot at this time present practical models for closer cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, but we look forward to hearing this matter discussed and to having the practical options and proposals on the table over the next few months.
I want to say to Mr Bouwman that we in the Council should very much like to see the various socio-political directives revised.
One of the things I would point out is that the current modernisation of EEC Regulation 1408/71 on social security schemes for employed persons moving within the Community is on the agenda of the Council's December meeting.
I should also like to thank Mr Andersson for his contribution.
We are in complete agreement on a great many matters.
We must be focused in our approach and see to it that matters are implemented in such a way that there is democratic scrutiny of all our efforts.
I should again like to emphasise that, for the people of Europe, it is the results that count.
When all is said and done, an increase in prosperity is conditional upon those who are unemployed obtaining jobs.
People must get off passive welfare and into work.
New jobs must be created, and the business climate must promote the creation of new, and more, jobs.
That is, and remains, the main task.
We must debate the future Employment Strategy now and over the next few months and, as Mr Herman Schmid stated, we must arrange for the national strategies to fit in with the European strategies, for it is in this area that we can reap the considerable benefits of our combined efforts to promote employment.
I would thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is a joint debate on:
? Recommendation (A5-0299/2002) by Mr Obiols i GermÃ , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States of the one part, and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria of the other part (10819/2002 - C5-0362/2002 - 2002/0077(AVC)), and
? oral questions (B5-0255/2002 and B5-0256/2002) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council and Commission, on the conclusion of an association agreement with Algeria.
Madam President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Cohn-Bendit, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to table the question here and also to make a number of comments on behalf of our rapporteur - if he is not here - on the conclusion of an association agreement with Algeria.
The Committee on Foreign Affairs did not make things easy for itself in this respect.
We therefore also postponed our decision until we were able to hold a discussion with the Algerian Foreign Minister, to whom we put questions on a wide range of issues, notably concerning compliance with key aspects of this agreement and especially the clauses on human rights and democracy.
This is also an important question for the Council and the Commission.
How much confidence is there that these provisions will be complied with?
Under Article 2 of the agreement, and with the involvement of this Parliament, it should after all be guaranteed that importance is attached in future to ensuring that such clauses do not simply remain abstract elements of these agreements but form part of an operational policy designed to make sure that appropriate developments genuinely take place in such countries.
I believe that it is in our common interest that we should have peaceful and democratic development, based on the rule of law, throughout the Mediterranean region, and therefore also in Algeria.
This is why it is right for these relations to be developed in order to enforce such positions.
In this context, the Council and the Commission must use all the instruments to ensure that the death penalty is abolished, that genuine cooperation is established in the fight against terrorism, and that progress is made on issues relating to decentralised decision-making structures, taking account of the different conditions within the country, and in particular, to ensure that progress is made on economic and social development which deprives terrorism of its breeding-ground.
I believe that these are key tasks, which should be tackled on the basis of this agreement so that it can become a genuinely useful instrument.
In this context, it is naturally also of interest to us to find out, in view of the European Union's policies, to what extent free movement of persons can genuinely be developed in this area, and, furthermore, how issues such as asylum policy can be dealt with.
In particular, of course, we are keen to hear why inter-parliamentary relations do not merit a single mention in this new agreement.
I believe that if we wish to promote democratic development in any country, it is extremely important to support parliamentary developments in an appropriate way in order, on the basis of inter-parliamentary dialogue, to set in train a mutual learning process and strengthen a country's democratic development.
I would be pleased if the Council and Commission could answer this question.
In particular, I am interested in hearing how the current Treaty can be used to promote this development, irrespective of what the Treaty says.
For these reasons, I would like to ask everyone to vote for this agreement.
In line with the resolutions which we have tabled in this House, however, we intend to monitor the implementation of this agreement on an ongoing basis and look very carefully at what you, the Council and the Commission, are doing, so that we ensure that our notions of democracy and human rights, as well as the joint campaign against terrorism, can flow into a progressively positive common policy.
On this, I ask for your support!
Madam President, this Parliament has a long history of activities and relations with Algeria which have always been based on clarity, respect and friendship as well as a sense of shared interest.
In the past, this Parliament has on several occasions vigorously condemned the terrorist attacks and violence in Algeria; it has encouraged attempts to achieve peace and harmony and full democracy through dialogue between all the social and democratic forces; whenever it has considered it necessary, it has condemned violations of human rights in Algeria, of whatever kind, and has supported the increasing vitality of Algerian civil society and its democratic forces; it has urged the Algerian authorities to guarantee that the press remains free, as one of their most positive national assets; it has supported the attitude of the Algerian authorities in favour of economic transition, the renegotiation of debt, the stimulation of internal economic investment and external investment, and has expressed the need, on the one hand, for an open and transparent economy with solid and autonomous institutions, as a basis for the economic and social development of the country and, on the other, for a full democratic transition, essential elements of which would be peace and full respect for human rights.
The Algerian crisis is partly the result of the events of 1991, of continued intermittent terrorism which has led to a civil confrontation which has probably caused a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand deaths in Algeria.
It would be a mistake, however, from our European perspective, to see the Algerian crisis solely as the result of the horrendous terrorism that has taken place in that country.
In fact, there are fundamental democratic issues and also, above all, problems resulting from the economic and social situation.
Europe needs Algeria for its creation of a Euro-Mediterranean partnership that turns our southern flank into an area of stability, peace and shared progress in which there is convergence between the economic and social situations of the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean.
Algeria also needs Europe.
Three and a half million Algerians live in the countries of the European Union and, from all points of view, the link between Europe and Algeria must be reinforced by means of an approach involving, on the one hand, a social and economic development objective based on the partnership, but also cooperation in the difficult tasks of achieving peace in Algeria, the eradication of terrorism and all types of violence and the full establishment of civil liberties and human rights.
I believe that the conclusion of the Association agreement between the European Union and Algeria deserves the full, and possibly unanimous, support of this Parliament.
The Association agreement must be a basic instrument to guarantee cooperation in essential areas of economic and social development in Algeria, but also an instrument available to us which we must be able to use, without interference but firmly, to achieve the greatest possible influence on the development of this great country towards peace, harmony amongst its citizens, the eradication of terrorism and all types of violence, the affirmation of human rights and progress in the civil and democratic field.
Madam President, might I be permitted to emphasise that the signing of the association agreement really has signified a turning point and opened a new chapter in our relations with Algeria.
It is the Council's view that the signing of this agreement clearly shows that, in order to stimulate trade and investment, the Algerian authorities have a desire to maintain and step up their efforts on behalf of the necessary reform process.
That ought also to find expression in political and social reforms.
A clear signal is also being sent to investors to the effect that Algeria undertakes to create a constructive environment for international enterprises.
It is primarily a question of intergovernmental relations, but the agreement also provides a framework for the commercial world and civil society.
The agreement is also of significance for the EU's entire Mediterranean policy, and it is a further step towards setting up a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area.
The purpose of the agreement is also to promote that sub-regional cooperation between the Mediterranean partners themselves that is so important to a positive outcome of the Barcelona process.
The association agreement contains an article on the movement of persons, and the EU has in this way pledged to look into the possibility of simplifying and speeding up the procedures for issuing visas to certain persons.
This provision must find expression in the implementation rules for the agreement.
Once the agreement has come into force, the bodies set up under it will have to investigate how it will be possible to implement this pledge concerning visas, taking account of course of the EU's policy at the relevant time.
With regard to respect for human rights, the Council is monitoring very carefully the issues relating to respect for human rights in Algeria, and specifically within the political dialogue with Algeria that has taken place at ministerial level since 1997.
In this way, the Council, which is represented in the troika, is given the opportunity regularly to address these issues and vigorously to emphasise that there must be no violation or abuse of human rights, including in connection with combating terrorism.
The association agreement will now provide greater opportunities for following up this issue and for supporting the Algerian authorities in this connection.
I would point out that, as is well known, the agreement makes respect for human rights an essential feature forming the basis of the parties' external and internal policies.
It also provides an institutional framework for regular political dialogue at different levels, and specifically at Association Council level, concerning all subjects of common interest.
As long as respect for human rights is a problem in Algeria, the issue will be on the agendas of the joint meetings.
As soon as the agreement has come into force, that will apply both to the political dialogue, established in 1997, and to the bodies concerned with the agreement, namely the Association Council and the Association Committee.
The Council does not intend to take any steps concerning the situation in Kabylia, for it regards the matter as being in the first place an internal Algerian issue.
However, the Council looks favourably upon the important decision taken recently to give the Tamazight language the status of a national language.
In June 2001, the Gothenburg European Council made it an urgent matter generally to call upon all those in responsible positions in Algeria to make efforts to bring the present confrontations and violence to an end.
It encouraged the authorities to launch a political initiative to solve the crisis with the aid of dialogue between all Algerians.
The situation remains difficult and complex, however, as may be seen from the low turnout at the parliamentary election on 30 May 2002.
The October local elections will also be able to provide an important indication of the situation in the region.
Improvement at the socio-economic level would aid the search for a solution, and we have every desire to help with the efforts aimed at economic reforms.
We are supporting these by means of the Meda Regulation, providing EUR 240 million for the period 2000-2004, and by means of the loans from the European Investment Bank, amounting to EUR 620 million since 1996.
Once it has been put in place, the new investment facility should also contribute to improving the economic situation in Algeria.
According to the association agreement, the Association Council can facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and Algeria's parliamentary institutions, as well as between the Economic and Social Committee and the corresponding body in Algeria.
I should like to emphasise that the Council takes a positive view of the conclusions of the latest meeting of the parliamentary Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, emphasising the parliamentary dimension of our partnership with the southern Mediterranean countries.
We are in the process of looking into which cooperation mechanisms can be used for setting up such a Euro-Mediterranean assembly.
Madam President, the agreement signed by the European Union and Algeria marks the start of a new era in relations between us, and as Mr Brok quite rightly says, Algeria needs Europe and Europe needs Algeria within the context of Euro-Mediterranean collaboration.
I should like to comment on three important points, in reply to the issues raised by Mr Brok.
The first relates to the economic and political reforms which this agreement may help, the second relates to people's freedom of movement and the third relates to human rights.
On the first point, from a political point of view, Algeria decided in 1989 to adopt a constitution allowing a multi-party system.
At present, democracy is not very well grounded, with political life segregated from civil society.
Algeria has a duty to improve the situation and, more to the point, to ensure that there is a genuine division between the executive, legislative and judicial powers and transparent ballot counts.
The political dialogue for which provision is made in the association agreement will provide a valuable framework for exchanging opinions and experience on this issue.
From an economic point of view, the association agreement allows for the gradual introduction of a single free trade area between Algeria and the European Union and challenges the Algerian Government to make the necessary reforms.
As stressed in the resolution, it will have to start by satisfying certain basic needs of the people, such as running water, housing and medical care, otherwise it will clearly be unable to push ahead with other reforms because it will not have the consent of the people.
Similarly, it needs to move and facilitate the move from the present planned economy to a free-market economy.
This reform was overdue in Algeria anyway, because the suffocating planned economy had reached its limits.
But now it has an opportunity, helped by this agreement, to adopt economic reforms which, basically, will rectify economic distortions and social inequalities.
The transition to a free-market economy will require consultations with business associations, with the trades union, and will need to focus on improving the legal framework for business and investment activities, reforming the banking system and stamping out corruption.
The government recently approved a 7 billion dollar programme along these lines, which covers a great many of these issues.
Again, the aid provided by the European Union under the MEDA programme will supplement this programme, given its three basic objectives of: one, strengthening the market economy; two, developing human resources, and three, consolidating the rule of law and satisfying certain requirements.
The second point concerns the free movement of persons.
Under the agreement, the European Union is charged with finding ways of simplifying the visa procedure, as Mr Frederiksen mentioned, especially for the people involved in implementing it.
This is a reasonable request on the Algerian side.
The association agreement cannot concern itself merely with the setting up of a free trade zone; it must also make it easier for people to travel in both directions.
I should point out that this endeavour relates to legal movements and in no way contradicts the Seville conclusions on stopping illegal immigration.
The agreement signed is completely in line with the Seville guidelines making provision for specific collaboration on illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants.
The third issue is the human rights clause, which is fundamental to the association procedure.
The Commission acknowledges that Algeria has experienced tragic terrorist activity over the past ten years and we are giving the Algerian Government all the support we can in its fight against terrorism; but we also believe that the fight against terrorism is no excuse whatsoever for trampling over fundamental freedoms.
The link to the Barcelona process implies a joint commitment to comply with certain basic democratic rules and values.
Our main concern in this area is for those whose whereabouts are unknown; there are serious obstacles which need to be overcome both by their families and by non-governmental organisations, who frequently encounter delaying tactics on the part of the authorities.
I think that the application of the human rights clause can be dealt with both adjectivally and substantially.
Adjectivally through political dialogue, which needs to be predicated on human rights, and substantially, I would say, by the European Union by using a clearer and more substantive language with fewer evasions.
One item on the agenda for political dialogue is the question of Kabylie.
We are hoping to inaugurate a dialogue with representative agencies and we welcome the conciliatory approach taken recently on the question of the official recognition of Tamazight as a national language.
The European Parliament is willing, as it has already stated, to foster dialogue with the Algerian parliament and this will be vital to exchanges of information, common positions and the interests of both sides.
Contrary to what is stated in the motion for a resolution, the importance of this is clearly stated in Article 99 of the agreement and the Commission will do its utmost to facilitate this sort of dialogue.
On a more general note, the Commission wholeheartedly supports Parliament's approval of this association agreement, which must not under any circumstances be seen as a blank cheque for the Algerian Government; it is a way of encouraging it to continue with the political, economic and social reforms it has started, basically in order to better the lot of the Algerian people.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when giving our opinion, according to the recommendations of Mr Obiols, with regard to the proposal for an association agreement with the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, through the intermediary of its Chairman, Mr Brok, and with the agreement of its bureau, considered it necessary to open the debate that has brought us here today and which will be followed, tomorrow, by the adoption of a resolution that I hope will be voted for by a very large majority of this House.
This step, which, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, has just enabled us to obtain the answers we were waiting for in response to our main questions, must in no way be interpreted as an attempt to interfere in Algeria's domestic affairs, particularly as a mark of disrespect towards Algerian culture and identity.
On the contrary, it falls within the scope of Parliament's commitment, recalled here by Mr Obiols, to establishing a privileged partnership with the Maghreb countries based on mutual respect and increased awareness of our common destiny.
That was the aim of the own-initiative report on the Arab Maghreb Union, for which Mr Cohn-Bendit and I were co-rapporteurs, which was adopted by a very large majority in this House before the summer.
With regard to this debate, I would now like to emphasise three points that have already been partially raised.
The first is that timetabling clashes mean we are delivering our opinion on the same day that local elections, which are crucial for the future, are taking place in Algeria as you mentioned, President-in-Office of the Council.
We must hope that these elections contribute to achieving peace, and do not, as some fear today, particularly in Kabylia, give rise to further outbreaks of violence which would serve as pretexts for further repression.
The second point is that, among the anticipated consequences of the conclusion of this agreement, we firmly hope that aid from the European Union will provide a solution to one of the main difficulties in this country, namely the problem of youth unemployment and the resulting frustrations.
In this regard, President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the need to increase investment and you invited Europeans to invest.
In fact, we believe that this is one of the very important areas in which the agreement should allow us to demonstrate our commitment.
Today, however, we draw the attention of the Algerian authorities to the fact that, for European investors, the formalities that must currently be fulfilled with a view to approval are probably a little too bureaucratic and can sometimes be discouraging.
I have already said this to our Algerian counterparts when I met them last week, but I would like to repeat it today.
The third point is that we must hope this agreement will help to develop and strengthen regional cooperation - and you mentioned that as well, President-in-Office of the Council - and that it will therefore contribute to kick-starting the process of constituting the Arab Maghreb Union, a process which today is unfortunately at a standstill in the absence of any prospect of a political solution to the problem of the Western Sahara.
Also on this point, I believe it would be useful to ask the Algerian authorities to pay the utmost attention to finding a solution that allows all the parties concerned to save face, by means, naturally, of the necessary compromises.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain indifferent in the face of the current situation in Algeria.
On the contrary, it should make us more committed to making a clear assessment of the current state of the country and to helping the Algerian people to overcome their difficulties.
That is why I am giving my full support to the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement that has been presented to us for our agreement today.
I believe it is along the right lines for four main reasons.
This is part of the very rationale behind the process opened in Barcelona, encouraging Euro-Mediterranean dialogue.
This agreement will facilitate regional integration and in particular the Arab Maghreb Union, which we are hoping for with all our might.
This agreement sends a strong signal of the solidarity of European citizens with the Algerian people.
And in particular, this agreement should support Algeria in its efforts to achieve openness, reforms and modernisation.
That is the most important thing.
In this context, I am pleased to see the broad consensus within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in favour of the proposed measures.
Nevertheless, our agreement must not be interpreted as giving the Algerian authorities carte blanche.
We must remain vigilant on the subject of human rights, democracy and good governance.
These fundamental values are the very cornerstone of the European Union and must be respected as a prerequisite for the correct implementation of the agreement.
That is why Parliament's motion for a resolution, which recalls these requirements, is along the right lines and should be given the utmost consideration.
Please allow me to add that, as a Frenchwoman, I am particularly aware of the difficulties that the Algerian people has suffered for so long.
The suffering of this country has gone on long enough.
We all need to take urgent action to find concrete solutions.
The association agreement will contribute to this if we are able to give objective consideration to Algeria's real problems.
Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we have discussed this matter for quite some time in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, with reports and hearings.
Most of us have also had bilateral contact with a number of representatives of Algeria.
We have done all of this not only because we take this issue seriously, but also because there are many issues concerning Algeria which need to be dealt with.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is particularly concerned about the human rights situation.
We know that serious human rights violations are being committed in Algeria.
Torture and persecution of opponents are unfortunately not unusual, and there are many reports of abuses by military and paramilitary groups.
Thousands of citizens have disappeared, and it is worrying that the Algerian authorities have not permitted UN observers to investigate this situation.
The situation in Kabylia is still desperate, and peaceful demonstrators have been killed.
Much remains to be done in Algeria in the domains of freedom of the press, freedom of association and the establishment of the rule of law.
The country also has a terrorism problem.
These issues are described very well and in great detail in Mr Brok's resolution.
It also points out the need for a regular follow-up of the way in which human rights are being observed, for scrutiny and for interparliamentary dialogue.
The Liberal Group has made constructive efforts to contribute to this resolution.
It is therefore with some surprise and disappointment that we note that the Christian Democrats have put forward a number of amendments which considerably dilute the resolution.
If these amendments are adopted, we believe that the resolution will not have the required force or constitute the complement to the recommendation by Mr Obiols i GermÃ  that is so important.
The Liberal Group would vote against the resolution.
It would be a shame if these points disappeared, because it is very important to put pressure on the Algerian Government.
The association agreement is important for Algeria.
In spite of the agreement's shortcomings, we believe that Europe has to help Algeria to build up its economic, political and democratic institutions.
As has been pointed out, the agreement constitutes an extremely important part of the Barcelona process.
Madam President, by way of conclusion I wish to address a few words to the Commission.
What is the significance of Article 2 of the association agreement: the human rights clause?
We have discussed it many, many times, but it has never been acted upon.
What is so terribly difficult about finding mechanisms for temporarily or, if necessary, permanently breaking off cooperation, with reference to Article 2, when serious human rights violations are carried out?
If we do not lead from the front on this issue, we will actually make ourselves look ridiculous, and we risk not being taken seriously in the field of foreign policy.
If so, all our talk of a human rights dimension in foreign policy will be nothing but resoundingly empty words.
Madam President, I say 'yes' to strong links between Europe and Algeria.
The Algerians are practically alone in having suffered the barbarity of fundamentalist terrorism since before 11 September 2001.
The European Union, for its part, must strengthen its links with the southern Mediterranean basin by freeing itself from its ideas of domination.
This would be one way of countering the unilateralism of an American superpower that is more and more interested in Algeria and the wealth that lies beneath it.
Although the association agreement shows the will to establish privileged links between the Union and Algeria, it also raises questions, starting with the lack of prior consultation, as denounced by Algerian independent trade unions and associations.
Our resolution rightly emphasises human rights first and foremost, and the resolution must keep this aspect.
Like others, I in turn would like to express my concern over the situation in Kabylia, where tomorrow's local elections are already marked by calls for a boycott, for strikes and for the police to take control.
Why has no credible solution for overcoming this crisis been put forward by the Algerian Government?
Why have no legal proceedings commenced against those responsible for the oppression perpetrated in what has become known as the 'black spring of 2001'?
When will lawsuits cease against representatives of the citizens' movement?
Most of all, are these not signs of a deep malaise within Algerian society as a whole, but in particular among young people?
The increasing number of lawsuits against journalists and the persistent refusal to repeal the family code, problems over which, to my great surprise, some Members wish to draw a veil in the resolution, can only stir up despair and tension.
The future of Algeria, however, would be more secure under the existing potential for democracy than under a new resurgence of fundamentalist ideas.
I also believe it is important to take account of urgent social issues.
There is a tremendous need in terms of employment, housing, public infrastructures for health, education and water, while inequality and foreign reserves have never been so high.
Unlike the rationale for free trade, which encourages liberalisation and deregulation, this situation, on the contrary, requires a true cooperation measure, for example in the field of public services.
Europe therefore has a responsibility.
Will the serious concerns of many players in the Algerian economy over the establishment of a free trade area be heard?
What will our assessment be of the economic, social and environmental consequences?
In conclusion, I would like to call for vigilance with regard to respect for the free movement of persons and equality of economic, social and political rights for Algerian nationals on European soil.
Madam President, of course this agreement is not the result of an extensive process of participation and negotiation between all the main players from both sides.
Consequently, it is what it is.
Our support, however, for the challenge of forging lasting political relations between both sides of the Mediterranean is unstinting, and we also hope that the Algerian crisis can emerge from behind closed doors where it has tragically played out for too long.
We would therefore like to take up the challenge of shared development.
Mr Morillon, I am going to put your mind at ease, please be reassured: we are not interfering when we talk of the democratic deficit and of the importance of supporting the development of freedom in this country.
The report of the Arab States office of the United Nations Development Programme says this itself.
It is therefore not a matter of interference at all.
Democracy is the foundation of development in all its forms.
However, in order to meet this challenge, in order to take up this challenge of shared development, we must begin by not adding confusion to the chaos in Algeria.
Certainly, this agreement must not give the authorities free rein.
In order to avoid this, it is necessary to very clearly acknowledge that, today, it is practically indecent to deny that the violence that has blighted Algeria for more than ten years is down to groups of all kinds, and when I say all kinds, clearly I am also talking about military security groups.
This has to be said!
Paramilitary groups.
This has to be written!
Mr Habib Souaidia, who is present here today along with other friends whom I would like to greet, was accused of slander by General Nezzar.
Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all.
The case brought by Mr Nezzar was thrown out.
Will we have just the merest fraction of the courage of this Algerian lieutenant?
I believe that we should start by acknowledging in our resolution the suffering and tragedy, the hundreds of thousands who have died and the thousands who have disappeared.
Secondly, our resolution must clearly call for the lifting of the state of emergency which is a real denial of freedom, and the public authorities with whom we negotiate, by declaring this state of emergency, have even let their prerogatives lapse, under the guise of military power.
How can we accept this?
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this association agreement with Algeria comes at the right time and I also believe that it has become urgent since Algeria is finally struggling to emerge from a lengthy dark period in which it has found itself as a result of an ongoing attempt to destabilise it, comparable to the situation affecting all oil-rich countries across the world.
A foreign, imperialist attack that, as elsewhere, used Islamic extremism for geopolitical ends, which we have been too short-sighted to see.
Mrs Boumediene-Thiery brought up the main issue a moment ago when she reminded us of the United States' desire to get its hands on Algeria's mineral resources.
The Algerian Government passed the test victorious in spite of its isolation and timidity, I would even say faintheartedness, for which European aid is chiefly to blame.
In order for this association to be successful, it must not be limited to good intentions, or just to vague, exclusively economic, free trade agreements.
It must also be a political association.
In other words, we must get used to addressing all global political issues together with our Mediterranean partners.
Furthermore, this is a prerequisite for the Mediterranean to remain at the centre of the world stage; unless this condition is met, we might become more African, Mediterranean or European, but have only a minor role to play in the twenty-first century world.
In order to achieve this, we must clearly go beyond a simple association agreement with Algeria, as with other Maghreb countries, which are our closest allies.
We need to alter the structure of Europe and leave behind any fantasies of supranationality and federalism so that we can include our Mediterranean neighbours in an expanded European Union, which will clearly make imperial powers see that they are up against a group of countries devoted to the preservation of liberty, that is to say ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, the association agreement concluded with Algeria really is a step in the right direction in Euro-Mediterranean relations and towards achieving our common objective, which is to create not just a free trade zone but an area of sustainable development, security and prosperity for all.
This being so, may I say how delighted I am that the agreement clearly refers to respect for fundamental human rights.
I am also delighted at the references to promoting the role of women in economic and social development through education, vocational training, better family planning programmes and the media.
What saddens me, however, is that these references alone will not promote respect for women's rights in practice and that no reference to this issue was made either by the President-in-Office or by you, Commissioner, who are a champion of women's rights and have nailed your flag to the mast of respect for the principle of equality in the Community's foreign relations.
I should like to remind you that, in its resolution on the report on respect for women's rights in Euro-Mediterranean relations, the European Parliament called for an express provision on protection for women's rights and, at the same time, called for provision to be made for a protection monitoring policy similar to that applied to candidate countries.
I should therefore like to take this opportunity to voice my disappointment, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, at the sidelining of this issue and to salute the Commissioner's words, her optimistic words, about the association agreement not being a blank cheque for Algeria.
We would like the European Commission to set up mechanisms to monitor and evaluate progress and for the Algerian Government to be required, as should happen with all association agreements, to demonstrate the necessary political will to bring about the legislative, administrative and other reforms needed in order to anchor equal opportunities between men and women in the law and include gender mainstreaming in all its policies.
In the same vein, we want to support Mr Brok's proposal on combating and condemning violence against women and, as condemnation never suffices, we want to impose a strategy inspired by the experience and successes of strategies in the European Union and the candidate countries to combat violence.
In the same vein, I should like to condemn the absence of the role of women and women's organisations from the proposed regional collaboration.
This, at the very least, is one area where provision should be made to strengthen civil society and work with women's organisations.
Madam President, I think that, this evening, we all welcome the fact that we have reached a key point in relations between the European Union and Algeria.
It is a key point because the situation in Algeria has been extraordinarily troubled for at least a decade. It has experienced, inter alia, a period of relative isolation in terms of international relations, particularly relations with Europe, not least in that there is a connection between Algeria and the African dimension and it is important that this aspect of relations is strengthened too.
I would like to place this report precisely in the context of the partnership.
The agreement is actually an instrument, it is not a concession granted by Europe, by the European Union, to Algeria, for we too benefit from the agreement - we must never forget that - and it is an instrument which unites, an instrument based on a vision of partnership.
What does this mean?
It means that we need to exploit all the possibilities, both as regards Algerian society - which we could say may be stifling both its economic potential and its human resources potential - and as regards ourselves.
I would like to draw the Commission's attention to a number of points.
You set great store by the Agadir process set up between the countries which have concluded association agreements with us.
You ought to focus equally on the Maghreb dimension of the partnership, for, as we all know, the borders are closed between Morocco and Algeria, and if Europe does not help to increase cooperation between neighbours I do not know what its mission is.
Lastly, I feel that it is important to place the emphasis on human rights - as other Members have done - and on the elections.
I would like to say to the Algerian authorities that something important is happening in Kabylia: a party which did not take part in the political elections has presented itself at the administrative elections.
This is important because it repairs a deep institutional divide which had become established.
We have witnessed a period when, for example, relations between the police and the people of Kabylia were non-existent.
It would be a shame if, during the elections, the police authorities were to create problems once again rather than protecting the people and assuring the smooth running of the electoral process, which is extremely important.
It is therefore absurd to make a comparison between Algeria and the candidate countries, for we are not granting Algeria accession to the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, let us be quite clear about that.
The greater the consideration that the Union gives to these countries, the greater the benefits it might derive from relations too.
Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President, I am happy to be closing this discussion.
I would just like to say to my good friend Philippe Morillon, 'Philippe, you are wrong.
All your amendments are misguided.
And I believe that you should think about them tonight and withdraw these amendments as soon as you wake up tomorrow.
Most of them have already been withdrawn?
Well then, withdraw the rest!
We will all be happy!'
Why?
Because it is obvious that we must exercise our right to intervene.
The Algerians exercise this right to interfere in our affairs when they say that our immigration policy is not right, that they do not have enough visas, etc. They have the right to participate in European discussions.
If there is an association agreement, then we have not only the right but also the duty to intervene when massacres are committed.
We must condemn massacres, whether they are committed by Islamic terrorists, paramilitary terrorists or other terrorists linked to some armed service.
We do not have the right to allow the Algerian embassy to dictate resolutions or amendments to us.
That is not our role.
Here our role is to establish an association agreement, on the one hand, and on the other, to intervene politically in discussions in Algeria, so that Algeria can emerge as a democracy.
And this is not just the fault of colonialism, though colonialism does have its faults.
Algeria has a single party tradition.
Algeria has a tradition of military power where the military stands above society and it is the military that commits both good and evil acts.
This has to change and it is exactly what we are trying to say in the resolution tabled by your colleague Mr Brok, and which many Members voted for.
And I ask that tomorrow we change nothing in this resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which is not a resolution of the left, but a resolution by Mr Brok, a member of the PPE-DE.
Let us adopt this resolution.
Let us vote for it as it stands and we will all be happy.
In connection with this debate, I have received a motion for a resolution submitted in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The next item is the Commission declaration on the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, like the other institutions of the European Union, the Commission has, as you can imagine, been following, the development of events in CÃŽte d'Ivoire very closely since the military uprising began on 19 September.
The Union has condemned the threat to institutional legality that CÃŽte d'Ivoire has been experiencing for almost three weeks.
At the same time, it has reaffirmed the need to find a political solution that would not exclude any of the opposing parties, in the spirit of the process of national reconciliation which CÃŽte d'Ivoire opened after the serious unrest of 2000 and which the Union supported in principle and with financial support.
Thirdly, the Presidency has reiterated that the Union attaches the utmost importance to respect for human rights.
The Commission supports President Gbagbo and his legitimate government, both put in place by democratic elections.
Nevertheless, since the publication of the Union declaration on 24 September, we have not denied that growing concerns have appeared both on the prospect of a political solution and with regard to human rights.
The Commission naturally welcomed with great interest the outcome of the summit of the Economic Committee of West African States in Accra.
The creation of a contact group consisting of six Heads of State, and charged with the task of mediating between the government and the rebels led us to believe that a peaceful solution could be reached that would avoid bloodbaths and lasting rifts that fighting on the ground would inevitably entail.
This work must have support.
The agreement in principle to a cease-fire given to the contact group by President Gbagbo and by the rebels would allow for a certain optimism in putting a cease-fire in place, although nothing had been signed on 4 October.
For the time being there has been nothing and government forces resumed fighting against the rebels at BouakÃ© on Sunday 6 October.
The group of mediators, whose alertness, patience and sense of responsibility incidentally we salute, has not concealed its great disappointment and irritation at the Ivorian Government and its behaviour.
The second point of the Union's declaration of 24 September, with regard to which concerns are again growing, is respect for human rights by the two opposing parties.
First of all, the behaviour of the rebels has deteriorated and is still deteriorating more and more, particularly with regard to attacks on property.
As for the government, attacks on members of the opposition and signs of xenophobia are increasing to the point where they are becoming very worrying.
The circumstances surrounding the death of General GueÃ¯ and his wife, members of his family and close relations are suspicious to say the least.
Attacks and intimidation against Mr Ouatara, his close relations and many leading members of his party (Rally of the Republicans) will have a lasting negative effect on the process of national reconciliation.
Hostility towards foreigners is also becoming increasingly widespread.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, do not misunderstand these reminders.
Institutional legality in CÃŽte d'Ivoire must be subject to wholehearted support from the international community.
This wholehearted support must not, however, be indiscriminate or unconditional.
Madam President, allow me to conclude by expressing the hope that your institution, by virtue of the prestige in the eyes of the Ivorian authorities, uses its influence to convince them, as the Commission is striving to do, that a peaceful solution is the only way forward that is logical and which offers hope.
Madam President, it is slightly difficult to speak on this resolution because as yet it has not been translated and brought up to the office.
I have to work on the basis of the French version and I just hope I get it right.
It is tragic that once again we find ourselves standing in this Chamber talking about yet another war in sub-Saharan Africa.
It is absolutely right that we voice our displeasure at such an action having taken place.
It is true to say that the election was disappointing and that we had hoped for better results.
It reflected on the problems of Ivoirian birthright - as to whether you should be allowed to stand as a president if you were born in the country or if your parents were Ivoirian.
We should always remember, however, that everything concerning our relations with these developing countries is based on the Cotonou Accord.
That, of course, gives us a basis for democracy, human rights and good governance.
Quite honestly, good governance to me is almost more important than pure democracy because if you can get a stable country that is transparent in its doings then that is a big step.
CÃŽte d'Ivoire is a huge country with enormous potential and is one of the lynchpins in West Africa.
This was very much an internal power struggle.
There are those who blame outside influences or rebel groups from other nations, but this was a pure power struggle within the nation itself.
It was an issue of people wanting to take power simply as a domestic issue.
The problem is much the same as that experienced by Nigeria in that there is a very strong Muslim presence in the north of the country, and a Christian one in the south.
There is always a vying between these two groups.
As it happens, the Muslims in the north tend to be the poorer of the two groups.
The Commission should focus aid onto this area to benefit the Muslims who have not got the wealth of the south.
I was in Ghana two weekends ago when the ECOWAS meeting of the 14 West African states took place.
They discussed the situation in the CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
There was real doom and gloom amongst the representatives and leaders of those countries.
When things go wrong in a country of that size, it not only destabilises CÃŽte d'Ivoire, it very much destabilises that whole region.
Therefore I was delighted that at least the ECOWAS leaders had the foresight and sense to intervene in the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire and send a delegation there in the hope that it could mediate between the two parties.
I sincerely hope that they are successful because there are problems arising in Nigeria where exactly the same situation exists.
That country has a strong fundamentalist Muslim north and a Christian group in the south.
With the way the Commission is now moving towards regional policies, it is absolutely vital that we get these countries to understand that if they are going to be able to face global prospects as far as trade is concerned, they must pull together as a region.
Therefore it is vitally important that they support each other.
The one disappointment was that NEPAD, the new African partnership on development, has not reacted more strongly in this situation.
Written into that new agreement was a peer review.
I had hoped that when a problem like this arose, the Heads of States in African countries in that organisation, which has been set up by Africans to look after Africa, would have immediately stepped in.
But unfortunately, as with the Zimbabwean situation, they have not done so.
If this organisation has not fallen at the first fence then it has certainly stumbled.
I sincerely hope preparatory talks can take place as soon as possible because only around a table can we bring this conflict to an end without the death and destruction that usually happens.
All I can do is ask the Commission to press both parties to stop warring and come together for discussions.
Madam President, since the coup d'Ã©tat on 19 September, the whole of the northern territory of CÃŽte d'Ivoire has been plunged into confused military conflict.
Military operations are being carried out even as I speak and fighting is raging in BouakÃ©, leading us to fear the worst for the civil population caught up in the conflict.
Ladies and gentlemen, we fear for the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire who have been taken hostage by factions and who are paying for this crisis with their freedom and, in some cases, their lives.
We fear for CÃŽte d'Ivoire, which is in danger of becoming further removed from the model for which it is so often admired.
Today, CÃŽte d'Ivoire and its society are being torn apart, and we fear for Africa and the African people for the whole region may collapse, and this is a region which has already seen too many wars and human tragedies and where armed gangs are rampant and trafficking of all kinds is rife - these are both distressing everyday realities.
This is an outcome which does not, in fact, seem too far removed from the current instability in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
If CÃŽte d'Ivoire becomes destabilised, this will lay the foundations for a crisis similar to that in the Great Lakes region or in the Congo, which have for many years been devastating the heart of the continent.
We are concerned by this crisis, and we are saddened by it.
We are also surprised by it too, however.
It is happening at the very time when the efforts made by Laurent Gbagbo's regime to deal with two of the country's greatest challenges were paying off.
The first challenge is national reconciliation and, to promote this, a broad forum was organised in 2001 and a government of national union was formed, bringing together the major political forces following the elections in July 2002.
The next challenge is economic and social revival, promoted through fundamental social reforms such as free schooling or health insurance for all citizens.
In order to make further progress on these fronts, however, CÃŽte d'Ivoire needs peace.
Europe must exert pressure to bring about a negotiated solution and a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
It must make every effort to mediate and must welcome the actions carried out under the aegis of the ECOWAS.
These attempts have so far failed, but it is indeed difficult to ask a legitimate government to negotiate as equals with armed rebels.
The challenge now is to preserve the unity of the whole territory of CÃŽte d'Ivoire whilst respecting constitutional law.
We must be particularly careful to ensure that, if an intervention force is sent to CÃŽte d'Ivoire, this does not lead to a de facto division of the country.
The Socialist Group also supports the idea of sending a parliamentary mission - I am addressing my fellow Members here - to give our support to the democratically elected institutions and to go and meet with the various political forces in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
In order, however, to help democracy take root in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, President Gbagbo must very swiftly take the initiative of launching negotiations with all the political and social forces in his country.
Negotiations must, in particular, focus on the constitutional bottlenecks which are acting as a brake, slowing down national reconciliation.
The 2000 Constitution does not fulfil this requirement, it does not allow all the different political positions to express themselves and it once again and still prevents Mr Ouatara from standing as presidential candidate.
It does not provide for the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly in the event of major crises, and this may leave the way open for an extremely violent political reaction.
Lastly, President Gbagbo must resume dialogue in order to pursue an unqualified and unambiguous effort to achieve national reconciliation, which is essential for a country that has been torn apart for many years by the manipulation of the concept of Ivorian birthright, almost 30% of whose population is made up of foreigners.
In this respect, the call for the expulsion of 500 000 inhabitants originating from Burkina Faso, broadcast last Sunday on CÃŽte d'Ivoire national television, is an unacceptable abuse and must be vehemently condemned, in the same way that the attacks on foreigners who live in the country must be vehemently condemned.
Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, today, CÃŽte d'Ivoire and the legitimate government of Laurent Gbagbo need the firm support of the European Union that you have outlined and which I shall promote very firmly and in every possible way.
Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commission's statement here today, which is actually more balanced than our draft resolution.
I also note with interest that the Commissioner made specific reference to the RDR, which is the Liberals' sister party in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
We have attempted to maintain contact with the party, but recently, of course, that has not been possible.
I am very disappointed at the part the EU has played in this matter.
In April, I asked the Council what measures were being taken to aid the functioning of the National Reconciliation Forum and what measures were envisaged for monitoring the elections in June 2002.
At that time, it was said that the EU certainly was concerned about the fact that the 2000 elections were characterised by violence, infringements of human rights and exclusion of some major political parties, and talks were held pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
The talks were, however, brought to a close in June 2001, and it was not thought possible to make any particularly significant contribution to the supervision of the elections, or to provide support, or to play an active role.
Many people in the region are suffering because we remained passive and did not take a more active role.
This is a shame, because this is an area in which the EU could have been active, and we were aware of these issues.
We are concerned about the troubles spreading out in the region.
As usual, there is a great risk that women and children will bear the brunt of the suffering.
We know that the position of children in CÃŽte d'Ivoire is not as it should be.
The Liberals will not support item 5 of the resolution, and my colleague Mr Van Hecke will go into more detail on this matter.
Madam President, supporting President Laurent Gbagbo is, ladies and gentlemen, natural.
It is natural to support a politician for whom prison, exile and suffering have marked the thirty-year long struggle for his ideas.
In two years, he has restored to CÃŽte d'Ivoire a minimum rule of law, revitalised the education system, gained the trust of the international institutions and above all, provided conditions for national reconciliation by forming a government made up of all the opposition parties, and I would point out to Mrs Thors that the RDR (Rassemblement des RÃ©publicains) party entered the government in August 2002.
Parliament invited President Gbagbo to Strasbourg in November 2001 - Nicole Fontaine invited him - and, in doing so, wanted to acknowledge the work carried out by this humanist professor and leader.
We must help him because he symbolises republican legality, because he symbolises political change in an Africa that is greatly in need of it, because he is the symbol that Africa is anchored in a modern democracy.
Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, a ceasefire is needed, but on the condition that the rebels surrender their weapons.
No constitutionally elected president can negotiate with armed rebels that occupy 40% of his country.
The European Union must help in the general reconstruction of the country, which will involve the development of the rule of law, a programme of social housing for the most deprived, and the reorganisation of the CÃŽte d'Ivoire army.
Ladies and gentlemen, if CÃŽte d'Ivoire falters, the whole of West Africa will be permanently destabilised, it will be plunged into chaos, and there will be terrible risks of ethnic and religious clashes.
We must therefore, as part of an active diplomatic effort, send a parliamentary mission, and this is what we shall begin working on, Madam President, as of tomorrow.
As Commissioner Barnier wished, quite rightly and quite appropriately, this parliamentary mission must be able to arrive within three days in Abidjan and it must strive, on the basis of the resolution that we shall vote upon tomorrow, to play a role and provide Parliament with a role to play.
It is no good arriving when the crisis is over.
We have an essential responsibility towards this country, its president and the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
They need our solidarity, Madam President, in the terrible ordeal they are going through, and the European Parliament must therefore have a presence and its presence must be firm.
Madam President, recent events, marked by a number of assassinations in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, are extremely worrying.
The military uprising against the current official government is unjustifiable, despite the worsening economic and political conditions.
The unprecedented economic crisis, related to the fall in the price of raw materials, and particularly of coffee and cotton, has caused further hardship and poverty in the country.
It is also clear, however, that the lack of respect for the concept of Ivorian birthright, which came to a head during the presidential elections in 2000, has served only to intensify the climate of hate and violence in the country, and the accusations that neighbouring countries are supporting the rebels could be used to justify the persecution of the immigrant civilian populations.
In this respect, we must welcome the statement made by President Gbagbo which calls for foreigners to be protected.
It should also be taken on board by his troops.
The risk of an outbreak of xenophobia among civilians is indeed great.
We must avoid being caught up in a civil war between ethnic groups, a crisis situation similar to that in the Congo, which would be extremely dangerous and regrettable for CÃŽte d'Ivoire and all its inhabitants.
Therefore, although we may lament the failure of mediation efforts by the ECOWAS which proposed the resumption of negotiations between the government and the rebels, the intervention forces should not impose an actual division of ethnic groups on the ground.
The European Union must support the legitimate government in order to restore the rule of law and to protect the civilian populations, of all ethnic origins.
In the longer term, a committee of enquiry should be set up in order to discover the causes of these events and to condemn those responsible.
The European Union must ensure respect for the principles of human rights, of democracy and of political pluralism, but also, and this is crucial, encourage the economic and social development of CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, Commissioners, allow me to express my astonishment at the arguments put forward by some of my fellow Members, because, ultimately, the situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire is so straightforward that we should be in immediate agreement on a number of obvious facts.
The first obvious fact is that CÃŽte d'Ivoire is one of the States that deserves our most vigorous support, as it is showing numerous encouraging signs: its level of growth stands at 3%, it is making relatively rapid progress towards democracy, illustrated by the presidential elections that have been universally welcomed as a step forward, it has a process for forming political groupings in place which, following the forum for national reconciliation, should lead to fully democratic legislative elections, and the current government must be instructed to arrange these as soon as possible.
Yes, CÃŽte d'Ivoire and President Gbagbo deserve the support of all the European States that are concerned about links with Africa.
I do not understand how we can hesitate, unless we are trying to make things worse before they can get better or we are allowing ourselves to be carried away by a feeling of indifference to which I fear many Europeans are certainly tempted to give in but which is unacceptable to France.
The second obvious fact is that CÃŽte d'Ivoire is in not facing a civil war.
It is simply battling with a foreign invasion which, although it exploits the age-old oppositions between ethnic groups, as usual, is primarily a matter for geopolitical analysis.
The so-called insurgents are obviously armed, and powerfully so, by one or more foreign powers.
An analysis of the situation must not, therefore, be based on ethnographic conclusions, and even less on humanitarian lamentation, but on geopolitical factors.
Turning to the third obvious fact, which is crucial but, for this reason perhaps, is too often eclipsed, since it is true that the ignorance - or lack of perception - of this House in geopolitical matters is evident in so many areas.
Today, Africa is, out of all the continents, the one which is the most immune to the influence of the global empire.
This is due to historical reasons relating to the links that several European nations have forged with Africa and, consequently, due to the fear, which has often stopped Washington, that any destabilisation of regimes would bolster the Soviet Union.
However, since the collapse of the Russian power, the empire has been trying to extend its influence over this continent, which is both the richest, potentially at least, and, sadly, the most vulnerable of all.
We tried to do this several times in Equatorial Africa - formerly under Belgian control - and extended these efforts to the neighbouring countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which has such substantial oil reserves.
We are now benefiting from the ambitions of a personality of uncertain nationality, who, in any case, spent most of his life in the United States, to destabilise a country whose situation has been growing stronger with each passing year and which, as a result, became a major partner of Europe.
It is this connection, it is this link that some want to destroy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must be firm regarding the true interests of Europe.
France has the courage to do this.
The support that it is giving to the official, democratic government of CÃŽte d'Ivoire must be shown by all Europeans together, because what France is doing in Africa, it is not doing for itself but for the whole of Europe.
Madam President, the latest conflict in CÃŽte d'Ivoire comes, I believe, as no surprise to those who try constantly to follow the developments in that country.
Behind it stretches a long history of political, economic and, above all, ethnic stand-offs that continually interweave and reinforce each other.
The motion for a resolution that is before us overlooks, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the responsibilities of the current leaders.
CÃŽte d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa and one of the most important producers of coffee.
The country accommodates nearly 5 million immigrants, mainly from the neighbouring countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal.
In times of economic boom, they are deployed as cheap labour; during a political and economic crisis, they are the scapegoats par excellence.
The xenophobic campaign in the state media was nourished by President Gbagbo's accusations that Burkina Faso was at the root of the mutiny, without there being a shred of evidence.
Many people in the north of CÃŽte d'Ivoire originally come from Burkina.
They have the feeling that they are now being treated as second-class citizens, particularly since their leader, Mr Ouattara, was barred from taking part in the presidential elections on account of his alleged Burkinan roots.
Together with Mr Ouattara, the peoples in the north felt excluded from the political system.
This is the core of the problem.
CÃŽte d'Ivoire has been broken as a nation by the political misuse of religious differences and of the concept of IvoiritÃ©.
The international community has made a huge effort to evacuate French subjects and 200 children of American clergymen.
I hope that it will display the same level of commitment to prevent even more victims from falling among the civilian population and to prevent the instability in CÃŽte d'Ivoire from degenerating into a regional conflict, the effects of which are incalculable.
Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank you for having given the Commission the opportunity to open this debate, to take part in it and to provide its own contribution.
Having listened to their comments very carefully, I would also like to thank the various speakers, virtually all of whom have, in general, simply demonstrated that, with regard to this serious issue, we have a common view of the situation and of the ways to resolve it.
The House and all of the Union institutions are concerned, not only by the serious and damaging internal consequences that the current crisis situation in CÃŽte d'Ivoire may have, but also by the destabilisation - as several speakers have said - that the crisis could cause throughout the whole region if a peaceful political solution is not found in the very near future.
Yesterday's televised speech by President Gbagbo calling for an end to the conflict leads us to hope that this peaceful solution will be found very soon in order to prevent unrest in the country and the whole region, which many, including ourselves, fear will happen.
Let us hope therefore, Madam President, that this debate and our combined efforts - and let us spare no effort - will help to restore lasting peace and silence the weapons in CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
Thank you, Commissioner.
To conclude this debate, I have received seven motions for resolution tabled on the basis of Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The attempted coup of 19 September has plunged the people of CÃŽte d'Ivoire into utter confusion, and has led to acts of violence such as the demise of the Home Affairs Minister and the death of General GueÃ¯.
The support expressed by the European Parliament for the democratic institutions of CÃŽte d'Ivoire and its president in the wake of the attempted coup, does not mean that Laurent Gbagbo has been given carte blanche to resolve the situation as he sees fit.
On the contrary, he must listen and put in place ceasefire agreements called for by the regional ECOWAS mission.
There can be no military solution to this crisis; the only option that can be contemplated is a political solution involving all opposing parties.
The CÃŽte d'Ivoire President must now embark on the policy that he made a commitment to follow after his election, the backbone of which was the policy of national reconciliation and the fight against ethnic and religious divisions.
In the light of events in CÃŽte d'Ivoire, there is a genuine risk of balkanisation and it is feared that the whole region will slide into chaos.
One quarter of the population of CÃŽte d'Ivoire is made up of immigrants from West Africa, of which some countries, such as Liberia, are engaged in civil war.
(Written statement abbreviated pursuant to Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)
The next item is the report (A5-0341/2002) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund [COM(2002)514 - C5-0441/2002 - 2002/0228(CNS)].
Madam President, first of all, I would like to express, at the beginning of the debate, my deep gratitude to the House, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Berend, and to Mr Walter, as well as to the chairmen, Mr Caveri and Mr Wynn, for the high level of cooperation between our two institutions and for the speed with which you have examined this proposal for a regulation.
We must now work as quickly as possible, not least in the area of the budgetary mechanism, so that the first funds can be provided before the winter.
I would like to be able to provide the first funds in November.
Given the progress made in discussions within the Council this very afternoon, I feel that we can say that an agreement on this proposal for a regulation is now within reach, and I am pleased to say that this has been made possible thanks to a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission, of which Mr Berend was one of the architects.
During this final stage of discussions, we still have three points to tackle.
The first is the definition of precisely which disasters will qualify for the provision of compensation.
Parliament is concerned that the mechanism should not be gripped in the vice of an excessively rigid definition.
The Council, for its part, wanted to classify natural disasters as priority.
The Commission, as I said the other day before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has studied the recent history of disasters in Europe in great detail.
In recent years 80% of the disasters which have occurred are natural disasters, such as gales, earthquakes or floods.
I do not believe, therefore, that it is inconsistent to agree to the priority requested by the Council since the option for the Commission to intervene in other similar cases - ecological, environmental or technological disasters - would still be available in a very small number of specific cases.
The second point concerns the threshold, or thresholds, for drawing on the Fund.
Like the Commission, this House attaches particular importance to the fact that there are two criteria, either one or the other, and not just one sole criterion, so that we can fairly assess the impact of a disaster on the economy of a State, whether this State is a large State, a large country such as Germany, or a smaller State.
I am afraid that, as we are quite aware, the smaller States in our Union are at risk of experiencing genuine, serious natural disasters.
Even though the Council wishes to significantly re-assess the criterion expressed as an absolute value - we had proposed damage estimated at EUR 1 billion, the Council is going no higher than EUR 3 billion - the principle of having two alternative criteria is not being questioned.
Finally, the third point, is maintaining a qualitative criterion to provide for intervention under exceptional circumstances to help a single region affected by a disaster.
This is an absolute priority for the Commission, and it is the margin of appreciation that we have sought throughout the discussions.
The higher the quantitative thresholds, and I have just said that they were increased in the Council proposal, the greater the need to have a margin of appreciation, because, of course, the worst thing that could happen would be, ladies and gentlemen, for this Fund to be so restricted, made so inflexible by very limited qualitative and excessively high quantitative criteria that, ultimately, it is never used.
I have pointed out, and I reiterate this to the House, that, in 14 years, we have only identified, thank God, seven major disasters with a total amount of damages of more than EUR 1 billion.
It is also for this reason that I proposed in the Commission's first version to retain the quantitative threshold of EUR 1 billion.
Once again, the worst thing that could happen would be for the Fund to be so inflexible, bound up in all sorts of criteria, that, once set up, it would never actually be used, even when peoples have been affected by disasters.
The Council is taking a very careful approach to the qualitative criteria.
I would like to say here that neither the Commission, nor, I believe, Parliament, wants the functioning of the regulation to be hijacked by the systematic use of this qualitative criterion.
The Commission wants to be and will be extremely strict in the use of this particular solution.
What we want is very simply to ensure that victims of a disaster that is exceptionally serious for a single region can qualify for assistance from the Fund.
Indeed, there are regions in Europe that are more at risk than others, such as islands, isolated or remote regions, or regions that we must protect, as, in fact, the Treaty stipulates that we must do in a specific article - and Mrs Sudre, who is present, knows it well - Article 299 on the outermost regions.
I therefore think that we must have the facility, and it is precisely this facility that the Commission has provided, to help these regions primarily in conjunction with these quantitative criteria.
To sum up, Madam President, with your help and, on this basis, with the help of the rapporteurs, I now hope that an agreement will be reached very swiftly on this proposal for a regulation and on the amendment of the interinstitutional agreement.
Because, behind the problems, the regulations, the thresholds, the rules, there are people - this we must not forget, I have met them and have been moved by their plight - people who have been wounded, injured, and are still waiting, and as we are quite aware, in addition to the injuries there are also people who have died.
These people are currently waiting for Europe, together with the national and regional authorities, to help them reestablish, as a matter of urgency, the very basic conditions that they need to continue their daily lives.
Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the floods that hit Central Europe this August reached alarming proportions.
They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage.
Entire regions and cities were devastated, and entire rural areas and cultural heritage monuments sustained severe damage.
The extent of the destruction triggered a great wave of sympathy across Europe, and the desire to be able to provide assistance, also at EU level, to the countries concerned in mastering the countless problems they face quickly became apparent.
Commissioner, the local populations gratefully recall that only days after the disaster occurred, you and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, visited the regions affected to see the extent of the damage for yourselves.
However, they were not only grateful, they were also hopeful.
Your visit raised their hopes that in such a case, the EU would intervene.
Until now, there have been no suitable instruments for this purpose at Community level, for as we know, an EU relief fund once existed, but was discontinued in 1998.
As the rapporteur, I view the establishment of this new solidarity instrument as an important complement to the Structural Funds.
It equips the EU with a flexible instrument with which to cut through red tape, which enables us to provide rapid on-the-spot assistance when disasters occur.
The purpose of the Fund - which will be focused on immediate financial assistance - is to help the people, regions and countries return to normal living conditions as quickly as possible.
Its scope will therefore be limited to the most urgent needs.
The long-term reconstruction of infrastructures and businesses must be left to other instruments, and this EU aid will add to, not replace, the efforts of the countries concerned.
The EUR 1 billion designated for this fund are 'floating': in other words, they are not earmarked for a specific budget line, but will be mobilised only when a disaster occurs.
The Commissioner has rightly asked the question: What kind of disaster can this Fund be used for?
By defining a major disaster as any disaster resulting in damage estimated at over EUR 1 billion or more than 0.5% of GDP, this should ensure that claims on the fund are restricted to very exceptional damage.
That is why the committee agreed, by a majority, on a definition that refers to 'major disasters'.
We have deliberately refrained from making any reference to natural, environmental, or technological disasters.
After all, what would we say to the people concerned if the European Union were hit by a disaster such as 11 September in New York, on a scale which claimed a similar numbers of casualties?
Faced with this scenario, we cannot say to people: Sorry, the EU is unable to help because this is not a natural disaster!
We should stick with the term 'major disasters' as well as the three-month deadline for the submission of applications for assistance from the Fund, as this is in line with the principles of urgency and immediate rapid assistance which underpin the Fund.
As regards the availability of the financial resources granted, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which is the committee responsible, I call for a timeframe of two years so that the Fund can provide aid to restore immediately key infrastructures such as energy, water supply and treatment, communication, transport, health and education.
The funds should also be used to provide auxiliary services, as well as to safeguard security infrastructures, take immediate measures to protect cultural heritage and clean up damaged natural areas, buildings and cities, and carry out emergency short-term repairs to dams.
The stipulation that this grant must leave available 25% of the annual amount of EUR 1 billion allocated to the Fund up to 1 October each year in order to respond to disasters possibly occurring late on in the calendar year is supported by the committee responsible.
Although the parliamentary procedure for the preparation and debate of this report is not without its problems due to the very tight timetable, I believe that the accelerated procedure adopted in this instance due to its particular urgency, with the aim of disbursing EUR 1 billion in November, if at all possible, is acceptable in this exceptional case.
I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible.
The people affected are waiting for assistance from the European Union.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgets have had a truly great task laid on our shoulders, and I am both glad and grateful that there is one thing that has so far on this occasion become abundantly clear. It is a matter of common knowledge that this is, on the one hand, about getting very diverse things done very quickly because people really are waiting for assistance after having undergone something that we can scarcely imagine.
On the other hand, we would have to toil our way through three complicated subject areas if we were actually to be able to do something that will be equal to the pressures of the future.
For a start, we have to create a legal basis; one is in place today.
We have today already been engaged in negotiations about it, and have had discussions about it in a very good atmosphere.
I believe we will be able to come to an agreement.
The Committee on Budgets attached primary importance to the need to embody all this in an Interinstitutional Agreement.
We have to take care that we do not only give people the impression that we are now able to give aid with all speed, but must at the same time make it robust enough for it to last, to fit into the overall framework, to stand the test of time, and ensure that others affected at a later date may know that there are some things on which they can rely.
What we must not do is again dangle a carrot before them and then later have to say that there is no basis capable of supporting what we want to do.
We have therefore put the emphasis on three things.
The legal basis must be decided on as soon as possible, and so we have cooperated very constructively with the Committee on the Regions, to which I am very grateful for having taken the majority of our amendments on board.
Today, the Interinstitutional Agreement is as good as concluded, but just one small problem remains.
The Commission must, as soon as possible, propose a supplementary and amending budget in which the money - the EUR 1 billion of which we are speaking - is actually made available as quickly as possible, and an appeal can be made to the Member States to produce the figures with all speed so that we can make progress on this.
In our budgetary capacity, we have agreed that we want, in future, to hold out this EUR 1 billion at least as an offer.
We will work together with everyone else as quickly as possible, but it must also be clear that we will do this as thoroughly as possible.
My present optimism is founded on my past experience, in this House, of cooperation across all national boundaries, without regard to political allegiances, between the committees and also between the institutions - Parliament, the Council, and the Commission.
I believe that the people of Europe can know that here there is real cooperation with human beings in mind.
We, who, in our budgetary capacity are otherwise meant to focus our attention more or less exclusively on money, now know how valuable the human dimension is.
There is now a need to provide assistance as quickly as possible, here and now, in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and, in future, also in regions which in the past sometimes felt that we, unfortunately, could not really meet their needs adequately.
Madam President, my inaugural speech here in this House in 1994 was on the subject of the serious floods which had caused tremendous damage in Athens at that time, and I have spoken about natural disasters on numerous occasions since.
On numerous occasions, both I and several of my fellow Members have called for the European Union to take action on the ground when major disaster strikes the Member States of the European Union.
Last year, I submitted an amendment during the budgetary procedure for disaster-relief action on the ground by the Union, but it failed to achieve the required majority in the European Parliament.
The fact that we are now well on the way to adopting a Solidarity Disaster Fund is of course, excellent news; I just wish we had not waited until after the terrible catastrophe, the human tragedy in Central Europe this summer; but, nonetheless, the European Commission and Mr Barnier personally deserve our congratulations because, we are, at long last, on the way to adopting a Solidarity Fund for natural disasters and, of course, congratulations also go to our rapporteur, Mr Berend, on his report, his hard work and his proposed amendments, which are a step in the right direction and almost all of which were adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy.
I should just like to say, in support of what Mr Barnier and Mr Berend have said, that it is right, first that there should be a broad definition of disasters and, secondly, that the European Commission and Parliament have laid down the right limit for including disasters in this regulation.
I really hope the Council will not demonstrate the meanness it appears to be demonstrating on this particular issue and will be as generous as it should.
The limit set by the Commission and endorsed by Parliament is the right one, it is not too low and it is not too high and I think that the message which all three institutions need to send out is a message of solidarity, a message that the European Union will act on human suffering.
I trust the Council will take this message on board; as for Parliament, I think that, with Mr Berend's report, we are moving in the right direction.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European solidarity is within our grasp!
Now and in the future, aid can be given at once when disasters strike.
It is with gratitude that I, as a MEP from Saxony-Anhalt, see with what speed and unanimity the Commission and Parliament act.
I have also found, among the flood victims in my region, that the European ideal can hardly be more clearly communicated than by aid.
It is perhaps auspicious that we find ourselves debating this solidarity on this historic day when the enlargement of the Community has taken on a definite shape, for the Solidarity Fund is already open to the candidate countries and our solidarity is already being extended to them.
My group's concern is to retain as far as possible the precision of Commissioner Barnier's fine proposal for a regulation.
The Solidarity Fund is an instrument of aid, one that makes immediate aid possible and whose tasks must be clearly distinguished from those of the Structural Fund.
I would like to highlight two amendments to the Commission draft.
Firstly, I wish to follow Mr Berend in highlighting the more comprehensive definition of a disaster, which we wanted, and which will allow us to respond flexibly to future catastrophic events that would otherwise be hard to include under the Commission proposal, for example droughts or the fallout from acts of terrorism.
Secondly, the extension to three months of the period in which application to the Fund must be made.
This gives an appropriate response time to those candidate countries that are as yet less well equipped to deal with administration and does justice to a situation in which important parts of the administration have also been destroyed.
Although this is not relevant to the Solidarity Fund, our discussion today should make reference to the call for a future European civilian emergency force.
The flood disaster has shown that, whatever the efforts made, there were significant deficiencies in the leadership of operations, in materials, logistics and communication, at any rate as regards the cross-border dimension.
This needs to be remedied.
The Commission should start by encouraging or supporting joint exercises by fire brigades, by the agencies for technical aid, by the rescue services and so on in border areas.
In the medium term, this could give rise to a logistically unitary aid network or even a civilian solidarity corps, which could indeed be deployable in the event of disasters outside the Community, for example after an earthquake such as that which recently struck Turkey.
It is a vision such as that on which we should be working, and we should not wait until after the next disaster.
My thanks - for I must not forget him - to the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation!
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks and, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Berend, who has speedily drawn up this excellent report in exceptional circumstances.
We must certainly all agree that we need a flexible tool that allows for quick action to repair damage caused by major disasters.
Establishing the Solidarity Fund is such an important issue, however, that more time should have been set aside to discuss it.
During the Committee debate and afterwards many factors came up which we have had insufficient time to consider properly.
Our group is in favour of establishing the fund.
The threshold for the use of the aid must be kept high.
The fund must concentrate on immediate costs during the initial stage of major natural disasters.
Actual reconstruction does not form part of the fund's remit.
Risk factors must be addressed through insurance and preventive measures whenever possible.
It is also important that the fund should not become a new variation on the Structural Funds, to be used up on a yearly basis.
It must only be used when there has been an exceptional, major disaster, when help is really needed.
One or two questions came up after the committee debate.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what the position will be on major disasters taking place in third countries and resulting in suffering for people in the Member States and the applicant countries.
Secondly, what will the maximum amount of aid be as a percentage of the costs of damage?
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my statement on the Commission proposal with a word of congratulations to Commissioner Barnier and his colleagues on the way that the presentation of the proposal for a regulation on the setting up of the Solidarity Fund has actually been very quick.
By doing this, the Commission has in fact done its bit to meet the expectations of the citizens in the European Union's disaster areas for prompt aid.
At the same time, I of course want to give my support to the discussion here in Parliament being a matter of urgency, and I expect the Council to go ahead with its project of direct dialogue to deal with Parliament's amendments to the Commission's draft.
This would make it possible to actually make a start on allocating resources from the Fund with effect from 1 November, following adoption by the General Council on 21 October.
I think this is virtually a world record for these three European institutions to get something from conception to realisation in such a short time.
This is unmistakeably and tangibly symbolic of European solidarity.
My group gives its support to the extension of the applicability of the Fund's resources to major disasters in accordance with the amendment brought in by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and is in consequence opposed to the Council's preference for concentrating on natural disasters.
In the same way, as my fellow Members have already said, we are also, as a group, in favour of applying them to damage in excess of EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP, 50% to be paid out at once, a three-month deadline for submission of applications, and the possibility of derogations for regions that are particularly severely affected.
I would, though like to express my regret that, as the Fund is to be what one might term a fund with virtual money, it is not to be possible to transfer resources unused in one year to the following year and thus to accumulate them.
To do so would have given us a more flexible instrument for giving as much help as possible to citizens, businesses and institutions affected even by major disasters.
Madam President, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, almost two years ago, in December 2000 in the Strasbourg Chamber, I pleaded my cause and the cause of a small number of other Members, calling precisely for the reestablishment of a budget heading for emergency financial assistance for peoples of the European Union who are the victims of natural disasters. This budget heading had existed up until 1997, when it was deleted from the Community budget as a result of what was, in my opinion, a distorted interpretation of subsidiarity policy.
Two years ago, I came up against the stubborn opposition of those Members who were using the lack of a legal basis as an excuse and denying me their support, despite the fact that I pointed out to them that genuine natural disasters ultimately affect environmental, agricultural, infrastructure, economic and social policies, as well as all the other Community-level policies.
Lastly, two years ago, I tried to make this House understand even just the psychological importance for the European citizens of being entitled to receive financial assistance from the Union, even if the assistance is only symbolic, at extremely sensitive times such as those when they have lost everything and, in many cases, find themselves having to rebuild their entire lives.
A personal example of this is the earthquake which took place in Italy a few years ago.
Clearly, two years ago, my arguments and political endeavours were not strong enough to convince the House.
In summer 2002, however, everything changed.
The tragic disasters which affected a number of both the Member States and the candidate countries unexpectedly changed our concept of subsidiarity policy. An astute political initiative - and I would like to thank you, Commissioner Barnier, in particular - turned the impossible into reality and, as a result, not only was a legal basis created in the space of a few months but, in addition, a new interinstitutional agreement was signed bringing about the immediate, guaranteed payment of these funds.
I can only rejoice: let that be quite clear.
When I reread the letters and speeches I had written during the 2001 budgetary procedure, I wondered whether I was suffering from the curse of Cassandra when I saw how often the fears I had expressed had subsequently become reality.
I certainly welcome the fact that the Union has, at last, decided to shoulder what I consider to be one of its responsibilities. I welcome the fact that we have shown ourselves to be capable of speedy, timely, well-targeted action.
I must admit, I am also glad that a good precedent has now, at last, been set, which will stop us trying to use the lack of a legal basis or similar arguments as an excuse for not doing something we do not want to in the future.
I am also, however, annoyed because, yet again, all this had to go via the Council, it was not the result of our own action, whereas Parliament can and does make itself heard when it wants to. It is capable of acting on equal terms with the Council or at least - I am no fool; I too am familiar with the Treaties - it can do its best.
There you are, that is what we must do and we must be constant in our endeavours.
In any case, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for everything they have done.
Mr President, we are, in principle, in favour of setting up the Solidarity Fund.
However, the amended proposal as it is now before us will in time lead to an untenable financial situation within the framework of the present budgetary agreements.
The term 'major disaster' has hardly been defined and if damage does not exceed the threshold value, there are generous exemption situations.
The way this fund is being organised shows in my view a lack of any sense of responsibility.
Although this may engender a warm feeling towards the EU among the citizens affected, ultimately, they end up paying for the emergency aid themselves.
The fund has to be streamlined in order to stave off this sort of hopeless situation.
This means restricting it to natural disasters and adapting the threshold values and exemption situations to its complementary nature.
This is with a view to penalising negligence, promoting preventive measures, making optimum use of existing international damage schemes and guaranteeing the fund's effectiveness.
I was the only one to hold this view in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.
I therefore foresee major problems when, after a few years, the financial balance sheet is drawn up.
I doubt whether there will be any solidarity left between the states.
For those who share my doubts, I warmly recommend our amendments.
Otherwise, I pin my hopes on the Council's wisdom.
Allow me to add that I am pleasantly surprised by the acoustics in this Chamber.
This is probably due to the additional equipment that has been installed.
I can assure you that it is working extremely well.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a community founded upon peace, and hence also on solidarity.
Not only do we talk in those terms, but we live in solidarity and set definite dates.
I would remind you that, at its first September sitting, Parliament almost unanimously passed a 19-point resolution on the flood disasters in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, that our second sitting found us voting the Budget lines, and that today, in our third part-session, this mini-plenary is creating the legal basis for all this.
We are standing alongside the victims, acting swiftly, unbureaucratically and consistently, and it is for this reason that we have also chosen to use the accelerated procedure for matters of urgent importance.
We are keeping our promise, and I would also remind you that we have doubled the proposal by the Council and the Commission for EUR 500 million to be allocated to the Fund.
We also call on the Council not to alter our definition of a major disaster - over EUR 1 billion in damage in any one country or over 0.5% of its GDP - as any change would nullify the consistency of our stance.
We call upon the Council to take up the proposal from Parliament and the Commission and make it a resolution.
We can and must tell the victims that, subject to the agreement of the Council on 21 October 2002, we will see to it that money can flow to the affected regions from 1 November onwards.
Agnes Schierhuber and I are from an affected region in Lower Austria and represent many who know how much damage was done and how much hope has been kindled by the policy of acting speedily and naming specific dates.
We rejoice and are also rather proud to be able to show by this example how we not only talk and make promises, but are also capable of fixing dates and acting promptly.
Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the speed with which the Commission has put forward the proposals to set up a solidarity fund and the promptness with which our institution is able to respond to them.
By this, we are showing that the European Union is reactive and responds to the concerns of its citizens.
I also welcome the fact that the recommendations that the European Parliament is preparing to make emphasise an important point, namely an emergency fund, the aim of which is to provide essential relief items to those affected.
The mechanisms for releasing the appropriations which are put in place as well as the timeframes specified must, as a necessity, take into account this specific point.
European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most.
Because the aim of this Fund is to demonstrate in practical terms the solidarity of Europe's citizens towards disaster victims, many Members of Parliament and I myself would like the intervention thresholds to be more generous and to take into account regional characteristics.
It is now the Council's responsibility to tackle this point.
I believe, however, that if Parliament insists that flexible qualitative criteria be taken into account when releasing funds, it must be heard.
It is possible that a disaster destroying poor regions of the Union, the outermost regions for example, or which completely devastates a territory, as has happened recently in the South of France, will not be able to benefit from European solidarity, because of nothing more than accounting reasons.
I must say that, personally speaking, I believe it is essential that natural disasters are handled separately and as a priority, because, in this case, it is impossible to identify who is responsible and therefore to claim insurance.
It is in these cases that European funds are most needed.
As a final, very brief, point, I would like to reiterate that repairs must go hand in hand with the implementation of a genuine policy of prevention and that of a European civil protection force, in order to give rapid assistance to those European citizens who are in the most difficulty.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the Commissioner, on the speed with which a proposal has been presented to Parliament, the rapporteur, on the important and serious work he has done, which has allowed us to discuss the proposal today and approve it tomorrow, and the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Regional Policy, because their work will pass into the annals of the European Parliament's history.
Mr President, I would like to highlight four criteria and finally mention a material error which has slipped into the proposal we are going to vote on tomorrow.
Firstly, I would like to express my positive view of the adoption of the qualitative criterion by the committee, and therefore by Parliament, and I hope this will be recognised by the Commission and the Council.
Secondly, I would have liked the definition of 'drought' to have been made much clearer amongst the disasters to be incorporated, despite the fact that the Commission and several speakers have expressed the view that it is covered by the definition of disasters.
From experience, I would prefer definitions to be much more specific and much clearer.
Thirdly, I believe it is positive that there is mention and clarification of the fact that it is the Member States who are the interlocutors with the Commission on the Fund we are talking about, in order that we may provide a rapid and effective solution.
Fourthly, since I come from the Balearic Islands, I would like to express my gratitude at the approval of the amendment clearly incorporating the islands and the outermost regions; this brings us back to the issue I mentioned before in the context of drought: the situations must be clearly defined so that there are no doubts when this type of dramatic situation arises and requires an immediate response.
Finally, Mr President, please allow me to request that the services of Parliament review Paragraph 3 of Article 3 in Amendment No 13.
I tabled an amendment which requested the inclusion of urban areas in the final paragraph.
I understand that this amendment was approved in the Committee on Regional Policy; in fact, in the justification for what is proposed for the vote tomorrow it is made perfectly clear that, in the amendment being approved, the cleaning up of cities is included.
However, what was voted for in the Committee on Regional Policy was not taken up, despite the fact that it appears in the justification.
I assume that this is an omission and I would be grateful if it could be resolved before the vote tomorrow.
We believe that the incorporation of the urban areas is extremely important in terms of their quantification and repair, and in terms of the concentration of human beings found in them, and immediate action is therefore required.
The vote within the Committee on Regional Policy was truly significant.
We have taken note of that matter and will try to correct it for tomorrow morning.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with mixed feelings of regret and satisfaction that I begin this evening's debate on the creation of a European Union Solidarity Fund.
I feel regret that we were not listened to following the disastrous storms of December 1999, the effects of which are still felt in many regions of France and Europe.
I feel satisfaction, which is of course tempered by the tragic events in Germany and Central Europe, that the European Union has finally conceded that it must be seen to stand by our fellow citizens in times of difficulty and in the physical and material tragedies that affect them.
I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier and his department, as well as Mr Berend, for the exceptional resourcefulness that they have shown in preparing this dossier.
I believe that this report is a credit to both the Commission and Parliament, and the European Union as a whole, both because of the speed with which it has been produced and because of its balanced approach, its recognition of the exceptional nature of disasters, and the prominence it gives to urgency, flexibility and adaptability.
Nonetheless, disasters can be tragic or perceived to be so regardless of their extent, and I believe that this evening, since we are finally putting in place a mechanism that we can call upon when major events take place, we must also consider our presence when smaller-scale troubles, tragedies or natural disasters occur.
No death can be classified as more or less important than any other, in the same way that no ruin can be classified as major or insignificant.
That is why I shall, once again - and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for mentioning this - call for the creation of a European body for civil security. It does not have to be created from scratch and would allow us to establish and dispatch to the regions in difficulty civil rescue forces wearing the colours of the Union who will thus display our solidarity with the citizens in times of misfortune.
Mr President, Commissioner, many Members have already stressed the value of the solidarity - and this fund is called the 'Solidarity Fund' - which is implied in and is the corner stone, the heart of the measure on which we are about to vote. We are building a Europe of solidarity.
I would, however, like to highlight another value which I believe is absolutely central to this initiative - and we have all supported it and contributed to its timely achievement - and that is the political benefit to be gained from it.
I feel, Commissioner, that there have been very few situations or events in which many, very many of our fellow citizens have for the first time felt that Europe is genuinely close to them, that it is truly an elder brother ready to run to their aid when they are in difficulties.
We must never forget that, in some cases, the only experience many of our fellow citizens have had of the European institutions is of a set of rules and regulations, bans and directives.
I believe there is a political benefit to be gained from showing them the friendly side of Europe, as we are doing in this case, particularly at times such as this - and we are approaching a major referendum now, we all know the details - a political benefit which we must not allow to go to waste.
How are we to avoid wasting it?
Commissioner, you put it very well and I fully agree with you.
We cannot make this instrument, which was designed to respond to emergencies, rigid, unadaptable or inflexible, in other words an instrument which becomes ineffective or which is even in danger of not being used precisely because the rules to which we are linking it are too complex.
We must maintain a certain flexibility in this matter and I can see that you are quite aware of this but - and this is the last point to which I would like to draw your attention, even though, I regret, you are not listening to me - I also feel that we must view this merely as an initial step.
Ladies and gentlemen, nobody here wants to see events such as these repeated, but we have a responsibility to be realistic. Soon, there will be 25 Member States, and it is quite clear that the climate is changing.
I am afraid that, statistically, it is realistic to expect more such tragedies to occur.
Therefore, in the face of tragic events which, I am afraid, will be repeated, I do not feel that EUR 1 billion will suffice.
We must endeavour to explore further possibilities for the future, Commissioner, for the 2004 budget, if possible.
I will only make one suggestion at a time, and I would like to hear your opinion too. Why do we not set aside part of our leftover funds - for there is always so much money left at the end of each budget which we do not know how to spend - why do we not use a set amount for this fund?
I invite you to reflect on the matter.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this evening and tomorrow's vote will see us reaching another milestone in the European Union's manifestation of European solidarity.
The floods have wrought their havoc, and we have taken immediate action.
Let me take this opportunity to remind you of the resolution Parliament passed by a large majority - over 470 votes in favour - at the first September part-session in Strasbourg.
We showed how aid can be provided quickly and secured on a durable basis, and that there can be an instant guarantee of European aid.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, who has so quickly taken on board this initiative by Parliament and submitted proposals, and say that it would be proper for Parliament to process these proposals without delay, even though our rules actually provide for a different procedure, and even though my parliamentarian convictions do not always lead me to favour our all too ready abandonment of our rights.
In this case, though, it makes sense, and in this case it is right that we should act in this way.
We have now created lines in the Supplementary Budget that we have just passed.
We are now discussing the legal basis, about which we want to have agreement with the Council by the time we meet in Strasbourg at the end of this month.
What this means is that the formal conditions for the disbursement of funds have been fulfilled.
Two are required - the legal basis and the Budget line.
What I ask is that the Commission should manage to come up with a supplementary budget quickly.
That, Mr Barnier, is a job for your fellow Commissioner Mrs Schreyer rather than for you!
Money must also then be allocated to these lines, because - as I have told this House three times already - if a disaster strikes in the middle of August and emergency aid takes until just before Christmas to arrive, then that is not emergency aid at all!
We should not be deceiving ourselves.
That being so, Mr Barnier, my request is to be passed on to Mrs Schreyer - who, I am glad to see, is coming in on cue - that a supplementary budget be set as quickly as possible, so that the lines can be funded and so that European solidarity can be a matter of deeds and not just words.
This needs to be given expression, and it is time that we did so.
I think that we in this Parliament have made our advance payment, and I hope that help can be given quickly, and in accordance with definite criteria, in any future disasters such as we have experienced in August, and that the events leading to the abolition, without legal grounds, of the former Disaster Fund do not recur.
Not all the problems in Europe should be allowed to become European solidarity issues.
This is where a clear dividing line must be drawn between solidarity and subsidiarity.
If we manage that, we will be on the right track!
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur and all Members and staff of this House who have made it possible for this report on the establishment of the Solidarity Fund to be adopted so quickly. As certain Members of this House have already pointed out, the distribution of resources for the affected regions is dependent on it, and that not only in the Member States, but also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.
It is this prompt action that helps the EU to be taken seriously as a Union for its citizens, and to show that the same EU is capable of responding with efficiency and speed to the emergency situations in which they find themselves.
Mr Karas has already referred to the fact that I too come from one of the regions affected, and I can assure you that people are really grateful for this solidarity. As well as the great damage sustained by roads, bridges, railway infrastructure and public and private buildings, over 20 000 hectares of farmland were devastated.
Let me repeat that the damage in Austria amounts to something in the order of EUR 6 to 7 billion.
The new Solidarity Fund is intended to be - indeed, it must be - a powerful instrument in an emergency and, for that reason, one whose use is targeted.
I would like to give my wholehearted support to the rapporteur's proposals, and thus to those of the Committee on the Regions, as regards fixing the threshold at EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP.
The threshold of EUR 3 billion demanded by the Council strikes me as too high.
It is also right to require that the financial resources be drawn on within two years.
The two-month deadline cannot but be supported, as, if aid is to be given quickly, applications for it must be made with equal speed.
Demands continue to be made on the Member States, which cannot evade their responsibilities for preventive measures or long-term reconstruction work, for which we will yet need much in the way of resources.
My especially warm thanks are due to the Commission for coming up with proposals so fast, and especially for the Commissioners having been on the spot with the President of the Commission, and for these funds of EUR 1 billion being available.
I really do hope that we will vote in favour of this report tomorrow and thus enable the funds to get to the victims as soon as possible.
Parliament and the Commission will then have done their duty, and it is my very real hope that the Council will pass the necessary resolutions in October, so that the money will at last reach the victims.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my satisfaction regarding the rapid creation of this emergency aid fund that can be called upon in cases of major disasters, since victims have the right to expect the European Union to provide them with solidarity and assistance.
I also regret, however, that this statement is only being made after several years of repeated requests to the European executive to set up an instrument of this sort, the lack of which was, for example, particularly marked following the storms which hit France in December 1999.
Mr Savary mentioned this earlier.
The powerlessness and inertia of the Community in such circumstances have been very badly perceived by the general public, even though efforts were undertaken to bring Europe closer to its citizens.
Today, following the catastrophic weather in central Europe and in the south of France, the imminent prospect of the implementation of an emergency fund with an annual grant of EUR 1 billion may, at last, give slightly more credibility to the concepts of European solidarity and a common destiny.
In this respect, I believe it is essential to congratulate, in particular, Commissioner Barnier, who succeeded in drafting a proposal for a regulation of very high quality in a record time.
The Fund will provide emergency aid to any area affected by a major disaster, whatever its status with regard to the Structural Funds.
An additional qualitative criterion stipulates that, in very exception circumstances, namely when the disaster affects a substantial part of the population of the region or the State concerned, the assistance from this Fund can therefore be used.
I knew that we could count on you, Commissioner, for this provision to include the particular case of the outermost regions, whose geographical and climatic situation often causes dramatically poor weather that has devastating consequences on their relative prosperity.
Article 299(2) of the Treaty must be able to be applied, including in the scenario in question that I obviously do not wish to see happen again in a hurry.
Mr President, I am happy with the speed and skill demonstrated in the response to the demands of the European citizens in relation to the recent and very regrettable disaster in Central Europe.
I would also like to express my gratitude for, and recognition of, the consensus which has existed in the Committee on Budgets in relation to this issue.
All of this demonstrates that Parliament ought to attach great importance to this issue since, as the only supranational institution in the world directly elected by the citizens, it is able to be sensitive to the needs and demands of the Europeans.
In this way, the European Union will have dealt with one of its outstanding duties towards those who are suffering, or who may suffer in the future, situations which leave them literally devastated socially, economically and morally.
With regard to the articles of the document we are debating today, in relation to the way in which the payment of aid should be made, following the decision to invoke the solidarity instrument, I must say that it is necessary to provide the aid completely and immediately, in order to respond responsibly and coherently to the spirit in which this Fund has been created and which is taken up in the explanatory statement.
The text submitted for approval responds to the undesirable but unfortunately probable future situations which both the imbalances in the weather system and the changing nature of the planet itself may confront us with, whether through possible drastic changes resulting either from excessive activity or from defects in the rainfall systems or atmospheric circulation, through tectonic movements or volcanic activity, or through any other type of extreme disaster which may take place.
Through this document, the citizens of Europe are promising to show solidarity amongst themselves.
It is our heartfelt wish here in Parliament that, in the future, this extraordinary aid will not have to be used, because financial measures cannot replace human lives and cannot put an end to the pain which feelings of loss can cause people.
You are to be congratulated on what I understand is your maiden speech in Parliament.
Mr President, I wish first of all to thank each of the speakers for their contributions and their questions, and for the specific concerns that have been expressed.
I particularly appreciated your almost unanimous praise for the Commission, for its ability to react and to take the initiative.
I do not accept these compliments for myself alone.
Mrs Schreyer, who stands beside me, has worked extremely hard to create a flexibility instrument that will enable us to finance this fund and, of course, all of our staff will also have appreciated your words.
As Mrs Sudre said, for three years now, I have thought that the European Union's response to major disasters has not been equal to the task.
I am reminded of conversations I had with Mr Hatzidakis a few days after I arrived at the Commission, the day after the earthquake in the Athens area.
As a French citizen, I was moved, as I was when Germany was buffeted by storms; and there were also those disasters in the Azores ...
Frankly, for a long time I have thought, with regard to this issue of risk and risk control, that the European Union's response to major disasters has not been equal to the task.
We have reacted in this way this time because the disaster that has befallen Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia is on a scale that has never been seen before.
Under the auspices of President Prodi, we have all learned a lesson from this.
I would like once again to thank your rapporteurs, especially Mr Berend, for their cooperation and their proposals.
I heard Mr Lisi say: will EUR one billion be enough?
I certainly hope so.
I even hope that this billion will not be used up every year.
This is already infinitely more than the small budget line that existed previously and which could only be spread very thinly.
Mr Lisi, ladies and gentlemen, we shall put our best foot forward.
As the years go by - and I hope we will not be seeing too many disasters - we will establish points of reference and in a few years we shall evaluate the management of this fund.
I have already said that if, by the end of the year, this fund were completely used up - and I must make it clear that I mean at the very end of the year - we could use credits from the following year.
Let us use this EUR one billion first, however, if we need to.
We will then assess what needs to be done.
I would also like to say to Mr Ferber that in order to use this money effectively and rapidly, to benefit the communities that are expecting it - local representatives and businesses in Germany, Austria and in the two candidate countries that have been affected - we must be able to release these funds.
I therefore insist on the fact that we must receive a request for intervention from the Member States and an assessment of the damage, even if the dossiers are not extensive technical ones.
I said the same thing today to the Minister-Presidents of the German and Austrian LÃ€nder. We have informed the ambassadors of the countries concerned that we need assessments of the scale of the damage.
To this end, we have been holding meetings with officials from the countries concerned.
Mr Ripoll i MartÃ­nez mentioned the very specific case of droughts.
I have to say, Mr Ripoll i MartÃ­nez, that droughts are not intended to be the main target of this solidarity.
I would also add that if periods of drought do occur, as appears likely, we do have other means in the European Union budget, under the CAP for instance, of helping and of demonstrating solidarity, in particular where farmers are concerned.
Lastly, I wish to reply to Mr Pohjamo, who asked me which countries apart from Member States of the Union could benefit from this fund.
The proposal for a regulation lays down very clearly that this fund is designed for the countries of the European Union or those countries with which negotiations for accession have been opened.
I should like, if you do not mind, since I have taken an interest in this matter for a long time, to say that in addition to this fund which I hope will be operational, thanks to you and to the Council, in a few weeks at the latest, there are lessons to be learned.
Prevention is always cheaper than repair and consequently, I have had two ideas which we can discuss a little further.
Firstly, although the Commission is not asking to be given competence in this field, I think it would be useful to have a benchmark study of the various insurance schemes in the Member States and candidate countries.
I was struck quite forcefully the other day, during my visit to Saxony-Anhalt, when I met a businessman whose company had been totally destroyed and who told me that he had no insurance cover at all.
I therefore believe that we must take a look, in each of our countries, at best practice and the best schemes and perhaps exchange these best practices in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation.
My second idea concerns prevention, an issue mentioned by Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Schierhuber.
In the proposals we are considering for the future regional and cohesion policy for the future agenda for after 2006 (proposals that I shall be making on behalf of the Commission at the end of 2003), I am determined to make prevention against natural risks and disasters a mandatory priority for the European Structural Funds in all of the Union's regions and in all of our programmes.
Lastly, I wish to conclude, because I am going as far as possible into the lessons to be learned, by replying to Mr Stockmann and Mr Savary, that I also think we should go beyond mere coordination.
We have already made progress since earlier disasters, particularly under the auspices and the authority of my colleague Margot WallstrÃ¶m.
I think that we should move towards this fine and effective idea of a European civil protection force, that we should create a network of specialised units in our various countries, which can be linked up and mobilised in the event of disasters within Union territory or beyond, and that it should not be Belgians, French, Germans or Austrians who set out - each with much goodwill but separately - but Europeans who set out to help other Europeans - their neighbours.
Perhaps we should discuss this issue further.
Once again, we are not calling for Community competence.
I also know that competence for civil protection is often not national.
It is sometimes regional.
But where there is a will there is a way and I think that it would be a fine and effective idea to go beyond mere coordination and one day to set up a European civil protection force.
I thank you, Mr President and I thank the rapporteurs. Thank you in advance for your vote on this issue tomorrow.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the energy performance of buildings (8094/2/2002 - C5-0268/2002 - 2001/0098(COD)) (A5-0297/2002) (Rapporteur: Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca).
Mr President, I am happy to announce in this plenary sitting that this Parliament's Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has reached full agreement at second reading on the common position on the directive on the energy efficiency of buildings.
Mr President, this important piece of legislation is a direct consequence of the Green Paper on security of supply, which the Commission originally presented, and which gave rise to a lively debate at European level on this issue which is essential to our competitiveness and well-being.
This directive, which is now happily to see the light, represents a significant qualitative change in relation to previous attempts to achieve the same objectives based exclusively on coordination and voluntary application.
This time the Commission is bravely establishing a binding framework which will undoubtedly lead to an homogenisation of best practices in the fifteen Member States.
Mr President, I must also express my particular satisfaction, which is shared by the whole of the Industry Committee, with the Council's receptiveness to all of Parliament's contributions: the principle of individual charging, differentiated treatment between existing buildings and new buildings, the clear definition of exemptions, special attention to social housing, the growing importance of passive cooling in southern countries, where air conditioning systems are increasingly contributing to our energy consumption, and, of course, the emphasis on incentive mechanisms rather than penalties.
In order to assess the importance of this piece of legislation we must bear in mind that 40% of the Union's energy expenditure is consumed in buildings, which in quantitative terms means EUR 100 000 million per year; 2.5 % of our total imports and 0.5 % of our Gross Domestic Product.
There can therefore be no doubt that this directive, which will be followed by others that the Commission has already launched, will represent an extremely important advance, on the one hand in terms of compliance with the Union's environmental objectives and, on the other, with regard to guaranteeing the security of supply.
There has been one point on which the Council, on the one hand, and Parliament and the Commission, on the other, have had to iron out certain differences.
I am talking about the period for the implementation of this essential directive.
It was the Council's view - perhaps with arguments which we cannot agree with, but which may be understandable - that once the 36 months for transposition into national legislations had elapsed, there should be four additional years for this directive to become fully operational; this took us beyond 2008; and 2008 is a symbolic year since it is then that the period for verification of the Kyoto commitments begins.
This was not therefore acceptable to Parliament: either in terms of energy saving or in symbolic terms.
And therefore, in the end, as we usually do in the European institutions, we reached a compromise agreement and this additional period was set at three years.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that we can be very satisfied and we can congratulate the Commissioner and her team on this great contribution to the Union's energy policy, all my colleagues in the Industry Committee for the great support I have received, the secretariat of the committee for their excellent technical work and, as I said before, we must thank the Council for their receptiveness.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
I would firstly like to thank Mr Vidal-Quadras and the members of the Industry Committee for the great help they have given me throughout the discussion of the proposal.
This initiative has arisen in the context of the debate on the Green Paper, and furthermore it responds to both the wishes of Parliament and the conclusions of the Council, which demanded actions to improve energy efficiency, specifically in buildings, with the aim of taking advantage of the potential for energy savings.
As Mr Vidal-Quadras said quite rightly, we are talking about 40% of Europe's total energy consumption and according to our analysis and studies, there is a potential for improvements in efficiency of around 22%; in other words, in terms of the global energy mix, we are talking about the possibility for improvement of close to 8%.
In this respect, all of us, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, believe that this is one of the key proposals in terms of trying to comply with our international commitments, and in particular our Kyoto commitments on greenhouse gas emissions.
The aim of the Commission's proposal is simply the adoption by the Member States of a common methodology for the energy performance of buildings.
Secondly, the establishment of minimum requirements for energy performance and their application in new buildings as a general rule, with certain small exceptions, and in existing buildings of more than one thousand square metres when these are subject to significant renovation.
Furthermore, the certification of the energy performance of buildings at the point of construction, sale or rent, because another important element is the rights of consumers who rent an apartment, house or building without knowing what the real cost of energy for that building will eventually be.
Finally, an essential additional element is the periodic inspection of boilers and air conditioning systems.
Let us remember that Parliament established its position at first reading in February 2002 and the great majority of its amendments have been included in the common position.
These amendments suggested by Parliament - I insist - have improved the Commission's original text, without changing its objective, and in some cases have added new important elements such as the requirement in terms of assessment and information.
The fundamental problem between the Council and Parliament, as Mr Vidal-Quadras has said, was the transitional period prior to obligatory application.
I believe that the compromise which has finally been achieved, three years for transposition into national legislations, plus another three to make its full application obligatory, is reasonable.
The Commission believes that the five amendments presented, from No 8 to No 12, are generally faithful to the spirit of the Commission's original proposal, since an acceptable and feasible balance has been achieved in the definition of the fields of work, typology and thresholds for action established in the Commission's proposal.
I would like once again to thank Parliament, the committee and the rapporteur because I believe we have reached an agreement precisely thanks to this will to find a balance between the positions of Parliament and of the Council, on the basis of the Commission's proposal.
I hope that this House can vote to approve this text at tomorrow's sitting, and that it can therefore be applied in the Member States as soon as possible.
It will thereby contribute to improving the European Union's energy efficiency in an effective way, in accordance with our international commitments.
We all know that we have made very serious commitments and that we must make the necessary efforts to ensure that these are not just stated ambitions but also tangible realities.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank our rapporteur for his quite remarkable work, particularly when we are talking about an issue of this scale, which involves taking real action, since, for once, we will be working on consumer information, on training and on new production priorities.
I think it is crucial to provide information about the state of the EU's energy demand when it comes to energy consumption in the housing and tertiary sectors. This applies all the more at a time when the threat of global warming hangs over our future.
Of course, we must also add to this the problem of our dependence on outside sources of energy supply.
This is a directive which will, as a result of the four following instruments: the methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings, the application of minimum energy performance requirements to new buildings and to buildings undergoing renovations and the establishment of a system of energy performance certification, I believe, increase consumer information and encourage owners to invest in improving energy performance, which is in both their interest and that of their tenants.
The particular notice system that we wish to put in place will enable us not only to keep citizens informed about this energy performance, but also to give public authorities an exemplary role in the field.
It is therefore a text that constitutes a considerable qualitative leap in relation to the SAVE programme, because it has a restrictive nature that will give us total credibility with regard to the Kyoto challenges.
I thank both the Commission and the Council which have, fortunately, abandoned the approach of voluntary measures in favour of that of a genuine piece of European legislation, which will alone guarantee results as well as uniform implementation.
No one could think that this directive imposes constraints and an excessive burden on the construction sector.
We maintain on the contrary that this is an opportunity for industry, for research and the consumer and represents a genuine boost for research into insulating material and heating and air-conditioning systems.
Eventually, European industry will have considerable expertise in the field of the energy performance of buildings, which will enhance its modernisation and its competitiveness.
We shall, at the same time, be extremely careful to undertake an evaluation and to ensure a usage that is geared more towards housing for the most disadvantaged members of society.
Might we perhaps be able to hope that the first experimental models will be the buildings of the European Union itself?
I thank you also for the clarity and the transparency of the work undertaken with the Commission, and above all for the close attention the Council has paid.
This is why, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote in favour of this text.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work, particularly in reaching a useful and speedy conclusion at second reading.
We have aimed at the target of improved energy efficiency in buildings for some years, in the climate change programme amongst others.
Some measures, such as the thermal insulation of new buildings, are indeed already provided for under the same programme.
However, these were not binding on the Member States.
In general, Community programmes have failed to result in the actual application of standards of energy efficiency in many Member States, so this directive, although modest, is indeed a step forward, a building block, if you like.
The rapporteur was correct to point out that in view of the Kyoto timetable, we must be careful not to invalidate the directive by a long transition period, particularly for certification in specific areas.
I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion.
Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who plea that we do something realistic about energy savings in Parliament buildings and in EU buildings in general.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report (A5-0283/2002) drawn up by Mr BÃ¶sch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on a communication from the Commission concerning the fraud-proofing of legislation and contract management (SEC(2001)2029 - C5-0158/2002 - 2002/2066(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact - perhaps an agreeable fact at this hour of the day - that I am able today to present to you a draft report that has been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I take great pleasure in the fact that we expressly welcome the Commission's ideas relating to the fraud-proofing of legislation and contract management.
It is always cheaper to avoid or prevent fraud than it is to attempt, after the event and at great expense, to put things right.
I would like to bring up a couple of other items that we would like to see reinforced.
Firstly, fraud-proofing must not be allowed to unduly prolong the preparation of European legislation, nor must it be limited exclusively to new draft laws.
On the contrary, existing legislation must also be checked for flaws.
I believe it to be also a credibility issue that we should, in tandem with this draft law from the Commission, start to scrutinise policies that we know, Commissioner, to be an invitation to fraud - the examples that come to my mind include export refunds in the area of agriculture.
Secondly, we have to hold fast to the primary purpose of the anti-fraud office, OLAF, which is, of course, to combat fraud and corruption and not to do the things proposed here.
We are prepared, however, within the framework of the 2003 work programme, to examine whether OLAF has sufficient human and financial resources at its disposal to effectively perform the duties transferred to it.
Here too we have to discuss whether we can transfer an increasing number of tasks to this Office.
We have had to note a cut in its budget for the coming year.
Parliament is trying to get matters back in some sort of order, but this is not just about the Budget; it is quite simply about the fact that we know that one of the reasons for the failure of OLAF's predecessor, UCLAF, was that it did everything and therefore managed nothing.
The main focus here, then, must be on the essentials.
It is our view that standard contracts and agreements should be drawn up and collected centrally, and that this would make it easier to track and monitor parties to contracts and transactions under them.
We take the view that a clause should be incorporated into the contracts and agreements to exclude from the award of future contracts those partners guilty of any fraudulent act.
Here too we urge the Commission to give priority to more consistent application of the options that are already available.
It is a tragedy, for example, when EUROSTAT repeatedly points out that firms cannot be got rid of even when it is proven that they gave false information as early as the stage of putting out to tender.
Where does that get us?
That is surely a credibility issue!
The combating of fraud is essentially a credibility issue, and credibility is something the Commission has yet to provide in various areas.
To repeat, we are very satisfied with what the Commission has submitted here.
What really will make a difference is how it is implemented.
What will matter, in the final analysis, is how seriously and with what transparency we want to remove the flaws from our own legislation.
I would like to tell the Commissioner without any equivocation that, on this issue, we in Parliament are standing alongside the Commission, but we need openness, and, when it comes down to it, we also need transparency, if we are to be able to work together on these problems.
Mr President, Mr BÃ¶sch, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking Mr BÃ¶sch for the support expressed in his report and which he has just reiterated.
The Commission's initiative both forms an important part of the work of reform as a whole and has a part to play in the Commission's overall strategy for the protection of financial interests.
As you have emphasised, its aim is to improve the fraudproofing of Community policies and legislative proposals.
The prevention of fraud is nothing new.
It was and is a matter of major concern, and it must be comprehensive, meaning that it must, so to speak, be present right from the very outset, and hence - as you also emphasised - in the initiative and the proposal; it cannot be introduced later, at the implementation stage.
Fraud prevention is not the province of a few specialists alone, a fact that has led us to declare that inter-departmental cooperation must start at an earlier stage, rather than leaving all the work to OLAF.
The expertise of the Directorates-General must be combined with the specialist knowledge that OLAF has gained from its practical experience.
This sort of cross-fertilisation can be useful as a means of developing fraudproofing in such a way that legislative drafts are examined with a view to making them fraudproof.
This is about establishing a method of working intended to combine this expertise with knowledge about prevention, and doing that without needlessly prolonging the legislative process.
I fully agree with the emphasis you have put on it.
Another important aspect has to do with making lawmaking simpler.
It of course has a preventive function for the legislative process not to be so complicated that it becomes incapable of being monitored; simplification, on the other hand, also creates good openings for legal control.
The fraudproofing mechanism is meant to help shape legislation in a way that makes it clear and fraudproof.
I would like to enlarge on what you mentioned in that context; on the one hand new draft laws, and on the other, the checking of laws already in force.
That, of course, again raises the question of the human resources available.
We are now starting on current lawmaking processes, which is of course the first step.
Once a procedure has become established, we will see to what extent we can apply this also to the amendment of laws, with which we are also constantly occupied.
OLAF is now getting on with drawing up criteria, appointing contact persons, and installing this mechanism.
Let me, however, point out that making legislation fraudproof is not just a matter for the Commission, but legislators are also of course obliged, for their part, to treat this principle as a decisive criterion when framing laws.
Let me conclude with the additional observation that even the best policy of prevention can only be a success if it goes hand in hand with a credible framework of deterrence, as indeed, Mr BÃ¶sch, you emphasise in your report.
Fraudproofing measures must not be allowed to limit in any way OLAF's firm action in bringing fraud and irregularities to light; they are merely supplementary to it.
I might add that the Commission is endeavouring to bring about improvements in the area of criminal law.
We have just had the hearing on the European Public Prosecutor, and will take this opportunity to thank Parliament for the great support it has given.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only does combating fraud seem to be becoming an ongoing task in the EU, but the Commission is also showing a great deal of imagination when it comes to the ways and means, and it is again showing its capacity for fantasy with this communication on the fraudproofing of legislation and contract management - a high-sounding title in very truth.
It remains to be seen whether the draft, when it comes to fruition, will also contain what has been promised.
I think it right to be sceptical about that.
Since taking office, this Commission has distinguished itself by placatory promises, the words of which have not been followed up by actions.
The Commission's announcement of its slogan 'Zero Tolerance for Fraud and Irregularities' has not prevented the officially-acknowledged fraud figures for 2000 from being higher than ever, and even those for 2001 from being, at EUR 1.25 billion, well above the average for previous years.
Legislation and contracts are now to be drafted in such a way as to be fraudproof.
It is as if they were meant to be stamped with the words 'checked and found fraudproof'!
Is that the big picture?
Is it not self-evident that legal documents - insofar as such documents are at all able to do so - promote lawful rather than unlawful conduct when the EU's billions are handed out?
Does the Commission not employ hosts of well-trained and highly-paid officials, and this objective not far from the least of those they are there to achieve?
Actually, I do think, if we are really honest, that this communication is superfluous, promoting as it does something that goes without saying.
I can only sum this up by saying that the Commission's clocks are obviously set differently after all.
It is evidently necessary to lay down by means of an official communication that we must obey rather than disobey the law.
I find that very worrying on the part of an institution that is the custodian of the European treaties.
In view of that, should the Commission not at last deal with the cases of fraud that have come to light and draw the necessary conclusions?
Is that not the method that promises success?
To give one example, why does the Commission, with the resources at its disposal, not take a certain former lady Commissioner before the European Court of Justice?
Providing a deterrent example for the future, that would be better targeted.
But no, the Commission prefers to change the Financial Regulation in order to reduce transparency.
It is still trying to limit Parliament's supervisory role, and it has done away with the independent financial controller.
All these points are referred to in Mr BÃ¶sch's Report, which I also fully endorse in other respects.
If fraud is to be successfully combated, then decisive intervention is indispensable.
Anything else can be nothing more than an accompanying measure.
Now I do not want to use this opportunity to enlarge on criticism of the Commission's book-keeping system, although there seems to be a certain amount wrong with it, but it is rather sad how the Commission continues to deal with criticism.
It seems to have learned nothing from it.
Mr BÃ¶sch mentioned it, and I want to repeat it.
A Danish official is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration, by which I mean what went on at Eurostat, to which our report makes reference.
Despite this criticism - and despite what I am tempted to bluntly call adequate grounds for suspicion - the Commission continues to cooperate with a firm that operates in a highly questionable way, which has won contracts by deception and has failed to do any good work.
This is something to which the Commission must respond.
If it does not, it cannot be spared the criticism that communications such as this one are nothing more than diversionary manoeuvres!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is report (A5-0307/2002) by Mr Holmes, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks (COM(2002) 108 - C5-0135/2002 - 2002/0053(CNS)).
I am privileged to present this report on behalf of my colleague from the Fisheries Committee, Michael Holmes.
Members may be aware that Mr Holmes recently underwent major surgery and I am sure that the House will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery.
Firstly, I congratulate Mr Holmes on his excellent work in compiling this report.
We are dealing with this issue against a background of collapsing fish stocks throughout the European Union.
Indeed, at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the issue of over-fishing in international waters was recognised by countries around the world.
They committed themselves to limiting fishing to sustainable levels and to taking steps to restore fish stocks by 2015, a position fully supported by Commissioner Fischler.
Indeed, he expressed the view that the EU should achieve these targets long before that date and he pledged decisive action against illegal and unregulated fisheries practices.
That is why I find it bizarre and even astonishing that the Commission agreed to a Council compromise last June which effectively paves the way for a total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to be applied to deepwater stocks.
Although this was judged by Mr Arias CaÃ±ete, the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council at that time, to be one of the highlights of the Spanish Presidency, it requires closer examination.
