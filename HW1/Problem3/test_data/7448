(FR) I voted in favour of this report.
The initiatives advocated by this report will, I believe and hope, enable us to prevent the disasters that we have experienced, particularly in France with the case of contaminated blood.
We cannot keep this tragic outcome, which is so imprinted on our minds, out of our discussion.
It is therefore up to us, at European level, to establish high standards for blood quality and the safety of collection, to be exacting about storage conditions and traceability and to impose strict testing rules.
Blood is not like other commodities.
It is not a commercial commodity and nothing should make us depart from this idea.
I remain firmly opposed to any commercial use of human blood and I am in favour of the principal of voluntary and unpaid donation.
For ethical reasons, first of all: our Parliament, and in particular its Committee on genetics, makes many references to ethics.
Do ethics push us towards establishing payment for blood donation?
Should the relationship between doctor and donor be based on trust or solely on a financial relationship?
With regard to ethics, we adopted a Charter of Fundamental Rights in which it is clearly stipulated that it is forbidden to use the human body as a source of profit.
Coherence must be a part of our political commitment.
Also, for scientific reasons: studies have shown that the safety of supply appears to be better guaranteed through the practice of unpaid donation, that the blood collected in this way is less likely to transmit infectious diseases.
In a directive whose aim is the quality and safety of blood, this scientific observation cannot be left out of our discussion.
Finally, for cultural reasons: in France - and the support of the various associations that have contacted me shows me this - we cannot accept the idea of payment for blood donation, precisely for the reasons that I have already given.

Evans report (A5-0229/2001)
Fatuzzo (PPE-DE).
(IT) Mr President, Jonathan Evans, the rapporteur for this report amending the rules on competition, usually sits next to me in this beautiful Parliament.
He has convinced me of the virtue of his report, which I have voted for, but as a representative of pensioners and the Pensioners Party, Mr President, I have to say that it would be good to have the same rules for pensions throughout Europe if we want to have true competition between products made in Europe.
If the cost of employment, which includes the cost of pensions, is different - it is higher in Italy, lower in Germany, lower in Holland - then there is unfair competition.
We need to have the same pensions rules throughout Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I rejected the Evans report because I am not in favour of renationalising competition policy in Europe.
If the Commission gives up its monopoly on exemptions in the future, this will not reform competition law, it will merely change the system.
If the Commission then confines itself to supervising abuses within the context of this changed system, then that is something which, to my mind, is highly questionable.
If national courts in the European Union are allowed to return judgments under competition law in the future, we shall no longer, I think, be able to talk of a uniform competition policy in Europe, especially now that the European Union is preparing for enlargement.
What we need is a European Monopolies and Mergers Commission and I think that is what we should be working towards.
- (NL) The Evans report receives our support because the rapporteur has correctly indicated where the Commission proposal needs adjusting.
It is a step in the right direction.
For reasons of subsidiarity, I would certainly value a greater role for national competition authorities in the implementation of the competition rules.
However, it should not undermine the standard application of these.
That would not only lead to uncertainty for businesses, it would also lead to discrepancies in competitiveness between one Member State and another.
The national authorities need clear guidelines in order to rule out different interpretations.
It is too precarious at this stage to carve up responsibilities among different authorities.
The most appropriate authority could be the authority on whose territory the most important effects make themselves felt, but also the authority that has been monitoring the situation for a good while.
The rapporteur gets to the heart of the matter when he asks for the proposal to be further developed for the benefit of legal certainty.
Despite the demarcation of powers, the Commission is responsible for safeguarding standard application in the event of effects being felt from one State to another.
Set against the Commission' s authoritative powers, a strengthening of the rights of defence would be appropriate.
In this connection, the question arises as to whether the Commission could indicate how the companies' need for a prompt, EU-wide statement can be met.
The call for legal certainty is not only a matter of further development by the Commission.
The European Institute of Public Administration recently indicated that, in many cases, there is simply too little case law available to draw on.
It is therefore inherent in the current state of European competition law itself that major legal risks cannot be ruled out.
Before the proposed reform can take place, the Commission must lay a foundation in the form of guidelines, or legislation which safeguards legal certainty.
In this perspective, the concept of core tasks for the Commission and implementing tasks for the national authorities is worth further consideration.
Just and decentralised application will prove its worth, certainly following enlargement.
Andria Report (A5-0269/2001)
. (PT) This report examines the proposal for a regulation tabled by the Commission on the implementation of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty with a view to creating a genuine common competition policy which is more uniformly implemented, and which will enable problems to be more effectively detected by abolishing the notification system in force today and in increasing the basic powers of the Commission, but also by decentralising power over policy implementation to independent national authorities, which would work in conjunction with the Commission.
Lest any doubts remain that the Commission is seeking to renationalise policy, it has tabled Article 3 of the regulation, which guarantees the primacy of Community law over national law, in other words, the implementation by national authorities and courts of Community law.
As a matter of fact, throughout the Commission proposal runs the blatant desire to increase its powers, as Article 7 shows clearly, which the European Parliament report, nevertheless, seeks to limit.
What remains, however, is this haste on the part of the Commission to reformulate competition policy before enlargement, thereby increasing both its powers of intervention and supranationality.
Since Parliament' s report seeks to establish benchmarks and curb the ambitions of the Commission, we have abstained from voting on it.
Mr President, Mr Andria, who is a great friend of Mr Fatuzzo and the Pensioners Party, has convinced me I should vote for his important report, which makes it possible to lend money to Member States of the European Union which do not use the single currency, the euro, to restore their balances of payments to health if they are in difficulties.
That will be of interest in a very short time - I hope - to all the countries that have asked to join the European Union, the twelve states which are to become members of the Union and which I hope will become members as soon as possible, but it occurs to me to say this to Mr Andria: 'Mr Andria, we are correcting the balances of European countries, but why can you not succeed in finding a system that allows pensioners to correct their own balances of payments?'
- (NL) On Tuesday, an extensive debate was held on the possible accession of twelve new Member States.
The economies of most of those states are weak in comparison with those of the current Member States.
It is not to be expected that these new Member States will swiftly change over to the euro as their own legal currency.
In those states, the euro can at best acquire the position of a second currency, additional to the national currency and involved in an ever-fluctuating exchange rate battle.
In those countries, the euro will at best be the currency for the rich and foreigners and have a role similar to that of the American dollar in many countries.
The result of the enlargement will therefore be that the number of Member States which are eligible for financial support for their balance of payments will rise sharply.
I am therefore not in favour of the simultaneous cut in the maximum level of loans to be allocated, from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion.
The Commission has still not made a concrete proposal for the way in which the new Member States can participate.
I do, however, agree that responsibility for the management of the loaning mechanism should be transferred from the European Central Bank to the European Commission.
A responsible body is needed which can operate at a political level, and the bank is not that body.
Lannoye Report (A5-0217/2001)
.
(FR) In the last few years, the news has highlighted food scandals and consumers are rightly demanding to be very well informed about the products that they buy.
The information given to consumers must be as clear as possible and as legible as possible, while avoiding increasing the number of categories.
Therefore, for fruit juices, the sales name should not lead to any confusion.
It is therefore essential to indicate to consumers the difference between a fresh fruit juice and a fruit juice made from concentrate.
These two different names will enable people buying them to choose a product with full knowledge of the facts.
In the same way, some fruit juices are produced by mixing fresh fruit juice and juice made from concentrate.
Just marking it as 'fresh fruit juice' would be deceiving consumers.
It is important that in this case labels should have an additional note indicating that the final product is also made from concentrate.
The name 'made with concentrate' or 'partially made with concentrate' should then feature directly under the name, in sufficiently large type to ensure that consumers are informed.
This measure also applies to nectars made from concentrate.
These decisions are aimed at informing consumers as clearly as possible, but also at not penalising producers.
The production processes for these two categories of products have technical, financial and organoleptic differences.
The production of fresh fruit juices requires high quality treatment of products, particularly during the pressing and pasteurisation phases, while the production of fruit juices from concentrate does not involve the same requirements.
CederschiÃ¶ld Report (A5-0284/2001)
. -(FR) Four years ago now, I spoke in this House on the vertical directive on honey, for which Mr Lannoye was also the rapporteur.
One of my main concerns in this case was, at the time, labelling.
I had tried to demonstrate that the label on a pot of honey should above all inform consumers about the origin and quality of that honey, in order to prevent honey imported from who knows where containing who knows what pollen from being confused with quality honey produced by our beekeepers.
Today, once again, we are talking about the quality of honey.
My aim is to draw your attention to the Commission' s proposal concerning the possibility of filtering the honey in order to remove the pollen from it, which I strongly condemn.
Pollen is the only indicator of the origin of honey.
Fortunately, the amendments proposed by our rapporteur prevent consumers from being misled, as they would no longer be able to know the origin of the honey and its exact composition if it were filtered to remove the pollen.
Without these amendments, there would therefore no longer be any guarantee of the quality of honey, and consumers would no longer be able to distinguish between quality honeys from their region as opposed to industrial honeys from abroad, which have been subjected to the filtering technique for a long time.
Moreover, honey could, according to the directive, contain 20% pollen 'A' and be 80% from 8 types of pollen.
On the label it would only say 'Honey from pollen A' as the English version of the directive propose, the term 'mainly' to describe the composition and the presence of pollens in honey.
This word 'mainly' indicates a majority, but not necessarily a majority of more than 50%.
(N.B. the German translation 'ÃŒberwiegend' and the French 'essentiellement' reflect that majority of more than 50%).
It then becomes possible to mix different sorts of nectar, without more than 50% of a nectar being present.
One could imagine a honey with 20% nectar A and the remaining 80% being made up of 8 different varieties of nectar.
(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)
After more than five years in the pipeline, we have finally voted today on the proposal for a Council directive relating to fruit jams, jellies, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purÃ©e.
I am delighted that the Parliament has left the Council's exemption on biscuits intact, which means that British favourites, such as the jammy dodger, will not fall within the scope of the directive.
The jammy dodger is a fine British institution and many in the UK had feared that the directive would result in the outlawing of this biscuit.
It is good to see that not all of Britain's traditions and institutions are under threat from Brussels.
I abstained on the joint resolution on the Bonn conference on climate change.
It presents a much too enthusiastic assessment of the agreement negotiated.
It is difficult to believe that this agreement 'gives new impetus' to Kyoto, constitutes an 'essential instrument' for a 'world strategy against global warming ' and represents 'an extremely positive message for all citizens who are concerned about globalisation' .
It should in fact sound the alarm bell: nine years after Rio, no real measures have been put in place and the ambitions displayed by the Member States have been strangely diluted.
The Bonn agreement includes positive points, such as the refusal to present nuclear energy as 'clean energy' .
But it marks a new climb down in the face of supporters of the 'let the market decide' approach, which can only concern and not reassure 'citizens who are concerned about globalisation' .
The joint resolution is still quite ambiguous on this essential issue.
Paragraph 9 'regrets' the space given in Bonn to 'coal wells' and 'flexible systems '.
But paragraph 6 proposes that the 2003 conference on the climate should have these 'systems' as a theme (the international system of exchange of emission rights) rather than the essential public policies that are required to fight against climate chaos.
The simple fact that an agreement was reached in Bonn with Japan, Australia, Canada and Russia should not hide how far the content of that agreement is from responding to the urgency of the challenges.
Mr President, I am sorry I am having to speak so often, but I have heard that anti-Fatuzzo amendments to the Rules of Procedure have been tabled, intended to restrict explanations of vote at each voting time to three, so I am forced to take the opportunities I still have left for explanations in these last few days.
Now, I have voted for this CederschiÃ¶ld report because one of the worst dangers threatening us is computer crime.
However, I wonder why we do not pay consultants, the computer criminals, to draw the poison from the secrets of computer crime so that we could better combat this ugly habit which too many people in Europe have.
BÃ¶sch Report (A5-0280/2001)
Mr President, I am entirely in favour of the activities of the European Ombudsman and what he has been doing over the past few years, as set out in this report.
The truth is that many European citizens do not know their rights, do not know what they can do on the basis of European directives and, above all, think that European directives and regulations are not European.
They are convinced they are Italian laws, and I do not think that is a good thing.
I therefore propose to the European Ombudsman to insist, and this Parliament to accept my request, that European directives and regulations are called 'European laws' when incorporated into national legislation.
Almeida Garrett Report (A5-0240/2001)
Perry Report (A5-0245/2001)
Dehousse (PSE), in writing.
(FR) Mr Perry' s report marks the happy and constructive end to 15 months of calm and continuous work by the European Parliament.
It was on 11 April 2000 that the European Ombudsman, Mr Jacob SÃ¶derman, charged Parliament with the innovative project of a code of good administrative conduct applying to all the institutions and bodies of the European Community.
It is this code that has been approved this morning.
In order to achieve this result, with the practically unanimous assent of the European Parliament, several obstacles have had to be overcome.
First of all, like most legislative assemblies, we had to prevent a conflict of responsibilities between our different committees as, depending on the approach, four of them could be declared to be responsible for the whole of the proposal.
We succeeded in overcoming this risk.
Next we needed to find a sound and undisputed legal basis for adopting the code.
This is what the Legal Committee applied itself to doing, beyond the traditional disputes and opposition between the groups, and the more discrete but no less acute disputes between nationalities.
I am delighted to have been able to contribute to it through an opinion that was very open to the expression of this large constructive majority.
Today the European Parliament wished to both strengthen and simplify the rights of European citizens with regard to the Community' s administrative actions.
It has managed to do so as the code adopted contains significant new elements, the importance of which we will gradually discover.
Simplification, however, is just as important as it prevents an endless breakdown of all citizens' rights, rights which would actually lose their importance if they differed in every case.
I am happy to have been able to contribute through my vote in favour to this significant advance for European citizenship.
Mr President, I had a dream about Mr SÃ¶derman!
Yes, it was actually him!
We were having dinner, but it was not Mr SÃ¶derman as he is today, it was a young Mr SÃ¶derman, very young.
We were friends and we were chatting and he said to me: 'My dream, Mr Fatuzzo, is one day, when I am grown up, to become the European Ombudsman, because I want to be able to check up on what the European institutions do and, if there is any bureaucrat who is out of order, I want to be able to find that out and take action so that all the citizens of Europe have the chance to benefit from European laws' .
Well, Mr President, at last the dream that Mr SÃ¶derman had in my dream has actually come true with the approval of this directive.
CamisÃ³n Asensio Report (A5-0236/2001)
.
(FR) Although the text talks about 'deepening of democracy' and mentions 'emphasis on administrative openness and transparency' and despite its very aim which is to give the Ombudsman greater access to official documents, its whole spirit is marked by a concern to preserve the 'professional secrecy' of the information to which the Ombudsman may have access.
Rather than making the institutions and their operation more transparent, the function of the Ombudsman only serves to conceal the fact they are in no way transparent for the overwhelming majority of the population.
As a result, we did not vote in favour of the report.
And although we did not vote against it either, this is solely because the official French authorities are rising up against slightly more flexible access - solely for the Ombudsman! - to 'classified documents' , in the name of the Europe of defence and are calling for the report to be rejected.
We reaffirm our opposition both to commercial and industrial secrecy and to the so-called State secrets, which are not so much aimed at protecting the State against a third country as at concealing the actions, including the most disgraceful actions, of the State institutions from their own populations.
In today' s vote, I gave my support to a crucial strengthening of the European Ombudsman' s position.
The proposal is aimed at amending Article 3 of the Ombudsman' s statute so that the Ombudsman also has access to classified documents within the EU.
It is also proposed that all officials of the EU should be instructed to give full evidence in accordance with the truth and that their duty of loyalty towards their employer should cease.
Officials are thus obliged to defend the truth and their fellow citizens rather than to protect their own institutions.
This is a crucial improvement in terms of transparency and democratic control in the EU.
Mr President, on page 8 of Mr CamisÃ³n Asensio' s report, he says: 'individual citizens are entitled to demand an effective and prompt response to any infringements of their rights or any omissions and delays in this respect' .
That is an excellent thing.
The Pensioners Party approves, and I personally have approved this report but I wonder when will we succeed in achieving what I have read in this report, and what is right, in Europe in terms of our fifteen Member States paying pensions?
There are quite a few where pensions are paid late, even quite a few years late, sometimes decades.
We must also commit ourselves, as Europe, to take action to prevent these delays happening any longer.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.22 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
Zimbabwe
We will start with the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0549/2001) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0554/2001) by the Members Mr Cox, Mr Mulder and Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0571/2001) by the Members Mrs Lucas and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Zimbabwe;
(B5-0581/2001) by Mr Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0582/2001) by the Members Mr Van Orden and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0583/2001) by the Members Mr Bertinotti and Mr Herman Schmid, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe;
(B5-0592/2001) by the Members Mrs Kinnock and Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, it is truly unbelievable that the once so prosperous Zimbabwe, potentially Southern Africa' s breadbasket, has made such a rapid decline into economic and political chaos.
Behind the guise of 'land reforms' the so-called 'veterans' loot and occupy white-owned farms at will.
These bandits shrink from no form of violence.
The police stand by laughing at the brutal scenes of intimidation and even murder of honest citizens.
Thousands, mostly black agricultural labourers, are also robbed of their jobs and driven from their houses.
Despite the fact that the judiciary has branded these activities as illegal, the pillaging goes on undeterred.
In addition, the campaign of intimidation has now also turned against the judiciary itself.
Various independent senior judges have resigned as a result.
The ban on the publication of 'incorrect' news capable of causing panic and despair, is used with increasing frequency to muzzle the free press.
Opposition leader, Mr Morgan Tsvangirai, was indicted earlier this year for infringing the same law.
I should like to take this opportunity to second the proposal of Mr Van Orden to put forward this man' s name for the award of the Sakharov Prize.
The orchestrator of this state terrorism is the 77-year-old dictator Robert Mugabe.
He justifies his crimes with an appeal to a renewed liberation struggle, a fight against 'evil capitalism' and 'evil whites' .
His Vice-President, Mr Joseph Msika, takes things even one step further.
He recently declared that whites are not human beings.
No comment.
It is becoming clear that Mugabe' s excesses are causing him to lose all credibility as a national and regional leader.
Still, the isolationist President still has his own friends here and there.
At the Libyan festival of revolution last weekend, Mr Mugabe sat next to Colonel Khadaffi as the principal guest.
A few days before, his host, Mr Ghaddafi, had given him an oil loan of USD 360 million and a gift of USD one million for his election fund.
This crystal-clear joint resolution asks the Council and the Commission to take concrete steps against the criminal policy of the Mugabe regime.
No Member State should be allowed to shirk this.
Mr President, perhaps there are others in this House who, like me, paid regular visits to Zimbabwe in the early 1980s and were able to discover at that time the kind of country it was.
It was a land full of hope, the civil war was over and people wanted to embark on a new future.
The oppositions between white and black would cease to exist.
If we look at what has come of these plans twenty years on, we see chaos, poverty, possibly famine in prospect, no press freedom and certainly no democracy.
Of course, Europe cannot stand idly by, just as it could not in the past.
I think, however, that Europe, in particular, must encourage Africa to condemn Mr Mugabe, because if we are not careful that situation may spread to other countries in the region.
What are our options according to my group?
In the first place, we have to suspend aid.
Food aid will be a different matter.
If the reports are correct, Zimbabwe' s self-sufficiency may already be under serious threat, and this will certainly be the case in future.
If that happens, food aid will have to be given, but of course it must not be distributed via the government bodies, since we know what will happen to it in that case.
It must be distributed by independent organisations.
We should also like an investigation to be carried out into what kind of sanctions can be used against Mr Mugabe and his clan personally.
Can we take steps against possessions that they have in Europe, such as the freezing of bank accounts, etc?
Finally, I should like the Commission to investigate whether the rumour is true that people from Zimbabwe enabled to study at European schools and universities, are mainly selected from the circles of Mugabe and his henchmen.
Is that correct and does the Commission intend to do anything about it?
Mr President, Zimbabwe is a country that, some years ago, was a source of so much hope that it was felt that Africa and the post-apartheid regime in South Africa should look to Zimbabwe as the country that had succeeded.
The wretched fact is, of course, that Mr Mugabe has extended his term of power to an unreasonable length of time and has forgotten to settle the problem of land reform himself.
The way in which he is now tackling it beggars all belief and is bringing his country to the brink of collapse.
I am therefore very disappointed that Zimbabwe is still, despite the misery befalling the country, involved in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I am deeply disappointed that the land occupations that this country is subject to are throwing the whole economic system out of balance and that a country that is actually suitable for food production is now itself going hungry.
Much of the hope awakened by Zimbabwe has meanwhile been dashed.
Consequently I am disappointed by the attitude of the European Union, which is unable to adopt a coherent stand in respect of Zimbabwe and to take the necessary measures on Zimbabwe that are required to consign the government of Mr Mugabe to the past, and to give a chance to the hope for a new age.
Mr President, Parliament today will vote on its fifth resolution on Zimbabwe in the last 18 months.
If the Council and the Commission did not feel moved to act before, then it is certainly time to act now, before the Mugabe regime destroys all hope for what is potentially one of the most prosperous countries in Africa.
The breakdown in the rule of law, the terrible human rights abuses inflicted on all sections of the population in Zimbabwe and the catastrophic economic situation have all been well documented and have intensified.
The political opposition to Mugabe's regime has been in the frontline of attacks from Zanu-PF militants.
The opposition press has been bombed and critical journalists have been routinely attacked.
Opposition politicians in the movement for democratic change and their supporters have been the particular targets of harassment, violent intimidation, arbitrary imprisonment and murder.
In the last few weeks, many MPs and party officials have narrowly escaped death after violent attacks.
This is not some family squabble between Britain and Zimbabwe.
Mugabe's regime is a destabilising factor in central Africa and his human rights record is of international concern.
The economic collapse in Zimbabwe is pulling down neighbouring countries.
In the last two days, senior black opposition activists visiting this Parliament have insisted that the crisis is nothing to do with land, but about Mugabe's desire to hold on to power.
He faces defeat in the presidential election next year, but is trying to head this off with a savage campaign of brutal intimidation against his political opponents.
We must recognise that democratic norms, protection under the law and basic human rights have been abandoned in Zimbabwe for all elements of the population.
It takes enormous courage to stand up for democracy, liberty and freedom of speech in such circumstances.
Morgan Tsvangirai, as the leader of the opposition MDC since 1999, personifies this courageous stance and the struggle for genuine freedom in Zimbabwe and deserves international recognition for his stance.
I had rather hoped that we would have senior Council representatives here this afternoon.
This resolution is aimed at the Council in particular because there are a number of high-level meetings taking place in the next few weeks.
Can I have an assurance that today the secretariat will ensure that our resolution is passed to the Presidency, so that it can brought up at the informal meeting of ministers at Genval near Brussels this weekend and formally put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 8 October?
Mr President, after having plundered Zimbabwe during a century of colonial domination, after having exploited its working classes and despoiled its farmers of land, the United Kingdom has left a legacy of a situation in which the best land still belongs to a few thousand rich white farmers.
The major powers did not find fault with the dictatorial nature and the corruption of the regime in Zimbabwe until its dictator, Mr Mugabe, started, in order to preserve his power, to make a few demagogical gestures calling into question the privileges of the white farmers.
France, which is less associated with this category of privileged people, is meanwhile continuing to unscrupulously support the dictatorship.
The feigned indignation of all those who, here, are protesting against the violence of Mugabe' s regime, seems, in these circumstances, to be above all a hypocritical way of defending a handful of privileged people against the right to live of millions of farmers in that country.
Even though some occupations of land by groups of poor farmers are violent, that only represents a small fraction of the violence that was imposed on them in order to despoil them.
For our part, we express our protest against Mugabe' s regime, both against its dictatorial nature and its corruption, but also because that dictatorship continues to protect revolting social inequalities and the privileges of a limited section of society to which his clique and the rich white farmers belong.
We do not, however, associate ourselves with this joint resolution, of which we reject both the letter and the spirit.
It is up to the population of the country to settle its accounts with Mugabe and his dictatorship.
It is not up to those in collusion with the privileged minority and those who conducted or supported colonial violence to give morality lessons to that country.
We would also like to express our solidarity with the working population of Zimbabwe and our support for their right to take possession of all the land, without any repurchase or compensation.
Mr President, I must say to the last speaker that, as somebody British, I can confirm that my ancestors had absolutely nothing to do with the oppression or repression of the people of Zimbabwe.
I would like to make it clear that I and my family are in no way guilty of colluding with anything that took place in colonial days.
It is very important for us to recognise that this resolution is being debated here today at a very important time.
It is an opportunity for President Mugabe to make the decision once and for all to step back from the brink, as Mr Van Orden has clearly said.
In addition to the negotiations, which are taking place as we speak in Abuja between foreign ministers of the Commonwealth, there are a number of European Union initiatives including the intended visit to the southern African countries by the Belgian Foreign Minister, representing the Presidency and Mr Solana, the high representative.
There are a number of other things going on as well.
Very importantly, in about three weeks, the preparatory team will be going out to prepare for the European Union's involvement - hopefully - in the March presidential elections.
That makes it extremely important.
But if it turns out that all those initiatives fail and he still turns his back on the willingness of the international community to have dialogue with him, then it will be time to take stock of what is happening.
I would say to Mrs Maes in particular that one of the reasons the Council and the Commission have not wanted to take urgent action, as some in this Parliament would perhaps have wanted, is the danger that what Mugabe wants is an excuse to call a state of emergency in Zimbabwe so he can cancel the election, stop the democratic process and stifle the official opposition as well as any opposition from the press and media.
We need to understand the potential impact of anything that the European Union, or indeed the Commonwealth, does in order to tackle what is happening in Zimbabwe.
The defining moment will be on 8 October when the next General Affairs Council is due to take place.
If no progress has been made by this time, if the dialogue has failed, if we say this is a useless procedure, then at this point it is essential that we adopt so-called smart sanctions.
We should restrict visas to all Mugabe's associates and his government and identify those individuals with foreign bank accounts and freeze their assets.
Those are smart sanctions that will not hurt the poor people of Zimbabwe but would certainly hurt those Zimbabweans who very much like coming to London to shop in Harrods or visit their children who are in British public schools.
Those are the kind of important things that the European Union can do.
Similarly we will have to look at the possibility of the suspension of development aid because that is how the Cotonou Agreement would suggest that we should proceed.
At that time, we would have to express Parliament's view, as we say now, that insufficient progress has been made on land seizures, on political violence, on all of these things that others have raised.
Finally, I support the words of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the Opposition Party, who this morning on the BBC was very tough on Mugabe and I will quote what he said and finish with this: 'President Mugabe has clearly violated all the tenets of the Commonwealth and all other international organisations and should now be isolated from the international community.'
We should heed the words of the leader of the opposition in Zimbabwe.
Mr President, in one minute you can say very little but I concur with what Mr van Orden, Mrs Kinnock and many of the other speakers have said.
I was in what was then Rhodesia in the 1960s and there was a great deal of injustice in that country at that time.
We had such great hopes for President Mugabe.
We thought we had in him a liberal, serious, intelligent leader.
Unfortunately, as we see the developing chaos and threats of famine and the destruction of the economy, we can but mourn the fact that he did not fulfil the hopes we had of him.
I agree that the smart sanctions are the way to go, because already the ordinary people of Zimbabwe are suffering grievously, as they watch their country disintegrate into chaos.
I urge all colleagues to support this resolution.
Mr President, there are 4 500 farmers of British, Dutch, German and Greek origin who own 8.3 million hectares of land in Zimbabwe.
Nine white farmers and 360 black farm workers have been killed in the chaos over the last few months.
Thousands of black farmers have lost their jobs and their homes and the farms are unworkable.
Zimbabwe depends on the success of agriculture and the contribution of these farmers is vital to sustain its economy.
There is money available from the United Kingdom government under the Lancaster House Agreement and there is a willingness among the white farmers to give up 80% of their land to settle the black families.
Mugabe must accept such a solution.
In 1970, Tanzania nationalised sisal farms, businesses and real estate, killing its private sector.
The same happened in Uganda in 1972, when the Asians were expelled, and those two countries' economies have been bankrupt ever since.
I sympathise with the farmers and farm workers of Zimbabwe, as my family was a victim of similar confiscation and nationalisation.
My family has lived in Tanzania for 166 years, much longer than many white farmers in Zimbabwe.
We bought land from Deutsch-Ostafrika in 1876 and I still have a title deed.
We lost land and property through nationalisation without compensation and I know what that means.
I share the grief of the silent black majority in Zimbabwe, who continue to live in poverty.
The poorest in Zimbabwe do not want to shoot, kill, loot and burn crops.
They are hungry and unemployed.
They need food, education, health, employment and shelter.
It was the vision and quality like Nelson Mandela that at last set an example for Africa that reconciliation, cooperation, democracy and respect for all people, irrespective of their colour, is the only way to govern a developing country the only way to help the poorest to be free of poverty and disease.
President Mugabe must follow Mr Mandela and accept reconciliation and democracy, allow the white farmers to thrive and continue farming and accept that Zimbabwe belongs to the people of Zimbabwe and nobody has the right to deprive them of a decent life based on peace and democracy.
Mr President, the Council, Commission and Parliament are well aware of the situation in Zimbabwe.
No one can claim they knew nothing about it.
In taking a passive line, the Council of Ministers is guilty of aiding and abetting.
It is outrageous that, yet again, the Council's 'Africa' working party failed to pass a resolution at its meeting in Brussels yesterday.
Obviously the presidency is only paying lip service to Africa, despite advertising it as a priority.
Unfortunately, France is the ringleader of a group of Member States that obviously has a different agenda.
How else are we to explain the fact that, while everyone else is either stopping or drastically cutting back on funding, France is increasing it.
I call on the Member States of the European Union who want to take a more active line to step up their collaboration, even before the Treaty of Nice takes effect, and to remind France and the rest that they are surely backing the wrong horse in taking this de facto passive line.
I think, my dear Mrs Kinnock, that Mr Mugabe will have no need of our resolutions or demands if he decides to impose a state of emergency.
He will do so anyway because, even if the elections are held, he will lose.
Mr President, I was part of the observer mission that went to Zimbabwe, as was Mr Gahler and others here.
I want to explode the myth that this is about land and land ownership: This is about politics.
This is about the fact that Mugabe knows that if they had the same votes that were cast last year in the general election, he would lose a presidential election.
He is driving the farmers and their farm workers off the land, out of the constituencies, so that they cannot register to vote.
It is plainly about politics.
It is not about colonial powers.
It is about politics.
Those farms are well run, they provide churches, schools and hospital treatment in those areas.
The communities come together.
70% of Zimbabwe is about agriculture and the economy is being destroyed.
We need smart sanctions to be taken on President Mugabe.
He is not listening to placations.
We have got to act and we have got to act now.
As the Members who have just spoken have pointed out, Zimbabwe is clearly in the grip of a serious crisis, which could lead to economic collapse and political conflict in extreme social conditions, bordering on a humanitarian emergency.
Our analysis is the same as that which most of you have made: the sole objective of the Zimbabwean government is to stay in power, even if that means ending up destroying a country that not long ago was considered to be one of the soundest economies and democracies in Africa.
The Zimbabwean government, which could have reasonably avoided this crisis, is therefore clearly responsible for this dramatic descent into hell.
The European Union' s political objective, as many of you have pointed out, is that presidential elections should be held.
The Union' s main objective is presidential elections in 2002, in the best possible conditions to enable change, as we say in conventional language.
The Union' s position, if that is the objective, should therefore be to seek a balance between, on the one hand, indicating our disagreement with the current development of the situation and, on the other hand, preventing it from serving as a pretext for declaring martial law, which would have the effect of delaying the elections that we want to take place.
Therefore, observing the presidential elections in 2002 is, in our view, the absolute priority for the Union.
With regard to what was said in your speeches on the implementation of Article 8, that is political dialogue (Article 8 of Cotonou), we approve the pursuit of political dialogue, while stressing, like you, that no substantial progress has been made in this dialogue in recent months.
A small hope remains, which is the forthcoming visit by the presidency to the countries involved in the Congolese crisis, an event that could perhaps lead to this dialogue being revived.
As far as the following stage is concerned, which is the implementation of Article 96 of Cotonou, which we call consultation and adoption of appropriate measures, again in conventional language, the Council will look at this issue at the beginning of October with, of course, our participation, and we will decide then whether or not we will take this step.
With regard to the impact of this situation on development cooperation, we hope to be able to maintain the programmes that the Community funds in Zimbabwe, particularly in the health and education sectors, given the humanitarian and social nature of these programmes, in order not to penalise the population, which is already being heavily affected by the economic crisis.
All this is taking place, as you have all said, in an extremely worrying economic and social context.
In Zimbabwe this year we see that a cereal shortage has already occurred and that should be manageable if it was only a question of the cereal shortage and its consequences for the population.
However, the serious instability prevailing in the country, the economic crisis and the societal conflicts that are taking place there are an important factor in a situation of food insecurity that we think, in these conditions, is in danger of becoming worse.
It is therefore the interaction between the food situation, the agricultural shortages, in this case of cereals, the economic context and the political context, which contains the germs of a crisis that is probably even more serious than that which we are currently experiencing, and which we should do everything we can to avoid.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Foot-and-mouth disease
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
(B5-0548/2001) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the EDD Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0553/2001) by Mr Martinez and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0555/2001) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0563/2001) by Mr Goepel, Mr Sturdy and Mr Maat, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0573/2001) by Mrs Lucas and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0580/2001) by Mr Berlato and Mr Hyland, on behalf of the UEN Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0584/2001) by Mr JovÃ© Peres and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on foot-and-mouth disease;
(B5-0593/2001) by Mr Garot and Mr Adam, on behalf of the PSE Group, on foot-and-mouth disease.
Mr President, the regions of Oene, Kootwijkerbroek, Mayenne, Cumbria and Northumberland have become notorious in Europe.
Regions where humans and animals have suffered from the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
However, the suffering was caused not only by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, but also by the means of combating the disease imposed by EU regulations, namely the slaughter of all animals on infected farms and in a buffer zone around them.
An approach based solely on the preservation of distant export markets.
Odd, if we realise that the European Union actually imports meat from vaccinated cattle from Argentina.
Much of the suffering of the last few months would have been unnecessary if the Commission had been prepared to accept preventive vaccination.
In France and since June also in the Netherlands the crisis has been averted.
Unfortunately, that is not yet the case in the United Kingdom.
There the suffering of farmers and animals continues unabated.
The figures make our heads spin.
Since 9 a.m. this morning, there have been 2 005 new cases. Twenty recent new cases in Northumberland that for three months had seen no new infections.
In the United Kingdom, four million animals have been destroyed in connection with foot-and-mouth disease and a further one-and-a-half million because of welfare problems related to the crisis.
Let me be clear about this.
This is not a loss of production units.
This is the destruction of living creatures.
It surprises me that the British government is only now considering using vaccination.
The argument that they wish to retain the lucrative export markets no longer cuts any ice, now that winter is nearly upon us.
Under the present circumstances, the United Kingdom will have lost that market for a considerable time.
I sincerely hope that the British government will listen to Sir William Stewart of the British Association of Science who says that vaccination must play a part in combating foot-and-mouth disease and should have been used at a much earlier stage.
There is intensive contact with continental Europe through the many movements of people, animals, vehicles and lorries.
That makes the situation in the United Kingdom life-threatening for agriculture in Europe.
The present checks, including those at the Dutch border, are so minimal that they are asking for trouble.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to take adequate preventive steps to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in continental Europe, so that humans and animals are spared unnecessary suffering.
Finally, I appeal urgently to the Commission once again in the light of the unmanageable crisis in the United Kingdom to change the non-vaccination policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, in this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there are technical areas of shadow, political certainties and strategic questions.
First of all regarding the areas of shadow, how, far from the known endemic sources - Turkey, Asia and Thrace in Europe - how has foot-and-mouth disease, and its virus, managed to reach Great Britain, an island? Perhaps by swimming?
Why this dogmatic refusal of a vaccine that is nevertheless effective.
In 1950, before the obligatory vaccination between 1961 and 1991, France had up to 300 000 sources of infection per year, which disappeared with the obligatory vaccination.
Why, in the same country, have we had the foot-and-mouth virus and the prion for mad cow disease?
So many questions that lead to political certainties, if not lessons.
In both cases, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, the British authorities have reacted late and have been overwhelmed, because the ultra liberalism of the Thatcher years left only 220 vets compared with 8 000 in France.
Just as for a developing country, Australia, Canada and even the French army had to send vets to Great Britain.
A lack of vets and no epidemic monitoring, which is why the disease spread.
It was also ultra liberalism that led to abattoirs being closed and meant that, from Carlisle, Hadrian' s Wall and Northumberland, sheep are taken to the south and the virus is spread.
The virus is spread across Great Britain and, following the removal of borders, it is also spread across France.
Freedom of movement is freedom of contamination.
The third certainty, demonstrated in an investigation report from the French Parliament in June 2001: it was illegal purchases, at knock-down prices - less than 90 euros per sheep for the Muslim feast of Eid-el-Kabir - which led to the spread of the virus.
Along with these certainties, however, there are questions for the Commission; and it is good that it should be Mr Lamy, the strategist, who is here.
First of all, does the compensation system in Great Britain not end up becoming a bonus for contamination?
The impression was given that the beneficial compensation meant that people perhaps had an interest in having contaminated animals.
All the more so given that, collectively, four million animals were slaughtered, the majority of which were sheep, means that the surpluses will be drained.
And finally, does New Zealand, the leading world exporter, not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered?
And my God, if Anglo-Saxons were able to come to an understanding on the Echelon Treaty, they can exchange favours.
For me, Great Britain, excessive individual compensation, for you, New Zealand, the possibility of more exports.
The Cairns group would be happy.
Doha would be a success.
It would be good if Mr Lamy could clarify this for us.
Mr President, no crisis in Europe, and especially in the Netherlands, has had such an impact on public opinion as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The great question is, and I do not know whether the Commission can answer it: what is the Commission' s explanation for the continued outbreaks of foot-and-mouth in the United Kingdom?
In my view, it is not only a matter for the authorities in Great Britain itself.
After all, every European taxpayer contributes to the solution of the crisis.
Has the Commission urged Britain for example to use ring vaccination?
I should have thought that the example in the Netherlands was very successful, and why could it not be repeated in other European countries?
Another question.
One of the reasons for the crisis is that meat was imported illegally into Europe.
Controls on our outer borders were inadequate.
My question to the Commission is: what has been done since on the outer borders?
What has changed from, let us say, some six months ago?
Why not implement a similar type of check as in the United States or in Australia, where there are strict controls on entry?
I have not been able to find this anywhere in Europe.
A further question.
I believe that the large-scale slaughter of animals will no longer be acceptable to public opinion in the long run.
The development of marker vaccines might be one of the solutions.
The Commission has already done something about this, but will it do a little more to ensure that these marker vaccines and also the accompanying testing methods are made available as quickly as possible, so that we no longer have to slaughter so many animals?
Finally I should like to know something about the costs.
The situation in Great Britain is special, since the whole question of rebate is taken into consideration, but how much does the Commission estimate that this has cost up to now?
Mr President, the British countryside is at the moment in total crisis.
I have a document here in front of me stating that the British government admits that it was unable to meet the required deadlines for the slaughter of infected animals.
It goes on to say that the control of the disease, as my colleague there has said, has failed because we are now having new outbreaks in the centre of Britain, in the centre of the region where we thought we were rid of it.
We have failed to control it and we have also failed to provide the necessary border controls.
Last Sunday I drove from my farm in North Yorkshire to Strasbourg.
I was never questioned about whether I was carrying any meat and there were no border controls at all to check my vehicle.
There were no disinfection points.
There was a simple carpet in the middle of the road and that was all.
I say to Mr Lamy, who is the really important man here today, that we have a situation where England is the dustbin of Europe.
We are importing food from these countries.
We must look at that.
Finally, will he consider the possibility of a public inquiry into the way this matter has been handled?
Mr President, I very much regret that this is the second time in six months that we are having to debate foot-and-mouth disease in this House.
The reason for our debate is, as the Joint Resolution says, that the measures taken by the UK government to control this disease have failed, that new outbreaks are appearing and that there is a very real risk of the disease spreading again to mainland Europe.
We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it.
It is ever more clear that it is not small farmers' livelihoods, it is not even the tourist industry and the wider rural economy that the UK has as its priority, but simply our meat exports and the desire to regain FMD-free export status again as soon as possible.
Yet even this dismal economic justification for culling on such a scale does not stand up.
According to the National Farmers' Union the UK earns just GBP 630 million a year from meat and dairy exports.
Compare that with the estimated cost to the wider rural community of GBP 9 billion as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic.
I welcome the call in this resolution for a full cost-benefit analysis between the various disease control approaches so that we can compare the losses that have been suffered under the culling approach to those that would have been incurred under a vaccination strategy.
I feel sure that the results will demonstrate that the UK government' s approach is not only inhumane, it is also uneconomical.
We are urging the Commission to revise the EU strategy on defending by all means FMD status and to recognise that the culling and destruction of healthy animals is both inhumane and ineffective.
Mr President, I represent the region in the north-east of England which was the scene of the original outbreak and has just recently been affected by further outbreaks.
I regret very much that we have been unable to agree a compromise text on this occasion.
The reason is simple.
Recital A accuses the UK government of failure to control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
In truth, it is not an attack on the UK government but on all those who have battled very heroically against the disease since the end of February - the farmers themselves, the vets, the scientists, the civil servants, the police, the military, many different rural agencies which have all been involved.
In particular, the farmers in the Allendale Valley, the scene of the recent hotspot, believed that they had taken all the necessary measures to avoid the disease.
Failure to control implies that the outbreak should have already ended.
But the mover of the resolution did not explain when and by what means that might have been achieved.
No-one ever promised, or even surmised, that the outbreak would be over at this stage.
At its peak there were 40 to 50 cases a day.
Despite the recent outbreak in Allendale, the average is now two or three cases per day.
If this does not indicate a degree of control then we really have a very serious problem in front of us, something that none of us ever imagined.
It is important also to recall that from the very start the UK government has given full information to the other Member States and has followed the advice of the Standing Veterinary Committee.
In that respect, we can point to a considerable success for the mechanisms that we have operating within the European Union.
A word on vaccination.
I would suggest to Mr van Dam, the original speaker on this resolution, that perhaps he ought to apply for the job of chief scientist in the United Kingdom.
He certainly seems to bring to the debate on vaccination an authority and conviction which far exceeds that of the current holder of the office, Professor David King, who only this morning in a radio broadcast said we could not be certain that vaccination would have done any good.
In the Netherlands the animals were also slaughtered and there is quite a problem here in the suggestion that vaccination actually saves the animal's life.
That does not necessarily follow - but I do not know when the job becomes vacant!
Mr President, Mr Adam calls the approach of the British government a great success.
But the great success of the tackling of foot-and-mouth disease by the British government is causing many farmers in continental Europe sleepless nights once again.
Is that a successful policy?
Foot-and-mouth policy there is not only inadequate, because we do not use, for example, vaccination and ring vaccination but because the Council and members of Council are treating the threat from Great Britain extremely lightly.
After all, it is extremely simple to lay disinfectant mats and carry out standard soil checks in ports and airports in order to clamp down on the problem.
We emphatically appeal to the Commission and the Council on this point.
Mr President, in my country, financial subsidies to farmers are cut back drastically if they have made minor mistakes and have had foot-and-mouth disease.
At the same time, however, many Ministers have no reason to talk, because they are doing nothing to avert the danger of foot-and-mouth disease from Great Britain in border checks.
This is a very nasty business, which the Commission and Council must tackle.
Mr President, no one doubts the seriousness of the foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK.
I believe it has been the worst epidemic of this disease that the world has seen.
Nobody can doubt the drastic measures that have had to be used to curtail it.
The two current hotspots show that this outbreak will be with us for many months.
We cannot, on the one hand, say that the containment is too drastic because of the slaughter policy and, on the other hand, that it is too slack because it has let the disease take hold.
We did not anticipate effectively the extraordinary scale of animal movements, particularly of sheep, in February 2000 and later.
The first of the three inquiries that have now been launched in the UK will need to look at that and perhaps also at the role of one form of CAP subsidy in encouraging some of these forms of animal movement.
We provided effective information for our Dutch, French and Irish neighbours and for them it worked.
We should study how their containment worked and why.
Vaccination, in my opinion, has to be one of the options that the inquiry can recommend if they so find.
Finally a word to Mr Sturdy, who called for a European public inquiry.
When we had one into BSE, he was not so enthusiastic.
But BSE was a new disease.
There was a real element of concealment in some of the factors that led to that disease and particularly in the European factor and the fact that we were still exporting infected meal to continental Europe for years after we banned it for ourselves.
That was a genuine European inquiry.
The epidemiology of this outbreak is not in doubt.
I believe that our friends should accept that the British have to get their own house in order and, if that means a public dimension to the inquiries, that case can be made in the UK.
It is not like what happened with BSE: we have done our duty by our neighbours.
We hope that they will now have the confidence in us to let us help ourselves and see all remedies properly examined so that this dreadful disease can be exterminated.
Mr President, neither BSE nor foot-and-mouth are British diseases; they are a European problem.
With millions of animals being slaughtered and farms being crippled or wiped out, this is hardly the time for party political argument.
I well remember how Labour let fly at the Conservative government during the BSE crisis and now there is the temptation for the Conservatives to let fly at the Labour government, but even if governments are guilty of omission, what you are doing here is not exactly constructive.
We have submitted a regulation on feeding meat and bonemeal in certain cases - we are talking animal waste here.
Had we had it at the time, there would have been no BSE problem.
The same applies to foot-and-mouth.
The Commission needs to change its strategy.
Holland may have ring vaccinated successfully, but it was only by going against the mood in the EU and the Commission.
I do not want you to help, I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy.
We must move away from this insane strategy of 'foot-and-mouth free' or 'disease free' and discuss this with our trading partners.
We need a regulation on feeding or destroying leftovers.
What the Council has done now, that is, just banning, is no help at all.
This rubbish has to go somewhere and we cannot dump it in landfills because then the problem of improper processing will keep recurring.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. The number of cases of foot-and-mouth is on the rise once again.
As you know, the foot-and-mouth virus is harmless to man but is highly infectious to all cloven-hoofed animals and results in huge financial losses.
With new outbreaks occurring, I again call on the Commission and the Council to favour vaccination rather than slaughter.
We must rethink how we fight zoonoses in Europe and today we have what I think is a very balanced resolution in order to do so.
Consistent preventive hygiene is only one side of the coin.
With people travelling the world for business and pleasure, foot-and-mouth disease is an ever-present threat and we must be far more consistent in applying controls at airports to prevent this epidemic from coming in and spreading.
I realise that both farmers and consumers are having difficulties with the ethical implications of the current vaccination policy.
We are talking fatal consequences here.
We must, at long last, move away from our non-vaccination policy. We need marker vaccines.
We need a reasonable approach to ring vaccination and we need to make up our minds once and for all to show through our policy that science needs to make progress with prevention, that is, by formulating suitable vaccines.
To give a brief description of the current situation in the Union as a whole, no restrictions have been imposed in the Union as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, except in Great Britain, and that was on 25 June this year, thirty days after the slaughter and destruction of the last vaccinated animal in the Netherlands.
So in fourteen of the fifteen Member States of the Union, plus Northern Ireland, we have quite a favourable situation, which is the result of the implementation and effective application of measures to combat foot-and-mouth disease at Community level.
I shall now run the risk of offending Mrs Lucas by referring briefly to the international point of view, and from that point of view we sincerely hope that the measures which have been adopted by France, Ireland and the Netherlands will enable them to obtain the necessary status from the International Office of Epizootics, thus enabling third countries to lift the trade restrictions that are still in place.
However - and on this point I should like to reassure Mrs Lucas - since this is perhaps not the most important aspect, let us come back to the case of the United Kingdom, which is actually still giving cause for concern, since the two-thousandth case occurred on 3 September.
Although the situation in Great Britain has remained stable for almost three months, we are still worried about it because of the fact that cases are continuing to occur within or close to the areas that have been placed under restrictions.
Many Members have referred to the most recent cases, in the county of Northumberland, the place where the epidemic first appeared. These cases are worrying, because they were confirmed three months after the disease had disappeared there.
Radical measures were taken: infected herds were slaughtered, as were neighbouring herds and contact herds, and although the occurrence of this admittedly limited but nonetheless worrying number of cases was to be expected, after the disease peaked at the beginning of April, the period over which a small number of cases have continued to occur is excessively long, and the Community has asked the British authorities to step up their eradication measures.
Time is pressing, because things will become more difficult in autumn and winter, not only because of weather conditions, but also because it is customary for animals to be moved during that period.
The present development of the disease is clearly passing through a critical phase.
This is not the time to relax our controls.
As has already been said, and as several of you have emphasised, this is the time of year when we see herds being moved around and handled in various ways, and in our opinion it is therefore necessary to reduce animal movements to the absolute minimum.
The Commission has made this known to the people involved.
Staying with the United Kingdom, the complex structure of beef and dairy farming, the absence of any clinical signs in sheep, and the fact that the spread of the disease within a herd or flock is slow, are all factors which complicate the problems and which make it necessary for us to have recourse to laboratory testing, and the capacity available for such testing is now sufficient.
So what is the Commission' s opinion?
We would not say that the situation is satisfactory, because in this specific case it is not, but the risk of the disease spreading to other Member States is now much less than it was in March and April, when the disease was at its peak, because all the restrictions that were imposed, in particular on the movement of animals and untreated products from Great Britain, are still in place.
We are carrying out regular on-the-spot inspections, the latest of which goes back to the end of August, in order to satisfy ourselves that the British authorities are taking adequate measures.
Other regions of Great Britain, in some cases quite large regions, have not been affected by the disease, and the Veterinary Committee must continue to consider the matter so that when the time comes, and circumstances make it possible, trade with those regions can be envisaged subject to stringent conditions.
On this point we shall be extremely careful, because the experience of Northumberland reminds us that the risk is still present, even in those areas where it seemed that the disease had been brought under control.
To come back for a moment to the question of third countries, if Mrs Lucas will allow me, a certain number of countries have continued to take discriminatory measures against European products, which go beyond the international standards currently in force, and we are working on this matter together with a certain number of our trading partners.
Many third countries have gradually lifted the somewhat extensive prohibitions that they had initially imposed. Others, by contrast, such as the United States, Canada and even some of the countries which have applied for accession, have been slow to lift the restrictions, which they still maintain, wrongly, even today.
We shall continue to work on this question, taking as our basis the WTO Agreement on Health and Plant Health.
Speaking more generally, it should be emphasised, first of all, that this crisis has had major repercussions on the Community budget.
We decided to grant an overall budget of EUR 400 million to the four Member States affected this year, and the latest forecasts show that the Union' s anticipated financial contribution will be slightly more than EUR 1.5 billion.
We shall take the necessary measures from the point of view of budgetary procedure.
There is no doubt that this is an exceptional situation. We do not know how to predict the budget for epizootics on this scale, and we shall therefore have to make adjustments as we go along.
That is just one aspect of this issue.
A second aspect, of course, is the damage done to the image of our livestock farming industry, following the slaughter of almost four million animals.
A third aspect is the fact that the problem, as has already been mentioned, is also present outside the European Union, and we are seriously worried following the recent appearance of a case in Turkish Thrace.
Finally, we at the Commission hope that we shall be able to learn some lessons for future use, with regard to the handling of this sort of crisis, so that we can improve our current regulatory and legislative system, for example by making provision for a certain number of additional requirements for intra-Community trade in small ruminants, such as restricting the number of stopping points, which would probably be the first step.
We are also working on a proposal regarding the identification and registration of sheep and goats, and on another proposal regarding the importing of animal products by travellers.
We are also working towards adjusting our inspection procedures when this type of epizootic appears.
I believe that we now have sufficient experience, but we must not delude ourselves.
The reinforcement of our legislation and of our systems, however necessary it may be, will not, on its own, be enough to prevent the reappearance of such an epidemic.
We must also improve the operation of the veterinary services within Member States, and there is not doubt that we must also change our farming practices.
My last point is one that several Members have drawn attention to during our discussions, and that is the question of vaccination.
As far as the use of so-called 'ring' vaccination around infected holdings is concerned, I should like to remind those of you who have sought to implicate the Commission by asking why the Commission did not order compulsory vaccination as a matter of urgency, that in our present legal system, which whatever any one says is characterised by certain forms of subsidiarity, vaccination is the responsibility of the national authorities.
There is therefore a procedure which allows any Member State that wants to to use vaccination, and that is how it is done.
The system exists and it is at the disposal of the Member States, but it is not the Commission' s responsibility.
I believe that I have thus given a clear answer to the questions raised by Mr van Dam, Mr Martinez, Mr Mulder and Mrs Lucas.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Human rights
Mr President, the abolition, in October 2000, of the main opposition party in Mauritania, the Union of Democratic Forces-New Era, and the arrest and subsequent sentencing, to five years' imprisonment after a summary judgment, of the leader of the Popular Front, Chbih Melainine, calls into question the fundamental principles of democracy laid down in the constitution of Mauritania.
What, then, is that constitution worth?
There is no freedom of association for political parties.
The Green Party, which submitted its articles of association several months ago, has still not been recognised and has not even received an acknowledgement that its application has been received.
These anti-democratic manoeuvres are taking place on the eve of the legislative and local elections planned for October.
We have no guarantee regarding these elections, because there is no independent electoral commission.
In our opinion, the release of Chbih Melainine is a prerequisite for holding the elections in October, as is the reconstitution of all the opposition parties.
It is in order to allow all these political actors to participate that we are asking that the elections should be postponed.
In order to re-establish democracy and guarantee the organisation of free and fair elections in Mauritania, we are asking the Council and the Commission to enter into consultations with the government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mauritania is preparing thoroughly for the elections in October.
Political opponents of the regime are being neutralised.
People are being arbitrarily arrested, excessive force is being used against peaceful demonstrators and the press now serves only as the president' s lackey.
The judiciary is again entirely at the disposal of those with political power.
Their Honours recently sentenced the principal political opponents of the president in a show trial to no less than five years in prison.
The imprisoned politicians were kept incommunicado for a long period and then taken to prison 800 km from the capital, so that they can receive almost no visitors.
It appears that no one can do anything to stop this.
Independent human rights organisations can scarcely operate in the country.
While Western countries are obliged to apologise in Durban for the slave trade conducted by their distant ancestors, slavery is still common practice in Mauritania.
In the caste system, people become serfs at birth.
They receive no education; no income from forced labour and are not allowed to marry without the permission of their master.
According to an estimate by the American State Department a few years ago, there are still some 90 000 slaves in Mauritania.
As recently as 1983, this country was the last on earth to abolish slavery officially, but still does its utmost to keep the gruesome reality hidden from the outside world.
It is high time that the European Union opened the consultative procedure of Article 96 with Mauritania.
We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem.
We must prepare for pseudo-elections in a pseudo-democracy.
Mr President, Mauritania is a vast country and almost 90% of its land is desert.
Water is a scarce resource and its 2.2 million people are poor and live in rural areas.
It depends on its exports of iron ore and fishing - just two things.
I was invited in May of this year to lead a small delegation of MEPs and visit Mauritania, which I did.
I spent a week with parliamentarians, all the ministers, President Taya, civil society and NGOs.
We travelled up and down the country - a week is a long time to be in Mauritania.
Mrs Sudre and Mrs Langenhagen came with me.
I was impressed by what President Taya has done over the years in a country as poor as this.
I am astonished - and I want to embarrass him and his government, which I shall do at the ACP Conference when their delegates come - that there is now this sad case of locking up the opposition.
There is no reason for it, there is no need.
He is quite strong, he is quite popular.
He has done well.
He can do well without locking up his opposition.
As far as slavery is concerned, it is actually banned in Islam and Mauritania is a Muslim country.
There are Moors, there are blacks and various mixtures of these two.
I saw their lifestyle.
I did not see any slaves, though that is not to say they are not there.
What I shall certainly do is embarrass the government of Mauritania at the ACP Conference to make sure this practice does not continue and the opposition is allowed to operate freely so that there is accountability of the ministers.
It is better for the president of the country and the people of the country.
Mr President, the situation in Mauritania is actually getting worse and worse.
We are talking about a country that falls within the ACP framework in relation to the European Union and which, furthermore, hopes to move on from its current observer status to becoming a full member of the Barcelona process.
We are obliged to remind the Mauritanian authorities that it is impossible for the European Union to envisage, for example, that country acquiring full member status in the Barcelona process if democracy does not become a reality, if human rights continue to be violated and, what is more, if the date is maintained for the municipal and legislative elections which, as things stand at the moment, will take place this October without any type of guarantee.
There is clearly little chance of dissolved parties and imprisoned opposition leaders being able to participate when, furthermore, they have nowhere to express themselves because the press is either overseen by the government or simply does not exist.
I shudder to think about the situation of that one Member of Parliament who does not belong to the government party in an assembly of 79 seats, but I imagine that if any opposition Member were elected in these elections - which will not happen - he would probably soon be sent from Parliament to jail.
I therefore think that the European Union must implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
Mauritania lowers the already low average level of democracy and human rights in the Maghreb.
However, it is clearly just one more case on a continent such as Africa, where human rights are constantly violated.
Mauritania is a country where the permanent dictator, not the dictator of the moment, President Mauya Uld Sid'Ahmed Taya, has just torn up all the rules which, with the mediation of the European Union, the opposition and the government had established for proper elections, elections furthermore which have been delayed indefinitely.
I believe that the Union must act decisively.
Togo
Mr President, two years ago, my first speech to this House condemned the situation in Togo.
Since then, although some good souls have assured us that everything is working out nicely, Togo is still living in a political wasteland and it has a long way to go before it escapes from it.
Democracy is still a fleeting ideal.
Civil rights and human rights are constantly flouted, and I believe that the passive attitude of the governments of European Union Member States does nothing to encourage things to change.
Parliament' s regular condemnations are merely rhetorical and ineffective.
Most recently, the sum paid by the Commission to organise new elections - CFA francs 4 billion - was dismissed as insufficient by the government, which took advantage of the opportunity to postpone, yet again, the long-awaited legislative elections.
In a complete violation of his previous undertakings, President Eyadema and his government are even thinking about amending the constitution so as to allow him stand for election again.
Finally, one of the opposition leaders, Mr Yawovi Agboyibo, was arrested and sentenced, a month ago, on trumped-up charges.
The truth of the matter is that he had denounced the terror tactics employed in areas where the opposition had a majority, tactics which took the form of rapes and other crimes, including the murder of opponents.
Mr Eyadema seems less than ever prepared to honour his obligations to his people and his obligations to the international community.
Here again, Parliament should firmly condemn his actions, demand that free elections be held on the planned dates, and ask the Council and the Commission to initiate consultations in accordance with Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
How do you stay in power for 34 years in Africa?
Opposition parties are banned or it is made impossible for them to function.
Opponents who have or threaten to acquire support are put behind bars.
The press is completely manipulated and anyone openly criticising the president winds up in a cell if he is lucky and six feet under if he is less fortunate.
Mass demonstrations are mercilessly broken up.
The political class consists entirely of slavish servants of the president as a result of a system of rewards and punishments.
A ludicrous cult of personality is designed to give the Head of State a quasi-divine status.
The French President, Mr Chirac, has to be hoodwinked to such an extent that he condemns Amnesty International instead of the human rights violations in Togo.
The murdering of opponents of the regime goes unpunished.
This is still unfortunately the familiar pattern in many African countries and we do not really know how to deal with it.
Crude misuse of power hampers development and perpetuates poverty.
The European Union quite rightly suspended aid as long ago as 1993, but the situation has not improved.
On the contrary, the opposition leader and human rights campaigner, Mr Agboyibo, was thrown into jail for six months, for allegedly insulting the Prime Minister.
In order to add force to his arguments his Excellency maintains a private army of 1 000 troops.
Togo is asking for financial support to hold parliamentary elections in October.
The question is whether or not we would then contribute to the organisation of a democratic farce, designed solely to give those in power a semblance of legitimacy.
President Eyadema has announced that he will keep to the constitution and step down in 2003, but why should we believe someone who has lied for 34 years in order to stay in power?
Mr President, Zimbabwe, Mauritania, Togo, it looks very much as if the democratisation process in Africa is in reverse.
Some leaders are indeed proving exceptionally creative in eliminating their political opponents and getting round the democratic rules of the game.
One of them is General Eyadema from Togo.
At the last elections in 1998 he did not hesitate to have the counting of votes stopped and himself again proclaimed president.
A period of bloody repression followed, in which, according to Amnesty, hundreds of people were killed.
An international committee confirmed those findings, but at the present moment, no one has yet been called to account or punished.
On the contrary, the repression is simply continuing.
The latest victim is opposition leader, Mr Agboyibo.
Last month in a show trial, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for spreading false information.
I have met Yawovi Agboyibo several times personally in his home base.
I have developed a very great admiration for the way in which, at the constant risk of his own life, he continues to campaign for human rights and the restoration of democracy in his country.
This must be stopped in some way.
Maintaining the suspension of aid is one thing, but I believe that we must ask ourselves whether a country like Togo still belongs at conferences of the ACS and the European Union.
However, the problem is that, just as in the case of Zimbabwe, certain European states follow their own agenda for the sake of commercial or other interests and, in so doing, run counter to the European strategy towards Togo.
It is not enough to establish fine principles in an agreement.
They must also be applied consistently and that also applies to a country like France.
Mr President, the resolution calls for the release of Yawovi Agboyibo, the opponent of the dictator, General Eyadema.
We support this resolution in that respect, but we wish to make it clear that those who approve the policies of the great Western powers are not in a position to be indignant now, because this dictatorship, which has oppressed the people of Togo since 1967, could not have persisted without the support of the great powers, and particularly of France.
One might therefore question the usefulness of a resolution adopted by Parliament, when the present dictator is then welcomed with as an honoured guest of our governments, and when he continues to receive subsidies that allow him to buy the arms that keep him in power.
Cambodia
Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that the political situation in Kampuchea is calmer at this moment than it has ever been and it is equally clear that the country is still a long way from being a real democracy.
Much support is still required on the slow road to democracy, and the local elections will be an extremely important moment in that process.
The Kampuchean People' s Party, which controls the country, is an old-style Communist party, which means that it as a party is directly or indirectly involved in everything, in every sector, at every level in that country.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the local elections should be considered a threat and that they have been repeatedly postponed.
It is therefore essential that we continue to exert international pressure on the government to do everything possible to create a violence-free period before the elections and to reopen the procedure for voter registration.
Voter registration is in the hands of the village headmen, who are appointed by the central committee of the Kampuchean People' s Party, and nothing is simpler than to give poll cards to those in favour of the government and withhold them from those opposed to it.
Only last Monday, the leader of the opposition, the Member of Parliament, Sam Rainsy, had a meeting with the local representative of the European Commission, who in that conversation, was able to make the point that we have a very positive attitude to the National Election Committee.
I am far from being so enthusiastic.
We must watch that National Election Committee very closely, since it is at the crux of whether or not the elections are being conducted fairly.
The European Union has little cause to be proud of the way in which we observed the elections in Kampuchea last time, and we must do a lot better this time.
Mr President, Cambodia has been through a black period, a bloody period, a period in which nearly three million people were sacrificed to Marxist ideology.
During this period, there were two people who personified the hope for freedom, Son San, the important democrat, who often visited us here in Strasbourg and who has since died, and King Sihanouk, who is now an old, ill man.
That is why this country needs to be renewed from the roots upwards and young, democratic forces need to be supported.
This can only be done through the communes, it can only be done through democratic local elections from the roots upwards.
That is why it is so important for us to support and back the numerous candidates in the communes, for us to ensure that fair local elections are held, for us to monitor efficiently, for us to ward off, prevent and correct any jiggery-pokery during registration.
As for the Criminal Tribunal, we must state quite clearly that this is not a question of revenge, it is a question of law.
We must state quite clearly to future offenders that acts of violence, genocide and mass murder will be ruthlessly punished on the basis of the rule of law, irrespective of who is responsible.
That is why we need the International Tribunal to have a large Cambodian contingent, so that it is seen not as a foreign court but as a court of the Cambodian people.
Mr President, in our memories Kampuchea will always remain the country of the 'Killing Fields' .
The period of terror still casts a shadow over the country.
Even now, with elections in prospect, the democratic process turns out not to be proceeding completely smoothly.
On the contrary, restrictions have been imposed on the opposition.
There is increasing violence.
Voter registration has been halted, so that 30% of the electorate cannot even take part in the elections.
There is the lack of legal guarantees in the special tribunal, and so on. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for the European Union, or the democratic world, to do our utmost to keep watch and to help guide the country towards democracy.
It would surely be positive if at least one guarantee could be given.
Something concrete, namely that voter registration will be reopened, so that the hope of a democratic result is not completely dashed in advance.
Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia
Mr President, the crisis concerning the boat full of Afghan refugees off Australia again calls attention to the whole problem of Afghan refugees.
In the last 20 years, millions of people have fled Afghanistan and, according to the UN human rights organisation, approximately 6.2 million Afghans are classified as refugees.
Their first port of call when they leave the country is generally one of the refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran, where they live in appalling conditions.
Pakistan can no longer cope with the number of refugees and is sending them back to Afghanistan.
Outside the refugee camps, there are so-called travel agents waiting who send refugees with money on to other countries, and the cheapest fare to a Western country is now a journey to Australia, which costs approximately EUR 6 000.
This stream of refugees will not stop if we do not manage to receive the refugees properly near Afghanistan and that is what we as the European Union must put our money into. This is the solution to the problem.
As long as people are living there in dreadful conditions, they will want to go on fleeing to Western countries.
Ladies and gentlemen, the fate of the Afghan refugees on their desperate quest for a chance of a new life provides a predominantly depressing story, were it not for the actions of the captain of the Norwegian ship Tampa.
Not only did he rescue the people from a sinking ship, but subsequently too he consistently took the side of the people.
It is thanks to such humanitarian help that we can retain a vague hope in a better future.
For this reason, our group feels that a legal obligation should be introduced to allow the stowaways ashore at the first port of call, in agreement with the 1957 Treaty on stowaways.
As a result of the clash between the various spheres of law, the refugees become the exhausted pawns in a game of passing the buck.
Consequently, it must be clearly stated that Australia' s actions in this matter have been far from praiseworthy.
Local political interests have taken precedence over the respecting of human rights.
Through its actions, Australia supports and finances the source of the problems with which the country is confronted.
Too little attention is paid to the cause.
The main responsibility for this drama lies with the Taliban regime, which is systematically destroying its own country and killing the spirit of its own population, so that migrations of people have become a necessary evil.
In this matter, we have an international political humanitarian responsibility.
We might have wished that Australia would use its political weight to condemn the regime in Afghanistan and to spur the international community on to constructive action.
Mr President, I think any of us can understand why people should flee Afghanistan. Not only because of the repressive and fanatical nature of a regime which denies women and children education, work and even medical care, but also because of the deterioration of the economic situation which that fanatical regime is causing in the country.
We therefore perfectly understand the almost 500 people which tried to flee, at risk of their lives, and came up against a brick wall erected by a country such as Australia, a rich country which could have taken them in from the outset without any problem.
I believe that we should acknowledge the courage of the captain of the Norwegian freighter, Arne Rinnan, who, without thinking of the consequences and led only by humanitarian considerations, immediately picked up these people, who were in danger of drowning.
In contrast, we must strongly criticise a country which, like any of our countries, is obliged to take in a ship which was sailing in it waters with almost 500 people in a situation as precarious as that of these refugees.
Rules must be laid down to prevent this type of situation.
I know that it is not easy, that there are increasing numbers of refugees, that poverty is spreading and is the reason why many people are seeking a better life, but I believe that the attitude of Australia must not be imitated by any country towards any group of refugees who, under the protection of the United Nations Convention of 1951, are asking to be allowed to survive.
Mr President, we were negotiating the motion for a resolution on Afghan refugees when, at precisely that time, a Turkish ship approached Greek waters and threw 350 people into the sea.
215 of them have been picked up and more than a hundred are still being sought, and we do not know if they have drowned or if they have been able to survive.
In fact, a former European Commissioner and Member of this Parliament, the current Greek Minister for the Merchant Navy, Christos Papoutzis, has highlighted the irresponsibility of the Turkish government in allowing a situation such as this to come about.
As the Member who has just spoken has said, we are undergoing a universal process of globalisation.
The phenomenon of illegal immigration is not confined to one part of the world. The European Union, to be specific, is currently seeing the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants, and since Commissioner Lamy is here, and he has been so concerned with the problems of globalisation, I would like to say that I believe we are dealing with another aspect of the phenomenon of that globalisation.
Just as capital and goods are being moved about freely, it seems that people also want to move about freely.
As Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez has said, this is not an issue which is easily resolved, but I believe we could do something from here on many levels.
On the most general level there would be a regulation of the international economy that includes population movements.
And on more specific levels it would mean action by the institutions of the European Union to try to regulate this illegal immigration.
This very week, this summer, on the island where I live, we have seen the bodies of illegal immigrants who have been flung from the boats on which they were arriving by Moroccan skippers who form genuine mafias.
The question should be put to the Commission of what measures the European Union is preparing for action within its own territory and what measures it is proposing on an international level.
I believe that we must act in our own territory, and in the area of neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, which are sending us illegal immigrants, and on an international level, by establishing regulations of a general nature.
I do not believe that responsibility on the issue of the Afghan refugees should fall exclusively to Australia.
Responsibility also falls, for example, to the Indonesian government because it was from there that the original boat sailed, the crew was Indonesian, it all began in waters under Indonesian jurisdiction and it seems that nobody is remembering to state this type of responsibility at the moment.
I believe that international action is required in this case and I believe that this would be an excellent opportunity for the European Commission to implement an initiative, I repeat, not only in the closer area of our neighbours, but also on an international level, with a view to achieving the regulation of migratory flows and illegal immigration.
Mr President, in August the Norwegian freighter Tampa rescued 433 Afghans and four Indonesian crew members from a fishing vessel that had set sail from an Indonesian port.
The captain was given permission to proceed to the Indonesian port of Merak, after which he was put under duress by the passengers with threatened suicides and forced to sail towards Australian waters.
It is believed that many of these passengers set out from a refugee camp in Pakistan, paying about GBP 4 500 each to be taken illegally to Australia.
Apparently the going rate for Germany is GBP 7 000 and Britain, the destiny of choice, is GBP 10 000.
The Australian government was perfectly entitled to exercise its sovereign right under the law of the sea to secure its borders by refusing the ship access to Australian waters.
Nor do its obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention apply until an asylum seeker is actually present on its territory.
The convention itself, introduced before the age of cheap mass jet travel, was a response to the horrors of Nazism and designed to protect the principle of asylum.
However, as we are all aware, it is increasingly abused by economic migrants who pass through several safe but poor countries in order to reach rich countries to settle in, where it can lead to people-trafficking, prostitution and a black economy in jobs.
In Britain over 100 000 people claimed asylum last year and the great majority of these claims were unfounded.
But it remains profitable for criminal people-traffickers to ply their trade because appeals can be strung out for years and, even when unsuccessful, almost no-one is deported back to their country of origin.
Australia's problem is also our problem.
We need urgently to face up to the need to secure our borders and remove those who enter illegally.
There is widespread concern.
The EU should urgently develop new policies in this area.
We also need to exert severe pressure on those countries which refuse to take back their own nationals.
In fact we need to totally renegotiate the 1951 Geneva Convention and think again.
I salute Prime Minister Howard of Australia's robust and courageous stance over this issue.
Mr President, the European Parliament is calling upon the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to facilitate the activities of voluntary organisations when it comes to supplying food and urgent humanitarian aid to the Afghan people.
Why are thousands of people fleeing in droves from Afghanistan?
What kind of regime is it that is governing the country?
The Christian aid organisation, Shelter Now International has just recently been excluded from Afghanistan and forced to discontinue its activities.
Eight of its employees - including four from an EU country, Germany, two from the United States and two from Australia - have this week been put on trial in Kabul for alleged Christian missionary activity.
The prosecutor is demanding the death penalty.
Sixteen Afghans are also being put on trial in accordance with the same Muslim law and threatened with the death penalty for having converted people from Islam to Christianity.
Mr Patten, Mr Michel and also Mr Solana are acting to protect these people.
Mr President, may I begin by saying that I cannot agree with anyone who suggests that the claims of most of the people who have been processed in the system in the United Kingdom are found to be fraudulent.
I would like to distance myself from statements like that.
It misrepresents the position of people in Britain who do not understand the kind of attitude that we heard here earlier this afternoon.
We are glad that after eight days of sitting under tarpaulins in the hot sun and inside containers, the Afghan refugees are now at least in reasonable conditions on board the ship on a long voyage to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea.
It has been an extremely tragic incident and terrible to watch and to think of their suffering.
But more than anything it teaches us that the 50-year old asylum-seeking system instigated by the United Nations is not working any more.
It is creaking under the strain of the mass movement of 21 million migrants a year.
The desperation of the people on the Tampa is clear.
To suggest that people take this kind of action lightly is ridiculous.
They take terrible risks with their lives and the lives of their children in order to escape persecution or penury.
They cross the seas in inflatable boats, they cling to the underside of trains like the Eurostar and jumbo jets.
The suffering of the refugees on the Tampa should at least lead all the governments that we represent here to rethink the way that they implement the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees.
Finally, I would say that the first thing we have to try and do is to ensure that it is governments, rather than organised criminals, that determine where refugees finally end up.
Attack on a train in Angola
Mr President, the attack on a train, which caused the death of 260 civilians and injured more than 150 people on 10 August in Angola is unacceptable and deplorable, especially since, in the weeks that followed, several buses also came under fatal attack.
Once again, it was UNITA which struck the blow, thereby continuing to violate the peace agreement signed in Lusaka in 1994, which made provision, amongst other things, for the disarming of the militant rebels.
Unfortunately, these acts of terrorism are merely one further stage in the civil war that has been ravaging the country for more than 25 years. Above all, however, these extremely violent acts against civilians only serve to postpone even further the prospect of organising the elections planned by the government for 2002-2003.
When he announced, on 23 August, his intention not to stand in the presidential elections, President dos Santos threw the ball back into the rebels' court.
He says that he is prepared to hold free and democratic elections, provided that the war comes to an end.
The pause in the fighting and the restoration of a peaceful climate are due, according to him, to Mr Savimbi and his militant movement.
Yet Mr Savimbi, the leader of UNITA, says that he wants to negotiate.
In reality, of course, sitting comfortably on his diamonds, he wants only one thing: all the power.
We are also responsible here, because who is it who supplies UNITA with arms?
Who is it who participates in this diamond trafficking?
As for the government, it is not transparent either.
The lack of transparency in the management of petroleum revenue leads us to conclude that public funds have been used to back up the regime.
The Angolagate scandal has revealed the role of Europeans in this affair.
The violence has to stop, and dialogue must be initiated as a matter of urgency.
Angolans must vote for and achieve peace.
The European Union can make its influence felt, and it has a role to play here.
It should be reminded of that fact, and we must vote in favour of this resolution in order to go forward.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, once again, in this Parliament, we are discussing Angola.
News comes through on a regular basis and is always sad.
The latest report describes an attack on three passenger vehicles in southern Kwanza last Sunday, in which dozens of people were killed.
No one has yet claimed responsibility for this attack.
Previous to this, there had been the attack on the train we are condemning today, which caused the deaths of more than two hundred people and for which UNITA claimed responsibility.
Lives have been wasted and innocent blood has been spilled in a bout of violence that we can only condemn.
We condemn UNITA today with the same independence with which, in February, we condemned the MPLA and the Angolan government for persecuting journalists.
More important, however, than condemning those who stubbornly continue to wage war, and criticising both sides, which undoubtedly deserve our criticism for pursuing this path of confrontation, the most important and most useful thing may be to foster peace.
This Parliament can contribute to encouraging all those in Angola tired of war and wanting a better future.
Along with many other Members of this House, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I signed a proposal to award the Sakharov prize to Zacarias Kamuenho, Archbishop of Huambo and Chairman of the Episcopal Conference of Angola and SÃ£o TomÃ©.
I urge all of you to use this gesture as a means to give courage to all those in Angola who wish to see peace prevail.
Mr President, the appalling terrorist attacks that Mr Savimbi' s UNITA has been carrying out in Angola, first in Caxito, then on a train, and then on cars, schools and hospitals, warrant our sternest condemnation, because they mainly affect the civilian population.
These are some of the most violent and reprehensible terrorist acts in living memory.
I therefore feel that the European Parliament too must express its repudiation of such acts in the most forceful terms, as the rest of the international community and, in particular, the other Community institutions have done by unequivocally condemning such barbarity.
All the same, and if any doubts could possibly remain, these acts have brutally shown the correct nature of the positions that have been successively adopted by the international community which, with a single voice, has called for and is implementing the isolation of UNITA and the imposition of sanctions on it.
That organisation had already given sufficient proof of being largely responsible for the tragic situation affecting Angola and its people, through its rejection of election results, obstructing the disarming of its forces and, more generally, through waging war and not respecting and even blocking the implementation of agreements that they themselves have signed.
Now, however, with such acts of vandalism, UNITA is revealing its true colours even more clearly and there is no longer room for any doubt, however small, as to the nature and the objectives of this organisation.
This is why there are even fewer grounds for holding equivocal positions, particularly where the European Parliament is concerned.
Any positions or initiatives, particularly when formulated by friends of UNITA such as Mr Ribeiro and Castro, which tend to condone, exonerate or divert attention from the huge responsibilities of UNITA in the tragic situation that Angola is experiencing are completely unacceptable. This applies also, and especially, to those that tend to place the legitimate government of Angola on an equal footing with this type of terrorist organisation.
As a matter of fact, it is now clearer than ever that any path to peace in Angola requires holding UNITA responsible, ensuring its political and diplomatic isolation, ending the diamond trade that sustains it and disarming it for good.
Having said this, I should just like to say a few words about the motion for a resolution that we shall be voting on next.
Its approval, despite the odd provision that is not worthy of adoption and is not essential, would be a positive development in that it would enable the European Parliament to adopt its traditional position of aligning itself with the international community and with the other Community institutions on this matter.
In particular, I would like to emphasise the correctness of the decision adopted by the resolution to call the acts that UNITA has recently been perpetrating 'terrorist' acts.
This is the right word to describe them and all concomitant conclusions should be drawn from that.
Mr President, I wish to respond to a personal remark which I consider to be unacceptable and, in this context, insulting.
I fully and vehemently repudiate this disgraceful insinuation, and furthermore the quite shameful and unbecoming statement from the benches of the Communist Party, which is more responsible than anyone for the war in Angola, that I am a friend of UNITA.
I wish to state quite categorically that I vehemently condemn the attacks on civilians but I understand the situation in Angola. I do not do favours for the diamond dealers or the oilmen or for Angola' s corrupt administration, which is largely responsible for what is happening and for the suffering of the Angolan people.
Mr Miranda should be ashamed of what he says and what he does, particularly because he is chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation and should be making a more responsible contribution to promoting a cease-fire and dialogue, which is what the Angolan people are asking us to do.
Mr President, allow me to take up the various points which have been mentioned during this debate, and to let you know the Commission' s position.
On the subject of Mauritania, first of all, we share the concerns that have been expressed regarding respect for human rights in Mauritania.
In recent years we have observed some progress.
This has now come to an end, and we are experiencing a period of sudden backward steps.
Like the Members who have spoken during the debate, we believe that the Union cannot remain silent in the face of the imprisonment of the leader of the opposition, Mr Chbih, in the conditions that we are aware of and in particular in the period leading up to the elections.
Therefore we, like you, believe that steps should be taken to ask for the release of Mr Chbih while the result of his appeal to the court of cassation is awaited, at the same time using this opportunity to remind the authorities of the principles to which the Union is committed with regard to the electoral process.
The release of Mr Chbih and the holding of the elections this coming October are our two priorities.
On the subject of Togo, again we share your concern, both about the imprisonment of a local journalist in May and about the imprisonment of the two leaders of the opposition parties, Mr Olympio in June, and Mr Agboyibo just recently.
All these names and all these facts have been mentioned, in particular by Mr Rod.
We should like to follow up our approach to the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 August, when once again we expressed our concerns to the Togolese government.
At the time, I believe that we got a clear message across, to the effect that, from the point of view of the Union, the political parties and the media must be able to continue their activities without restrictions.
So far, our approach has not had any effect.
We believe that the statement made in August by the Prime Minister, in which he mentioned the need to postpone the elections and proposed that the electoral code should be amended, which some Members have mentioned, is not good news and does not help to create a climate which is conducive to the conducting of transparent, free and democratic elections.
On this subject we have noted with satisfaction the statement made by President Eyadema, in which he said that on this point the Prime Minister' s proposals committed only the Prime Minister himself, whereas he, the President, intended to respect the constitution and abide by the undertakings given under the LomÃ© Convention.
We are continuing to monitor the political and economic situation and we shall maintain our position, to the effect that we can render assistance to the electoral process by helping the government to create the necessary conditions, notwithstanding the suspension of our cooperation with Togo which, as you know, was decided on under the provisions of the LomÃ© Convention, which corresponds to what would now be Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.
From this point of view, Mr Rod, we are already past the Article 96 stage.
The Union has also responded positively to the invitation from the Togolese Minister for Foreign Affairs to participate in a mission to observe the elections.
If the United Nations decided to take on the task of coordinating such an observer mission, we would not have any objections.
However, the conditions for organising and implementing such an observer mission still have to be determined.
If it is decided to go ahead with such a mission, obviously Parliament' s participation in that mission would be welcome.
As for human rights in Cambodia, the Commission and the Member States have been officially invited by Cambodia to nominate and dispatch observers to monitor the local elections.
With this in mind, we have sent a fact-finding mission.
The conclusions and recommendations of that mission will be examined by the Council during September, so as to decide whether or not we should organise a Community observer mission to monitor the local elections.
We are also ready to assist in the smooth running of those elections by means of technical assistance projects.
On the question of electoral registration, Mrs Maes, the latest figures available to us indicate that the overall rate of registration is just over 80%, which is an improvement on the previous figures, though 100% registration has still not been achieved.
As for the question of how we should deal with the past, which some of you have mentioned, I would remind you that we support without reservation the efforts of the United Nations and of the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia to reach an agreement concerning the court responsible for the Khmer Rouge trials.
On the subject of the Afghan refugees seeking asylum in Australia, we, like Mrs Kinnock, are relieved that a solution has been found which will provide the help and protection needed by those people, men, women and children, who are fleeing from one of the most intolerant of all regimes.
If I have understood you correctly, your speeches were not intended to put any particular third country in the dock, but rather to consider whether, in the context of the present system of international governance, there are any remedies that would enable us to handle this type of situation better.
You are right, we cannot remain insensitive.
We all know that there are other ships carrying other fugitives from misery, often in the most appalling conditions, and that these ships arrive, some of them off the coasts of Europe.
This is not a question of 'the rest of the world' , from which we can remain detached, any more it is a question of looking at it purely in the light of the problems that it may give rise to elsewhere.
There is clearly a growing malaise in the international community with regard to forced migration, whether it is of economic, political or criminal origin, because this is how we must describe the organised networks trafficking in human beings.
Mr Medina Ortega, we share the desire which you and other Members have expressed for international instruments to be adopted which will be able to prevent and settle such cases, and also your desire at least to update and amend the 1951 Convention so that it can cope with the present situation, which is not the same as it was in the 1950s.
From this point of view, we support the efforts initiated by the High Commissioner for Refugees, which were announced on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of that Convention.
The High Commissioner for Refugees played an important role in dealing with the crisis involving the Tampa, and I believe that we should all encourage the Commissioner to put this type of problem on the agenda of the consultations which, following the Geneva Conference in December, should enable us to update our rules, because that is what they are, international rules.
We must also remember the importance of the protocols on trafficking in human beings which are annexed to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime of December 2000.
The Community is itself a party to those protocols which, when they come into force, after a certain number of ratifications, will improve the joint framework that we have at our disposal in order to combat such crime.
As far as the Union itself is concerned, and we really are concerned, as I have said, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council provided the basis for a common policy on asylum and immigration.
I believe that the Union, by means of these instruments and various declarations, has repeated its commitment and that of its Member States to a humanitarian tradition which should take the form of the creation of a common asylum regime which provides appropriate protection to any person who needs it, and which guarantees the principle of not turning people away.
Of course, this will not work without preventive measures in the countries and regions of origin.
We took a step in the right direction here when the Council adopted a certain number of action plans prepared by the immigration and asylum group.
One of these plans is specifically targeted at Afghanistan and neighbouring regions.
If it proves to be ineffective, we shall have to look at it again, and we shall rely on Parliament to point us in that direction.
As far as trafficking in human beings is concerned, we need to strengthen the action taken by the Union, especially in cases where the victims are able to benefit from international protection.
Here too, the Commission takes the view that a more systematic and coherent approach is needed.
We shall shortly be taking action with a view to achieving this, by issuing a communication.
This is all turning into a timetable of action for the Union.
Work has started within the Council.
To be perfectly honest, we think that things are proceeding very slowly, but this is only to be expected given the sensitive nature of these issues from the point of view of Member States.
No doubt we shall need fresh impetus at an appropriately high political level, probably at the European Council in Laeken.
At any rate, that is what the Presidency seems to think.
It goes without saying that Parliament' s support in this matter will, we are sure, enable us to proceed in the right direction.
Finally, on the subject of the attack on a train in Angola, there is not much that I can add.
Much of what has been said we can all agree on anyway.
Like you, the Commission is very concerned about the continuation of this war, and deplores the fact that these confrontations are intensifying and that, yet again, several hundred civilians have been killed in various regions of the country over the last few weeks.
We are absolutely determined to support the efforts being taken, in accordance with the Union' s common position, to find a political solution to the conflict in Angola.
I did not get the impression, from your speeches, that you are seriously critical of that common position.
We are therefore working towards implementing it, by supporting any proposal which seeks to support the initiatives being made by the African Union - and there are some - or by African regional organisations such as the Southern Africa Development Community, with a view to developing the systems which have been set up on the initiative of African countries in order to prevent and resolve conflicts.
I would remind you that we are continuing our humanitarian aid to Angola, which is substantial, and that we are consequently ready to adjust the nature and the scale of that humanitarian aid.
Mr President, I was not present at the debate because I was attending the Conference of Presidents, but someone came to tell me that a member of my group, Mr Miranda, was literally the subject of verbal aggression on the part of another Member.
I regard such methods as inadmissible.
It was more than a personal accusation, and that is why, Mr President, I should like you to allow Mr Miranda to take the floor, and to ensure that his restatement is included in the minutes.
Mr Wurtz, you were not present.
First of all, it was Mr Miranda who attacked the other Member and I allowed the other Member to speak briefly in order to reply.
That is the end of the matter because if Mr Miranda says something else and Mr Ribeiro e Castro says something else, we may very well be here all day.
Both gentlemen had the chance to speak on the same subject and the final score is therefore 1 all!
Exactly, Mr President, this is a point of order.
I think that you must have not been paying attention, Mr President, when you said, just now, that I was the first to attack Mr Ribeiro e Castro.
This is not true.
In his own speech, which preceded mine, Mr Ribeiro e Castro referred to me in a completely unacceptable way and you said nothing about it, Mr President.
As you will remember, he said that I have manipulated public opinion, that I have manipulated the press, that I have sought to use this Parliament, and he referred specifically to the fact that I am Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation.
What I said in my speech that gave Mr Ribeiro e Castro the pretext for answering in the way he did was simply that some friends of UNITA, specifically Mr Ribeiro e Castro, had gone ahead with certain initiatives.
Mr President, I did not mean any insult by this, because it is public knowledge and widely known that this party, to which Mr Ribeiro e Castro belongs, has clear, public and acknowledged links with UNITA.
This was the precise tenor of what I said and nothing more!
That is why what was said...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I should like to say on a point of order that the President took absolutely the right line because Mr Ribeiro e Castro did not stand up for UNITA; on the contrary, he signed a motion criticising it.
He criticised it in his speech and the President allowed him to respond to your personal attack.
To my mind, therefore, the President took absolutely the right line.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Anti-personnel mines
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0542/2001 by Mr Van Orden and Mr Van Hecke, on behalf of Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;
B5-0561/2001 by Mr van den Berg and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
B5-0568/2001 by Mr Haarder et al, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;
B5-0575/2001 by Mrs Maes and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
B5-0590/2001 by Mr Segni, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group;
. B5-0599/2001 by Mrs Bonino et al
on measures to promote an undertaking by non-governmental actors to ban anti-personnel mines.
The problem of landmines is not only a problem for States.
Long after peace has been concluded, and I hope that even in Angola that will one day be the case, there will still be fields that cannot be walked on, because they are full of mines and therefore put innocent people are at risk.
In 1997, a treaty was concluded banning landmines.
One hundred and forty-nine countries have already signed it. Many countries have ratified it, but 52 have not and they include some of the largest nations.
One of the major problems is that not only regular armies lay the mines, but that terrorist and rebel movements also use them.
That is why it is necessary that they should be urged to stop using landmines.
It is difficult for an official body like ours to involve non-governmental players in the negotiations, but it is good that we as an official body should urge the countries not to stockpile landmines and that we should support the NGOs that are striving to get the terrorist organisations and rebel movements to forsake the use of landmines.
I refer in this context to the appeal of Geneva, which we have heard proposed here this week in our own Parliament.
Mr President, I think everyone is against anti-personnel mines.
On this point, I should like to express my astonishment that this motion for a resolution is addressed to actors other than states.
If the mines are produced and used, they are produced and used with the authorisation of states, and it would be up to those states to give an undertaking that mines will not be produced or used, and I do not even understand the title of such a resolution.
As far as I am concerned, the only interpretation is that Parliament is thus pledging its allegiance to the great powers and the nation states.
Mr President, I shall keep to the topic.
Landmines kill, every day and in many countries.
Landmines are a lethal threat daily in many dozens of countries.
In Kampuchea alone, over 35 000 people have been injured by landmines and those are the survivors.
Every day, mines are removed and every day new ones are laid.
The anti-landmine treaty of 1997 has been ratified by 19 countries and signed by 141.
Countries that have not yet signed include Russia, Yugoslavia, but also Finland, which uses mines to defend its border with Russia.
That is, of course, cheaper and helps bring down the defence budget.
We can understand that.
If Finland can use that argument, however, why not other countries too?
I should therefore like to call on the Member States to force present and future members, as well as countries that receive financial aid from the European Union, to sign the treaty.
Mr President, I speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Van Orden, who is absent today but who for many years has been directly involved in the work of overcoming the scourge of anti-personnel landmines.
Most EU Member States no longer have anti-personnel landmines in the operational armouries of their armed forces.
These weapons have indeed been banned for the past four years.
It is only irresponsible armed forces such as those in former Yugoslavia and armed groups of non-state actors engaged in civil war and insurgency that continue to use these dreadful weapons.
By definition such groups are not party to the Ottawa Convention to ban landmines.
This resolution draws attention to the fact and seeks to find ways in which these groups can be influenced.
This requires very careful consideration as we must take great care that we do not imply any sort of recognition of the legitimacy of these groups or of their actions.
We do not wish to distract EU resources from the priority task of mine clearance and assistance to mine victims.
We wish to bring this matter to the attention of all the states party to the Ottawa Convention that will gather in Managua in Nicaragua later this month.
Mr President, the European Parliament' s position against anti-personnel mines and in favour of their total ban has already been clearly expressed in various resolutions.
The result of Ottawa is due to the work of certain specialised NGOs.
I believe that at the next meeting of the contracting parties to the Convention which will take place in Managua, the European Union should contribute to ensuring that the Convention is signed and ratified by more countries. There are 52 which have not signed it and many who are still to ratify it.
It should also contribute to ensuring that more resources are provided for the complete clearing of mines, since mines which are still buried are causing death and mutilation throughout the world, and the parties involved - State and non-State agents - should be forced to reach an agreement on a total ban of these mines.
Mr President, I will end by asking for recognition and support for the work of NGOs such as the initiative launched by the humanitarian organisation 'Geneva Appeal' and others, which are going to contribute to the disappearance of such a lethal and odious weapon as anti-personnel mines.
Mr President, what are we doing?
I think that is the question that is being asked and the question to which you are asking us to reply.
Well, first of all we have equipped ourselves with a framework of rules for the Union, and just before the summer recess we adopted two regulations against mines, so that we now have legal instruments on the basis of which we shall be able to take effective and coordinated action.
Then at the end of this month we shall be actively participating, together with the presidency, at the meeting in Nicaragua of signatory states to the Ottawa Convention, a meeting which we believe is extremely important, because we shall of course be discussing the challenges posed by the abolition of anti-personnel mines, sharing the practical experiences of those who have been involved in this action and, as most of you have asked us to do, putting pressure on those states which have not yet signed the Convention.
In our view, the objective remains the same and we are determined to achieve it, by obtaining a universal prohibition on the production, stockpiling, movement and use of anti-personnel landmines.
The achieving of this objective and the removal of the risk to which the millions of mines which still have to be removed from areas of conflict throughout the world expose not only human lives, but also economic activities, is chiefly the task of states and governments.
There is no doubt about that.
Unfortunately, it sometimes happens that non-government actors also use anti-personnel landmines in internal conflicts or conflicts between states, and they too bear a responsibility for the suffering and devastation caused to populations and societies by mines
Experience has shown, as you have pointed out, that we need to explore new ways of involving non-governmental agencies in these campaigns against landmines, and of making them subscribe to the objective of a complete ban on such devices.
From this point of view, the Geneva appeal is an initiative with laudable intentions, but we must make sure that any future initiatives of this kind take place in the context of the considerable efforts which have already been undertaken by the international community.
As Parliament knows, the international campaign to prohibit landmines has assumed the form of a worldwide movement which the European Union has supported since the beginning.
This international campaign, in conjunction with a certain number of governmental and non-governmental agreements, has drawn up standards and action programmes which will supplement the international regulations of which the Ottawa Convention is an example.
We would therefore like to see, alongside this international regulatory framework, initiatives being set up to strengthen the action that is being taken within states and civilian society, and we are ready to support them.
We must analyse this Geneva appeal in detail, and encourage those who have instigated it to coordinate their activities closely with the ICBL and with other major agreements, so as to ensure that all the forces that are mobilised towards this objective never run the risk, given the magnitude of what is at stake here, of becoming dispersed.
There is still a lot to be done to consolidate the ambitious demands and objectives that were defined by the Ottawa Convention.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m.
Drought in Central America
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:
B5-0547/2001 by Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra and Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats;
B5-0562/2001 by Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez et al, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists;
B5-0569/2001 by Mr SÃ¡nchez GarcÃ­a and Mr GasÃ²liba i BÃ¶hm, on behalf of the Group the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party;
B5-0574/2001 by Mr Mayol i Raynal et al, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance;
B5-0591/2001 by Mr Marset Campos et al, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left;
B5-0600/2001 by Mr QueirÃ³ and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group
on the drought in Central America.
Mr President, I will not waste part of the one minute I am allowed to convince Members of the extremely grave consequences of the sequence of natural disasters which have taken place in Central America.
However, I will use part of my speaking time to say that this has had short-term consequences.
In brief: one and a half million people are suffering from hunger in the region, not to mention the long-term consequences for sustainable development and the climate.
So far the European institutions have reacted by trying to alleviate the short-term consequences: with emergency aid and with deliveries of food, which have gone some way to alleviating the hunger in the region.
So far we have been incapable of responding to the long-term needs or shortages.
This resolution asks the Commission firstly to take account of these needs when drawing up the 2002 budget. Secondly, that it implement actions which will serve to accelerate and promote a sustainable development policy in the field of agricultural development, which will serve to prevent drought and the long-term consequences which I mentioned previously.
Thirdly, I refer to section 4, relating to a policy of cooperation with the region in the long term, which would help to meet the needs which I stressed before.
Mr President, the truth is that the region of Central America has been suffering for too long.
First there were the death squads and the extreme right governments.
Then, with democracy won thanks to the mediation of the European Union, there were corrupt governments; then there were the catastrophes of Hurricane Mitch, earthquakes and now this drought, which, as has been said, means hunger, misery and death for hundreds of thousands of people.
The European Union must behave with a solidarity which distinguishes it from others, not only by approving budgets for this circumstance, but, as has been said, also for the coming years, by approving important and essential budgets which will eliminate the causes and consequences of this drought.
I drafted the report on the reconstruction of Central America after Hurricane Mitch, and I have seen that the corruption in the area prevents aid from arriving directly.
We therefore recommend that the aid which we grant arrives in the most direct way possible by means of local councils and democratic NGOs.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, every day we see horrifying images of new tragedies which desolate the world: people devastated, children dying from hunger and disease, refugees without refuge, immigrants wandering the world looking for an opportunity to live...
There are tragedies, however, which persist while nobody talks about them, which get worse and fester although they do not make the headlines.
One of those cases filed away in our selective first-world memory is the situation in Central America and the dramatic effects of the drought which has been devastating it for more than three months.
This is a tragedy which is unfolding in a region, as has been said, which is already weakened by constant natural disasters, quite apart from political disasters, and which has a social and economic structure lacking the least resources for resisting them.
El Salvador has declared a state of emergency and Guatemala just yesterday declared a state of public disaster, in a truly desperate attempt to combat hunger.
The drought has destroyed the majority of the crops in the region and hunger is now affecting millions of people, as previous speakers have said.
All of this in an area where an extremely high percentage of inhabitants live in poverty or extreme poverty.
The United Nations world food programme raised the alarm very recently, telling us that if the current situation continues, it will only be able to meet the needs of half of the affected citizens for barely three months.
I therefore draw your attention in particular to the recommendation contained in section 4 which, in relation to that in section 3, seeks to direct our decisions in the field of development aid towards the objective of combating the structural problems.
Only in that way, by investing in sustainable development in the most sensitive areas of the world, will we be able to prevent and alleviate as far as possible the effects of natural disasters, because we will have invested our aid and our resources in the structuring and strengthening of the population and we will have made them stronger so that they can endure the consequences of phenomena which not even we, in the first world, can prevent.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Europe to be able to give out fishing rods, to show people how to fish, rather than to hand out fish.
Mr President, I agree with what other Members have said.
In any event, we in the European Parliament delegation for relations with the countries of Central America were in El Salvador in July and were able to see the consequences of the earthquakes and of Hurricane Mitch.
In fact there is a very important European Union programme for the rehabilitation of institutes in that area; at the moment, however, the worst thing of all, which we were informed of in July, is what is happening as a result of the drought.
I believe that we must envisage two types of aid: immediate aid, to prevent starvation, and a more long-term aid, in order to work towards sustainable development; because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change believes that earthquakes, floods and droughts are going to become increasingly common, and in precisely the poorest parts of the world, which are least able to endure them.
Therefore, I believe that the European Union must use two approaches: immediate aid, which they requested of us when we were there in July, and more long-term aid, in order to prevent what is happening now from happening again.
We are also concerned about the distribution of aid.
It must be very well controlled by the services of the European Commission that are on the ground, so that it may reach the people genuinely affected.
Some complaints have been made about this.
The Commission is of course well aware of the situation described in this resolution.
The current drought in these countries is certainly the worst since the one caused by El NiÃ±o in 1997.
For the moment, however, we believe it is going too far to compare the situation with the one that followed Hurricane Mitch.
There is constant contact between the Commission and the representatives of the countries of Central America, and we believe, along with the representatives of those countries with whom we are working, that the situation is certainly extremely worrying, but that at this stage it is under control, and is unlikely to continue for very long because the rains will soon be returning to most of the areas affected by the drought.
Although the rains are due to return shortly, that should not prevent us from thinking about the real causes of these crises which, as you have all, I believe, pointed out, are due to cyclical factors but also, and above all, to structural factors, including the falling incomes from primary products, especially coffee, the probably inappropriate nature of agricultural policies, and increasingly difficult access for many rural families to production inputs, not to mention the poverty which is undoubtedly rife in all these countries.
With regard to monitoring, I should just like to say that the Commission and the Union now have a network of antennae which enables us to monitor the food situation in all the regions that are susceptible.
One of these antennae is located in Central America and will enable us to be alerted instantly so that we can intervene if necessary.
The heart of the problem, that is, the structural causes of the lack of food security in the region, is the real problem that we will have to face in the medium and long term, as some of you have pointed out.
One of the most important solutions, as we see it, is rural development, and this is already a priority in the Union' s action and cooperation in most of the countries concerned, and we would like to see it strengthened even more by the pooling of efforts, whether that means aid to local governments to enable them to concentrate their development policy in that area, something that we can actually do, or whether it means support for the projects of non-governmental organisations or local communities seeking to diversify production and crop distribution and to create family incomes of another kind, or whether it means coordination with other international donors, like Member States, or the Bretton Woods institutions, or, finally, whether it means putting in place programmes to reduce poverty in the countries concerned.
Like you, we are convinced that we shall have to cope with short-term emergencies, but that the problem is a deep-seated one and is one of the fundamental causes that will have to be tackled if we wish to avoid a repetition of the same problem.
Mr President, in the Spanish version of the resolution on the Afghan refugees off the coast of Australia there is an error, and I am pointing it out so that Parliament' s services may correct it.
In Recital E there is a line missing, since it says 'allow asylum seekers to request asylum once' and it should then say 'they have arrived in Australian territory' .
This text simply needs to be modified in accordance with the other versions - I have seen the English, the French and the German.
I point this out so that Parliament' s services may correct it.
Mr Medina Ortega, I trust you implicitly here because I know that you are extraordinarily well versed in the other languages.
I am sure this will be corrected.
I have already been assured from my right that this will be added in the Spanish version.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m.
Mountain farming
The next item is the report (A5-0277/2001) by Mr Ebner, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the own-initiative report on 25 years' application of Community legislation for hill and mountain farming has arrived on the European Parliament's agenda in the run up to the International Year of Mountains in 2002.
Activities have therefore been planned over the coming year at international, national and local level to promote the sustainable development of mountain regions.
The main objectives of the International Year of Mountains are to create awareness and increase knowledge about mountain ecosystems and their dynamics and operation, to promote and maintain the cultural heritage of mountain communities and the maintenance and sustainable development of resources in mountain regions to safeguard the quality of life of the population now and in the future.
