Therefore I ask you to go beyond your clarifications and tell me what explanations you are requesting from the Spanish authorities and whether you will demand from them not just political measures but humanitarian ones too.
I really want to emphasise that the fact that I mentioned the catastrophe that took place in Dover was not in any way intended to diminish the events that have unfortunately occurred off the coast of Spain recently.
This is a problem that must, of course, be dealt with wherever in the Union it occurs.
The work on this problem must consist of two elements.
One element involves fighting the criminality that is associated with trafficking in human beings and the like. However, it is perhaps even more important to carry out preventive work, namely to work in the way that the Council has chosen to do in the case of Morocco.
We have gone to the source, so to speak - to the cause of these types of migratory flows, and we have tried to put right the underlying problem.
I am convinced that with joint efforts we can achieve success.
This is an important issue under the Swedish Presidency.
I also believe that it will be an even more important matter under the Belgian Presidency, when matters of asylum and migration and that which was achieved at the Tampere Summit are to be evaluated.
We are working actively on this issue.
Mr President, when a question is asked seriously accusing the Spanish Government of inertia in relation to the death of immigrants in the Straits of Gibraltar, it shows the inanity and irresponsibility of those who use a tragedy to try to discredit their own Government in this House.
You see, the Spanish Government, through the Civil Guard, has intercepted 133 leisure craft and 2 300 dinghies in five years, resulting in 203 immigrants dead, over 200 missing and 377 rescued, and I underline rescued, all coming from Morocco.
The Spanish Government, through the Civil Guard, has implemented an information system to prevent shipwrecks in the Straits, at a cost of 13 600 million pesetas, for which Spain has requested European Union funding.
The Spanish Government has pushed forward the Action Plan on Morocco, as mentioned by the Council representative, which this Parliament approved with a budget line of EUR 10 million.
I was the rapporteur for that plan.
Now, Mr President, comes my question: when will the Council submit a progress report on the action plan for Morocco to which he has referred?
Let me say that of course I have the greatest respect for all the measures that the Spanish government is taking in order to put right this difficult problem.
However, it is not for the president of the Council to comment on efforts by individual Member States.
As I said in my original answer, the Council is in the process of implementing an action plan for Morocco.
The dialogue to which I referred, which was introduced to the Moroccan authorities through visits, will hopefully provide concrete results as soon as possible.
The answer to the honourable Member' s question is, therefore, that the Council has already started implementing the action plan.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this issue does not just concern Spain. For instance, yesterday I got a call from a road haulier from the top of whose lorry immigrants had cut a way in through the cover during the crossing.
The British border authorities then arrested these immigrants and the haulier had to pay a fine, although he was unaware immigrants were on board.
I therefore put the following supplementary question: what is the Council Presidency thinking of doing to get to grips with this type of activity?
As the honourable Member will, I am sure, understand, it is not possible for me to comment on a specific individual case.
I can therefore only remind the house that within the framework of the Schengen regulations there is what is known as carrier' s liability.
This means that the person who transports, and thus trafficks in, human beings, knowingly or unknowingly, can be held liable in various ways.
However, I would like to say that the fundamental discussion on these matters took place as recently as the other week in Stockholm when the ministers for justice and the interior met informally.
Although opinions concerning the methods to be used to put this problem right differ slightly in the Council, there is - as I said earlier - a common resolve to give priority to asylum and migration matters in the immediate future within the framework of the cooperation relating to the third pillar.
Mr Nogueira, I am going to let you speak, but first listen to me as President of this sitting: it is not a matter of there being parliamentary debates between Members who ask questions quite legitimately and who naturally each argue their points according to the best of their knowledge and also according to their opinions and interests.
Therefore I ask you to make a point of order.
Excuse me for judging your intentions but I imagine we may get into some reflections at cross-purposes which are not the subject of this debate.
Mr Nogueira has the floor.
Mr President, I understand you are performing your job and I shall therefore try to follow your instructions.
I simply wish to point out here, Mr President, that the country holding the presidency at the moment is Sweden and not representatives of the Spanish Government in this House, who should confine themselves to speaking as Members and not as representatives of that Government.
In any case, given that the Spanish Government will be presiding over the European Union, I believe, within a year, I hope by then it will have taken the humanitarian measures that are required in view of the Andalusian problem and the thousands upon thousands of immigrants who are suffering from the xenophobia that the Spanish Government is practising right now through the Immigration Act.
Ladies and gentlemen, I consider there should be no representative of the Spanish Government or of the various oppositions to the Spanish Government in this House.
I ask you not to make such affirmations, since it is not even laid down that there may be any and they are rejected in the formulation of the initial question itself.
We can consider this incident over, as is natural.
Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, a point of order just to say that I do not represent a party or even a Government: I represent Spain.
And as a representative of Spain, when reference is made in this question to the authorities of the Spanish state, I am within my legitimate rights to defend my country, something that others do not do.
You are both protected by your legitimate rights.
I am not going to allow any more points of order.
There will not be a debate on this.
Note also that both Mr Nogueira and you are according to the law representatives of the Spanish people.
That is what the Treaties say and we all know it.
You are not representatives of either the State or the Government but of the electoral district that elected you, which coincides with the Kingdom of Spain; this is your official title.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 8 and 9 will be taken together.
Question No 8 by (H-0032/01):
Subject: Women and Taliban fundamentalism What political measures is the European Union offering to women forced to endure the cruel Taliban regime?
According to its information, how many women are subjected to this fundamentalist regime?
Will the Council appeal to Afghanistan' s neighbours to leave their borders open to Afghan refugee women?
Will the European Union then grant financial support to those countries which admit refugee women?
Question No 9 by (H-0052/01):
Subject: Human rights: oppression of women in Afghanistan What further steps will the Council take with a view to alleviating the appalling oppression of women in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime that so ruthlessly denies them their basic human rights?
The Council fully shares the honourable Members' commitment in the matter of the suffering of Afghan women under Taliban rule.
The Council regrets that the sad reality in Afghanistan shows that, so far, the Taliban have been unreceptive to arguments and pressure from outside, despite the efforts of the Union and of the international community.
Both parties to the conflict are continuing their military operations and a political solution to the conflict still seems far away.
There is a pressing need to improve the outrageous situation in respect of human rights but, under the conditions that prevail in the country, the prospects of an improvement are, unfortunately, not particularly bright.
The Taliban control around 90% of the territory of Afghanistan.
Since the military situation in the country is changing all the time, however, the Council has no precise information on the number of women living under the Kabul regime at any given point in time.
Moreover, the catastrophic situation in respect of humanitarian circumstances and human rights in the country has led to massive emigration of refugees to neighbouring countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan, making it even more difficult to make an assessment of the population situation in Afghanistan.
The Council has often taken up the issue of the critical situation of the Afghan refugees with the host countries in the area and will continue to do so in future.
The Community and several of the Member States will also continue to provide humanitarian aid to the Afghans when the circumstances permit.
The majority of this aid benefits women.
The recently updated common position of 25 January 2001 forms the basis of the Union' s policy in respect of Afghanistan.
The Union is continuing its efforts to bring about lasting peace, to get foreign intervention to cease and to encourage internal dialogue in Afghanistan.
In particular, the Union emphasises the importance of encouraging respect for international humanitarian law and human rights, including the rights of women and children.
The Union will therefore continue to call upon all parties to recognise, protect and promote all human rights and basic liberties and to respect the general declaration of human rights that Afghanistan has in fact signed.
We will continue to call upon the Afghan factions to cease their discriminatory policy and to recognise, protect and encourage equal rights and dignity for men and women, including access to education and health facilities, employment, personal safety and the absence of injustices and persecution, as well as emphasising the negative consequences that discriminatory policy will have for active supply of aid.
The Union will continue to support the proposal by the Secretary-General of the UN for civil human rights observers and will also continue to support such aid programmes in Afghanistan as integrate equality issues and actively attempt to encourage the participation of both men and women on equal terms.
Finally, we will be attaching particular importance to human rights when it comes to the international coordination of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.
The Council hopes that the latest sanctions, based on UN Security Council Resolution No 13033, which the Council is currently discussing in order to adopt the corresponding common position and regulation as soon as possible, will contribute to reducing foreign involvement and encourage a negotiated solution to the Afghan conflict.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate your reply but it does not go far enough.
Will you recommend the adoption of effective emergency measures to combat the current situation: the scourge of hunger, the scourge of cold and the scourge of diseases?
I can put it as brutally as today' s media: 120 children die of cold, barefoot, in temperatures fifteen degrees below zero; over 10 million, almost 11 million women survive without a right to health care, without a right to education, without a right to work, in subhuman conditions.
We need something more than understanding, as you must realise.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, will you not recommend that some emergency measure should be adopted?
How many more children will have to die of cold?
How many million women will have to live without rights or freedoms?
(The President cut the speaker off)
As I mentioned previously, the Council had the opportunity to discuss the common position on Afghanistan at its meeting at the end of January.
I can assure you that, in the discussions concerning the situation in Afghanistan, the Council, too, is aware of the dreadful witness accounts to which the honourable Member refers.
I see three paths along which the Council and the Union must proceed. First of all, we must continue with generous humanitarian aid in order to alleviate suffering, particularly suffering by Afghan women and children.
Secondly, we must continue to exert pressure on the Taliban regime so that it ceases its systematic crimes against human rights.
Thirdly, we must give Afghanistan' s neighbouring countries more advice and support so that they are better able temporarily to accommodate the refugees - primarily women and children - who are forced to leave Afghanistan.
Mr President, thank you for allowing me to put a supplementary question on behalf of my colleague, Mr MacCormick, who is accompanying the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on an official visit here to Parliament today.
Mr President-in-Office, do you accept that this is a new and profoundly oppressive instance of the subordination of women and their seclusion into private life?
For many years women in Afghanistan enjoyed a fully public existence, participating in the professions and in the world of work and dressing appropriately.
Sometimes it is said that appeals to human rights involve imposing western values on non-western cultures.
That is false, and this particular case in Afghanistan shows it to be so.
Does the Council agree that what is needed is a restitution of women's human rights and of the fundamental respect that they are due?
Surely more is needed than has been offered in the statement today.
Unfortunately, the honourable Member is, of course, right in his description of the fact that the situation in Afghanistan has clearly worsened in recent times.
We are facing a situation of inhuman suffering for women and children.
As I mentioned previously, the Council made an assessment of the situation at the end of January in the light of the information that was then available.
If developments continue in the wrong direction, the Council must, of course, continue to assess what can be done.
It is our hope that the clear message that was sent out, for example, by the recently adopted resolution in the UN Security Council, together with international efforts - which as we know do not just involve the Union but also a large part of the international community - will gradually produce results.
I can assure the honourable Member that the issue is being monitored very intensively by the Council so that we shall be able to take the measures that the situation requires.
As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 will be taken together.
Question No 10 by (H-0040/01):
Subject: Transport and integration What plans has the Transport Council for developing indicators and monitoring, implementing and creating a timetable for further measures for its strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
Question No 11 by (H-0041/01):
Subject: Energy and integration What plans has the Energy Council for developing indicators and monitoring, implementing and creating a timetable for further measures for its strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
Question No 12 by (H-0042/01):
Subject: General affairs and integration What plans has the General Affairs Council for developing a comprehensive strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies, with a set of indicators, a timetable for further measures and follow-up and monitoring as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
Question No 13 by (H-0043/01):
Subject: ECOFIN and integration What plans has the Economic and Financial Affairs Council for developing a comprehensive strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies, with a set of indicators, a timetable for further measures and follow-up and monitoring as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
Question No 14 by (H-0044/01):
Subject: Parliament and integration process How will the European Parliament be consulted about the comprehensive strategies being developed by nine Councils for integrating the environmental dimension into their policies as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
Question No 15 by (H-0045/01):
Subject: Coherence of integration plans How is the Council ensuring coherence between the comprehensive strategies being developed by nine Councils for integrating the environmental dimension into their policies?
Question No 16 by (H-0046/01):
Subject: Industry Council and integration What plans has the Industry Council for developing a comprehensive strategy for integrating the environmental dimension into its policies, with a set of indicators, a timetable for further measures and follow-up and monitoring as required by the Helsinki conclusions?
The record number of questions means that this will be, if not a record length answer, then at least as detailed an answer as possible.
The Council is pleased to tell MEPs that the environmental protection requirements under article 6 of the EC Treaty are to be integrated into the elaboration and implementation of the Community' s policies and activities, particularly with a view to encouraging sustainable development.
The strategies for incorporating environmental dimensions into the Council' s activities will be established ahead of the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June of this year.
At this stage, therefore, it is a touch early to report on the details of all these strategies.
The Presidency and the Commission are currently working intensively on these matters in the various Council constellations concerned.
In December 1999 in Helsinki, the Council established the timetable for the European Council in Gothenburg and called upon the Council to complete its work on incorporating the environmental dimensions into all the Council' s activities by producing overall strategies, if possible accompanied by a timetable for the measures to be taken and a set of indicators for the sectors concerned.
Once these strategies have been established, they should help with carrying out the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, supplement measures at national and regional level and emphasise the need for closer cooperation between different areas of sectoral policy.
Hopefully, the important role that these strategies will play for the implementation of sustainable development is therefore obvious.
The implementation and follow up of all this work has been entrusted to the Commission and the Council.
Internally within the Council, the various bodies that prepare the considerations have a duty to use the various steps of the traditional decision-making process to ensure good coordination in order, as best as possible, to meet the challenge set by the European Council.
The participation of Parliament will be ensured in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.
It must be stressed that the Council shares the view of MEPs and is prepared, together with all the political and economic players in this area, to ensure success with a holistic approach when it comes to environmental matters within the various policy areas concerned.
Concerning the integration of environmental dimensions and sustainable development in all sector policy, much can be said concerning how and to what extent the Council is applying the provisions of article 6 of the Treaty.
Without dealing with this matter exhaustively - which is not possible because it covers an incredibly wide area - I would like to emphasise some of the most relevant aspects of the situation.
First there is energy policy, which the Council considers to be one of its highest priority areas.
The Council is fully contributing to the three important objectives emphasised in the programme of the Swedish Presidency for this six months.
In this respect, the Council would remind MEPs of the Council' s conclusions of December 1999, which already contain a detailed preliminary set of indicators covering the area of energy in general, including the environmental consequences, the energy market and energy efficiency.
The application of these conclusions and the set of indicators is to be evaluated at two-yearly intervals.
In addition, a final decision is expected this year on the directive on the promotion of electricity from renewable sources of energy.
To prepare the way for the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June, the Council will discuss a communication concerning the integration of the environment dimensions and sustainable development into energy policy, as well as the proposed sixth action plan at Community level for sustainable development.
Both are to be presented by the Commission in the next few weeks.
A number of measures are to commence within the framework of the action plan for increased energy efficiency based on the priorities established by the Council at its meeting on 5 December 2000.
Where the industrial side of this overall strategy is concerned, the Council would remind MEPs that, in the report to the European Council in Helsinki, it was emphasised that a strong contribution was required from the industrial sector in order to strengthen sustainable development in the economic area.
At the same time, it set out once again the key role that this sector has in respect of improving the competitiveness of European industry and its capacity for innovation in order to encourage employment within industry and related sectors.
The horizontal nature of this issue calls for better cooperation and exchange of information between all the parties and decision-makers concerned.
Once again: hopefully, the conclusions that will be established at the European Council summit in Gothenburg will be of very great interest.
To show, through a concrete measure, the extent to which the Council is attempting to maximise the integrated strategy when it comes to environmental matters, the Council intends to draw up certain conclusions at the Council meeting in May at which both energy and industry ministers will gather together in order to take this work further.
Finally, as far as economic and financial matters are concerned, the Council wishes to inform MEPs that, at the European Council summit in Nice, the Council submitted an initial report concerning how environmental dimensions can be integrated into the economic policy of the Union and its Member States.
In this area, the Gothenburg Summit will once again follow up this report and, in particular, will investigate how a European strategy for sustainable economic development can be elaborated in which environmental dimensions are taken into consideration.
The Ecofin Council will undoubtedly be urged to apply such a strategy within its area of authority as soon as the European Council has approved such a strategy.
Mr President-in-Office, thank you for such a comprehensive answer to seven questions.
I would like just briefly to follow up one aspect, which I do not think you really touched on.
What ideas and proposals have you got to continue the process of integration into subsequent EU presidencies?
Given the momentum of the Cardiff process and the fact that this is all beginning to happen now, it is going to be quite a lengthy process and is not going to happen overnight.
I would be interested to know what provisions you are making for the future.
The honourable Member raises a very relevant question.
As I mentioned, we in the Swedish Presidency - in close cooperation with the Commission - are currently involved in work in which we are preparing the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Gothenburg in June.
It is on that occasion that we will hopefully be able to answer the questions put by the honourable Member.
The Cardiff process, as it is known, is a new way of working as far as the European Union is concerned.
We now have experience from a number of Council constellations.
Some have done very good work, whilst others have perhaps been less successful.
We are now attempting to gather together all this experience and formulate the strategy and the ideas and proposals that the honourable Member is looking for.
I expect that, in good time before the European Council summit in June of this year, we will be able to come back to this House with a more concrete account of the thoughts that the Council has and in order to listen to the viewpoints that Parliament and its Members may have.
I would therefore beg your indulgence and ask to be given opportunity to come back to this important debate, which after all concerns one of three priority areas for the Swedish Presidency, namely the environment.
Mr President-in-Office, thank you for that very wide-ranging answer.
Unfortunately, one of the problems of wide-ranging answers and short times is that you get breadth but you do not get depth, and I would like to ask for a bit more detail.
I do find it quite extraordinary that you say it is too early to talk about the detail of some of these plans, given that the Gothenburg Summit is not far away.
I wanted to focus in particular on the General Affairs Council.
You will know that this is the only Council that has not produced any documents in line with the Council's requests, so I would like to know when we might see some more detail on that in particular?
Will we see a draft before Gothenburg.
If we do not have any detail on the General Affairs Council plan, can you at least say what kind of structure and shape it will take, what indicators it will be using and the follow-up and monitoring?
The honourable Member refers to the Council constellation in which it is possibly most difficult to find the concrete framework demanded by the work on sustainable development.
I do not believe that it is any coincidence that it is precisely the work in this Council (General Affairs) that is taking the longest.
That is the reason why unfortunately there is not that much to report as yet.
The honourable Member thinks there is very little time left before the Gothenburg Summit.
I, on the other hand feel, think it feels as if there were an infinite amount of time left.
I am absolutely convinced that we will be able to come back and be even more concrete in respect of the ways in which the General Affairs Council can integrate environmental dimensions and the principles of sustainable development in its work.
However, I hope that we can have a common understanding that it is precisely in the matter of the General Affairs Council' s activity that it is most difficult to find the concrete framework that I believe we all want to have.
Mr President-in-Office, thank you for your reply.
However, I would like to add my voice to the concern expressed here that there is not too much time left before the Gothenburg Summit, in terms of preparation to integrate environmental issues into various policies, something which came out of the conclusions of the Helsinki Summit.
In fact, I am very worried about how this process is to move forward.
Some who have spoken of sustainable development think the aim is somehow to make the environment a relative issue, the economy appearing to take priority over the environment.
I would like you, Mr President-in-Office, to explain your purpose regarding this matter.
At present, the sixth environmental action programme is being drafted in Parliament and this should be the ecological pillar of this programme of sustainable development.
Are you going to demand that this will in fact be the case, or is this ecological aspect just talk?
The action plan for sustainable development is after all to be presented by the Commission.
The question should therefore, in the first instance, be put to the Members of the Commission.
However, since the question is nevertheless such an important part of the Swedish Presidency, I cannot refrain from nonetheless giving the viewpoints of the Swedish Presidency concerning the components that the strategy for sustainable development should include.
I believe it is incredibly important that, in the strategy which we hope will be adopted in Gothenburg, we will clearly include three elements that should form part of the concept of sustainable development.
These should be the ecological element, the economic element and the social element.
We know that two of these elements, namely socially sustainable development and economically sustainable development, will be discussed as early as the Stockholm Summit.
We intend to supplement the discussion in Stockholm of these two elements with ecologically sustainable development, so to speak, and then make this into a common strategy that can be adopted at the Gothenburg Summit.
Once again, however, I would like to point out that it is the Commission that is in the driving seat here.
We have every confidence in the Commission' s ability to produce a strategy for sustainable development that makes Europe become even greener.
As a co-sponsor with my colleague, Mr Watts, of amendments which were put forward in the trans-European networks on a strategic environmental impact assessment some four years ago at least, I find it quite surprising that it is said to be too early to talk about a comprehensive strategy in this particular direction.
If it is too early to do that, surely the Council can provide us with some information about how it will properly coordinate this comprehensive strategy - when it comes into existence - across the various Councils.
I think I have partly indicated the answer to these questions already.
Obviously, each Council constellation is doing its work in this area.
In the order that was established in connection with the European Council meeting in Cardiff, there are a number of factors that each Council constellation must observe in its work and which are then put together.
As I have already pointed out, the framework will then be the strategy that the Commission will present.
It is therefore a case of putting together the Council' s various strategies depending on which constellation is concerned.
These strategies have been drawn up in accordance with the template decided on in Cardiff, whereupon the Commission' s work remains to be done.
For obvious reasons, I cannot go into more detail about how the Commission will draw up its strategy, but must instead ask that the question be put to representatives of the Commission.
I too should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer.
I refer to the Transport Council and in particular to the latest report on the concrete implementation of the strategy, which showed a distinct lack of progress on many fronts in the transport field.
The strategy raises serious concerns about the transport implications of enlargement, but the report did not suggest much in the way of concrete measures.
What concrete measures does the presidency propose?
Such measures are essential if transport is to be fully taken into account in the enlargement process which, it is to be hoped, will result in environmentally sustainable policies.
It is after all not just E for 'environment' that is a priority task of the Swedish Presidency, but also - as the honourable Member is surely aware - E for 'enlargement' .
The transport chapter is one of the most important chapters within the framework of the negotiations with the applicant countries.
These negotiations are based in the first instance on the existing common regulations, but this still leaves us opportunity to point out to the applicant countries the important issues concerning sustainable development that the Council is in the process of discussing, in this case in the area of transport.
The principles are thus discussed in conjunction with the negotiations with each applicant country on the transport chapter.
Mr President, this question of sustainability is indeed of great interest and the priority of the Swedish Presidency is welcome.
But what our citizens want to know is what is the Council planning to do to ensure the public dissemination of the results of the Cardiff process to all citizens and governments of Member States and accession countries?
I do not think the Council has been particularly active in the past.
I know that the Swedish Presidency wants to change that and involve citizens more extensively and be more transparent.
I want some information about that and specifically about the Industry Council.
The Council is committed to a full-blown strategy by 2004.
What short-term targets or actions and indicators will be needed to ensure its full development?
How will the external impact of the industry strategy be evaluated?
You have also referred at length to energy.
Energy efficiency is an important priority.
We have a report about to go before this House in Brussels.
Will you take any steps on the action plan for energy efficiency?
The honourable Member has put three very extensive questions.
I will attempt to answer them as briefly as possible.
It is absolutely correct, as the Member points out, that the Council and the Commission need to devote more energy to disseminating the results of this work to the public.
Within the framework of the general efforts by the Swedish Presidency to increase openness, we plan to ensure that, after the Gothenburg Summit, the results of the Council' s discussions are disseminated widely through the Internet, through attempting to ensure that the decisions that are taken are disseminated and put in terms in which citizens can understand them.
I know from the good contacts that we have had with the Commission that the Commission is also planning fairly extensive activities in this area.
As far as concrete indicators in the area of transport are concerned, I would ask the Member if we might return to this when, in April, the Council has adopted a resolution that concerns precisely integration in this area.
There are great many concrete plans, but the Council has not yet had opportunity to discuss this.
Consequently I must ask to be allowed to come back to you with more concrete news.
We expect the Council (Transport) to meet in early April of this year.
We shall then be able to obtain answers to the questions that the Member has put.
As far as the action plan for energy efficiency is concerned, it is the hope of the presidency that we shall be able to act on the proposal during the Swedish Presidency.
However, I would not dare to be more precise than this.
Question No 17 by (H-0050/01):
Subject: Inadequate enforcement of animal protection in Europe Yet again the media reports maltreatment of animals in the Member States.
Yet again there is a public outcry against such inconceivable cruelty. And yet again comes the Agriculture Ministers' answer that it will be stopped.
In a report of 6 December 2000 on the situation regarding animal protection, COM(2000) 0809/final, the Commission has demonstrated with terrifying clarity how animals in several Member States are subjected to inhuman suffering and how the competent authorities continually fail to carry out proper checks.
When will the Presidency, therefore, propose a substantial increase in resources to verify compliance with current animal welfare legislation, and appropriate, strict penalties for breaking the rules?
The Commission report to which Mrs Paulsen refers deals in the first instance with transportation of animals.
The presidency welcomes the report, which commendably identifies a large number of problems in the Member States and also contains proposals for measures.
The report was presented on 6 December last year and has already, after having been dealt with both at working party level and in a meeting with the chief veterinary officers, been discussed by the ministers responsible.
It is now up to the Commission to present concrete proposals for measures, which the Commission has also promised in the report.
Once these proposals have been submitted, the presidency will start work in the Council working party as soon as possible.
I am very aware that the country holding the presidency does not control the agenda entirely itself.
However, initiatives can be taken in the matter of work in progress.
The Commission can also, so to speak, be pressed to produce proposals faster and more effectively.
In this context, I would like us to review the agricultural policy as such.
The export subsidies make the very worst transportation profitable.
There are many other subsidy systems that favour bad management of resources and the neglect of animals.
I know that there are legislative shortcomings, but it is better to force through the observance of laws that already exist than to wait for additional new laws.
I can only agree with what the honourable Member says.
We must not let the fact that we are waiting for concrete proposals from the Commission lull us into believing that we need not do anything but that we must wait for the Commission' s proposals.
I can assure you that the presidency regards this matter as having the utmost priority.
Without in any way violating the restrictions that exist in the Treaty, we are leaning on the Commission with a certain amount of force to try to get better mechanisms for observance of the rules that currently exist.
Above all, improvements are required.
I believe we are entirely in agreement in this area.
The facts in this area are in many cases horrendous.
The Council and Parliament must continue to drive this forward so that we get proposals from the Commission - proposals that I am sure the Commission will present as soon as possible.
Question No 18 by (H-0054/01):
Subject: Radioactive pollution of the Aegean and Ionian Seas According to reports in the Greek press, as well as in the Turkish press, according to 'Le Journal du Dimanche', depleted uranium shells have been used by the Greek and the Turkish navies in exercises in the Aegean and the Ionian Seas for the last ten years.
The inhabitants of the islands and along the coastlines of these two seas, as well as the citizens of neighbouring countries, are concerned about possible radioactive pollution, because sea currents carry radioactivity beyond the area where the shells were fired.
Does the Council intend to set up an independent commission to investigate this matter and to inform the inhabitants of these regions and all the citizens of Europe about the real state of affairs so as to prevent an 'Aegean syndrome' taking hold, whether or not it is justified?
Does it intend to work towards this goal with the governments concerned?
What preventive measures does it intend to take?
. (SV) Let me first of all point out that the Council does not comment on documents - including articles in the press - that are put to the Council outside the institutional framework.
The Council would remind the House that, when it comes to radiological emergencies, under the current Community legislation the Member States have a duty to take the necessary measures to cooperate with every other Member State or other states that may be affected, as well as to notify the Commission and the Member States that are, or are at risk of being, affected.
In this respect, the Council would remind the honourable Member that it is the Commission that has authority when it comes to how the Member States are to apply the Community law in this case, for example through Directive 89/618/Euratom on informing the general public about health protection measures to be applied and steps to be taken in the event of a radiological emergency and Directive 96/29/Euratom laying down basic safety standards.
Moreover, the Council has not made any proposal that, if necessary, preventive measures beyond what is already specified in the Community law are to be taken.
Mr President-in-Office, I should like to hear your views on cooperation between this Member State and the institutions and what you think the European Commission could do.
I think that you too are aware, as is European public opinion following the Balkans syndrome, that we need to investigate promptly and take action to prevent other syndromes.
If there is no danger, then the public should be informed, because the Aegean and Ionian islands are worried that there may be repercussions not just on the health of the locals but also on tourism.
As I mentioned in my earlier answer, the question concerning the Member States' observance of the rules that are relevant in this case is covered by the Commission' s area of authority.
It is therefore not possible for the Council to comment on the question that has been put.
However, in very general terms let me emphasise that it is obviously important that matters concerning depleted uranium are considered and handled with great care and prudence and in accordance with the precautionary principle to which the Member herself made reference.
I would remind you of the important debate on this matter that we had in his Chamber approximately a month ago.
We are now awaiting the results of the various investigations that were discussed at that time in order to be able to debate the matter further.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, questions that have not been given an answer will receive one in writing, with the exception of Questions Nos 28, 30, 40, 42, 43 and 44, which were submitted too late according to the Council, and Question No 32, which has been withdrawn by its author.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
Reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0019/2001) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings (8975/3/00 - C5-0521/2000 - 1986/0080(COD)).
Commissioner Nielson, thank you so much for taking over from your colleague Mr Bolkestein.
As the proposal is rather complex, I will not ask you any difficult questions this evening, which is just as well, I think.
On 23 December 1986, the Commission presented the proposal concerning a directive on the winding-up and reorganisation of insurance undertakings to Parliament, and the proposal was adopted.
Approval at first reading by Parliament followed on 14 March 1989.
The directive was to spend the next eleven years on a shelf at the Council of Ministers.
Two stumbling blocks were mainly to blame for this: in the first instance, the Gibraltar issue and the territorial implications this had, and secondly, the connection between Articles 10 and 11.
The latter mainly concerned the connection between a guarantee fund for the policyholders and any preferential position they may have in bankruptcy legislation.
The latter was touched upon very briefly at the most recent reading, but fortunately, we managed to knock this on the head during a committee discussion in Parliament.
The second reading is now formally before Parliament.
This directive has the same goal as the proposal on the winding-up and reorganisation of credit institutions, namely the mutual recognition of legislation.
This directive guarantees that insurance undertakings are wound up or reorganised according to the principles of unity and universality.
This means that the insurance undertaking must be wound up in accordance with legislation applicable in the country where the insurance undertaking has its registered office by the competent authority in the same country; this is what is referred to as the unity principle.
This competent authority must then involve all branch offices and sub-offices in the European Union in the winding-up process, irrespective of where in the European Union these are based.
This is the universality principle.
The directive must ensure that creditors are treated equally.
Irrespective of the country in which claims originate, the claims are always dealt with in the country of the registered office.
That is why creditors all have the same rights, and are no longer at the mercy of the country in which the claim is generated.
In contrast to the second reading of the reorganisation and winding-up of credit institutions, this directive is more consistent and is structured in a logical manner, in my opinion.
I would therefore recommend my fellow MEPs to adopt the Council' s common position without any amendments.
And on this Valentine' s Day, this seems a nice, unanimous position for the Council, the Commission and Parliament to hold.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Peijs, I would first like to wholeheartedly thank the rapporteur for her work and for her clear explanations, which once again spelt out to us what this directive is all about.
I would like to add that this directive covers the whole aspect of the creation of an internal market for financial services and is therefore to be welcomed, as we still have a great deal to do to strengthen, improve and consolidate this market and to remove existing blockades.
The common position has succeeded in bringing the rights of insurance undertakings into line with the legitimate interests of creditors.
The common position is well balanced and, what is more, it is the result of lengthy negotiations to reach a compromise.
The Council has allowed eleven years to elapse.
In view of fact that the procedure has been allowed to run on for far too long, a speedy approval of the common position would be an important step in the interest of creditors and insurance undertakings alike.
To conclude, I would like to say something so as to avoid any misunderstandings. Throughout the whole of Europe, it is exceptional for insurance undertakings to be wound up, as they are subject to very strict scrutiny, they are very well managed and relations between customers and management are good.
The lack of an EU legislative framework is, nevertheless, a potential risk and could lead to serious problems in isolated cases.
The idea and the need for a directive are therefore justified and the outcome is to be welcomed.
Mr President, the directive on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings fills a major gap in the European Union's financial services legislation.
It is a top priority in the creation of a fully integrated market in financial services, as pointed out at the Lisbon European Council.
It will ensure mutual recognition of legislation and proceedings as well as an appropriate level of protection for policy holders.
It will avoid conflicts of jurisdiction and the unequal treatment of insurance creditors.
The result will be quicker procedures and more protection for policy holders. The Council' s common position, which has been submitted for consideration to Parliament, is fully consistent with the essential objectives pursued in the Commission's original and amended proposals.
It is also consistent with other legal instruments on winding-up and insolvency agreed within the internal market.
I would like to thank the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for their judicious and efficient handling of this file.
They recommend that the text of the common position be kept as it is without any amendment.
They have considered that the objectives pursued in this area have been duly preserved through the common position.
They have understood that the difficult balance reached on this technically complex text, after so many years of discussion, should not be put in jeopardy.
I fully share their opinion.
The Commission invites the plenary to follow the recommendation of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and to approve without amendments the entire text of the common position.
This directive symbolises European cooperation, and the calmness of this moment in the plenary does not, in my view, reflect the magnitude of what is actually happening here.
It is very clear that it takes a lot of time and seems very complicated now and then, but at the end of day our cooperation produces solutions to problems that can only be solved through systematic cooperation.
So the system works.
The debate is closed.
I am sure the serene attitude is due to the composure of the rapporteur.
The vote, if any, will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The Union and Macao beyond 2000
The next item is the report (A5-0017/2001) by Mr Soares, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: The European Union and Macao: beyond 2000 [COM(1999) 484 - C5-0169/2000 - 2000/2099(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my report on the European Union and Macau was discussed twice in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, which then unanimously approved it.
As a matter of fact, I had previously incorporated some conclusions from the opinion issued by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy.
In December 1999, in other words, just over a year ago, Macau stopped being a special territory under the administration of Portugal, which it had been, peacefully and with the consent of the people, for 450 years. It is today a Special Administrative Region that is part of the People' s Republic of China, in accordance with the Chinese principle of 'one country, two systems' .
I wish to take this opportunity to say that there is a serious mistake in the report, in item No 9 of the explanatory statement, where it says, in repeating this principle, 'one system, two countries' .
The Chinese idea is completely the opposite - 'one country, two systems' .
This is a mistake which still needs to be corrected.
As a Portuguese citizen and having enjoyed direct constitutional responsibility for Macau, I must state that Macau' s handover from Portuguese administration to the Chinese was done consensually and with enormous goodwill under the terms of the 1987 Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration, which is still in force today and which will remain so for the next fifty years.
This last year has also been peaceful and consensual, according to first-hand information that I have received from various sources and, in particular, from the Portuguese and Macanese who still live and work there.
I have already passed this information to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
As we all know, the policy of the People' s Republic of China towards Hong Kong and now towards Macau seeks to achieve a rapprochement between Taiwan and China and, eventually, to integrate it into China.
Despite the fact that there have been, and still are, minor and inevitable problems with this integration in the case of Hong Kong, a much larger, more populous and richer territory than Macau, albeit with a much more recent past, it is widely known that the these two territories have, by and large, enjoyed a relatively smooth transition.
As I pointed out, Macau was never a colony. It was a territory under Portuguese administration, by agreement between Portugal and China.
Following Portugal' s 'Carnation Revolution' , when I arrived for the first time at the United Nations in 1974 as Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me, 'Be careful, do not decolonise Macau, because Macau is not a colony and never has been.'
In 1949, when Mao Tse Tung came to power, he said 'Portugal has spent 400 years in Macau without ever having waged war against China.'
This was a very important point for Macau, and still is.
Although Macau is not as rich as Hong Kong, its development in many areas in the last ten years has been extraordinary.
Formerly, gambling alone ruled, but today there is a very strong sector producing goods for tourists and toys and various objects, and many other industries, including the textile industry.
Relations between Hong Kong and Macau are and have always been excellent.
It is worth bearing in mind, and I shall take this opportunity to remind Parliament, that every territory has its peculiarities.
They are all different and the European Union should therefore deal with them all as separate issues even though they are closely related.
These territories must not be lumped together, particularly in terms of the European Union' s representation there.
Portugal has historically enjoyed excellent relations with the People' s Republic, which are still improving at various levels. This year, there were several visits to Portugal by Chinese Ministers and by Portuguese Ministers to China.
Relations are still very close between Portugal and Macau. The current Governor of Macau, Mr Edmond Ho, who was actually appointed by the Chinese Government, paid an official visit to Portugal this year.
As a matter of fact, this was his first trip abroad.
Under the terms of the Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration, the People's Republic of China made a commitment to respecting the economic system and the political and legal system instituted by Portugal when it established the Special Administrative Region of Macau for the next 50 years.
As a founding member of the World Trade Organisation, Macau is a signatory to the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights and the International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
It has a kind of economic and trade delegation called the Macau Economic and Trade Office. I say 'kind of' , because this delegation is not recognised by the European Union, since responsibility for foreign relations and defence lies with Beijing.
In principle, the European Union is supposed to appoint its own permanent representative in Macau.
This is important and I believe that it has already been done.
Portugal left Macau with a complete, western-style democratic legal system, with political institutions that function well, with a Chief Executive appointed by Beijing replacing the former Portuguese Governor, with a Legislative Assembly of 23 members, independent courts and a Court of Final Appeal as well as an efficient police force.
The Joint Sino-Portuguese Declaration defines civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, which have been respected, and the territory does not have the death penalty.
Portugal enjoys excellent relations with the People' s Republic of China, as I said, and continues to have a considerable presence in Macau through its investors and businesses and in the civil service and the liberal professions.
There is a Portuguese high school in Macau which is thriving and where Portuguese continues to be taught.
Macau can and must retain its importance for the European Union as a centre for business and investment, not only in the territory itself, but also for the business that is traditionally entered into there with China and with other Asian countries.
Because Macau is a Special Administrative Region with its own cultural identity and a population that is mixed, although largely Chinese, the European Union can only gain by maintaining a presence there, for both of these reasons.
I must therefore insist that the European Union sends a permanent representative to Macau and that we step up economic, political and cultural relations between the European Union and Macau.
The European Union must not lose interest in Macau, because what happens over the next 50 years in this territory, which is under special jurisdiction, depends to a certain extent on the vigilance with which the European Union watches over Macau.
Mr President, with MÃ¡rio Soares' s particular knowledge of Macau and the close attention that he has paid to developments in the Special Administrative Region that has been created there, he has provided this House with an extremely important and timely document.
His report starts with an analysis of the institutional and legislative framework that has been designed for the region and of the potential of the modern democratic structures that these have lead to. The report takes account, of course, of the particular culture and the specific historical, social and economic bonds that underpin Macau' s relationship with Portugal and the European Union on the one hand, and with the People' s Republic of China, on the other.
In this way, the report outlines the expectation which the clearly positive changes in the Special Administrative Region have confirmed, even though we know that we cannot yet take account of as many tangible figures as we would like, in order to have a true picture of these first twelve months - in fact a very short time.
If, as we hope, and as the Soares report has already indicated, these positive aspects are fully confirmed, we must see this as the result not only of the careful preparation for the transfer of sovereignty on the part of Portugal and China, but also of the special commitment demonstrated by Macau' s current authorities. These positive aspects are also, and it is important to remember this, the result of the truly outstanding action of the last Portuguese Governor of Macau, Vasco Rocha Vieira, on whose merits Parliament had the opportunity to hear the specially authorised statement by Commissioner Patten, in the December 1999 plenary.
The benefit of this action on the ground was to guarantee lasting respect for fundamental rights, amongst other things, and this was a serene and heartfelt fight without the histrionics that characterised the fight for which the Sakharov prize-winners were rewarded, and yet it was carried out with similar efficiency and with equally far-reaching effects.
The very positive aspects that I have just mentioned must not, however, lead the European Union' s authorities to pay less close attention to later developments.
My justification for saying this consists of a few points, which are perhaps explained by the differences in outlooks.
We know that, in the meantime, changes have been made to the company code that are likely to clash with the rules on transparency in the field of invitations to tender. We also know that the Portuguese language is being used less, both at an official level and in schools and social situations.
There even appear to be signs of changes to electoral law and to certain aspects of public administration and the classification of civil servants, the health system and higher education.
It is to be hoped that these are superficial aspects that do not herald a moving away from the European Union and a diminishing of Macau' s autonomy for the sake of practices employed in other countries in the region or for the sake of a watered-down situation that is less acceptable to China itself.
Nevertheless, the Soares report reiterates the need for the statute and the legal framework adopted for Macau to be fully respected, both with regard to fundamental rights and to the other rights and principles of democratic law that stem from the Joint Sino-Chinese Declaration of 1987 and the Basic Law of 1993, the thrust of which it would be useful to summarise.
This law insists on the need to stimulate cooperation between Europe and Macau in all areas, because the importance of rapidly appointing a representative of the European Union to that Special Administrative Region is clear.
For these reasons, congratulating Mr Soares once again, I wish, in conclusion, to express my support and my praise for his report.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak for two basic reasons.
Firstly, to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Soares, on his excellent report, with which he honours this Parliament, and to highlight three points made in this report: firstly, the need for Europe to remain vigilant over the autonomy and specific character of the Special Administrative Region of Macau; secondly, the need for the European Union to maintain a physical presence there through a representative; and thirdly, the need for closer relations and dialogue with that territory, as Mr Soares made very clear.
As for my second reason, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my speech is intended to mark an important point in the debate on this report, because in addition to being a long-standing member of this House, the rapporteur is a former President of one of the Member States of the European Union with a history that honours us all, not only the members of his party or his compatriots, but all Europeans.
This report, which bears his stamp and his signature, increases the credibility of the European Parliament.
It is worth highlighting that it is not only the contribution he has made in this document but also the active and resolute way in which he has always fought and continues to fight in this House to defend the highest values of the European project itself.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Macau is a unique case, a case which is culturally specific and pivotal in the historic relationship between Europe and China through the intermediary of Portugal.
We feel that preserving and valuing these links under the new framework initiated in December 1999 is a highly appropriate proposal.
The European Union is Macau' s second largest trading partner and its third largest investor as a result of the trade and cooperation agreement that has already been in force since 1993 and of other one-off agreements between the European Union and Macau in various other areas.
Lastly, the Portuguese administration has made a huge effort, especially in the last twenty years, to modernise the territory and its infrastructures. In its negotiations with China, it managed to ensure the establishment in Macau of an institutional legislative framework, which is of particular importance from a European perspective, for the particular way in which we see Asia and the Pacific and in terms of our relations with the great nation of China.
The main quality of this report and of the motion for a resolution that we are now debating is that it has rigorously and punctually respected the timetable and has not let Macau fall into oblivion.
In saying this I am not detracting from the importance of the report. On the contrary, I consider it to be extremely appropriate, precisely in order to prevent our documents in this area being interred in a graveyard for good intentions and ending up in a drawer or, even worse, in the bin.
Looking around the Chamber, one might think this was a Portuguese debate, but what I wish to state once again is that the 1999 handover also marked the fact that Macau became a European issue of the first order.
The timeliness of this Parliamentary report by Mr Soares exposes the main weakness of the Commission, which is not to have marked this fact. This clearly warrants our criticism.
First of all, it is unfortunate that a year should have passed without the Commission publishing the annual report on EU-China relations that it promised and which we were expecting.
Secondly, it is also unfortunate that, as far as we know, no one has yet been appointed to take charge of bilateral cooperation in Macau, which runs counter to the announcement made over a year ago in the Commission Communication to the Council and the European Parliament.
We are all perfectly familiar with the reasons why we must maintain and improve bilateral cooperation with the new Special Administrative Region and it is not worth repeating them now.
I wish to congratulate Mr Soares on his excellent report and I hope that the Commission will now be able to make up for lost time and step up and better organise cooperation with Macau.
I hope that it will address the challenges facing us more actively and that it will duly reread and comply with its own communication of 1999 in time.
Mr President, I would like to commend the rapporteur on his excellent report.
As Parliament's rapporteur on Hong Kong, the current status of the Macau Special Administrative Region holds obvious interest to me, and I have been fortunate enough to visit the region twice within the last year.
On the positive side, Macau's economy has progressed significantly since the handover, enjoying a 4% growth in GDP during the year 2000.
Another positive development is Edmond Ho Hau-Wah's stated intention of breaking up the casino monopoly and aiming to create an Asian equivalent of Atlantic City.
I welcome the fact that Macau's crime rate has also improved.
Statistics show that the overall drop in crime is around 5% and that the police have significantly reduced gang-related crime involving the gambling industry.
On the negative side the unemployment rate has reached 7% causing unrest among workers.
Their fears and uncertainties have been compounded because of their belief that immigrants will pose a threat to future employment.
Macau does boast a sound education system but its economic dependence on gambling and textiles, and its failure to attract high-tech industries do not augur well for the future employment prospects of the young population.
Other worrying developments are the claims of police brutality made by Falangong practitioners who were refused entry to Macau during the visit of President Jiang and who were also denied the right to protest against the government's crackdown on the group.
Furthermore, President Jiang's plea to Macau's government not to allow criticism of Beijing raises fundamental questions about the Chinese Government's commitment to allow freedom of expression which is fundamental to the success of the one-country two-systems policy.
Overall, progress has been made since the handover and that progress can be described as satisfactory.
However, it is imperative, as also with Hong Kong, to continue monitoring to ensure that there is no erosion of democracy, human rights and freedoms.
I can assure the last speaker that this is not simply an issue of interest to the Portuguese.
It is an issue of interest, not only to the European Union, but to the world and those who want to see Macau and Hong Kong progress, so that basic freedoms are guaranteed and are not eroded by the country to which they have been handed back.
. (DE) Mr President, quite frankly, I thought I was going to speak after the Commissioner and so I have only just arrived.
I just wanted to tell you that I read this text with great interest.
I am of the view that the European Union should not underestimate this issue.
The thing is that we, as the European Union, live on this Eurasian continent and a large part of humanity is crowded into Asia.
For us, the relationship between Europe and its Asiatic partners is of strategic importance.
In this, Macao is of great importance because, in this region, a European cultural tradition has become intermingled with an Asian tradition and a whole host of thoughts about human rights and freedom has sprung up.
Despite its relatively small size, Macao has an extraordinary bridging function.
That is why I am of the view that we Europeans must never abandon Macao. We must also acknowledge that we are not entirely innocent in the fate of many people who lived there in the past and, possibly, of many who will live there in the future.
That is why we have an obligation which goes far beyond what Portugal generously took on.
I am pleased that Mr Cushnahan and I are speaking in this debate. This gives us a chance to explain that this situation is not only a legacy of the former Portuguese colonial empire but an essentially European concern.
We as Europeans must recognise that Asia is our most important strategic partner and whatever brings the European body of thought closer to the Asian body of thought and vice versa, and whatever consolidates thoughts of democracy and the rule of law on the Asian continent, is not only in the interest of people living there but it is also a basic interest of the European Union.
Mr President, the European Commission welcomes Mr Soares's report on the Commission's communication 'The European Union and Macao beyond 2000' and we also welcome the draft motion for a resolution.
I am happy to note that Parliament and the Commission have reached similar overall conclusions on how to approach the future for Macao.
I welcome the positive developments that have occurred in the Macao special administrative region (SAR) over the past year since the handover.
We attach great importance to the people of Macao being able to continue to live their lives with the rights and freedoms they have enjoyed for so long.
We share Parliament's view regarding the importance of the 1987 joint declaration and 1993 Basic Law as the main instruments for defining the status of the Macao special administrative region.
This is why the Commission has given its commitment to watching very closely the process of transition and to helping the smooth implementation and retention of the 'one country, two systems' principle.
In the first year since the handover, Macao has established the required administrative institutions and adjusted to the new situation.
The government, the legislative council and the judiciary have all made impressive efforts to adapt to the new situation.
Macao has also been active internationally in its own right in areas such as telecommunications, civil aviation and investment protection, affirming its individuality and autonomy in areas covered by the Basic Law.
Like Parliament, we also welcome the fact that Macao has been provided with a modern legal system, including an express ban in the penal code on the enforcement of the death penalty.
A modernised legal system will be of great benefit when applying the Basic Law under the 'one country, two systems' principle.
On our side, we will support their correct implementation where possible, including through our cooperation programme and particularly our legal cooperation project.
We share the view of the importance of the 1993 EU-Macao Trade and Cooperation Agreement remaining in force to strengthen relations.
We consider the agreement is fundamental to EU-Macao relations and is the basic requirement for the development of increased business cooperation, especially business-to-business links.
It is also the basis for improved cooperation in those areas where Macao has retained its autonomy.
We intend to develop our trade as much as we can and the situation is improving.
We will be supporting efforts to position the EU better in Macao by encouraging more investment by European companies and by helping Macau diversify its economic base when the time is right.
We are pleased that last year was good for Macao's economy.
Economic growth was positive, reaching 4% for the first time since 1996.
The European Parliament report and the resolution call for a dynamic approach in the activities of the EU-Macao Joint Committee.
I can report that EU-Macao relations remain extremely good.
The Joint Committee held its annual meeting in Brussels on 30 June 2000.
This provided an excellent forum for both sides to exchange candid views and detailed information on the work in progress of transforming Macao into a special administrative region.
They also discussed ways to improve and strengthen bilateral links, including through cooperation and trade and economic relations based on the recommendations of the Commission communication.
With regard to cooperation, the resolution calls upon the Commission to settle quickly the question of appointing a technical cooperation officer for Macao.
Here I would have liked to be able to report that the nominated technical cooperation officer had been appointed in November as had been planned.
Unfortunately the selected candidate withdrew at the final stage after a selection procedure that lasted several months.
We continue to consider the appointment of the technical cooperation officer very important.
All in all, the situation in Macao has been positive.
The Commission is finalising its first annual report on Macao and hopes to transmit it shortly to Council and Parliament.
Parliament's report itself is timely, as its observations and recommendations will provide another source of advice to draw on when finalising the Commission's first annual report.
As I have already mentioned, we attach great importance to maintaining the rights, freedoms and democratic principles of Macao and its people.
The Commission's report will look closely at the full range of issues that have characterised Macao's daily life during the first year of the SAR's existence.
Finally I am pleased to report that the Chief Executive of Macao, Mr Edmond Ho will visit Brussels on 7 May 2001.
I know that the Commission will be keen to discuss with him the most recent developments in Macao.
I hope that some of you will also have the opportunity to meet him.
I can assure Parliament that the Commission will continue to maintain an active watch on events in Macao, especially those regarding democratic principles and human rights.
The Commission remains committed to assisting Macao wherever possible and to helping it develop and realise its full potential.
We also remain fully committed to keeping Parliament informed of progress throughout Macao's transition process.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
EC/Mexico Agreement (economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation)
The next item is the report (A5-0036/2001) by Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the EC-Mexico Joint Council with a view to the adoption of a decision implementing Articles 6, 9, 12(2)(b) and 50 of the Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement [COM(2000) 739 - C5-0698/2000 - 2000/0296(CNS)].
Mr President, my report refers to the fourth consultation of the European Parliament on the EU/Mexico Agreement.
Since it is also probably the last consultation for the foreseeable future it has particular importance. The report concerns aspects of the agreement that are not covered by the so-called interim agreement, i.e. services, investment and aspects of intellectual property.
From a European perspective, the EU/Mexico agreement is generally seen as a milestone in the forthcoming relations with Latin American countries.
It has the largest scope of any agreement the EU has ever concluded with a third country, providing EC operators with more rapid preferential treatment than Mexico has ever before granted to any of its preferential partners.
Indeed, with this agreement, the EU has not only succeeded in achieving NAFTA parity but has actually achieved a result that goes beyond NAFTA privileges in a number of areas. Among those are the ones that I focus on in this report.
However, I believe that some of these gains for the EU are being made at the expense of the people of Mexico.
Although my report approves the proposal for a Council decision, it does so with some reluctance and with a number of serious reservations and recommendations for reform which I should like to set out now.
First and most important is the issue of poverty in Mexico.
It is essential that the agreement more fully reflects the fact that Mexico has an ambiguous position in terms of its development status.
On the one hand, it is a member of the OECD and thus is considered to be one of the industrialised countries; but, on the other hand, it is a country with 95 million inhabitants where well over half the population - 65% - live in poverty.
That means it is absolutely essential to take seriously the coherence principle of the European Union.
To me, the bottom line must be that a reinforced economic partnership with Mexico and better access to Mexican markets must not contradict development objectives and must not exacerbate the existing asymmetry between the two parties.
It is therefore of considerable concern that in a significant number of places the agreement is likely to hinder, rather than to support, poverty eradication, human rights and sustainable development.
I will outline some of these in a moment.
A good example is the fact that the agreement foresees the almost total prohibition of performance requirements which will prevent the Mexican side from specifying the terms on which it would like to see trade and foreign investment.
That means that Mexico will not be able to ensure that trade and foreign investment support its own emerging markets and its own development objectives.
Looking at the agreement in more detail, starting with services: For the Commission, the negotiated trade package in services is: "of key offensive interest".
Indeed the liberalisation covers very nearly all sectors.
So its terms and scope are very far-reaching.
But, more worryingly, it contains a stand-still clause which, by prohibiting Mexico from introducing any further standards and conditions in the future, could seriously damage the social and economic development and policy autonomy of this country.
Furthermore the agreement states that: "no mode of supply is a priori excluded from coverage".
If that implies that education and health might be covered without safeguards, this is an area of further concern.
I am sure Members will recall that in the European Parliament in 1999, in our response to the approach to the Millennium Round, we made a specific demand that health and education be excluded from the revision of the GATS.
It would therefore be inconsistent to include education and health in the EU/Mexico agreement as sectors that could be liberalised.
Finally, Mexican civil society groups believe that the Mexican negotiators went beyond their powers in making this agreement, since the agreement establishes the powers of the Joint Council to dismantle Mexican trade and services legislation, which clearly should be within the remit of the legislative power.
Parliament should support civil society in Mexico, which is asking for this unconstitutional provision to be changed.
On investment, the different economic crashes we have seen in Mexico make investment a particularly sensitive issue.
However, the definition of investment in the agreement includes direct investment, real estate and purchases of securities, and therefore seems to open the door to speculative movements and thus to further financial instability.
I could go on citing more problems that we can see in the area of intellectual property rights, on conflict resolution and, indeed, on human rights.
But to conclude in terms of where we need to go now, we need to have a clear statement from the Commissioner about the agenda of the Joint Council meeting on 27 February.
There are a number of key issues which I have raised which must be on that agenda.
I would like to know from the Commissioner present if and when we will get the agenda of this meeting, if he is going to include the kinds of issues that I have raised in my speech - and also in the report itself - and when we will get the results of that meeting of 27 February.
The Joint Council meeting must include the competences of the Joint Council along with the Mexican constitution, ensuring their compatibility.
It must include effective monitoring of human rights.
It must include a commitment to coherence and compatibility of trade measures and it must ensure that the European Parliament is closely associated with this agreement in all its future changes.
Mr President, before I begin my intervention on this report, I should like to ask that it be recorded in the Minutes that in accordance with Rule 161 of the Rules of Procedure the explanatory statement in the report under discussion is the responsibility of the rapporteur alone and only reflects her personal opinion, not the opinion of the Committee on Industry.
There is no reason why citizens should know our Rules and certain statements may lend themselves to confusion and give rise to misunderstandings.
Thank you, Mr President, and now I shall begin my intervention.
The proposal for a decision contained in the Commission proposal, which is the subject of the report we are beginning to debate, is the culmination of a long process that began in 1995 with the signing of a joint declaration between the European Community and Mexico.
This declaration established some objectives that were to become an agreement that would replace the Cooperation Agreement signed in 1991, in order to strengthen and enhance the political, economic and commercial relations between the European Union and Mexico.
The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement, also known as the Global Agreement, was signed in December 1997.
Therefore, the Commission proposal on which Parliament has been consulted must be considered in the context of the Global Agreement signed by the European Union and Mexico - the most important agreement the European Union has ever signed, I think it is worth remembering.
This is also the context of the interim agreement dealing with the economic and commercial aspects of the Global Agreement, the aim of which was to allow negotiations to begin as soon as possible for the liberalisation of the commercial aspects of Community competence included in the Global Agreement.
With regard to the proposal for a decision with which we are concerned and the agreements it deals with, my Group sees them as being very positive because they strengthen the possibility for Community operators to act in spheres of particular interest by guaranteeing them access to the Mexican market on equal or even better terms than those enjoyed by NAFTA countries in the area of services, investments, payments and respect for intellectual property rights, with the resulting benefits and legal guarantee that all this may bring to the European Union.
These considerations by themselves would justify the unreserved approval of the proposal for a decision by my Group and, I hope, by this Parliament as well.
Furthermore, in addition to the economic advantages, my Group is well aware of the political benefits arising from the adoption of this proposal for a decision, and also that the European Union-Mexico Joint Council, which will meet at the end of this month, needs to adopt it, because only once it is adopted can the provisions on political dialogue and cooperation in the areas of education, combating poverty, and social and environmental matters come into force.
My Group in particular and this Parliament in general have always been highly sensitive to such questions, because they are the guarantee that the economic benefits which will undoubtedly accrue from the overall agreement will help promote a political system that is more democratic, more respectful of human rights and more in tune with social justice.
Mr President, as chairman of Parliament' s Delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, I wish to congratulate the participants on concluding the final stage of one of the most ambitious projects the European Union has ever undertaken.
I should also like to take advantage of the presence of the Mexican Ambassador to the European Union, the diplomat, Jaime Zabludovsky, to congratulate him on his active contribution to this agreement.
This agreement establishes the bases for closer relations between the European Union and Mexico.
In this respect, I should like to emphasise that, on this occasion, we have managed not only to obtain institutional declarations, but we have created a legal framework that will bring together these two peoples who share many common values, if both parties are able to take full advantage of the potential of this agreement.
To this extent, I wish to emphasise that, in addition to the mechanisms that have been established in the fields of political cooperation and trade, an instrument has also been created to boost and further cooperation in more than thirty different areas.
Almost three years have passed since Parliament delivered a favourable opinion on the interim agreement between the European Union and Mexico.
One year later, Parliament also expressed its support for the overall agreement, which was then ratified by the Fifteen Member States of the Union.
Throughout this period, we have witnessed the great changes that have taken place in Mexican society and which have culminated in what can be called a genuine celebration of democracy: last July' s elections.
On this subject, I should like to take this opportunity to pay public tribute to President Ernesto Zedillo for his commitment to democratic reform.
I should also like to convey to the new leaders of the Mexican administration my sincerest hope that they will continue in the current direction and repay the trust that the Mexican people has invested in them.
To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we need to call for two things: firstly, we must ask the Commission, in the person of Commissioner Nielson, through the intermediary of the European Union delegation in Mexico, to undertake an assessment on the ground of the agreement' s potential for trade and cooperation and to ensure that his results are distributed to the various parties concerned. Secondly, we must once again ask the parties concerned in the Chiapas conflict to maximise their efforts in dialogue based on respect for democratic principles, so that an end can be brought to an anachronistic situation that has no place in modern society.
Mr President, I should also like to express our solidarity with the people of El Salvador, who have, once again, fallen victim to a natural disaster.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as the Nicaraguan writer Sergio RamÃ­rez has pointed out, the political map of Latin America can be interpreted today by means of some diverse and highly contrasting landmarks.
One of these could be the 'tequila effect' which has irradiated from Mexico since the last presidential elections, a genuine example of civic pride which, we trust, will have beneficial consequences to help shape the new political map of the United Mexican States.
There we hope to see a separation of powers and guarantees that governments will alternate in power, and we are sure that the necessary interrelationship between economic modernisation and political modernisation will increasingly prosper.
Of course Mexico is a country of light and shade, like any country in the European Union.
That is why I noticed the excessively critical tone used by the rapporteur of this report in her explanatory statement regarding the social and economic situation in this Latin American republic.
I believe we should be careful in our statements and I am surprised by the rapporteur' s doubts on questions of Mexican constitutional competences when dealing with trade in services.
With regard to investments, I do not think the assessments made are appropriate, since the degree of internationalisation of the Mexican economy in recent years has been remarkable, to the point where Mexico is the country that has most used the Community financial instrument known as the ECIP.
This is clearly reflected in the growth in investment by foreign companies and in the free trade agreements, both the one signed with the United States and Canada and the recent one with the European Union.
In the latter case, Mexico has made a strategic effort to diversify its relations, which had focused so much on the United States, and this will moreover provide European goods with tariff treatment similar to that given to US goods, especially with regard to industrial products.
We shall obviously be voting in favour.
Mr President, in the short space of time available to me I must say that we consider the proposal for a Council decision that we are debating today to be positive overall, because at the time we were pleased with the signing and subsequent ratification of the agreement with Mexico, because we understand that it is an important - I might even say unheard-of - step in the relations of the European Union with a Latin American country.
But this agreement, like everything else in life, can be improved.
We understand of course that the agreement is a trading issue, but we feel there is a lack of concrete measures on the development of Mexico, our sister country.
Similarly, nowhere in the functions of the Joint Committee (Article 44) did we find provision for a study of the repercussions of putting the association agreement into practice, something that we believe is frankly essential.
We also regret that there is not even a mention of the environment in this agreement, not even -as my colleague Caroline Lucas has pointed out - a reference to the Protocol on Biosafety within the sections on intellectual property.
Lastly, I must point out the profound inconsistency in the fact that, whereas in Mexico the agreement has been ratified by institutions elected by the people, in the European Union, which thinks of itself as a model of democracy, this agreement is not passed on directly for approval by this Parliament, which has been directly elected by the people of Europe, but it is simply consulted.
Mr President, our Group supports and appreciates the report by Ms Lucas as a positive contribution to the proposal made by the Council regarding the Joint Council meeting and its development.
The observations and recommendations on democratic transparency in matters as delicate as services, investment, intellectual property and conflict resolution are made out of respect for Parliament, the Mexican people and the Constitution of that country, and are also aimed at preventing any damaging effects on Mexican society.
The European Union is obliged to ensure that our relationship and agreement with Mexico do not help increase problems, as has happened with the usual United States intervention and, more specifically, with the worsening of the Chiapas situation, since this area is the focus of multinational interests.
Hence it is important that this agreement should succeed, since it would mean a different type of relationship between the European Union and Latin America, for instance in the forthcoming agreements with Mercosur and Chile, and it would be a major source of hope for the continent.
Mr President, this EU-Mexico agreement gives me an opportunity to say that it makes a lovely change for the European Parliament to be discussing free trade, something to which it usually pays just lip service.
When this agreement was completed, however, my first thought was lucky Mexico.
Here is a country which can enter into a trade agreement with the EU without having to join the club, without having to pay the membership fee or take on thousands of directives and regulations every year.
Why can't the UK do the same I thought.
On another level I must highlight the observations of the rapporteur that there is an increased sensitivity amongst Members of Parliament about who makes the decisions on trade: whether it is the Council or the Commission.
Actually that sensitivity is not confined to this Parliament.
Many of my party members and constituents share that sensitivity and are alarmed at the Nice developments which seem to place far too much power in the hands of unelected Commission officials.
That is to say that I would not be content if the power was vested elsewhere in the EU, because the greatest sensitivity is that we as a country are having trade agreements affecting the UK negotiated and finalised by a third party, which may or may not be entirely in our national interests.
Further, as to conflict resolution procedures based as they are on a WTO model, we have already experienced the banana war where innocent British companies have been penalised for matters which have nothing to do with them and over which they have no control whatsoever.
Altogether we are happy that the EU and Mexico have reached an agreement but we do not believe that the UK should be bound by it.
We would much rather make our own agreements on our own terms.
Mr President, first of all I should like to express my satisfaction at the conclusion of the Association Agreement between Mexico and the European Union. Many of us present here have played an active part in preparing this agreement over the last few years.
With regard to the report we are dealing with, I should like to point out two aspects I consider important, the treatment of which is surprising.
First, this text mentions the Mexican constitution at least eight times, arguing that if Mexico signs the agreement with the European Union this will supposedly violate that country' s supreme charter.
In this regard, I should just like to recall that on 20 May 2000 the Mexican Parliament approved this cooperation by 89 votes to 11 with two abstentions.
The same figures apply to the approval of the commercial decisions of the Joint Council for the Interim Agreement and also those of the Joint Council for the Global Agreement.
No parliamentary group appealed to the nation' s Supreme Court of Justice, the body authorised to settle such matters, on grounds of unconstitutionality.
On another subject, with regard to human rights, it should be remembered that Mexico has signed more than 50 international treaties on human and workers' rights, including many of those mentioned in the report on the table.
It also recognises the mandatory jurisdiction of the Interamerican Court of Human Rights in such matters.
It seems then, that the rule of law prevails in Mexico.
In addition, the current administration has signed an agreement with the United Nations and has set up a special embassy at that international organisation for human rights and democracy.
I must also mention that in 1999 the democracy clause was included in this agreement.
Lastly, I think the best guarantee of being able to exercise individual rights and freedoms is economic prosperity; as everyone knows and as has been demonstrated on many occasions, free trade agreements provide in the medium term a solid basis on which to achieve it.
Mr President, it has already been said that our group will approve the Council proposal.
Mexico is an important country.
It is the largest Spanish-speaking country in the world.
Accordingly, this agreement is of great political importance.
But I would like to stress that it is also of great importance to us to approve this agreement, because it is evidence of the common foreign policy of the European Union. I address this remark in particular to the Commissioner responsible for foreign policy.
In this, I differ from my British colleagues for whom it would be preferable that the Member States concluded individual agreements with Mexico.
I regard the fact that the European Union is tackling this issue as a united front as a great step forward.
For us, the agreement with Mexico has a high priority.
What is more, it is the first in a series of agreements we are currently negotiating with Mercosur and Chile.
Implementing the Mexico agreement therefore serves a pilot function.
As far as our foreign trade policy is concerned, this will improve our trading situation in Mexico.
The share of Europe' s trade with Mexico has fallen back to simply ridiculously low levels.
This situation must improve and I believe it is also in the interest of Mexico not to be solely dependent on trade with the USA but to have a well-balanced trade position, with Europe playing a role.
This, I believe, is a truism.
To this extent, the agreement is in our interest as much as it is in the interest of Mexico.
While approving the EU/Mexico agreement, we should nevertheless honour the fact that Mexico is changing.
The election of President Fox means that, for the first time since the Mexican revolution, there has been a changeover of power.
Mexico now ranks among the states in which democratic changeovers of power will become the norm.
There is also hope that the conflict in Chiapas, in the south of the country, will be settled peacefully.
Mexico has opened itself up to the USA, but it is also prepared to open itself up to Europe.
I would therefore very much welcome it if, for instance, the newly elected President of Mexico were to pay a visit to Europe in the not too distant future, and perhaps speak to us here in this Chamber, and if European heads of state were to visit Mexico.
A final word on the Lucas report: as is always the case, it is clear that we do not agree on the explanatory statement contained in the report.
Here, the rapporteur is free to express his or her opinion. But I would like to say in this connection that cooperation with Mexico, a country with which we entertain friendly relations, is critical.
What is more, this works in both directions.
We want to have the freedom to say what we do not like in other areas and we also ask our friends to tell us what they do not like.
That can best be exemplified by the situation with the USA: we have had some very serious clashes with the USA - and vice versa too, I might add - without that having changed our cooperation partnership and our mutual trust in any way.
Mr President, my group is very much aware of the importance of the EU-Mexico free trade partnership agreement to both partners and backs the rapporteur's initiative on most points.
Mexico is the European Union's most important trading partner in Latin America after Brazil, and I am particularly proud that Europe has reached a result that goes beyond NAFTA privileges in a number of areas which are good for Europe but also good for Mexico.
We consider this agreement a milestone in future relations with Latin American countries.
In the context of today's debate, the European Liberals would like particularly to stress the importance of the standard human rights clause in this agreement, especially respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights.
We would like to underline how vital it is to monitor the human rights situation in Mexico as I have seen with my own eyes.
In this context I find the rapporteur's proposal to proceed to a reform of Articles 39 and 59 of the global agreement judicious.
A side agreement on cooperation on human rights is to be envisaged.
Our main hope is that the opening up of the Mexican economy will contribute towards economic and social development in Chiapas.
We declare our willingness to start this process and I hope that the march of Marcos on Mexico City will mean a breakthrough in peace.
It is now up to President Fox to make what he promised the European Parliament delegation during his campaign come true.
I will follow it closely.
Mr President, we gladly give the agreement between the European Union and Mexico the benefit of the doubt.
At the same time, we would request the Council and Commission to provide the European Parliament with continuous and comprehensive updates on the mutual effects this agreement has.
This explicit request is tied in closely with the promising initiatives which the new Mexican President, Vincente Fox, is currently developing.
These are efforts which are clearly aimed at supporting neglected population groups, in the first place the country' s very extensive Indian community, by investments and considerable regional autonomy.
A courageous goal in the face of huge resistance, both politically and socially.
This holds a pleasant, joint development task in store for the European Union and the United States.
At the end of the day, we in Strasbourg and Brussels do not wish to have the reputation worldwide of being cool and collected customers.
In short, wider market access and an improvement of the Mexican position in the world economy requires an approach which is more humanitarian than one-dimensional liberalisation.
We can certainly identify with the social focus which the rapporteur, Mrs Lucas, has opted for amidst the needs of the Mexican population.
In her explanatory statement to the agreement, she mentions the adverse effects this agreement has on the Mexican constitution several times.
However, that is primarily a domestic matter, in our opinion.
But that does not affect our wish for the rapporteur' s commitment to rub off on the Council and Commission in their dealings with the Mexican partners.
. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have an interesting case before us.
I think that a sharp mind must have worked on this report.
The rapporteur has managed, in an exemplary fashion, to tease weaknesses out of an agreement and, reading the explanatory statement contained in the report, Mrs Lucas, I get the impression that it may be paving the way for some form of Euro-imperialism.
I have two specific points to make.
Firstly, as regards the democratic weaknesses which have been pointed out time and again in the explanatory statement, we are setting standards for Mexico which only a strong country can allow itself to set for a weak country.
The need to adapt Mexico' s constitution to bring it into line with this agreement in particular is questionable to say the least.
It reminds me of the deficits which the European Union has itself towards its own citizens due to a lack of democratic legitimisation.
The second point which, in my opinion, should not be forgotten is that Mexico is not only an important trading partner for the European Union but, in the mid 1990s, went through what the then President of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, called the first financial crisis of the twenty-first century.
That is why, to my mind, it is especially laudable that special reference is made to problems which countries like Mexico and, especially now, Argentina have through being closely tied to the US dollar. It is very regrettable that the Commission does not follow mainstream opinion, which says that we must pay attention.
From my own perspective, I would even prefer to go in the direction of the Bretton Wood system.
The relevant precautions are lacking, as is positive assistance to Mexico.
Perhaps the only criticism I would have against the report is that we do not point out in the recommendations that, in the field of financial crises, we should be extending our help.
Mr President, the agreement with Mexico is in fact a milestone in our relations with the countries of Latin America.
It has a larger area of application than any previous agreement between the European Union and a third country.
I have always been very critical towards, but, at the same time, very solidly behind this agreement with Mexico. For us, it is not only a matter of keeping the interests of the European Union in mind - which is very much the case with many in this House - but also the interests of Mexico and its people, who mostly live in poverty.
The agreement will therefore only be a milestone if it improves the living conditions of the overwhelming majority of Mexicans.
Of crucial importance will also be how democracy and human rights are implemented.
The Fox administration will have to be measured in terms of that and not just in terms of its economic success.
Special heed should be paid to the services sector and direct investments, since Mexico must not be regarded as an extended workbench. Rather, investments must contribute to enhancing regional development.
They must be in line with clear social and ecological standards, which must not only be scrutinised but also adhered to. It also behoves us here in the European Parliament and the Mexican government to ensure that the greatest possible benefits are reaped for the people of Mexico.
But how the Joint Council performs its tasks in connection with the further development of the agreement and how Mexico' s Parliament and the European Union will be integrated are also important for us.
And as there is nothing that could not be improved, I hope Mexico and the European Union, as equal partners at the same eye level, will resolve the discrepancies and remove the errors which doubtless still exist in the contract.
I say this as Vice-President of the Delegation for Relations with Central America and Mexico.
I stand by this agreement and if these objectives, about which Mrs Lucas has said a great deal, are fulfilled, nothing should stand in the way of success.
Then this agreement would really be a milestone in the history of the contracts concluded between the European Union and a Latin American country.
Mr President, Mr Seguro mentioned at the end of his contribution the terrible situation in El Salvador.
I would like to take this opportunity to inform Parliament that today I have decided to release another EUR 5 to 8 million to support people in El Salvador. This is quite significant.
Turning to the matter under discussion, Mexico has gone through a radical modernisation process over the last decade.
The NAFTA agreement has played an important role in this.
It led to a major increase of trade and investment flows between the US and Mexico and also Canada.
Neither the EU nor Mexico wanted the NAFTA agreement to result in less intense relations between the EU and Mexico.
We both accepted the challenge and decided to adapt our relations.
This culminated with the entry into force last October of our economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation agreement, often called the global agreement.
This agreement, which consists of a free trade area, political dialogue and cooperation provisions reinforces Mexico's existing relations with Europe.
Due to the very complex distribution of competence between the Community and its Member States, the free trade agreement is made up of two separate legal texts.
The first, Decision 2/2000, covers the areas of Community competence and was adopted by the Joint Council in Lisbon on 23 March 2000 after Parliament gave its opinion on 16 March 2000.
It entered into force on 1 July 2000.
The second text covers the remaining areas - services, investment and intellectual property - and should be adopted by the Joint Council on 27 February 2001.
The later text, which we are debating today, will liberalise services in two phases.
Firstly by including a stand-still clause which prevents both parties from introducing new discriminatory measures or reinforcing the existing ones.
This clause only applies to discriminatory measures and therefore does not exclude the possibility of adopting new, restrictive, non-discriminatory rules in order, for instance, to protect the environment further.
Secondly, this decision provides for the elimination of substantially all remaining discrimination between the parties over a maximum period of ten years.
The decision will comply with GATS rules - mainly the obligation not to exclude any sector from the liberalisation process.
Moreover the text includes measures concerning investments and related payments which complete the undertakings already made by both parties at the OECD and through bilateral agreements signed between Mexico and most of the Member States.
The European Parliament has been invited to give its opinion on this second decision.
Once this decision is adopted by the Joint Council on 27 February 2001, the free trade agreement will be fully in place.
But this decision has also a bigger impact.
The global agreement will be fully implemented and thus the political dialogue and the cooperation pillars will enter effectively into force.
Mexico is traditionally one of the EU's most important trading partners in Latin America with a significant growth potential, and the EU is Mexico's second trading partner after the US.
The achievement of the free trade agreement will provide EC operators with access to the Mexican market similar to NAFTA.
Our trading relationship, which has declined over previous years, should improve markedly now that we are able to compete on a level playing field with the US and Canadian products and services.
We should be satisfied by what we have achieved in this area.
The EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement is the first agreement of this type which the EU has signed with a Latin American country.
Apart from trade, we should make full use of this comprehensive agreement to further deepen our already excellent bilateral relations with Mexico.
The institutionalised high level political dialogue will provide a good tool to agree on common positions, on issues of mutual interest: for instance, UN reform, efforts to launch a new WTO round and the human rights situation of both parties.
The agreement will provide us with new possibilities for cooperation on the basis of the guidelines laid down for the period 2000-2006, whether on strengthening the rule of law, judicial reform, tackling poverty or investing in human resources.
It is a new, very ambitious beginning.
I share the views expressed by most Members in this debate, and we will be very happy to see this flourish in the coming years.
Mr President, on a point of order, there was one specific piece of information that I asked for from the Commissioner.
It was about the agenda of the joint Council meeting on 27 February.
Could he tell us if and when we can get hold of that agenda, what will be on it and what kind of report we can expect from that meeting?
The way the division of labour is organised will mean that we will, of course, inform Parliament about the results of that meeting.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon.
Facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence
The next item is the report (A5-0315/2000), by Mr Ceyhun, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the French Republic with a view to the adoption of a Council Directive defining the facilitation of unauthorised entry, movement and residence (10675/2000 - C5-0427/2000 - 2000/0821(CNS)) and a Council Framework Decision on the strengthening of the penal framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence [10676/2000 - C5-0426/2000 - 2000/0820(CNS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in August 2000, two initiatives were put forward by the then French Council Presidency to combat criminal networks trading in human beings and to take appropriate preventive measures.
But before that, a great many refugees had to die as victims of these criminal networks trading in human beings.
Unfortunately, they are still dying.
Every week, we read at least two reports about this sad state of affairs.
For this reason, the European Union must act without delay.
The Council Directive defining the facilitation of illegal immigration and unauthorised residence defines a statutory framework to prevent the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence by criminal networks trading in human beings.
The second initiative is a Council Framework Decision on the strengthening of the penal framework to combat the facilitation of unauthorised entry and residence and hence to prevent the exploitation of refugees.
I must admit that both initiatives could actually be offered as a single initiative.
They could be combined into a single proposal on the same legal base, that of the first pillar.
Unfortunately, I was unable to convince the French Interior Minister.
I am pleased that my proposed amendments were backed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
Now we no longer have two restrictive proposals but two proposals which can deal differently with the different target groups.
While the criminal networks trading in human beings must be combated, NGOs or churches and other similar organisations which offer humanitarian aid to persecuted human beings must not be treated as criminals.
We should not ignore the fact that, sadly, even today, tens of thousands of people have to flee from various forms of persecution and war.
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, is it a criminal act to help a persecuted person in this situation?
Quite frankly, I am glad that there are courageous people who help those who are being persecuted.
For this reason, it was very important to define facilitation and the honest facilitator precisely.
The text of the French initiative did not distinguish between individual and organised facilitation or between commercial and moral facilitation.
That is why a correction was crucial.
I would not like to overlook the fact that trading in human beings is a lucrative business for criminals.
But it would be a fatal mistake to believe that this problem can only be solved with restrictive measures.
Police and judicial measures must be accompanied by a common European asylum and immigration policy.
Only in this way can we succeed in preventing the sad events we all witnessed at Dover from being repeated in the future.
It would have been easy to reject the proposals of the French government, which I criticised, as there is no common asylum and immigration policy.
It really would have been the easiest thing for us to simply declare the matter settled in five minutes.
But, given the fate of the victims, that would have been irresponsible.
That is why I am glad that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and I have managed, with my report, to develop the initiatives so that both humanitarian and penal demands can be met.
I very much regret that the PPE-DE is not prepared to back this report.
On the other hand, I am delighted to be able to thank the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party for their sensible, supplementary proposals.
I hope that, with my report, we will show the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left that, in such a difficult situation, the European Parliament will put forward to the Council groundbreaking proposals for action which will represent the interests not only of the state but also of humanity.
Mr President, when I left the House of Commons in the United Kingdom in 1997 I thought I had got away from debates that took place after 10 p.m.
It is very comforting, however, to see that we are able to debate matters of great importance later in the evening.
I am also interested to note that in the United Kingdom debates now seem to have been truncated into times that are well before 10 p.m.
The balance of power, in that sense, has certainly shifted.
I was privileged to be an immigration minister in the last government.
It is important for me to emphasise straight away that the EPP is in agreement with the aim of the French initiative.
It is vitally important to curb illegal immigration and to deal with the criminals who are exploiting poor people to their own advantage, both financially and in other ways.
However, sadly, as shadow rapporteur I am unable to speak in support of many of Mr Ceyhun's amendments, as I believe that these do not actually address the issue but could on the contrary have the effect of exacerbating it.
In particular, it seems to me difficult to try to decriminalise the facilitation of illegal immigration for some groups rather than others.
The notion that those acting with humanitarian intentions should be immune from prosecution is very problematic and certainly subjective.
I, as a lawyer, also have to question why the law should apply to some and not to others.
The humanitarian motives referred to in many of the amendments of Mr Ceyhun are, again, very difficult to define or to interpret in a fair and proper manner in a court of law.
This does not imply that humanitarian organisations should refrain from aiding such people after their proper entry into a Member State - I would very much support that continuing, and certainly being a feature in future - but rather that they have no more right to participate in any illegal act, in our view, than anyone else.
In this context it also has to be stressed that illegal immigrants whose entry is assisted by traffickers should surely be no more immune to prosecution than other illegal immigrants.
Of course there is a difficulty with the implementation of a common immigration and asylum policy.
I, as a British Conservative, have doubts about that.
But tonight I am perfectly happy that we should look at it in the context of how it will develop.
We are not yet ready.
We do not yet have that policy in place.
Given that such a policy may be implemented, this report appears at an inopportune moment.
It is imperative that the parameters of the common immigration and asylum policy should be established before any inner standards - such as those addressed in this report - are set.
Improving the legal status of refugees, as stated in Amendment No 2, is not, to my knowledge, part of any common immigration and asylum policy.
As regards compensatory payments, the rapporteur does not detail how the money would be spent.
An increase in the EU budget surely requires more justification than is shown.
It is always important to distinguish between asylum and immigration: those are two separate issues, the latter of which is covered by the 1951 Geneva Convention.
Amendments underlining the importance of that convention are certainly welcomed by me and the EPP.
We support the French initiative.
We merely regret that this report has appeared before its time and is unacceptable.
Mr President, I am sorry, I was confused about the time.
I should first like to congratulate my colleague Mr Ceyhun for the work he has done and his efforts to cover all the sensitive issues surrounding these two initiatives.
Secondly, I must stress to this House something which is an absolute priority for the future of the European Union, our society and the political project we are constructing from here.
It is the need for a Community immigration and asylum policy, something we will not be able to achieve without commitment, effort and hard work from the European Union' s political institutions.
I should like to reiterate a number of issues that this House and the Council must take clearly into account when making future decisions.
It is essential to distinguish between the disinterested humanitarian aiding of illegal immigration and the activities of criminal networks as laid down in Article 27 of the Schengen Convention.
It is also important to distinguish clearly between those who benefit directly and actively from illegal immigration, such as those who organise and take part in the transport of illegal immigrants, and on the other hand the passive and indirect beneficiaries, who are the ones who profit from the work of illegal immigrants.
It must also be stressed that the economic benefit itself may be direct or indirect, depending on the nature of the activity performed.
I realise, however, that carriers cannot be held liable for transporting persons who request political asylum immediately upon arrival within the territory of a Member State.
Carriers have neither the ability nor the authority to assess the admissibility of an application for asylum, and hence I understand that under no circumstances can they be directly or indirectly persuaded through these instruments to carry out an assessment of suitability.
Sanctions must be proportionate and balanced and the punishment must be made to fit the crime.
The means and ends must strictly respect the obligations accepted by the countries which are parties to the 1951 Geneva Convention as regards asylum-seekers entering an EU Member State.
The purpose of such measures must never be to dissuade asylum-seekers from exercising their legitimate right to seek the protection of a signatory state, since this would constitute an infringement of the Geneva Convention.
Lastly, I should like to point out that the Member States need to be aware that certain regions of the European Union are particularly affected by illegal immigration, and because of their geographical position they are having to shoulder much of the burden imposed by the immigration policies, so budget lines should be developed to allow compensatory payments, which will increase solidarity within the European Union in this area.
Mr President, we all remember with horror the container containing 58 dead Chinese people that was found at Dover last summer.
Recently, we saw drowned people washed up on the Spanish coast.
Such tragedies occur around Europe every day, if not always in such spectacular forms.
The gangs that earn money from exploiting people' s desperation and smuggle them across borders under horrendous safety conditions must, of course, be punished.
This is an inhumane business.
Joint efforts are required here at EU level.
However, the initiative proposed by France only deals with a small part of these incredibly complex issues concerning migration and refugees.
Despite fine declarations of global responsibility, the EU Member States have not been able to agree on a common asylum and immigration policy.
It seems that the only thing that can be agreed upon is repressive measures.
The smugglers must of course be punished, and airlines that allow persons without valid documents to board must pay fines.
It is unreasonable to leave it to the cabin crew to assess people' s need for protection.
One must also ask why people stake everything they own in order to be smuggled into an unknown country in unsafe conditions.
Is it really possible to get into the EU by lawful means when we require visas from 130 countries?
I do not believe it is.
The EU is in the process of building a Fortress Europe.
The Liberal Group would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive programme on migration issues.
A common policy is required in this area.
The report written by the rapporteur is an important modification of the French proposal, because he attempts to see the nuances.
Certainly the gangs must be punished, but there are people who conceal refugees without any prospect of profit because they are convinced that the refugees are risking life and limb if they are sent back to their home country.
Relatives, friends or individual organisations must not be punished for this.
A distinction must be made.
It is also important to emphasise that the purpose of this proposal for a directive is not to make it more difficult for people to seek asylum or migrate to the European Union.
With the amendments tabled by the Liberal Group, we will support Mr Ceyhun' s proposal in the hope that the Council will get its act together and agree on a common European asylum and migration strategy.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today the issue of immigration crosses all areas in our European societies, from the situation of legal immigrants to that of illegal immigrants, from the right of asylum to the right of freedom of movement, from socio-economic and cultural rights to political rights.
In the majority of EU States, figures on the granting of refugee status and traditional immigration channels are falling systematically.
On the other hand, the figures for overall immigration have remained stable in recent years, proving that restrictive policies on immigration and visas have succeeded only in increasing the number of illegal immigrants.
On a daily basis, men, women and children die in the attempt to enter illegally into a Europe which has become a real Fortress.
For the most part they fall victim to smugglers and traffickers.
Unfortunately, their ordeal continues once they have entered European States as, without regular papers, they can be freely exploited and forced to suffer intolerable living conditions.
We should point out that some legal immigrants have been made illegal by restrictive legislation.
Some of these have been living in Europe for over twenty years.
They can no longer be expelled, nor can their situation be regularised.
What means is available to them to earn a living and support their families?
The solutions laid down in the proposed initiatives replicate these repressive measures and grounds for exclusion.
They give rise to tragedies such as those in Dover, Gibraltar or the situation of those immigrants without regular papers in Spain, Belgium and France who are on hunger strike in order to obtain recognition.
Who is really responsible?
Not only do these proposals not meet these requirements, but they even go so far as to challenge the right of asylum or the right of family reunion.
While it is clear that we must staunchly fight the organised networks trafficking in human beings, it is unjust to condemn natural or legal persons who, in good faith, assist asylum seekers fleeing conflict, famine and the horrors caused by economic and democratic deficits.
These initiatives, therefore, lump all categories together in an inadmissible and dangerous fashion.
While the proposed amendments limit some of the damage, we reject the initiatives and would vehemently urge the authors to go back to the drawing board.
It is only possible to combat illegal immigration within the framework of an overall Community policy that is clear and that respects the dignity of human beings based on genuine respect for fundamental rights and based on a new North-South relationship.
Finally we would point out that the best weapon to combat discrimination and human exploitation is to acknowledge rights and thus to regularise their status.
Mr President, the policy pursued by many Member States and, to an ever greater degree, by the EU too in this area gives us all a direct share of responsibility for the corpses at Dover and for the bodies washed up on the Spanish coast.
What we are doing is treating the symptoms. We are doing nothing about the real disease.
The disease is, of course, the fact that there are 20 million refugees in the world.
The present project will lead to there being fewer humanitarians and more mafiosi involved in the trafficking in human beings and in helping to transport refugees.
It is said that trafficking in human beings is a lucrative business, but I maintain that, with projects like this, it will become still more lucrative.
The price will rise, and the mafia will, of course, add the cost of their fines to it.
That means more money from desperate people in the pockets of the mafia.
There will be fewer suppliers and ever more demand. That means higher prices.
We know this, of course, from the market economy in general.
It will mean more unscrupulous players and, therefore, more Dover-style accidents.
I have to say that the rapporteur has done his best to temper the proposal.
He has really made an effort, but it is nonetheless still a matter of treating the symptoms. We are not treating the disease.
Our group will, of course, support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Liberal Group.
Above all, we shall support the proposals completely to reject this move, and my group will vote very differently in the final vote on the report.
Mr President, the radical members of the Bonino List will vote against the proposal for a Council initiative and therefore, while voting in favour of some of amendments improving the rapporteur' s proposals, we will also vote against the report as a whole.
The fundamental reason for this is one that affects these and all initiatives dealing with the framework of criminal legislation in the Union.
As a European federalist, and therefore not a Eurosceptic, I consider it monstrous that criminal legislation should be adopted and implemented without any approval by a democratically and legitimately elected Parliament with the legitimacy to grant it.
Here, as elsewhere, I find the road the European Union is taking monstrous.
Criminal law cannot be removed from parliamentary debate.
Because of the very delicacy of the matter, it cannot be abstracted from more general considerations relating to society, risks, weights and counterweights, fundamental causes, and economic and social causes.
The only line on which European integration policy is advancing rapidly is that of repression, because that is easy.
Decisions are prepared by groups of civil servants from the Ministries of Justice and Home Affairs, whose only concern is the efficiency of the repression mechanisms, without any consideration - it is not their fault, that is their craft, their professional approach - or concern for issues arising from society, the economy, work, international policy or development.
We are travelling very fast down the line of repression while, on the other lines, such as guaranteeing the right of asylum and the right to a defence, the European Parliament, the European Union, the European Commission and the Council are incapable of making progress.
So that is the main reason why we cannot accept the Council' s proposals. We cannot accept a report which does not reject them out of hand because, even on this matter, the European Parliament - as usual - is just being consulted and does not have any real powers.
As to the merit of the argument - as Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mrs Frahm have said - it is an illusion to imagine that strengthening the ban on immigration produces anything other than a strengthening of illegal immigration and the forces of illegality overwhelming us.
Our frontiers are being overwhelmed by the illegality produced by our prohibitionist laws. That is the reality.
We should not delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by tinkering with the penalties for carriers of illegal immigrants without democratic consultation.
It is possible - although I hope this does not happen - that we will only succeed in making things worse.
At the same time, the fundamental economic causes are not being addressed.
Commissioner Lamy put a brave proposal to the European Commission for unilateral liberalisation of imports from the poorest countries. That is a means of attacking the fundamental causes, not just doling out charity, alms and assistance but opening our markets to their agricultural products and basic manufacturers.
'Everything but arms' the proposal was called. It was sunk by the lobbies in the European Union and, consequently, pressure from migrations is growing ever stronger.
So the Lamy proposal gets sunk and, at the same time, we delude ourselves that we can solve the problem by a few months' increase in the penalties meted out to those who ply a trade we have presented them with as a gift, for profits we, with our laws, make possible.
We cannot delude ourselves - I say this to Mr Ceyhun and Members on the left - that partial improvement - we are in favour of certain amendments - of this repressive framework can change the situation.
Only as a lesser evil do we support the distinction between immigration for economic profit and immigration for humanitarian purposes, but we do not think it can solve the problem, as you on the left point out yourselves, when you assert that economic causes are ultimately responsible for immigration.
How can you sustain the argument that economic causes are the fundamental causes and, at the same time, take such a strong stand against the entrepreneurs and profiteers running illegal immigration?
This prohibitionist attitude is not confined to immigration alone, but also to the labour market and the new forms of employment - part-time work, temporary work, short-term contracts, seasonal contracts - and it is an attitude that the left, and the unions too, are largely responsible for in Europe.
Let us not try to salve our consciences by attacking the entrepreneurs and those who exploit labour for, in the eyes of the exploited, the people condemned to die in their own country of hunger and a total lack of the means to survive, the European entrepreneur-exploiter may well be the only hope of advancement and salvation for them and their families.
So I conclude, Mr President, by confirming the vote of the Bonino List radical Members against the motion.
Mr President, I consider the two initiatives by the French Republic seeking to better define and strengthen penal sanctions against assisting the illegal entry of aliens into European territory to be particularly welcome.
Illegal immigration, which is growing rapidly, is indeed becoming a major problem for the countries of Europe.
A good indication of this is the increase in the number of asylum requests, which have virtually doubled in the last three years in the main European countries, even though approximately three quarters of these are rejected as unjustified, thereby greatly increasing the number of immigrants illegally resident on our territory.
Europol currently estimates that 500 000 illegal immigrants enter the European Union every year.
This influx of marginalised individuals provides a breeding ground for all sorts of crime and exploitation.
According to the United Nations Organisation, even within Europe some half a million people from this illegal staff pool are reduced to slavery, mostly women and children, who are victims of sexual or economic exploitation.
This situation is a source of shame for Europe and I must say that I am shocked when I read the Commission communication of 22 November 2000 on the Community immigration policy to find that it includes only one tiny paragraph, and a vague one at that, on illegal immigration.
I am shocked, too, to see that the Commission' s first practical proposal in application of this policy was for a particularly lenient draft directive on family reunion.
Once again, one has the impression that the concerns of the Commission are out of step with the concerns of Member States, which raise genuine practical problems.
For, after the French Presidency, which made the fight against illegal immigration one of its priorities, we now have the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and his Italian counterpart, Giuliano Amato, sounding the alarm and demanding an action plan to combat such trafficking.
That is why I totally agree completely with Mr Kirkhope that the amendments by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs are quite misplaced, as they water down the French text.
I also agree that these texts have been brought out at just the right time.
Contrary to the claims made in some of the committee' s amendments, there is no need to wait for a general policy on immigration before taking steps immediately in the specific field of illegal immigration.
There is a clear need for such action as a matter of urgency.
Indeed it is a requirement of the Treaty of Amsterdam, since Article 63(3) stipulates that, for the five years following its entry into force, measures must be taken as a priority against, I quote, "illegal immigration and illegal residence, including repatriation of illegal residents."
The French Republic' s initiatives on illegal immigration must therefore be approved, followed up and reinforced.
We must, incidentally, note our approval of Article 67(1) of the Treaty of Amsterdam which, amid some more unfortunate provisions, had the wisdom to retain Member States' right of initiative in parallel with the Commission' s, even in those aspects of immigration policy which it sought to communitise.
This exceptional juxtaposition, which, in this instance, turns out to be very helpful, is unfortunately only a temporary situation since it is scheduled to last only for a transitional period of five years following the entry into force of the Treaty.
It is therefore going to expire on 30 April 2004.
However, at that very time, at the beginning of 2004 we are due to have an intergovernmental conference that will specifically have to look into the distribution of competences between the European Union and the Member States.
I believe that it would be a good idea for its agenda to include a proposal for extending the duration and scope of States' right of initiative.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our starting point is based on the need to combat illegal immigration and, in particular, the resulting forms of exploitation.
The situation has been exacerbated, not only because it has proved to be extremely lucrative and less risky than other forms of trafficking, such as drugs trafficking, for example, but also because this activity actually benefits from shortcomings in the legislation and action of Member States and from all the factors that allow illegal immigrants to enter and remain in these countries.
The proposal now before us, which is intended to strengthen the fight against illegal immigrants entering and staying, must pay particular attention to two factors: first of all, the issue of employers' responsibility and the consequences that using an illegal workforce may entail. We must look at the situations in our own Member States with regard to the illegal employment market - and the issue of trafficking in human beings, which must be fought hard, paying particular attention to the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, which is one of the most odious aspects of this type of trafficking.
Tragic events such as the one that took place in Dover last June or those that have come to light following the successful 'Cathedral' police operation are situations that no democratic society can tolerate.
What we must do is target those who assist illegal immigration.
It is crucial that each Member State adopts the necessary measures to ensure that the deliberate facilitation of the unauthorised entry, movement and residence of immigrants is considered to be an offence punishable by effective, proportionate, dissuasive criminal penalties.
The European Union is now facing new challenges caused by migratory flows in evidence throughout the world. We must address these challenges as one wide-ranging issue.
The Member States must have a common immigration and asylum policy that is appropriate to their demographic, economic and humanitarian needs.
Mr President, I want to congratulate my colleague Mr Ceyhun for approaching a very difficult and sensitive issue.
Referring to what Mr Kirkhope said, this is an issue of great importance and I could not agree with him more.
I am sure he would agree with me that it is very sad that on an issue like this, which covers the pages of many of our newspapers, there is - to the best of my knowledge - no press here to cover it.
We have also to recognise that this report is just one piece of a jigsaw.
It is a very difficult jigsaw that we are trying to put together.
We need a proper system of immigration and asylum that will cater for the needs of Europe in the modern world.
I say to Mrs Frahm and Mr Cappato that this is what we are aiming for, and I do not believe the rhetoric you used just now is helpful in such a very difficult situation.
On specific points, Mr Kirkhope referred to his anxieties about paragraphs 11 and 12, and I know the points that he is making there.
But the reference is to legally recognised organisations, NGOs, with which all of us are familiar.
We have to ask ourselves is someone or an organisation that is helping people in desperate circumstances escape persecution a criminal?
Are they the organisations that we ought to be legislating against?
I would say not.
We know, and others have said, that people escaping from these situations are desperate people escaping conflict, war and circumstances like that.
That is why we need these measures.
We must do more.
We must do more to help those developing countries and help the countries that are war-torn and with regimes that we do not like.
But we cannot do that overnight.
I do not believe we are helping those people who are trying to get out by doing nothing and leaving the situation as it is, so they have to clamber into the back of lorries and suffocate and endure torture and misery.
We have to make certain that we have a proper asylum system that is not skewed by the overemphasis on illegal immigration.
Our job in the new few months, as a Parliament, will be to report on the Commission's opinions in a way that reminds all Member States that their national interest must not override our global and humanitarian obligations.
. (DE) Mr President, today, in Germany, a man is appearing before the court who immigrated illegally from the former East Germany to West Germany.
He has quite rightly been brought before the court, not because he immigrated illegally but because he grassed on illegal immigrants from the former East Germany to the state security police.
In my opinion, it should still be possible for people who betray refugees or illegal immigrants to the police to be prosecuted.
Why?
Both the Commission proposal and the report admit that illegal entry can lead to an application for asylum being approved.
Yet this is tantamount to admitting, albeit unintentionally, that, for most people, it is no longer possible to enter the EU legally. This confirms, also unintentionally, the criticism made by the UNHCR of the EU and its isolationist policy towards refugees.
That is why the promised immunity from prosecution does not help refugees who are accepted as asylum seekers, because they must then betray the people who were actually able to help them in their application for asylum.
The conclusion is that separating commercial from humanitarian facilitation serves no useful purpose because the policy of isolation is increasingly being promoted and aid for refugees is becoming more of a financial burden.
If a decision cannot be reached to dismantle the fortress that is the EU, then at least this report must be rejected and aid for refugees must be promoted both in terms of commercial and humanitarian facilitation.
Mr President, Commissioner, zero immigration policies may well have reduced legal immigration into Europe to zero, but at the same time they have caused the number of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants to rocket together, of course, with the fees charged by all types of carrier.
It is becoming increasingly clear that turning Europe into a fortress, by reinforcing its borders and intensifying repressive measures, will not reduce migratory pressures as long as the prosperity differential between the European Union and its neighbours persists or increases.
As far as traffickers are concerned, as I maintained in my report on Albania, concentrating mainly on traffickers, as if they were the root cause of immigration, does not help us to understand or manage this phenomenon.
The fact, as other members have said, that carriers often save human lives, by helping people to escape from persecution by totalitarian regimes, and provide services to refugees protected by the Geneva Convention and desperate people who have nowhere else to turn, is often passed over in silence.
We must, I think, distinguish between disinterested, humanitarian aiding of illegal immigrants and the aiding of illegal immigrants by members of criminal networks for the purpose of gain, as proposed by our rapporteur, Mr Ozan Ceyhun, whom I congratulate on the many improvements which he has made to the French initiative.
Finally, I should like to say that any initiatives along these lines must be incorporated as quickly as possible into an integrated European immigration policy, which will have legal channels and, more importantly, which will guarantee the legalisation and social integration of those already living in the European Union.
But, Commissioner, this sort of policy does not seem to be making any headway; on the contrary, the Council appears to be desperate to take what are, for the most part, repressive and fragmentary measures, rather than to introduce an integrated immigration policy as called for by the European Parliament.
Mr President, one of the objectives highlighted by the recent Tampere, Feira and Nice Summits, by resolutions of this Parliament and by the Euro-Mediterranean Forum, which we held in Brussels only last week, is the combating of the organised networks that traffic in immigrants.
This is a despicable traffic, which causes so much harm and even tragedy amongst the immigrants themselves and great concern within the European Union, a concern sometimes greater than that seen in some of these immigrants' countries of origin, although it is a hard thing to say.
We must therefore receive the two French initiatives with satisfaction.
But the report by Mr Ceyhun suffers from a lack of legal rigour, which if not corrected will make it impossible to vote in favour - and believe me I am sorry - particularly on the point I am about to mention.
I am personally acquainted with the magnificent work that some NGOs are doing in this field; the humanitarian care many of them are giving surpasses their own means.
But from that to generalising that if an association performs the criminal action of providing organised aid for the entry, residence or movement of illegal immigrants it should be exempt from liability, is going too far. This is because profit or financial benefit, as for example happens in Spanish criminal law, is an aggravating circumstance but it is not the essential component in characterising the crime of trafficking in human beings.
This does not mean that there are not aspects of the report that can be accepted and which I applaud, such as the compensation for the regions that most suffer from migratory pressure or prosecution of employers who use and abuse these workers illegally.
Finally, in any case, I believe that in this battle against illegal immigration the cooperation of the countries of origin is absolutely necessary, since without it any attempt to combat these criminal networks is doomed to failure.
The European Union alone cannot control this migration phenomenon if it cannot count on the essential collaboration of the countries from which the migration originates.
Mr President, last week in Stockholm the Council asked for the Tampere agenda to be revitalised.
I really do not understand at all.
I do not understand why they have not been able to revitalise and fulfil it over all these months.
What I see is that with initiatives like this one they will not only revitalise it, they will bombard it.
At this time of night, and coming from a Spanish and Portuguese evening that Ms Cerdeira and I attended, I am tempted to surrender to Mr Cappato' s rhetorical charms and agree with him completely, because in fact the only thing I can understand is that the ministers meet on one side and on the other there is some machinery which points towards other objectives.
I do not understand why the Council does not go after some coherent political proposals, which follow one behind the other in pursuit of the clear objectives of creating a common, coherent and global immigration policy and asylum policy in the European Union, instead of advancing piecemeal on absolutely specific and partial topics which throw this policy off balance and make it increasingly difficult to make progress on the Tampere agenda.
Seeing that in the Council the ministers have also decided - paradoxically in my view - to support this French proposal, and it should be either discussed immediately or moved on, my Group will in any case try to send them the clear message that we in the European Union must not confuse compassion, the work of some people in the front line helping immigrants, with the traffic in people.
We shall try to do so by supporting the amendments that Mr Ceyhun has drawn up so well and also the amendments that Ms Cerdeira has added to the report.
If we succeed, we shall vote in favour of this report and we shall try to send this message to the Council.
If not, we shall see tomorrow what we can do with it: we shall probably have some difficulties.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Ceyhun, the rapporteur, and remind you, as he did, that the trafficking of human beings, particularly the trafficking of women and children, is, in itself, an odious phenomenon which is a growing source of concern, because it is not just a question of immigration policy or of security policy.
This is basically an issue that concerns the violation of human rights and human dignity.
Throughout the world, tens of thousands of human beings are trafficked for the purpose of exploitation every year.
The importance of this issue does not mean - and I think that this criticism is unfair - that we are addressing it because we are obsessed with building a Fortress Europe.
This issue, which is complex and requires us to be very precise in the terms we use to discuss it, is today at the very top of the international agenda and, I think, received a broad, worldwide consensus when the United Nations Organisation promoted the adoption of a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime last December. This convention contains two additional protocols, one on the illegal transporting of immigrants into a country - smuggling, to use the English term - and another specifically covering the trafficking of people.
These two protocols were signed by 81 States at the High Level Conference in Palermo last December.
Amongst the signatories to the United Nations Convention are all the Member States of the European Union and the Commission.
I personally took the opportunity to call upon both the Member States of the Union and the candidate countries to proceed as quickly as possible with the ratification of this Convention, which will only enter into force when 40 countries have concluded their accession process.
The European Union is, therefore, able to demonstrate its contribution to a worldwide fight against the trafficking of human beings.
Various speakers reminded us just now that, following the Dover tragedy last June, the Feira European Council called for measures to be adopted to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings.
This initiative by the French Government therefore addresses this concern and the Commission has no difficulties in acknowledging that, in principle, it should be supported.
We must, however, clarify the terms of the debate properly.
Today, I have, or rather the Commission has, been accused of paying little attention to the issues of illegal immigration and, furthermore, of not paying sufficient attention to drafting a comprehensible immigration policy.
I hope you will not be offended if I do not go into great detail, at 11.15 at night, in order to refute all the accusations and if I simply tell you sincerely that I do not consider these criticisms to be at all justified where the Commission is concerned.
For example, our immigration policy does contain a security component. This component cannot be the main one, or exclusive, but we cannot ignore the fact that the trafficking of human beings is a serious problem, that also requires security measures.
I am therefore surprised - I shall not say shocked, which is a very strong word - that Mr Berthu has only found one paragraph on illegal immigration in a Commission communication which seeks to address the issue of legal immigration and that he has not, for example, discovered that the Commission has presented two proposals for framework decisions.
One of these proposals is intended to eliminate the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of exploitation, specifically to ban child pornography on the Internet. I am also surprised that Mr Berthu has not noticed that the Commission has presented a proposal for a framework decision to eliminate the trafficking of human beings for the purpose of economic exploitation, in other words, for the purpose of promoting illegal work.
Similarly, just as we agreed to discuss the French initiative, in which security features very prominently, the Commission has already initiated a discussion in the Council on a proposal for a communication on a European asylum system and a communication on legal immigration, in other words, on the rights and duties of third-country nationals who are allowed to enter the Union legally.
We have tried to define a balanced policy but the contradictory criticisms that have been made in this House show that we may well not have achieved this yet. These criticisms have not convinced me, however, that the Commission is not on the right track.
We have two fundamental concerns about the French proposal, which make it difficult for us to accept the proposed text.
Our first concern is about the legal basis, which is not a minor issue.
We feel that the French initiative must be completely underpinned, notwithstanding its reference to aggravating circumstances, by a legal basis under the first pillar, such as the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 63(3)(b).
It can clearly be inferred from this article of the Treaty that competence for illegal immigration has been given to the Community.
It is also clear that the Community per se does not have Community competence in criminal issues.
Nevertheless, I wish to remind Parliament that there is case-law from the Court of Justice of the European Communities which indicates that, in cases in which the Community, within a clearly defined jurisdiction, has power conferred upon it by the Treaties to regulate activity in order to achieve a Community objective, it also has the power to decide whether the fact that this activity does not comply should be punished at national level by criminal sanctions.
This, as I see it, is especially true in this case.
Our second concern involves the scope of Article 1(a) of the draft directive.
In its current wording and as matters stand today, this measure in the French proposal contains no reference to the objective of financial gain.
The Commission is willing to study this approach, in other words, not to lay down the requirement of financial gain, but this would have to be balanced by a carefully worded exemption clause for cases where illegal entry, movement and residence are subject to assistance for humanitarian reasons.
This is the only way it will be possible to distinguish clearly between humanitarian assistance under international commitments, specifically respect for the Geneva Convention, and the trafficking of human beings which is punishable by law.
I wish to conclude, Mr President, by saying that the Commission feels that other elements must be included in the French proposal, such as, for example, establishing an obligation for administrative coordination and cooperation between the competent national departments, creating a system for the exchange of information between Member States and imposing the obligation on Member States to adopt the appropriate measures to provide humanitarian assistance to illegal immigrants.
I wish to make one final comment, which is that, in line with the Tampere conclusions and the Commission 'scoreboard' , we have presented a proposal for a framework decision on combating the trafficking of human beings. We would therefore like the joint work of the Council, Parliament and the Commission to show clearly that there is no overlap between the French initiative and the two framework decisions presented by the Commission, but rather complementarity.
These framework decisions are part of the broader issue of the fight against illegal immigration, which involves a proactive policy of legal immigration under the terms proposed by the Commission in its communication issued last November. Of course, this also involves other complementary policies that the Commission intends to propose to the Council in May, specifically on the issue of a policy of return and of the conditions for sending citizens from third countries back to their country of origin.
I hope that the conclusions of the informal Stockholm Council meeting last week will enable us, at the Laeken European Council, to take stock of this debate on a common immigration policy and on a European asylum system which respect our international obligations and which guarantee the stability and security of the Union' s Member States.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.
(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)
Research guidelines 2002 - 2006
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0052/2001) by Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Making a reality of the 'European Research Area' : Guidelines for European Union research activities (2002-2006) [COM(2000) 612 - C5-0738/2000 - 2000(COS)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, never before have I spoken for so long in Parliament.
You may go for a nap in between because eight minutes really is rather long.
Commissioner, it is now almost a year since it was agreed during the European Council in Lisbon that the European Union wants to become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world and this Parliament rallied around that goal with a large majority.
If the European Union wants to achieve this goal, then more investment in research, technological development, innovation and education is essential, both in the Member States as well as at European level.
The creation of a European Research Area is vital to this.
European research has proved a success: and the innovative efforts of Europe's businesses are also impressive, accounting in the first half of the 1990s for 33% of turnover.
The European Framework Programmes of research and technological development have definitely contributed to this as well.
The success of the Framework Programmes must therefore be retained in the future and that will also have to be demonstrated when the proposals for the sixth Framework Programme are discussed.
But at the moment, ladies and gentlemen, there is absolutely no question of having one European research policy.
The proposals made by Commissioner Busquin in order to actually bring such a policy about were well received by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but on a number of points we still have a few gaps to fill and some concerns to raise.
One way of creating an effective research area would be to ensure more cooperation on the basis of more Community objectives and flexible use of resources.
Let us do away with techno-nationalism.
The research policies of the Member States and that of the Union are currently pursued alongside each other without forming a coherent whole.
In addition, we invest significantly less in research than the United States and Japan.
These two factors mean that the ground lost to the United States has simply increased in the last few years.
In my first report on the European Research Area, I also went on about techno-nationalism, which has to vanish.
Greater cooperation is needed between the Member States, researchers and research groups, but also between companies, universities and public research institutes.
More coordination at a programme level is also necessary.
There is a need for new forms of European cooperation, namely intermediary cooperation, or in other words between national research institutes as well as between the establishments which subsidise research in the Member States.
But, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in Europe will stand or fall with a state-of-the-art infrastructure.
It is vital to extend a high-speed trans-European research network with a capacity of ten gigabits to a hundred gigabits in the future, in order to achieve a European Research Area and enable it to perform optimally.
Only then will we also achieve cooperation such as that between centres of excellence.
This goal will never be reached with the SEAN project, which is based on an increase of two gigabits per second per year.
I therefore call upon Commissioners Liikanen and Busquin to show much more ambition in this matter.
As well as the creation of a European Research Area, we also have need of a European Educational Area, since a dynamic knowledge-based economy, which was talked about so much in Lisbon, requires not only high quality education at the same level in all Member States, but also mobility amongst researchers and students.
Greater harmony between higher education and researcher training is necessary as well.
I would like to hear the Commissioner's point of view on this matter.
The agreements reached in Nice concerning flexibility, variable geometry, or cooperation between a limited number of Member States in the field of research, create an obstacle for the Industry Committee.
This forms a central part of Commissioner Busquin's plans.
The Industry Committee expresses the strongest possible reservations concerning this cooperation between Member States, particularly if it involves spending European research funds.
As it so happens, the Research Committee, this Parliament in other words, has the power of codecision where research at European level is concerned.
If this brings about cooperation between the Member States, whereby the Member States finance this themselves, then there is no problem at all.
But as soon as European funding is put into research from which only a couple of Member States profit as a result, then the codecision procedure will indeed have to be retained. That is laid down in the Treaty.
That is why I would like to see the details of these plans take on a clearer shape, although we are definitely not opposed to more cooperation - because for all that, I have also said: let us do away with techno-nationalism - but as soon as European funding is in the picture, Parliament's power of codecision remains.
Another point is the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in the field of research.
In the fifth Framework Programme we argued in favour of spending at least 10% on small and medium-sized enterprises within the thematic programmes.
That was successful too.
It appears that even more funding is going to small and medium-sized enterprises from the Fifth Framework Programme.
In my report for the Industry Committee, we established once again that at least 10% must be spent on SMEs.
Nevertheless I believe that having regard to current spending we can well afford to be a bit more ambitious, so I put it to you that in the coming Framework Programme the amount should be increased to 15% and, of course, I welcome your views on this as well.
One last point, Mr President, relates to an issue about which there is considerable doubt in Parliament and that is nuclear fusion research.
Essentially, Parliament has very little to report on this, except that we do have to make the budget available.
