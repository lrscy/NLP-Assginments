Â Â  MrÂ President, in the context of the problems related to the immigration process raised in todayâs question, attention has been drawn, amongst other issues, to the lack of mutual trust between Member States of the European Union.
This mistrust and suspicion almost automatically affects relationships with third countries, such as the United States, which is Europeâs natural ally in the war on terrorism.
Such an attitude hampers the establishment of clear legal provisions in these areas.
It effectively limits, or even prevents, useful cooperation.
It is hard to agree with the view expressed today by CommissionerÂ Frattini, namely that the protection of fundamental rights and fighting terrorism ought to go hand in hand.
I believe that for the benefit of most European citizens, serious thought should be given to redefining fundamental rights with a view to restricting them.
This would allow us to counter terrorist actions swiftly and efficiently.
Clearly, we must move in that direction in the interests of security.
Â Â  MrÂ President, last Sunday the small country of Switzerland voted in favour of a type of immigration policy that is best suited to the needs of the country in question and its citizens.
As CommissionerÂ Frattini stated, it could also be worth emulating the immigration policies adopted by Australia and United States.
The European Union, however, has been following an over-ambitious immigration policy for years, to the detriment of the interests of its own citizens.
Our security, justice and immigration policies ought to strengthen development aid for Africa.
It should put an end to the influx of Muslims and, if demographic factors or the situation on the labour market require it, welcome Christians from Eastern European countries like Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Russia, who would not jeopardise the identity of our Christian civilisation.
Â Â  â In the long run, we cannot cope without a common immigration policy and common strategies.
The Member States are mainly responsible for integration.
The exclusion that we have at present, along with benefits instead of work, must be brought to an end, and integration policy activated.
Work must become the rule and benefits the exception.
In Sweden, the new government is aiming to make the unemployed more attractive to employers.
Integration policy must also be combined with measures to combat people-trafficking and with the development, in partnership, of agreements with third countries.
I want to praise MrÂ Frattini for his endeavours in this area.
We must also join together in defending the humane values on which the EU is based.
An area of freedom, justice and security requires increased legal certainty and a strengthening of individual fundamental rights that the European Court of Justice can and must apply.
Although we do not have these things in the third pillar, any more than we have data protection, we have seen measures introduced that interfere extensively in private life.
How much longer does the Council believe we can go on without fundamental rights and a court at EU level competent to re-examine cases?
The focus should now be on legal certainty and fundamental rights.
In the long term, this should help us combat crime more effectively.
Legal certainty and the fight against crime go hand in hand.
Â Â  â Some months ago, in this Parliament, Commissioner Frattini said that he cannot go ahead at the pace he would like to.
We understand and we appreciate that there are bureaucratic problems, but these cannot continue being used as excuses and allow an alarming situation to change into an explosive and uncontrollable one.
It is embarrassing that the Union is coming across as extremely passive when faced with a situation which is so sensitive, human and tragic for so many people and countries, including Member States.
Malta, like Italy, Spain and other countries, is faced with a burden no country can shoulder on its own.
This is a crisis which transcends frontiers, and therefore the solution must be European, Mediterranean and African, and, if necessary, must also involve the United Nations.
For a long time we have been hearing words like mobilisation, solidarity and financial help.
Let us take, for example, the promise made to Malta that, during Summer, European patrols would commence in our waters.
Summer has come and gone in the same way the immigrants have come, but the patrols were nowhere to be seen.
So far the result has always been a piecemeal policy comprising unconnected measures, and the occasional announcement that we have found another half million Euro to donate.
This is such a critical situation that it warrants the formulation of a European emergency plan, and in this context I believe that the European Parliament should have greater competence and a more pronounced role.
There are many initiatives which can be adopted, one of which is the establishment of an observatory based in a Mediterranean country like Malta so that coordination work about illegal immigration in the region can take place.
The Council and the Commission have to send out a clear and concrete signal that they really consider this problem as a priority, and that they are ready to move and to act in order to implement a comprehensive policy which addresses not only the immediate needs of the Member States affected, but also those of the immigrants.
Very often they are the victims of political repression, of organised crime or of economic poverty.
This plan must involve the countries from which these immigrants depart, and must address the problems, especially economic problems of the immigrantsâ countries of origin.
The more serious the situation becomes, the greater the citizensâ loss of faith in European institutions.
Â Â  Mr President, we urgently need the bridging clause for more efficient and democratic decision-making.
The EU must speak with one voice and not allow the United States to determine unilaterally the conditions of our joint counter-terrorism efforts.
This applies, for example, to the negotiations on the post-2007 PNR agreement, but also to CIA activities.
Last week the Member States issued a very feeble condemnation of secret CIA detention camps, but I would like to know whether the Europeans will continue to use the information obtained in these secret and illegal prisons.
On fundamental rights, which are conspicuously absent from this debate, in 2004 the Commission obtained the approval of the European Parliament on condition that the Commission become the champion of fundamental rights; but so far the Commission has been fairly timid.
For example, you condemn homophobia with words, but will you also take action, Commissioner Frattini, for example on the basis of Article 7 against homophobic actions and statements by EU governments and ministers?
Will you finally end the unacceptable discrimination against married gay couples?
Commissioner and Council, will you be tough on terrorism, but also tough on intolerance in Europe?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, more than 20Â 000 illegal immigrants have, at peril to their lives, run their boats onto the beaches of the Canary Islands, Lampedusa and Malta since the beginning of the year.
We do not know how many others have actually drowned.
As for what MrÂ LeÂ Pen said a few moments ago about these men and women, it was pretty disgusting.
Our sole aim where these immigrants are concerned is to provide for the vital needs of their families.
The men concerned, who are often responsible for families, are prepared to do anything to enable their children to eat, and nothing will stop them.
Rather than stigmatise these people, we need to put an end to these human tragedies.
Let us, then, turn our words into actions and put a genuine immigration policy in place quickly.
During the visits made by colleagues and myself to the detention centres on Europeâs southern borders, we sounded a warning note.
This summer, a delegation from the Frontex agency was sent out to patrol the Spanish and African coastlines.
That was a positive first step.
Unfortunately, there is still a glaring lack of resources.
Here are a few examples of what might be done, referred to in my groupâs resolution.
Firstly, increase security at our external borders.
Let us remember that, in our Schengen area, it is crucial to share responsibilities and the financial burden.
Let us therefore consider creating effective joint patrols for the maritime borders, a European border police force or a network of immigration liaison officers.
Secondly, let there be a more effective crackdown on traffickers in human beings and on undeclared work in all the Member States.
Thirdly, there should be real partnerships and readmission agreements with countries of origin.
To start with, we want the European return directive to be adopted as soon as possible.
With regard to co-development, let us put more effective monitoring systems in place.
Co-development money must reach the people directly, without being misappropriated.
Development aid must be provided only in proportion to the efforts made by countries of origin to prevent their populations from emigrating illegally.
Finally, have those Member States that have regularised the status of huge numbers of their illegal immigrants in recent years got on top of illegal immigration in their countries?
The answer is, unfortunately, no.
Mass regularisation is not, as some people think, the right solution.
To conclude, I would quite candidly ask you how long it is going to take and how many meetings are going to be necessary before the 25 âŠ
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we had no need for a secret services committee in the United States to tell us that the War in Iraq would increase rather than reduce the risk of terrorism in Europe and the rest of the world.
Nor should anyone declare in the future that they are surprised if it emerges that secret prisons, flexible interpretations of the Geneva Convention, the tapping of thousands of telephones, distrust of every European traveller and the approach to the millions of immigrants living among us with repression rather than integration measures are not only giving terrorists recruiting arguments, but are also, primarily, measures that undermine the sense of security and democracy at the very heart of Europe.
The European Parliament is neither naÃ¯ve nor romantic on questions of anti-terrorism.
It has repeatedly demanded harsh measures to combat all these murderers.
However, at the same time, it insists on the application of European law and on the protection of fundamental rights.
However, Parliament's balanced and strong stand does not appear to bother certain ministers in the ÎU.
Last week in Tampere, certain ministers of justice insisted on keeping Parliament in the role of ventriloquist's dummy on these issues.
Unfortunately, they included the Greek Minister of Justice, who should be more careful following yesterday's disclosure that the Greek Government had secretly agreed with the USA in 2004 to facilitate the transmission of thousands of data items â not on Greek but on European citizens â during and after the Olympic Games in Athens.
In our countries, noÂ one understands the national parliaments not having a decisive say and control in policing and justice matters.
In Europe, however, it would appear that some people wish to draw a line and say that democracy does not count here.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, a minute is a very short time, so I shall confine myself to making a single point.
We are dealing with policies in which it seems clear what Europe can and should do: it needs to develop a common asylum system, common rules on legal immigration, and common management of our external borders.
It is clear that national efforts are no longer enough, because they simply do not work.
It is clear that public opinion would support this alternative idea of effective European sovereignty, although I admit that there have been too many speeches by Italian or Mediterranean Members this morning, as if immigration were purely our problem, that is, one affecting just the Mediterranean countries.
What is not clear, however, is the title of the press release issued at the end of the Tampere Summit: âMinisters call for greater solidarity and cooperation.â
I am sorry, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, but from whom else can they demand that but themselves?
As we do not yet have a European Constitution â I wish we did â does anyone in the Council have a different idea other than quickly implementing the bridging clause?
Besides, who benefits from this institutional standstill?
Today, at least, I think a large majority in Parliament has made its opinion quite clear on that point.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many new threats to our security and freedom, and uncontrolled immigration is certainly one of them.
The greatest and most recent threat, however, comes from terrorism, as MrÂ Frattini pointed out earlier.
As the coordinator for my group in the temporary committee on the CIA, I have addressed the problem with my colleagues and we have all looked for solutions together.
I personally have come to the conclusion that we can do very little â and, unfortunately, we have done very little â to discover anything new about the situation, about its causes and about who is to blame.
We now need to concentrate on the future and on ways and means to prevent the recurrence of situations of illegality that further endanger our freedom and security.
What can we do?
One idea can be found in the question to the Council that led to this morningâs debate, where it mentions initiatives to remedy the lack of trust between Member States.
That is an important, indeed crucial point.
To combat terrorism within the Union we need to exchange more information, including with our main allies and in particular the United States, with which we have recently had some difficulties.
We must exchange information on an equal footing and on the basis of mutual trust.
Greater control is also needed over the activities of one countryâs secret services when they are operating on anotherâs territory.
Secret services have to remain secret in order to operate effectively, but only within certain limits.
Our committee on the CIA has no powers of investigation and so we have to insist that the national parliaments, which in many countries have the appropriate powers, investigate any infringements of human rights and any threats to our security and freedom.
It will then be our job to coordinate the research in order to achieve compatible solutions at a European level.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even if some people choose to ignore the fact, Europe is a continent that attracts immigrants.
Many people in this continent of ours could accept that and live with it if they felt that this immigration was to some extent under control and kept within reasonable bounds.
What they cannot accept â and this is of course exploited by the extreme Right in particular â is the feeling that they are facing some sort of onslaught that they are powerless to control.
It is, then, absolutely right that the Council and Commissioner Frattini in particular should openly call for action to be taken to give the public the sense that there is such a thing as a single European migration policy with certain cornerstones that ensure that everything is kept under control.
Solidarity within Europe is, of course, a part of this.
It may be that certain countries â Germany and Austria, for example â are somewhat bitter about the times when they were on the receiving end of a great deal of migration, particularly from South-Eastern Europe, but of little solidarity, but that is no reason to deny that solidarity to others now.
Far from it; where this is concerned, we have to make common cause.
Immigration policy, though, must go hand in hand with a policy for integration.
I am very glad that Commissioner Frattini addressed the subject of unauthorised workers, for it is sometimes the case that those elements in politics that get terribly worked up about immigration tolerate, at the same time, the presence in Europe of vast masses of illegal workers, constituting a sort of illicit reserve of labour and also bringing downward pressure to bear on wages.
That is not on!
It is quite right to demand that the individual governments take firm action to deal with this.
Â Â  MrÂ President, fellow Members, I was in Spain at the end of August, and I have to say that I was deeply shocked by the terrible pictures I saw of these poor wretches landing on the coasts of the Canary Islands.
I must also say, however, that I was ashamed, not at what the Spaniards were doing â they were doing their best â but at the lack of solidarity on the part of the European countries that had promised to help Spain but did not do so.
I was also ashamed â and, Commissioner, I hope that you looked at the Spanish press â at the limited resources available to Frontex.
It was a case of too little, too late.
MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, it is usual in European circles to use flowery language to say that we are together constructing a common area of freedom within common borders.
Remind your colleagues, however, that a common border has to be managed and protected jointly.
It is scandalous that a number of Member States haggle over their solidarity and shameful that one Member State should have to beg for help from the others in order to perform a task that is in everyoneâs interests.
Â Â  Mr President, the Spanish Government's mistaken policy is flooding the Union with people without documents.
Spain is now a country of destination and a country of transit.
There must be no more mass regularisations.
We must be able to say how many people, and who, can live in dignity amongst us.
What can we do?
There are national solutions and there are Community solutions.
At Community level, we must move towards the objective of a common immigration policy.
To this end, it is crucial to take advantage of the opportunities provided for in the EC Treaty and, specifically, in paragraphÂ 2 of ArticleÂ 67, and apply the codecision procedure to illegal immigration.
We shall have to implement policies such as the following: greater cooperation amongst the Member States, equal rights and obligations for all immigrants, partnership and cooperation agreements with conditions, bilateral agreements between the Union and countries of origin, including obligatory repatriation clauses.
No, I repeat, no, to national mass regularisation processes, yes to constant improvements in resources and strengthening of the capacities of FRONTEX, to the coordination of controls at maritime borders, to the creation of joint border control patrols and teams, to protecting the Union's external borders and to external European Union action.
Solana and Ferrero to Africa and the Mediterranean!
All of this must be accompanied by the humanitarian treatment that illegal immigration demands and that we support unreservedly.
Assistance, humanitarian care and return.
Nobody should remain in European territory outside of the law.
I would like to make one protest in order not to break with my tradition.
This is a good debate, but it is a that takes us nowhere.
Hence my protest.
We are talking here about immigration, about terrorism, about passerelle clauses and about organised crime.
We must learn a lesson from this and hold debates on single subjects.
Â Â  Thank you, your comments are noted.
It is, however, a debate on the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice.
It is an annual debate, so naturally it has to be rather wide-ranging.
Â Â  Mr President, Parliament has to give its opinion by the end of the year on the framework programme known as solidarity and management of migration flows.
I should have liked to have seen more resources given to this major instrument, but we are suffering the constraints of a draconian Financial Perspective.
I hope, in any case, that the Commission will not accept any watering down of its latest proposal.
Our objective must be to guarantee that the distribution between the four funds â those in relation to refugees, external borders, integration and return â reflects a balanced, rather than essentially repressive, approach to the issue of immigration.
That is why we must defend the integration fund as, if the Council states that integration can be financed from the European Social Fund (ESF), the integration fund will be the only real instrument financing measures intended for new arrivals.
If, finally, we have a duty of solidarity towards Member States that are particularly vulnerable in this respect, let us remember that what we are concerned with here are structural funds which, as such, are not intended to be used as emergency funds, all the more since the distribution keys in each fund allow a variety of situations to be taken into account.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Unionâs credibility in the eyes of millions of citizens is at stake.
If the European Union cannot protect its own borders in a joint fashion, then what is the Union for?
Europe has a shared external border, and it is everybodyâs responsibility.
African immigrants do not enter via the North Pole, Minister, nor via the shores of the Baltic, but they are entering Europe, and Europe belongs to all of us.
Everybody has their own particular geography, though, and they have been given it by God, as some people might say.
It is not charity that certain Member States are asking for but, rather, consistency with the European project that we all talk about so much and which is so easy to preach when we are talking about the single market in financial services or the common market in goods.
When it comes to borders, however, it appears that each Member State has their own, and they do not feel the need to share responsibility for other borders.
We are not talking about charity, but about coherence, about responsibility for the European project.
The European Unionâs credibility is at stake.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki stated that a revised timetable for the accession of the new Member States to the SIS II system will be made known by the end of the year.
It follows that a revised timetable for the elimination of internal borders will also be set.
It is not known when this will come about, but the postponement is not due to delays on the part of the new Member States.
Poland will be ready to start implementing the SIS II system by MarchÂ 2007. The same is true of the other new Member States.
Commissioner, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, how does this situation impact on the Commissionâs credibility with regard to granting citizens such a fundamental right as full freedom of movement across the territory of the European Union?
The Commission is forever ramming slogans about a Europe of the citizens and a Europe of results down peopleâs throats.
How dare it, therefore, for allegedly technical reasons, hold up the process of the full enlargement of the Schengen area, and postpone it until after next year, as had been agreed at the European Council?
Perhaps experts from the new Member States should be asked to ensure that the central unit is completed on time?
The best IT staff and programmers must be recruited to ensure that this is done.
If it is not, the Commission and you personally, Commissioner, will be called to account for such lack of professionalism.
I am not referring to the financial, technical, political and social consequences of this decision.
The European Parliament is monitoring the Commissionâs progress in this area, together with any costs arising from the delay, and it will continue to do so.
I therefore urge all concerned to consider the costs and benefits involved before taking the final decision on this matter.
I congratulate the Council on reaching a compromise on the SISÂ II legislative package.
Nonetheless, we still need the Council to demonstrate strong leadership and reveal the so-called technical problems for what they really are, namely a smokescreen for the lack of political will on the part of certain Member States.
After all, it is the SISÂ II system which creates certain technical opportunities and is thus one of the conditions ensuring that the common immigration policy becomes a shared responsibility for all Member States, not just for those most affected by illegal immigration and terrorism.
If this does not happen, we shall never be able to deal effectively with terrorism and the influx of emigrants.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, migration into Europe, whether by legal or illegal means, is a Community task In an age of open borders, problems with immigration can no longer be dealt with by nation-states acting on their own; there is a shared responsibility that no Member State â not even Germany â can wriggle out of.
Looking forward to the German Council Presidency, one thing is clear, namely that we cannot act as if legal and illegal immigration were absolutely unconnected, for the opposite is the case; each is conditional upon the other.
The fact is that migration is a complex phenomenon and is as old as the human race itself; deportations and border guards will be ineffective in dealing with it.
That is why the Council of the European Union must at length face up to this problem, not only in Europeâs interests, but also and above all in the interests of the desperate people who go in search of what they are told will be a better future only, alas, often to lose their lives in the attempt.
The utterances that MrÂ Beckstein of the Bavarian CSU came out with in Tampere are shameful to say the least, and reveal once more what this man and substantial elements in his party actually believe.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, very little progress has yet been made in the area of security and freedom, and certainly not enough for such a crucial issue.
For years, the Council has decided to base its actions in the area of freedom on mutual recognition, as if the courts, police and secret services in the individual countries of Europe could necessarily cooperate on the basis of mutual recognition.
Events have shown that this principle alone is not enough: we also need the courage to harmonise certain policies and thus turn them into European policies, particularly on matters of freedom.
We remain firm on some points: the antidiscrimination directive, the racism observatory, the framework decision on procedural rights, and safeguards of privacy in the transfer of air passenger data.
It is on the subject of freedom that we lack common safeguards at a European level; in this area, cooperation among the Member States is not enough.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the problem of how to contend against illegal immigration is the greatest challenge of modern time, although I have to make it clear that 99% of immigrants are not refugees, but rather economic migrants, and it is ultimately for the European Union and every one of its Member States to decide which migrants, and how many of them, are to be accepted; this is a quite separate matter from asylum, the necessary solutions to which are possible only on a Community basis.
I am glad to see that, after many debates, the way is being paved for real action on this front, and Commissioner Frattini deserves praise for Frontex and other measures, but what we should be doing is investing more in prevention.
The first steps are indeed being taken to this end, but I suggest that we should give thought to stepping up development aid, to targeting and monitoring it, to the possibility of information campaigns in the mass media, which should be a collaborative effort with the countries of origin, in which people would be informed about the risks and consequences involved in illegal immigration by being shown how things really are for stranded âboat peopleâ and for those who migrate illegally in search of work, and they would also have to be told about the possibility of migrating legally.
That really would help to alleviate a lot of need and misery.
Thirdly, we must do more to address the problem of people working illegally within the European Union and take firm action.
I expect the Council to ensure that there will be no more mass legalisations, which do more than anything else to draw more migrants to the EU.
Finally, I would like once more to appeal to the Member States to abandon for good their national animosities where asylum, migration for work purposes and internal security are concerned, or at any rate to curb them and move towards Community-based solutions, for what new challenges demand is new European responses.
Â Â  EU citizens attach high priority to the debate we are now having.
As quite a few speakers have said in this House, we should have solved these acute problems a long time ago.
That applies to the migratory flows to the Canary Islands and Malta, information updates for everyone waiting for permission to stay in the EU and better support for those fighting to be accepted as new EU citizens.
We should have made more progress in influencing attitudes in our societies and combating segregation in working life, housing and education.
In Sweden, we had elections two weeks ago, in which a xenophobic party won seats on councils in every third local authority.
I am perturbed by their message that too many immigrants have been allowed in.
They talk about that, but not about the responsibility we all share and the solidarity we all need to show.
The EUâs population is ageing quickly, and there will need to be more of us.
We must have a successful debate on this.
We in Parliament must obtain increased powers, greater responsibility and access to more rapid decision-making.
It is only by means of a common EU policy in this area that we can achieve results for EU citizens.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, yet again this summer we have witnessed landings and shipwrecks every day that have led to hundreds of deaths in European waters.
The steady flow of boats trying to reach the Unionâs shores shows no signs of abating; indeed, it is increasing.
The situation has now clearly developed into a real emergency, which has to be addressed seriously.
Even today, three or four Member States find that they have to deal with these landings by themselves.
Something that we have heard and said all too often in this Chamber is that Malta, Italy and Spain are making an effort for the sake of the whole Union but are left to suffer alone.
The European Union as a whole, with its 25 â soon to be 27 â countries, must once and for all tackle this extremely serious situation jointly.
National self-interest has to be abandoned.
It is time to start regarding the immigration emergency as a problem affecting all 25 Member States and not just those whose geographical position means that they have to recover bodies from the sea every day.
Through the good offices of MrÂ Frattini, who thoroughly deserves our plaudits â and not just because he is a friend â the Commission is preparing specific action plans and is trying to implement existing programmes.
It is the Council, however, that has to decide to address a situation that has been a human tragedy for some time.
Instead, Minister, the Council is still taking Europe for a ride.
The Council needs to take responsibility for sending out a strong, effective signal to make this a Community issue.
To that end, Minister, I shall use this opportunity to ask yet again that an extraordinary Internal Affairs Council be called, to be held on the island of Malta, which is one of the countries worst affected and facing the greatest difficulties because of its size.
I also call yet again for a debate on the Dublin II agreement.
No more idle talk, Minister!
Through the Council, the European Union needs to prove that it really exists!
Â Â  Mr President, Lampedusa is not just an Italian problem.
Immigration is not currently as great a problem in my country, Poland, as it is in Spain, Italy, Malta, Greece or Cyprus, but any of us could be hit by a wave of illegal immigration.
Immigration is therefore not a local or regional issue.
It affects the whole of Europe and needs to be dealt with at that level.
If the Union is to develop an effective, common immigration policy, this policy must be based on decisions taken by a majority vote.
It is time to do away with unanimity at the Council and to make immigration a first pillar policy.
I shall now move on to the matter of Frontex. Frontex is located in my country, in Warsaw.
Poland has the longest external border in the European Union and yet, ironically enough, its citizens cannot move freely across the territory of the whole Union at the moment, because SISÂ II is not ready.
I wonder, Commissioner, whether by the time we come to celebrate the Unionâs 50th anniversary in MarchÂ 2007, you will be in a position to say when the citizens of the new Member States will be able to enjoy free movement across the whole of the territory of the Union?
Â Â  Mr President, allow me emphasise the issue of police and judicial cooperation and to say that widening and deepening such cooperation between the Member States of the European Union is really crucial.
We cannot talk about effectively combating crime and terrorism on a pan-European scale with the current cooperation levels and mechanisms in the police and judicial sector.
It is about time that we proved that our declarations and assurances for enhancing and developing the cooperation are not meaningless.
That is the major challenge facing the European Council, which will be meeting soon with the aim of reviewing the programme.
If the European Council has the will to remedy the decision-making incompetence of the Europe, in this respect there is only one decision to take: to shift these subjects from the third pillar to the first pillar.
It has the legal power to do that, under Article 42 of the European Treaty and the .
Let that be used at last.
Last week the Finnish Presidency admitted, inter alia, that practical experience has shown that problems with current decision-making at EU level are leading to a decreasing number of police cooperation initiatives.
That was indeed a nice honest admission.
However, the steady degrading of police cooperation is due to the lack of European framework decisions which would develop and establish such cooperation.
Those shortcomings have to be remedied.
The low credibility of the European Union as far as the security of the citizens is concerned reduces its prestige.
We have been waiting a long time for approval of the framework decision for minimum procedural rights in criminal cases and for revision of the European arrest warrant.
What has caused the delay?
Why is the Council inactive and incapable of taking decisions?
We have to leave rhetoric behind and finally embark on action.
Â Â  â Mr President, Europe is a bicycle.
Needless to say, this quote leaves itself wide open to all kinds of feeble comparisons, because with the Schengen information system, an instrument that helps us, among other things, to track illegal immigrants, we are engaged in some kind of political Tour de France, which involves all of us racing like mad in the same direction.
Meanwhile, there are other challenges, such as preventing immigration, and the solitary figure of Commissioner Frattini is attempting to make headway using a tricycle.
The green card is a fine idea but, unfortunately, pie in the sky as things stand.
Perhaps Commissioner Frattini will tell us whether the Council is prepared to give these issues a âmountain bike treatmentâ.
Something else that is left hanging in the air is the presidencyâs remark that majority decision-making works.
It does, but I am all the more surprised, then, that the Council should want to restrict Parliamentâs codecision rights where biometrics is concerned.
Are we not cycling around the Schengen information system fast enough?
Will Commissioner Frattini give us his opinion on whether we are or not?
I look forward to his doing so.
Â Â  â Recently, there have been conflicting reports about what sort of cooperation we have with Libya regarding illegal immigration.
Initially, Commissioner, you said that Libya was interested in participating in the Mediterranean patrols; we then heard Libya deny this.
Later, the Corriere della Sera announced that Italy and Libya had agreed to undertake joint patrols.
Subsequently this news item was denied as well.
Afterwards, Commissioner, you said that the European Union was ready to help and give financial assistance to Libya to encourage it to cooperate.
Can the Commisioner and the Council clarify at what stage contacts with Libya are, and what the present situation is like?
What is certain is that in the struggle against illegal immigration, cooperation with Libya is necessary, in the same way that it is important that we help Libya protect its borders in the south of the country.
After all, we cannot expect Libya to help us protect Mediterranean borders if we ourselves do not help Libya protect its own desert frontiers.
Â Â  Mr President, the need for a great pact amongst Europeans on immigration is clear.
This pact amongst Europeans requires a pact amongst Spaniards.
The government has proposed one repeatedly and the Peopleâs Party has spurned it, preferring to go late to Brussels to propose measures that are already being implemented in our country with the support of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me briefly to sum up the three main points of the Spanish Governmentâs immigration policy.
Firstly, effective management and regulation of legal immigration linked to the reality of the labour market.
Ladies and gentlemen, the âdraw effectâ is caused by the submerged economy; we want workers with rights and obligations, not slaves.
Extraordinary regularisation has been a necessary one-off measure for dealing with the dreadful migratory situation that we inherited from the Aznar government.
Secondly, the full social integration of legal immigrants into Spanish society.
Finally, resolve in the fight against illegal immigration: all immigrants entering Spain illegally are treated properly, but they must return to their countries.
In Spain this year, 54Â 000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, ever since the Tampere Summit in 1999, it has been clear that the Union needs a common approach to the problem of migration, and to economic migration in particular.
As a result of the increasing flood of immigrants and the alarming pictures from the Canary Islands, we have now become more aware than ever of the need for a common European migration policy to deal effectively with this problem.
Immigration should not be perceived simply as a threat, however.
Europe is clearly experiencing a demographic crisis.
Well-managed migration could be the answer to the negative consequences of an ageing population.
I would remind the House that, in view of the current rate of migration, it is anticipated that there will be about 20Â million fewer people employed in the Union in the period 2010-2030.
The leading regions of the world have long been competing with each other to attract suitably qualified immigrants, and the Union must not remain on the sidelines.
The lack of a common migration policy actually increases the likelihood of immigrants circumventing national regulations.
We have seen how individual countries have responded to such practices by undertake mass measures to legalise the status of illegal immigrants, as the Socialist government recently decided to do in Spain.
Moves of this kind are not the solution to the problem.
In fact, they aggravate it because they act as an incentive for middlemen involved in smuggling more groups of immigrants into Europe.
I venture to take this opportunity to disagree with the opinion expressed by MrÂ RajamÃ€ki at the start of this debate concerning the positive impact of development policy on reducing the influx of immigrants, notably those from Africa.
I do not believe it is useful to think along those lines, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki.
I accept the need to strengthen development policy, but am inclined to support Commissioner Frattiniâs approach, namely to deal firmly with illegal immigrants and give priority to common management of economic migration.
I would also like to call for the work on the draft directive on admission to be speeded up, along with the work on the directive regulating procedures for returning immigrants to their countries of origin.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, opening legal entry channels that take account of the market requirements in the individual Member States is, together with clamping down on illegal work, one of the priorities for dealing pragmatically with the complex problem of immigration. This needs to be done through a common European action plan, a joint commitment and a collective effort.
For that not to be just empty rhetoric, however, we have to give up the hypocrisy of grandiose, theoretical statements of principle at Council meetings and stop using the immigration issue for domestic political ends, a practice that is utterly unacceptable and irresponsible.
From this perspective, implementing the clause at last is absolutely crucial.
That is the only way in which we will be able to act effectively in an area where we have been remiss for too long.
I agree with whoever said âwe have to pedalâ, but I would add âotherwise we fall offâ.
In this case, however, we will all fall together, in unison.
If we have not yet realised it, we are all on the same bicycle.
Â Â  â Mr President, we have all realised that there is now an urgent need for us to take a common approach towards terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration.
As far as immigration is concerned, it is necessary to coordinate the structures involved in managing migration flows and simplify decision-making procedures using the qualified majority.
Particular emphasis must also be placed on the need to respect solidarity and the fair distribution of burdens between the Member States, including those not under pressure from immigration.
We also need to highlight the need for cooperation between all of us on the effective control of external borders.
Particular emphasis needs to be placed on better management of sea borders in Europe by creating a Mediterranean coastguard in order to prevent human tragedies and control immigration flows.
Finally, it needs to be understood that the mass unilateral legalisation of illegal immigrants not only is no solution, but also creates greater immigration pressures and unforeseen developments.
Unilateral deeds in a community of open internal borders â in which interdependence and interactions are unavoidable â are a matter which deserves our serious attention.
These are just some measures that we need to decide on jointly and not just decide on, but also apply with religious devotion.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that we are now at a key moment when it comes to the future of European immigration policy, a moment of truth in which every man and woman needs clearly to perceive what is at stake.
What, precisely, is Europeâs response to these challenges?
At present, it is âit has to be said â a mixture of compassion and repression that offers no real solution to the recognised need for protection.
Let us be aware in this House of the dangers of disposable immigration in which the migrant is seen only in a utilitarian perspective.
Hypocrisy has prevailed since the first Tampere European Council, which was ultimately supposed to make it possible for asylum and immigration policies to be communitised.
We are now seeing our responsibilities assumed instead by our southern Mediterranean neighbours, who have a lot of difficulty in taking on this very heavy burden.
How, then, is it possible to believe that we shall be able to stem these migratory flows at a time when, in addition, the future arrival of refugees from climate change is already being foreseen?
We need finally to leave behind short-term politics and to support policies that require action to be taken.
Â Â  Mr President, we see more and more every day how a common European immigration policy has become essential.
For those who were in any doubt about the matter, certain European countriesâ mass regularisation of foreigners without papers has demonstrably led to huge numbers of new illegal migrants arriving on our continent.
This situation has repercussions for all the countries of the European Union since, as everyone knows, a migrant whose papers have been put in order may move freely within a large part of the EUâs territory.
The example of Spain has shown that, in the area without borders in which we live, a government can no longer decide alone, and without consulting its partners, to regularise the status of all illegal immigrants on its territory.
A common and agreed policy has become essential, as foreseen moreover by the draft European Constitution, which put most of these matters on a basis whereby they could be decided on by qualified majority voting.
I note that, despite the Commissionâs efforts, a number of Member States seem to be taking a backward step by now rejecting what they had accepted yesterday.
That is deplorable.
The continued requirement of unanimity in this area is a factor leading to paralysis and ineffectiveness.
At the European Unionâs informal summit on 20Â October 2006, strong practical measures must be decided on with a view to putting a stop to illegal immigration.
The summit must not be content with fine statements of good intentions, as summits too often are.
Put a stop to illegal immigration by all means, but the root cause of the problem has to be tackled.
The problem must be examined in consultation with the African countries within the framework of a genuine co-development strategy and by means of a proper sharing of competences between countries of immigration and countries of emigration.
Above all, however, the European Union must extend its development aid policy and monitor it more successfully and must know where the funds are going and how they are used.
Finally, I am not forgetting the very short term and the immediate problems and, like MrÂ Deprez, I deplore the behaviour of those Member States that have talked non-stop about mutual aid and solidarity but without ever having translated their words into deeds.
Faced with the influx of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands, it is our duty to come to the aid of Spain and the task of the Member States to take action and show solidarity.
Â Â  Mr President, it is fundamentally important that the basic principles and values on which the European Union is based are applied, in all circumstances, as part of the Member States' and Community policies too.
If our aspirations towards this are fulfilled, it will bring us closer to safeguarding the Union's democratic legitimacy and retaining our credibility.
This also means that the protection and promotion of fundamental rights must receive appropriate institutional support.
This is why I feel it is important that no Member State should prevent the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights from being set up to operate in a genuinely accountable, independent, as well as effective manner.
No Member State can be allowed to disregard Europe's fundamental values and principles.
But this is especially true for new Member States or for states now joining the Union, where the rule of law is, in many cases, only put to the test after they become members.
This is why open or covert official support by the government and politicians for intolerance and extremism cannot be allowed in Slovakia, neither can we tolerate its direct result: turning a blind eye to the acts of violence committed against minorities and the Hungarian population.
This cannot be regarded as a domestic matter.
It has a direct impact on freedom, security and justice within the EU, which makes it a European matter.
Similarly, we have seen a lack of principle, obscenities and lies being openly and cynically upheld, contravening Europe's fundamental principles and any responsibility and accountability to citizens, being presented, without any hint of an apology, as an act of courage and heroism. I am referring, of course, to the events surrounding the Hungarian prime minister, Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny.
This also undermines the foundations of the rule of law and credibility. This is why it jeopardises everything we build together in the area of freedom, security and justice.
The way in which the Council and Commission handles the expansion of the Schengen area has jeopardised the credibility of Community institutions and the confidence of the new Member States' citizens in the Union, especially when it has been recently announced that the area's enlargement would be postponed until the second half of 2008.
We simply do not understand this, and it is unacceptable to new members that they cannot join âŠ
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on a problem that all of Europe is facing, particularly the Mediterrranean countries.
Everyone has had his or her say; everybody has said that a solution should be found.
Ladies and gentlemen, the solution is right here in front of us: we should introduce a mechanism that ensures that responsibilities are shared by everybody.
Empty words are useless; it is useless to say that in this Union we should all be helping each other, but then do next to nothing when it comes to the crunch.
It is useless to utter beautiful-sounding words like âsolidarityâ, but then continue to fail to act.
Let us not allow this Union, which was created precisely to enable everybody to enjoy equal rights, to be reduced to a Europe of documents, a Europe of resolutions, a Europe of promises or a Europe of dreams.
I know efforts are being made, but they are not enough.
This is the moment of truth, this is the moment to practise what we preach and state what we really believe in.
I am convinced that, with some good will on all sides, a compromise will be found which will lead to a lasting solution to this problem, that is, the sorely-needed common European policy.
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry to raise this yet again, but it appears that no one in Parliamentâs Presidency is listening.
We were told to arrive here for votes at noon.
That has now been postponed to 12.05 and again to 12.10.
I know that you are very efficient at getting business through this House, but I urge you please to inform the Conference of Presidents of the continuing dissatisfaction of colleagues in this House about the times of votes being changed arbitrarily, at considerable inconvenience to the way this Houseâs business is conducted.
Â Â  We have had a very comprehensive, whole-morning debate on a single subject.
There have been 63 speakers.
I do not want to be discourteous either to the Council or the Commission, but the Minister spoke for 23 minutes and 49 seconds, and the Commissioner spoke for 21 minutes and 19 seconds.
I am obliged to give both of them the floor now.
I hope they will be brief in their remarks.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank Parliament for an excellent debate. I regret, however, that there has been insufficient time.
Unfortunately, I cannot take, say, two minutes to give a five-minute speech, although that would certainly be possible in the Finnish Parliament.
The Presidency is aware of the nature of the draft Framework Decision on the protection of personal data under the third pillar â I am now referring to MrsÂ Roureâs proposal â and of its importance for the citizens of Europe, and of the fact that the European Parliament has engaged with the proposals on the Framework Decision VIS and SIS II information systems.
In this connection and on behalf of the Presidency, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the work it has done, and to say that we are doing all we can in order to reach an agreement on the draft Framework Decision by the end of our presidential term.
Where possible, we will take the European Parliamentâs opinion and views into consideration in future work within the context of the acts of the Treaty, so that we can use an acceptable legislative instrument to guarantee high levels of protection of personal data by establishing common rules for data protection under the third pillar.
The issues of immigration and migration call for more focused discussion, and I hope that we will have the opportunity to return to them once again.
The situation in the Mediterranean was an issue I raised immediately at the first meeting of the Council of Ministers for Home Affairs.
It has been on the agenda and has been discussed at every such meeting, and will be again.
It is essential that we should be able to have a greater influence on social and economic development and on general conditions in third countries from which migrants come.
In general, we Ministers of the Interior prefer to deal with the purely human and negative impact; in other words, we put the plaster on the wound.
As a result, it is very important to have better coordination of the EUâs external relations and internal affairs in cooperation with third countries and the Commission.
This is also something that has been continually underlined in the work of the Council of Ministers.
It is also important that we give support to countries which bear a heavy burden when it comes to illegal immigration.
The initiative regarding extended solidarity proposed at Tampere is an important one.
It may help us to make progress, and not just by doling out money.
As a counterweight to this burden, we need significant financial investment.
In addition, we need guarantees of a procedure that will ensure that the Member States adhere to the jointly agreed rules and take responsibility for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers entering their territory â in other words, that they register them and give them a residence permit, or make arrangements for their repatriation.
It will be very important to establish information systems for this, and to develop existing systems too.
Together with the Commission, the Council supports the available forms of assistance needed in coastal surveillance in the Mediterranean and other areas of cooperation, but I wish to point out that in the European Union, responsibility for operations such as these lies with the Member States, which must have adequate competence, planning skills and management abilities for a continuing operation, as well as for joint operations.
The countries on Schengenâs external borders are also responsible for preventing illegal immigration into the Schengen area.
We want to support that, as well as the work of the new European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex).
It is vitally important that, when we emphasise the importance of ensuring protection and implementing the Geneva Convention, we make a distinction between illegal and legal immigration.
In this respect, it is very important that a proactive European immigration policy is developed and its quantitative and qualitative management established, while at the same time we bear in mind the question of stability in our job markets.
A proactive European immigration policy is not, however, the same thing as illegal immigration under the control of organised crime.
As Commissioner Frattini said, we must also take a serious view of the fact that the illegal job market and the grey economy are responsible for human and economic chaos.
The various Member States of the European Union should now be able to discuss this fact frankly and openly.
For this to happen, the authorities must be better able to recognise the phenomenon of the smuggling and trafficking of human beings and to step up their efforts to protect the victims of human trafficking.
The most disgusting form of organised crime, human trafficking, is a European phenomenon, although we hardly talk about it.
Finland wants to revitalise this debate both at home and in the European Union.
It is very important to monitor the way in which the enlarged European Union responds to the demands of our citizens and what they find acceptable, on the one hand, and the demands of internal security, on the other.
In this connection, I consider it very important to improve the decision-making process.
It is totally unacceptable that we should take more than a year to think about who to choose as Director of Europol.
It is also unacceptable that, at the same time as we demand controls at external borders and a border strategy, we should be dwelling on the matter of which city the Border Security Agency should be located in.
We must be able to implement a decision-making system that aims at better and more credible security.
Regarding the mountain bike that was called for in earlier speeches, I would like to say that Finland, like Germany and the other presidencies, as well as Commissioner Franco Frattini, would like to put this mountain bike into a higher gear, and that we aim to use it for the benefit of common security and a safer Europe.
Â Â  Thank you, Minister.
I believe it was US President Jackson who said âI like the noise of democracyâ.
That is what you are hearing.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I realise that, in the very few minutes available, it is going to be extremely difficult to reply even briefly to all the suggestions and remarks made by those who have taken the floor in the two and a half hours or so of this important debate.
MrÂ RajamÃ€ki, you mentioned earlier that todayâs debate concerned certain priorities for the European Union, one of which is certainly the fight against terrorism.
We have not talked about it much today, but you are all perfectly aware that just this summer, thanks to some painstaking cooperation, the security authorities in three European countries â the United Kingdom, Denmark and Germany â have foiled some terrorist attacks that could have proved devastating.
Terrorism still remains the main threat to our democracy.
In my view, there is no link between terrorism and immigration, and I share the opinions of those who have pointed that out.
Immigration is undoubtedly a separate priority: it is a challenge, not a danger to the European Union.
Many of you have mentioned co-development policies, especially with African countries.
I can tell you that the Commission, which is always somewhat ambitious when drawing up proposals, has proposed allocating EURÂ 17 billion â a substantial sum â to the new European fund for the development of countries such as those in Africa, and that the co-development policies that many have called for will be enhanced accordingly.
There will be co-development policies targeting institutional stabilisation, the fight against corruption, and good governance.
These are all co-development initiatives aimed at improving their capacity to prevent the flow of migrants, as many of you hope.
MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo mentioned the problem of the take-up of the available European funds.
I fully agree with MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, and I call on the Member States once more to draft some projects: European funds can only be spent if projects are put forward by EU Member States.
In recent years, unfortunately, several funds made available by the Commission have not been spent for lack of projects.
I invite all the Member States to put forward more projects, so that further initiatives can be financed.
A great deal has been said about prevention, protection and maritime borders, referring to the Mediterranean.
We are going to submit a project for the integrated management of the Mediterranean border to the ministers in Luxembourg for their approval.
I should like to say something to all those who have spoken in harsh terms, which I do not endorse, of a kind of âEuropean armadaâ to wage war on immigrants.
I should just like to mention â and this is directed in particular to MrsÂ Flautre, whom I hold in great esteem â that had it not been for the patrols in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic this summer, had it not been for thousands of coastguards, police and security operatives, many thousands of immigrants would have drowned at sea.
The primary purpose of the patrol boats is to save peopleâs lives at sea and not to wage war on immigrants.
The truth is therefore precisely the opposite of what was suggested: it is in the interests of safety that we intend to propose a system that all the governments have asked us to provide.
The subject of the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean certainly deserves to be debated thoroughly.
With regard to Libya, I shall only say that that country has agreed to talks with the European Union, which we shall begin in practical terms on the basis, above all, of a guarantee of full compliance with the rules on the dignity of the person and respect for the individual.
We have demanded this of Libya just as we demand it of all our other non-EU interlocutors.
Libya has asked for help in controlling its southern border: its 2Â 000-km desert border is practically uncontrollable, and one of the requests that we have received is: âhelp us to control this border better, and we can help you to control people before they set off and, above all, to eradicate people trafficking,â which unfortunately often takes place across the Mediterranean.
We have a duty to start talks with Libya, and we must do so on the basis of mutual respect between the European Union and its non-European partners.
The African Union-European Union conference on immigration, to be held in Tripoli, will be a further signal to make Libya understand that we want not only Libya but also all the countries in North Africa to be seriously involved.
I should like to make a couple of final considerations.
The first concerns solidarity. Many people have mentioned solidarity.
I believe that we need to take a global approach towards solidarity, just as we do towards immigration, because we must show solidarity above all to the victims of people trafficking.
That is the first kind of solidarity that we must have.
Then there is the solidarity that we must show towards the African countries of origin, as well as the transit countries, as they too are exposed to an often uncontrolled flow of people.
Then there is also the solidarity among Member States within the European Union.
We must not deny the importance of mutual solidarity among countries in the European Union, since it is one of the forms that the word âsolidarityâ must take.
How can we forget that countries like Malta or the small islands of the Canaries or Lampedusa cannot deal with the ongoing flow of illegal immigrants by themselves?
That, too, is solidarity.
There is the human solidarity towards the people who land on our coasts; there is also the solidarity that countries far from the Mediterranean must show towards countries surrounded by or bordering the Mediterranean.
The second topic is respect for the law.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think the European Union can be asked to turn something illegal into something legal, because, where a law has been broken, the infringement remains an infringement.
Those who deal in human beings must be punished severely and without tolerance.
When people provide work illegally and under cover and take advantage of illegal immigrant workers, there have to be sanctions.
When people get into the EU by breaking all the laws and remain in the EU by breaking all the laws, European policy must respect the dignity of the individual, but it must also be credible and must send those who have broken the law back to their countries of origin; otherwise we shall be giving the impression that they can break the law and nothing will happen to them.
Lastly, my final consideration concerns our institutional and constitutional policy.
We have talked about it a great deal: we need vision, as MrÂ Schulz and many others have said, to steer and to activate the political processes.
I cannot imagine us lagging behind civil society; I cannot imagine us, as institutions, waiting for civil society to give us a push or even to show its dissatisfaction with our capacity for political leadership.
Many people mentioned the need to give up national self-interest.
I see this as a central theme: if we and the Member Statesâ governments realise that not even they stand to benefit from sticking to their national self-interests, then those governments will understand that national pride, which many of us consider important, can be upheld rather better if we pool our common policies.
Upholding national pride by maintaining that immigration or terrorism can be addressed solely through national policies is not a matter of upholding national pride or upholding the great principles behind so many countriesâ traditions; it is merely not responding to what the people are demanding.
That is why we need a political vision with the courage to go in a different direction.
Â Â  I should like to thank all 63 speakers who took part in the debate.
I should like to thank the Minister for his brevity and the Commissioner for his passion.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be tomorrow.
Â Â  âPrevention is better than cureâ is a popular idiom.
This issue is one of both prevention and cure.
There is no doubt that the European Union is finally understanding that the problems faced by Malta and other Mediterranean countries affected by the immigration phenomenon will ultimately become a problem of Europe as a whole.
And this is the Europe that Malta wanted to join.
There is nothing more noble than solidarity.
Some, however, are criticising the Union for providing too little too late.
Maybe they are right; but better late than never.
Definitely two boats to patrol the extension between Gibraltar and Alexandra are inadequate, but on the other hand the request by Libya to help control its 2000 km hinterland borders is extremely good news, especially for Malta. This is part of the policy of prevention.
The process to cure the phenomenon is much more complicated.
Unless the endemic African problems of poverty, civil wars, disease, hunger, unemployment, corruption and international debts are addressed and enhanced by a system of good rule and justice, the problem of irregular immigration will remain irresolvable.
I cannot but criticise some European countries for squabbling over financial help to their partners â Malta, Italy, Spain and Greece â which are doing their best to alleviate the plight of irregular immigrants.
Â Â  â Achieving a European common policy on immigration and asylum is undoubtedly a priority, although the Member States have so far shown varying degrees of willingness to address the problem.
However, the need to tackle the problem of illegal immigration is, in my view, even more urgent.
Despite the institutionsâ repeated calls for cooperation, the main burden of this still falls on the Member States located on the European Unionâs natural borders.
Practical solutions therefore need to be found urgently to contain and regulate the problem.
Coordinating the border forces of the various Member States is useful but not enough.
The idea of setting up a joint border task force is certainly the most appropriate solution, and I am grateful to the Finnish Presidency for mentioning it.
Not least, dialogue with and support for those countries from which the immigrants come and those through which they pass on their way to Europe are absolutely essential for any lasting, effective solution.
I hope that the forthcoming presidencies, starting with Germany, which receives a large proportion of the immigrants filtering through from the southern borders, will tackle the issue firmly and achieve a consensus on this subject, which closely affects all Europeans as well as the Unionâs delicate social balance.
Â Â  I should like to take this opportunity to welcome to the distinguished visitorsâ gallery members of a Chinese delegation led by Deputy Minister Qiu Yuanping.
Mrs Qiu is Deputy Minister of the Central Foreign Affairs Office of the Peopleâs Republic of China.
The delegation is here to meet a number of political groups as well as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade and the chairmen of the Delegation for relations with the Peopleâs Republic of China and the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
I wish them an instructive stay in the European Parliament.
â a warm welcome to you all!
Â Â  Mr President, I very much welcome the visit of the Prime Minister of Lebanon this afternoon, but I very much regret that the Question Time session with the Council has had to be abandoned to make room for this, with no attempt by the Conference of Presidents to reschedule it to another time.
Question Time is one of the important democratic traditions of this House.
It is the one opportunity we have to question the Council on issues of concern to us and our constituents.
It is central to our work.
This is the second time this year that this session has been arbitrarily cancelled.
Can I urge you, please, to make sure that there is no third repeat of this.
Â Â  We take note of your remarks, Mr Bushill-Matthews.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
Â Â  . Fellow Members, I would ask you to vote in favour of the legislative resolution contained in my report on data protection under the third pillar.
Indeed, MrÂ RajamÃ€ki has, this morning, been able to give shape to the moral undertakings given by the preceding presidencies.
The Finnish Presidency has made data protection its priority, and I would today thank it for having done so.
I would also take the same opportunity to welcome the Presidencyâs presence in this House.
The Council is to present us with a document at the beginning of 2007 and it will take account of our opinion.
That is why I call on you to vote in favour of this report.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry, MrÂ President, but an error in the French translation of AmendmentÂ 29 has been pointed out to me: as the authors of the text, we should like the words ââ corrected to ââ, in line with the spirit of the text in French.
That is the political will of the draftsmen.
We consider it a translation error.
Â Â  Mr President, in paragraph 29, there is a mistake in the Dutch version.
I am not an expert on the Dutch language â but I will improve! As far as I know, the phrase is not an appropriate translation of what is written in the English version, i.e. âappropriate legal initiativesâ.
I think my Dutch friends will agree with me and maybe also give me a grade A in the Dutch language!
I would like to underline that it is the English version that is the authentic text in this case.
Â Â  There is an error in our amendment.
What we are concerned with here are, of course, services of general economic interest, since the sentence relates to the deregulation of these and has no bearing on other services of general interest.
It is therefore a case of services of general economic interest and not of services of general interest.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have the same request to make: that services of general interest be replaced by services of general economic interest.
Â Â  â The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes swapping the order of paragraphs 28 and 29 and combining them into a single paragraph.
Is anybody opposed?
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also proposes inserting paragraph 30 before paragraph 22.
Is anybody opposed?
Â Â  It does not make a big difference, but we prefer the original sequence, and therefore we oppose this shifting of paragraph 30.
Â Â  The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also proposes inserting paragraph 33 before paragraph 31 and combining them into a single paragraph.
Is anybody opposed?
Â Â  Mr President, I do not want to hold up the vote any longer, but here too we prefer the original sequence because we think it is better.
Â Â  Mr President, I have a simple oral amendment to correct the text.
It suggests that a committee of experts should be set up by the Turkish Government to look into the issue of the genocide, âunder the auspices of the United Nationsâ.
This is our idea not their idea, so to make it clear that it is our proposal that this committee should also work under the auspices of the United Nations, we want to improve the text by replacing âunder the auspices of the United Nationsâ with âwhich should be under the auspices of the United Nationsâ.
We are therefore adding the words âwhich should beâ.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of the members of my delegation, I wanted, for clarityâs sake, to make a change to the voting list.
Against the vote in sections about the original text of paragraph 72, a minus sign has been inserted in both the first and second parts by mistake. This should be changed into a plus sign in both instances, just so as to make matters absolutely clear.
We will be voting by roll call for the first and second parts.
Â Â  Mr President, I see that the oral amendments have been distributed.
They merely update the text of this amendment, so I do not think we need to have much discussion on them.
Â Â  . Mr President, the vote on this report puts an end to a few months of exhaustive proceedings.
With the vote, as this House has voted on the amendments, the text of the report is coming very close to the original text which I as rapporteur proposed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The report is strict, yet fair: fair because we in this House have expressed our seriousness and commitment, but fair also because we, in turn, demand from Turkey that it should show commitment, both in terms of the implementation of the Ankara Protocol before the end of this year and of carrying out political reforms in the area of the freedom of expression of opinion and freedom of religion by the end of 2007.
Nor let there be no mistake about the text with regard to the Armenian genocide.
Although it is, strictly speaking, not a formal condition, we think it unavoidable for a country on the path to Europe to come to terms with its past.
I therefore hope that Turkey will interpret this paragraph 50 as an extra incentive, together with its neighbour Armenia, to face up to the facts.
Mr President, I come to the conclusion that the report is fair but tough.
The European Parliament is fulfilling its responsibility for safeguarding European values and the accession criteria with this report.
I therefore ask all Members to support the report as broadly as possible.
I hope that Turkey will see it as an incentive to speed up its reforms.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
We shall now proceed to the explanations of vote.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I voted in favour of the Roure report on the grounds that the war on terror is, for the USA, a welcome pretext for compelling others to hand over personal information.
European data protection provisions, however, categorise the USA as a third country with poor data protection security, something irreconcilable with the agreement on passenger data, which is itself worthy of criticism.
It would also appear that the banks, too, are being blackmailed into disclosing the movements of funds.
While one would hope that all these things are being done only for good purposes, the EU must stop lending legitimacy to the concept of the transparent person, and should instead get back to taking data protection seriously.
Â Â  The report is clearly a further step towards total harmonisation of the Member Statesâ criminal justice systems.
As always, proposals of this kind involve a protracted and very complicated compromise between the countries.
The June List is always a devoted adherent of the Member Statesâ right to self-determination in criminal law, and we are very concerned about legal certainty.
Among other things, the report would, under certain conditions, entitle private actors to acquaint themselves with very sensitive personal data, a development that, in the opinion of the June List, cannot be regarded as offering sufficient legal certainty.
It is true that Parliamentâs amendments contain certain guarantees of legal certainty for individuals, but the proposal as a whole entails a major step towards supranational control of what is at the heart of the right to self-determination of a state governed by the rule of law, namely criminal law.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of the report by Mr Diaz de Mera Garcia Consuegra on the proposal for a decision of the European Council on the PERICLES programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting.
This issue is essential to the proper functioning of our single currency, and I am delighted that the decision is being extended to Member States that are not part of the euro zone.
It is important to note that, while the number of counterfeit euro notes appears to have stabilised at 50Â 000 per month, we are seeing a worrying explosion in counterfeit coins.
We should therefore consider whether it may be in our interest to look into the introduction of a one euro note, following the example of the one dollar note in the United States of America, in order to prevent counterfeiting and also because it would be of some practical use to commerce and to the citizens.
Â Â  Since the euro was introduced and the Member Statesâ national currencies correspondingly withdrawn, there is just one encouraging development to be noted: the reduction in counterfeiting.
In 2005, the total number of counterfeit euro coins withdrawn from circulation was substantially lower than the total number of counterfeit coins in the former national currencies before the introduction of the euro.
This is due, in particular, to the constructive cooperation between the anti-fraud office, or OLAF, the European Central Bank, Europol, Interpol and the competent national authorities.
Beyond straightforward counterfeiting, there has also, however, been the recent emergence of new coins confusingly similar to twoâeuro coins.
Since 1Â January 2005, Turkey does, in fact, have a new coin, known as the ânew Turkish lireâ.
Looking at the new one-lire coin, you can see that it is of exactly the same size and appearance as the two-euro coin.
Is this a coincidence or a clever piece of counterfeiting?
Wait and seeÂ ...
The problem is that these Turkish coins are already circulating in Europe, no doubt in anticipation of Turkish accession to Europe, as announced by our leaders and eurocrats, regardless of the will of the nations themselves.
Let us be vigilant. Turkey is closer than ever to our gates.
Â Â  I am abstaining in the vote on this report because I believe that the EU should invest as many resources in protecting the Swedish krona and other EU currencies as in protecting the euro.
The fight against counterfeiting is, of course, a good thing in itself, especially when it is based on cooperation and conferences and not on increased police supervision.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we did not vote for MrÂ Demetriou's report, even though it is a substantial improvement on the proposal for a framework decision tabled by the Council.
Why did we not vote for it?
Because, in spite of everything, this whole instrument is still remarkably ambiguous.
What exactly does it mean that criminal decisions taken in a Member State will be taken into account?
Will they be taken into account to avoid the application of the double jeopardy rule, in order to avoid unfair double convictions?
That would be perfectly natural.
On the flip side, however, does it mean taking them into account in order to suggest that someone is guilty on the basis of actions that are not regarded as criminal in their country of origin?
For example, will the historian David Irving, who is currently unjustly imprisoned in Austria for a thought crime, be regarded, when he returns to his country, which we hope will happen soon, as a criminal and persistent offender, when he is doubtless the greatest British Second World War historian?
Those are some of the ambiguities contained in this text, which, in our view, justify our reticence, all the more so because there is a convention on this matter, the convention of 1970.
As the report quite rightly states, a framework decision cannot unilaterally amend an international convention.
This also raises the problem of the States that are not Members of the European Union but that nevertheless ratified that convention.
This reservation, which we have developed since ratification, presents a new problem in international law, which we would prefer to regulate under the terms of the international conventions.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of the excellent report by MrÂ Demetriou on the proposal for a Framework Council Decision on taking account of convictions in the Member States of the European Union in the course of new criminal proceedings.
The functioning of the single market and the mobility of Europeans within the Union makes it essential to define the conditions under which convictions in the Member States must be taken into account in the course of new legal proceedings involving different cases in another Member State.
It has become essential to establish the principle of mutual recognition of convictions, together with the gathering and exchange of appropriate information that would naturally accompany that.
This is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition if we are to move towards a European judicial area in the belief that European democracy must be based on law and, conversely, that the law must stem from democracy.
Â Â  The June List believes that legal certainty for individuals is a very important issue that should not be compromised on.
Criminal law goes to the heart of a countryâs sovereignty and right to self-determination.
There is no doubt that widely different legal cultures exist at present within the EU, just as there are widely different attitudes to legal certainty and the impartiality of the courts.
The proposal is in danger of undermining the Hague convention governing the international scope of criminal courts, which was signed back in 1972 and has operated successfully since then.
True, the June List believes that Parliamentâs amendment is better thought-out, but it also believes that the proposal as a whole is a further step towards a supranational union.
We are therefore voting against the proposal on grounds of principle.
Â Â  . One absolute principle in all modern codes of criminal law is that of , according to which criminal penalties may only be applied to something that was punishable as a crime at the time the deed was done.
What this means is terms of this framework decision is that a sentence previously handed down in state A may not be taken into account in a new criminal trial in state B if the relevant act was not a punishable offence in B under that stateâs own laws. Since this can, ultimately, be determined only by, for example, a judge in state B repeating the whole proceedings from state A complete with the collection of evidence â which would involve such things as re-interviewing witnesses and would be neither desirable nor workable â it must be sufficient that he should have good reason to doubt that the act was punishable.
If a judge has such doubts, he should no longer be allowed to take such a previous conviction into account.
It is regrettable that this is not expressly stated in this framework decision.
I would have tabled an amendment to it, had it not been for the fact that the time available for discussion of amendments in committee ran out, since the deadline for handing them in fell in the summer recess and the vote took place immediately following it without further debate in committee.
I find this highly regrettable, since a bit more time would have made it possible for the problem I have described to be avoided.
Â Â  We need to stress that cooperation rather than harmonisation must underlie any measure in this area.
This report is no doubt worthy, however we need strongly to reiterate the prime importance of respecting different national legal traditions rather than following too prescriptive a path.
Therefore, my British Conservative colleagues and I have abstained on this report.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted against my party's whip with regard to the Capoulas Santos report on the fisheries agreement with Guinea-Bissau.
Over the last seven years I have become increasingly concerned about the nature of the various fisheries agreements the European Union has with many and various countries.
This has been reflected in my voting up until this point.
A few years ago I read the Court of Auditorsâ report on a number of these fisheries agreements which raise particular questions and doubts as to whether there are benefits to the countries concerned.
Certainly there is little benefit to the local fishing communities, and certainly no benefits to the ecology of the local fisheries.
I especially dislike the fact that the EU is hoovering up fishing rights on the cheap for rich and mainly Spanish fishing fleets to abuse, and thus I voted against this particular report.
Â Â  . The extension of this Fisheries Agreement will allow for better preparation for the new Partnership Agreement between the EU and Guinea-Bissau.
The main difficulty currently facing the Community fleet concerns the manifest lack of resources for the inspection and surveillance of the countryâs exclusive economic zone, that is to say, outside the 12-mile zone.
The result of this lack of resources is illegal practices that are jeopardising the sustainability of the fishing activities of the Community fleet.
This extension will also maintain the fishing opportunities for the European fleet and will enable the Guinea-Bissau Government to guarantee best fishing practice for the EU on the basis of the sustainability of the resources concerned.
I shall be voting in favour of this report.
Â Â  Mr President, today we are asked to approve yet another fisheries agreement exporting our disastrous policies to a third country.
These agreements do not serve development, conservation or the credibility of the EU and I shall continue to vote against them.
Â Â  Mr President, I did not vote on draft amending budget No 4, the Pittella report.
This is not because I have no respect for the rapporteur â in fact I have a huge amount of respect for Mr Pittella and I am quite sure that this particular adjustment in the budget is fine.
But I do have a definite problem with the process: a qualified majority vote without an indication of votes, no check of votes on the floor and absolutely no scrutiny of the process behind this.
I would like to reflect many of my constituentsâ worries about the European budget.
I was recently at meetings in both Daventry and Brixworth in my region, where concern was expressed that the budget is not spent or implemented properly.
Transferring huge amounts of money between budget lines, which does not reflect Parliamentâs considered political view at the time of the budget process, is a worrying development that is happening more and more.
Thus I did not vote on the Pittella report.
Â Â  Today, we have voted on an amending budget affecting the income side of the EU budget.
The amending budget includes, for example, the recalculation of the contributions necessary for funding the British rebate.
We find it unfair and antiquated that a Member State should have been placed in this kind of unique position and we wish, in this connection, to emphasise the importance of reviewing the EU budget planned for 2008/2009.
It is crucially important that this review should cover the British rebate as well as the common agricultural policy.
Â Â  We have voted against this report because it rejects the Council of Ministersâ draft amending budget no. 3.
Unlike the majority in the Committee on Budgets, we believe that the Council of Ministers is perfectly entitled to redistribute expenditure between the EUâs different institutions during the budget procedure if it thinks this the right thing to do.
Â Â  . With the adoption of the Progress programme, all of the Community actions that were previously spread across different programmes have been brought together, for example the fight against discrimination, the Community strategy for equality between men and women, incentives in the area of employment, activities relating to working conditions and actions in the fight against social exclusion.
During the debate and negotiation stage we were able to improve upon various aspects of the Commissionâs original proposal on Progress, which now includes a number of proposals put forward by our group on the opinion of which I was draftsman on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality.
Unfortunately, however, the important aspect of the cofinancing contribution was not amended. This represents a backward step for associations working in the area of poverty and social exclusion, given that the contribution has dropped from the 90% negotiated in 2001 to the current figure of 80%, a flat figure for all associations.
There may be exceptions but it would be very difficult to gain approval for them.
This is the main reason behind our abstention on this report adopting the Progress programme.
Â Â  Like so much that we see in this Chamber, the objectives of this programme are well-meant.
Yet I doubt that it will achieve much practical effect.
The proposed budget of EUR 650 million is both too much and too little: too much because such a sum, wisely used, could potentially achieve some good; too little because at about EUR 1.50 for each EU citizen, it cannot make the broad-scale changes that are envisaged.
Most of the money will go into administration, allocation and assessment, and precious little to getting results.
When will we ever learn?
Over and over again we see well-meaning programmes like this that fail to deliver.
Yet we keep trying again.
It is a triumph of hope over experience.
Yet here we are, with yet another centralised attempt to set the world to rights.
Letâs be brutally honest. The main effect of this measure will be to make us in this House feel that we have âdone Somethingâ.
It will give us a glow of self-righteousness. But it will pass unnoticed amongst those it is intended to help.
We are fiddling while Rome burns.
Or perhaps I should say fiddling while the Treaty of Rome burns.
Â Â  . â For 2007-2013, the Progress programme wants to absorb the Community programmes on social protection, working conditions and so on into a single text. This mish-mash is just yet another socially useless instrument along the same lines as the ineffective 'Lisbon Strategy' for European economic growth.
This programme also quite clearly has an ideological slant.
Whilst gender equality and consideration for the needs of disabled people are very laudable objectives, the defence of 'people potentially exposed to discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age and sexual orientation' may be a way of silencing opposition to the immigration policy currently being pursued by the Member States, which has been threatening our social protection systems for 30 years.
Quite apart from its costs, this draft strengthens the powers of the European bureaucracy in Brussels, which bears a large part of the responsibility for the ruin of many of our industries, for the destruction of our countryside and therefore for the social regression from which the peoples of Europe are suffering.
Only a new Europe of nations, based on national solidarity, will enable true social progress in our countries.
Â Â  . The overall objective of the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity, or Progress, is to provide financial support for implementing the objectives of the EU in the area of employment and social affairs and to help achieve the targets of the social agenda in the context of the Lisbon Strategy.
The partial political agreement on a common position already incorporates most of Parliamentâs amendments to the text of the proposal.
Broadly speaking, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have taken the same line on this programme.
I therefore lend my full backing to the text of the common position, which creates the conditions in which the proposal for a decision establishing the programme can be quickly adopted.
This text does not change the substance of the Commissionâs original proposal, but it does bring greater clarity and transparency to the implementation of the programme and above all to budgetary questions.
Â Â  . As Europe grows older and the economy becomes ever more globalised, it has become increasingly necessary to attach special importance to social policy, with a view to strengthening regional and social cohesion in Europe.
The Progress programme is more than an important instrument of social policy.
It is indicative of the fact that Parliament recognises that public policy continues to play a central role in promoting employment, social protection, social inclusion, favourable working conditions, the fight against discrimination, diversity and equality between men and women.
Naturally Europe must look at the economic growth indicators that it needs to improve.
Yet for this to happen the Member States need to realise that progress must be made on certain key aspects, such as making more concrete progress in the construction of the internal market.
The view that what is required is more Europe and less self-interest is a further vital factor in the success of regional and social cohesion policy.
I welcome the simplification that PROGRESS will bring, by continuing to develop activities launched by four previous programmes, in line with the Commissionâs intention to consolidate and streamline the EU's financial instruments.
Â Â  . â I voted in favour of the assent for the strategic guidelines on cohesion, but I should like to emphasise that the regional policy reform took place not only in the difficult context of the renewal of the financial perspective, but also in the context of the revival of the Lisbon Strategy, which clearly reoriented its objectives.
The fact is that reorienting them exclusively towards innovation, the knowledge-based economy and competitiveness in the old Member States is not enough to guarantee the objectives of territorial cohesion and sustainable development, which seem to me to take priority.
I deplore in particular the fact that the earmarking of appropriations in relation to the Lisbon objectives, together with the classification of expenditure, should not have been made subject to the agreement of Parliament.
I also find it regrettable that the territorial dimension of cohesion was not explicitly taken into account as a strategic guideline in its own right.
Nevertheless, this is not enough for the development of isolated rural areas.
I am worried about the fate that awaits them in the programme, because there is still no clear dividing line between intervention from the ERDF and that from the EAFRD, which is part of the CAP and has very limited funds.
Â Â  . â The Community strategic guidelines for 2007-2013 have finally been adopted by the European Parliament.
I voted in favour of the rapporteur's recommendations approving these guidelines.
Nevertheless, during the debate I drew the Commission's attention to the challenge of cross-border cooperation, which should enable us to reduce the disparities between the Union's border regions, provided the unequal amounts being allocated from the Structural Funds as a result of the statistical nomenclature do not hinder the objective of cohesion and do not increase inequalities.
It is vital that we create the conditions for balanced economic, social and territorial development on both sides of borders and pay special attention to programmes aimed at achieving cross-border cooperation.
Â Â  . The quick adoption of Community strategic guidelines on cohesion is a vitally important factor in the ongoing process of programming assistance from the European Funds in the Member States in the field of the reform of the cohesion policy for 2007-2013, with a view to the new financial programmes being operational as of 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
Parliament had its say on the guidelines in its sitting of 18Â May in a resolution that it adopted based on the Krehl report on preparing for the assent procedure for the Communityâs strategic guidelines for the period 2007-2013 (Cohesion Policy in Support of Growth and Jobs), which I supported and on which I voted accordingly.
The recommendation on the proposal for a Council decision on Community strategic guidelines on cohesion by MrsÂ Krehl is based on that parliamentary resolution of 18Â May.
I therefore voted in favour again.
Â Â  . Now that the majority in Parliament has given its assent to the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion for 2007-2013, the Member States will submit their national reference frameworks.
We do not accept the change implied by these strategic guidelines, insofar as they make cohesion play second fiddle to competitiveness; in other words, the objective of economic and social cohesion becomes secondary to the 'Lisbon Strategy' objectives and their neoliberal agenda of liberalising the markets and public services, encouraging deregulation and reducing job security, privatising social security and selling off teaching and research to the highest bidder.
It is an agenda, in other words, that undermines economic and social cohesion and promotes territorial disparities and social inequalities.
The establishment of a minimum quota of funds for these purposes â at least 60% for convergence regions â is therefore unacceptable, as it pits contradictory objectives against one another, especially in a context in which the amount of funds has been cut to 0.37% of Community GNI from 0.41% in the previous framework.
Furthermore, we are opposed â especially in this context â to extending the use of private-public partnerships.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Krehl on a well balanced report on this crucial issue.
In Scotland we have long experience of using structural funds effectively and well, and it is vital that the funds continue to evolve to meet Europeâs needs.
This report takes proper cognisance of developments and suggests a number of helpful steps forward and I welcome it wholeheartedly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to explain why, after yesterday's very interesting debates and today's votes, I voted against MrÂ Rapkay's report: it is quite simply because I cannot help but observe that it is a resounding victory for the liberals.
We voted for the deregulation of public services, against a framework directive, against the distinction between services of general economic interest and services of general interest, for the application of competition law to all services of general interest and their precise definition, against the definition of 'in-house', in other words state control, and against the specifics of the Altmark criteria.
Under these circumstances, we are taking a considerable step backwards in comparison with the previous resolutions by MrÂ Herzog and MrÂ Langen in 2001, and the Commission is now proposing a new communication at the end of the year.
In other words, we are currently leaving whole swathes of Community law and local public services exposed to the uncertainties of the Court.
What is meant by State control?
What is meant by inter-communal structure?
What is meant by mixed-economy society?
What concessions need to be made to market and competition law?
We still do not know, and that is why I shall continue to advocate over-arching texts that enable us to put subsidiarity on a firmer footing.
Unfortunately, I think that we are far from achieving that, and that it is now a losing battle.
I hope that it is not a final defeat.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we did not vote in favour of the Rapkay report for one very specific reason: it constitutes a completely unjustified backward step in comparison with the text of the Constitution.
The text of the draft Constitution provided for a European law laying down the principles and conditions that enable us to provide, implement and fund services of general economic interest.
This would therefore be what is currently called a framework directive.
Not only does the report move away from this principle, but, by rejecting AmendmentÂ 10, it formally rejects and publicly expresses opposition to the Constitutional Treaty.
I am consequently most concerned about the wayward path being taken by Parliament, which claims to support the Constitutional Treaty but which, when it comes to something important, and even crucial, to public opinion in some countries, pulls back with no justification.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of the report by MrÂ Rapkay on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (SGI) because it is a balanced report.
In particular, he has had the courage to point out that it is impossible to provide a uniform definition of SGIs in such a heterogeneous social and economic environment as the European Union and that, in this field, the principle of subsidiarity must be reaffirmed, leaving it to the Member States to define what should or should not be classed as coming under the general interest and directly to act in accordance with their decisions.
Following the difficulties in reaching a political compromise at first reading on the âservicesâ directive, the debate on SGIs is far from concluded.
It is urgent that we legislate at European level on particular sectors, namely social services and health services of general interest, in order to provide them with legal certainty.
Finally, this matter will be important in terms of the competitiveness of the European area, to which we must pay close attention.
Â Â  . â I voted against MrÂ Rapkay's report on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest because several amendments that were very important to me were rejected, in particular the amendment calling for a framework directive on services of general interest and those calling for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between services of general interest (SGIs) and services of general economic interest (SGEIs) and the criteria for granting compensation for the provision of public services and in-house provision.
We must not give way on these vital issues for the future of public services in our countries, and we must not take a backward step in comparison to what Parliament adopted in the Herzog resolution in 2004 and the Langen resolution in 2001, especially at a time when the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has drafted a proposal for a framework directive on general interest services that goes still further.
Â Â  . As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission White Paper on Services of General Interest (SGIs), I fought for the following:
- the complete exclusion of SGIs â both non-economic (SNEGIs) and economic (SGEIs) â from the scope of the directive on services in the internal market (the âServices Directiveâ).
- the adoption, by contrast, of a framework directive, a framework legislation or a general legal framework, call it what you will, for SGIs (including SGEIs, although this does not prevent the latter from being subject to a specific sectoral regulation); and
- the definition and description of SGIs, along with a clarification of the distinction between SNEGIs and SGEIs, for the purpose of legal certainty.
Broadly speaking, I feel that these ideas have been covered in this report.
I therefore supported and voted in favour of this report.
I am disappointed, however, that the report did not incorporate another of the main ideas that I put forward in the opinion of which I was the draftsman, namely a recognition, in the context of SGIs, of the unique situation of the outermost regions, in view of the particular structural and permanent obstacles that they face.
Â Â  â I voted against MrÂ Rapkay's report for the following reasons.
First of all, the Commission is not requested to propose a framework directive on services of general interest.
There is now a threat hanging over administrations, mixed-economy societies and inter-communal structures, due to the risk of disputes in the name of competition law.
MrÂ Barroso made no mistake when, during the debate in plenary, he observed that there was no consensus on a proposal for a framework directive.
By refusing to define services of general interest and the specific law applicable to them, the Commission is leaving public services subject to the rules of the market, and hence to competition law.
Now is no longer the time to publish yet another communication, or to put forward new sectoral proposals.
We expect the Commission to respect Parliament's decisions and to proceed as soon as possible to an evaluation of the liberalisation policies being pursued.
We know that the results are a long way off the published objectives.
This resolution does not look at services of general interest as a fundamental pillar of the European social model, or as a means of achieving the EU's objectives in terms of society, the economy, the environment and territorial cohesion.
Â Â  . We voted against this report because its broad premise is to submit public services to competition and to a future internal market for services, in light of the compromise reached by the Council over the notorious Bolkestein Directive.
At the same time, it covers up the effects of the sectoral liberalisations that have already taken place in areas such as transport, energy and communications.
Contrary to what is claimed, and as many user groups and consumer protection organisations have proved, liberalisation has led to more difficult access to services, lower service quality, higher prices and the loss of thousands of jobs, on the pretext of sectoral restructuring.
The idea of dividing services of general interest into economic and non-economic, from a commercial perspective, is actually part of an attempt to put almost all public services at the mercy of the market.
Our position is to defend the exclusive competence and sovereignty of the Member States in defining how public services are to be funded and how that funding is to be organised.
After all, public ownership is a fundamental element in protecting high-quality public services, so as to guarantee universal access throughout EU territory, supply at socially fair prices and the democratic involvement of end users in defining, managing and determining the quality of these services.
Â Â  . â MrÂ Rapkayâs report on services of general interest, whether economic or otherwise, promises us yet more convoluted European legislation and further interference on the part of the Commission in the budgetary and fiscal systems of the Member States and their local authorities, all of which is in flagrant breach of the principle of subsidiarity, which is nonetheless mentioned time and again by the rapporteur.
The people of Europe must be constantly reminded that the liberalisation of public services, with its all too familiar consequences, is the Commission of Brusselsâ way of holding the Treaties to legal ransom.
The fact is that the market, on its own, cannot guarantee either the quality or the completion of all of the tasks relating to these services, regardless of whether they are connected to society, territorial planning or strategic and national interests.
Public services, whether profitable or not, must come under the exclusive power of the Member States, in terms both of their definition and of their organisation, the appointment procedures, the number and nature of the bodies to which they are entrusted and even the funding methods.
Â Â  I voted against the Rapkay report because I consider that the final text did not provide adequate support for services of general interest (public services).
Directives on a sectoral basis alone will only result in âsalami slicingâ of the overall public interest and carve out sectors for business benefit.
There are aspects of social services which support the educational sector, forms of housing which serve a general public interest even if not expressly dealing with a deprived social sector etc. â a sectoral approach is not enough.
As we have so often done in the environmental domain, we need an overarching framework directive first, setting out the general interest before we embark on specific sectors.
We can find a legal basis.
It is not enough for people to say this lies within the competence of Member States when those same Member State governments are using market rules, the Services Directive and other means to achieve liberalisation by the back door.
I hope those who supported the amendment on liberalisation, who voted against a horizontal directive and voted for the final report will be able to explain to their colleagues in local and regional government why they are not defending more strongly the public services their colleagues have to deliver.
Â Â  . â Mr Rapkayâs report on services of general interest (SGIs) is initially appealing.
It talks about more being done to protect public services and the principle of subsidiarity, about democratic respect being shown for national traditions and about the definitions relating to SGIs being clarified by means of the specific introduction of the concept of services of ânon economicâ interest.
These good intentions may fool people, especially when the draft framework directive now seems to have been abandoned.
However, a good many binding rules are going to compete with the Member Statesâ prerogatives, such as their control over funding methods.
The door therefore remains open for a wayward pro-European path to be taken in future.
Finally, it is clearly impossible for me to vote in favour of this text, as it refers to the Constitutional Treaty â the Constitution â which the report maintains would provide better guarantees for SGIs faced with the current mess that European legislation is in.
I would point out that the European Constitution was democratically rejected by the people of the Netherlands and of France.
This text, which, in the end, takes neither side in the debate, only warrants a vote of abstention.
Â Â  â I voted against the Rapkay report. It does not acknowledge the need for a framework directive for SGIs and SGEIs and thus leaves the door open for a continuation of the current process of deregulation, which jeopardises our public services, as well as the opportunity for everybody, no matter where they live, to access these vital services.
A framework directive should guarantee standardisation among users, equality among the citizens and the regions, territorial planning and the long-term continuity of the services provided, as well as a quality standard level.
We must, as a matter of urgency, stop this across-the-board liberalisation, which satisfies neither the employees engaged in these activities nor the citizens.
Â Â  â Services of general economic interest, with the distinction between their economic and non-economic aspects, are in the sights of big business, with a view to commercialising the satisfaction of basic grassroots needs and increasing their profits.
The ÎU is intensifying the ban on state aid on the pretext of protecting competition and promoting the full liberalisation and privatisation of services with a view to permitting the penetration of big business.
Within the frameworks of the single market and the stability pact, the Member States are selling off the grassroots wealth, thereby strengthening the plutocracy.
According to the ÎU, services profitable to capital must be sold off.
The results of this policy will be particularly painful for the workers: the loss of thousands of jobs, worse industrial relations and a fall in the standard of living.
The consequences, which we have already seen in services which have fallen victim to capitalist restructurings and the privatisation policy, will be particularly adverse for all the users of these services, especially the grassroots classes.
The Greek Communist Party voted against the European Parliament resolution which accepts the division of services of general interest into economic and non-economic services and promotes the selling off and commercialisation of these services.
It supports the workers fighting for better and cheaper public services for the benefit of the standard of living of the people and not of the profits of the monopolies.
Â Â  . Regardless of the capitalist and market economy model that we advocate, there will always be a need for public services to be provided by public bodies, either directly or indirectly.
Accordingly, and given that this issue comes up in various Community measures â if only for the purpose of excluding it from their scope â it is understandable that the Commission should submit its opinion on this issue.
That said, I wish to make three reservations, mindful of future developments.
Firstly, the EU is not in a position to provide services of general economic interest, and this is increasingly true of services of general interest as well (any exceptions should ideally be based on cooperation between the Member States); legislation on these services should increasingly be at national level, although it should also comply with the rules of the internal market and the principles of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services.
Lastly, I am dismayed that the resolution on this issue calls on the Commission to submit a comprehensive analysis âof the effects of liberalisation to date, in particular on the situation of consumers and the employees affectedâ.
The term âaffectedâ introduces an ideological angle in a context that should be impartial.
Â Â  . The EUâs internal market has already proved successful in liberalising a large number of sectors of its services, which has ultimately benefited European consumers and employees.
In order to give the European economy fresh impetus, however, the EU must make another qualitative leap ahead to complete its internal market and thus to derive maximum benefit from it.
This leap ahead could be made by means of initiatives in the area of services of general interest (SGIs), public services that are not of a commercial nature and that are financed mainly by public funds.
I believe that the precise definition, formulation, organisation and funding of SGIs should rest exclusively with the Member States, reflecting the reality in the Member States and respect for regional and local autonomy.
The provision of SGIs at local, regional and national level has been at variance with Community legislation.
These services occupy a legal grey area at European level, given that it is unclear what rules apply to SGIs â as regards, for example, competition, public competitions and the internal market.
The case law of the European Court of Justice has done little to clear the fog.
I support the report insofar as it promotes a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the implementation of Community law and, on the other, the pursuit of objectives in the public interest in the provision of SGIs.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I have voted, deliberately and with conviction, in favour of the first part of paragraphÂ 69 and against the second, taking as I do the view that the good work done by MrÂ Eurlings and many other Members does in fact amount to an enumeration of issues and situations that militate against Turkish accession, and that is a reason why the negotiations should not have accession as their final objective.
It is for that reason that I have voted against the report as a whole.
We should focus on paragraphÂ 71 by trying to find a way of tying Turkey into the European structures, and we should do the same for other neighbouring countries to which the prospect of Member State status should not be held out and that we do not in any case believe capable of achieving it.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, even though there is no doubt that it has a number of good or interesting points â not least the way it makes clear that Turkey is not ready for Europe and also that it probably never will be â I voted against the Eurlings report, and I did so on the grounds that the Turkish Government is doing nothing more than indulging in window-dressing, in that it has agreed on a few reforms, albeit without implementing them, not to mention the fact that we are not getting any closer to solving certain problems with considerable potential for doing damage, such as the conflict over Cyprus, the Kurdish problem or the acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide.
All these matters should have been resolved long before negotiations started, all the more so in view of the EURÂ 1.3Â billion that the Turks have been given over recent years in pre-accession aid.
I believe it is now time that we did what Europeâs citizens have been doing for some time, and said an honest ânoâ to the accession negotiations.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, many of us abstained from voting on the Eurlings report, and we did so for the following reasons.
We would have voted in favour of this report because, as I said yesterday, it is the most critical report ever adopted in this Parliament on the subject of Turkeyâs behaviour towards the European Union.
Unfortunately, Parliament, by means of its vote, has rejected the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession and, in spite of our vote and that of a number of our fellow Members, has also adopted a provision that implicitly provides for accession as the only outcome of the negotiations.
We disagree on these two points.
Nevertheless, that does not mean that we wanted to oppose the efforts made by MrÂ Eurlings and the Committee on Foreign Affairs. They have sent out a very strong signal on behalf of this Parliament, and that is why we abstained from voting.
Â Â  Mr President, I had originally intended to vote in favour of the Eurlings report today, even though I, as a staunch opponent to Turkeyâs accession, believe that this report overlooks the essence of the matter, but a number of amendments, particularly those on Armenia, prompted me to change my mind during the voting procedure, and so I ended up voting against this report.
What the Eurlings report did do, though, was to prove that the mood in this Parliament and in Europe has shifted in the right direction in the past two years and that we have become more aware of the many points on which Ankara is failing to fulfil the Copenhagen accession criteria.
It was therefore a good thing that the rapporteur reminded us of the Armenian genocide, but todayâs vote is making the Liberals, Greens and Socialists in this Parliament look like fools.
They are so full of human rights and grand principles, but when the chips are down and they are faced with the realities of politics, they fail to deliver.
One can hardly imagine a more selfish attitude.
It appears that not every genocide is entitled to our remembrance.
The same applies to the Cyprus issue, in respect of which many in this House appear to forget that the northern half of that country, with its terrorist regime, has, for over thirty years, been kept under the thumb of Turkey, a country that can never, and indeed should never, become a Member State of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, I too voted against the Eurlings report, because it still works on the premise that Turkeyâs accession remains desirable.
If, though, we were to examine the impressive catalogue of serious problems, we would know better.
Taking out the key clause on the Armenian genocide is a disgrace; the actual effect of it is that we in this House are distancing ourselves from the two resolutions we have adopted on this subject in the past.
It also encourages the Turkish Government to continue to pursue its policy of state-sponsored denial.
In that connection, I should also condemn the lack of stamina shown by the groups on the Left.
The Walloon , for example, withdrew its support for recognition of the Armenian genocide for fear of losing votes among the ever increasing Turkish electorate in Brussels, where elections are to be held in two weeksâ time.
So much for people claiming to uphold grand principles.
Talk about hypocrisy!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I, too, should like to make a statement of vote in relation to the Eurlings report.
Although the report contains many statements that I can endorse, I eventually voted against its adoption on the grounds that I am fundamentally opposed to Turkish membership of the European Union, whilst the report â although it does impose many conditions â does not exclude full Member States status as an objective.
Another reason why I rejected it was that the report does not call for the accession negotiations with Turkey to be suspended with immediate effect.
It is intolerable that we should still be negotiating with a Turkish Government, members of which have recently compared Pope Benedict with Hitler and Mussolini.
It was politicians of Turkish origin who made the most odious statements in response to Pope Benedictâs speech in my own country.
On this issue, though, I shall put my trust in the people of France, assuming as I do that the majority of them will vote against Turkish accession, so that it will not come to pass.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, we, in the UDF, very strongly support MrÂ Eurlingsâs report, because it contains some very powerful truths that must be made known.
Even so, we were obliged to abstain from voting.
Why?
Firstly, precisely because this report seems to rule out the idea of an enhanced partnership acting as an alternative to pure and simple accession.
Well, that is unrealistic, especially because, by rejecting the paragraph on Armenia, this Parliament is sending out an extraordinarily negative signal.
I would point out that, in 2004, we voted in favour of a resolution stating that we were calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide; and that, in 2005, we voted in favour of a resolution stating that we were calling for the recognition of this genocide as a prerequisite for accession.
We have forgotten about all of that today.
What message is being sent out?
The message that this is a Parliament that changes its mind and that forgets about its resolutions.
The message is simple â it consists in saying to the people of Turkey: you need not be in any hurry to change regarding this matter; you may continue to make the very mention of the genocide a crime of opinion; and, when all is said and done, you will not be asked to recognise this genocide.
This is an extremely negative and extremely serious message.
I regret that it has been sent out and that it has prevented us from voting in favour of what is, I might add, an excellent report by MrÂ Eurlings.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, during the debate evaluating Turkeyâs supposed progress towards joining the European Union, and since we approved an important resolution on the Armenian genocide, I have been wondering what we can demand from Turkey other than a clear commitment in this area at last: specifically a commitment to respect human rights and to accept the values on which the European Union is founded.
Instead, todayâs vote has yet again shown the hypocrisy of political correctness, in that it seeks to leave out the need for a clear position statement from the demands that Europe has a duty to put to Turkey's leaders and institutions â the same people who welcomed the Pope's words and forthcoming visit with vulgar, violent language and Mafia-like threats.
Europe just looks on, while their school books still teach Turkish children that the Armenian genocide is a fabrication of history.
People were right to say that we should listen carefully to the criticisms levelled against those who want to rewrite history.
It is disgraceful!
Turkey still refuses to recognise the rights of peoples â not just the Armenians, but the Kurds as well â while Europe remains hypocritically and shamefully silent.
We no longer have a Europe of human rights, but a Europe that could not care less about human rights!
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I voted for the adoption of the Eurlings report in the belief that it was good, critical, and the best report of this kind to have been put before us to date.
I voted for it even though I do not like everything about it.
I do not, for example, like the way this report approaches the Armenian issue.
Let us imagine for a moment that the Holocaust that occurred under Hitlerâs regime were, in Germany, to be always referred to only in inverted commas or described only as the âso-called holocaustâ; that is the way in which the Armenian issue is handled in Turkey.
I voted in favour of the Eurlings report even though a majority backed the inclusion of a clause stating that the objective to be aimed for had to be Turkeyâs full membership of the European Union, an objective of which I am of course not in favour on the grounds that Turkey is neither ready for accession nor willing to comply with our requirements, and because I know â as does everyone else in this House â that the EU cannot afford to have Turkey as a Member State.
I found it easy to vote in favour of this report, for the statements that I did not want to see incorporated, yet which nonetheless have been, and which I have just enumerated, are quite obviously so nonsensical that the report, taken as a whole, nevertheless represents a good reflection of this Houseâs position.
Â Â  . I voted against the Eurlings Report because I remain resolutely opposed to non-European Turkey obtaining membership of the EU.
Those who claim that movement towards membership will induce Turkey into full democratic and human rights compliance are shown, even by the lack of appreciable progress conceded by this report, to be lamentably wrong.
On reform, human rights, religious freedom, Cyprus, Armenia we have obtained nothing, but in return we have wasted, and will continue to waste, millions on pre-accession aid.
Not for the first time, the EU is being taken for a ride.
The EU's lust for endless enlargement is driven by a craving for ego-building world status, which goes hand in hand with the drive for super-statehood through the rejected Constitution.
Turkey's membership, even wider enlargement and the Constitution are all part of the same grand design.
Â Â  . â One year on from the start of accession negotiations with Turkey, the Eurlings report reviews the progress that has been made and the problems that have been encountered.
With the tabling of certain amendments, it has been possible to balance this report so as to take account of the efforts made by Turkey and, at the same time, to highlight areas that remain problematic, such as Turkeyâs failure to sign the Ankara Protocol and the treatment of minorities.
As regards the Armenian genocide, it absolutely must be recognised by Turkey.
This recognition cannot, however, be presented as a prerequisite for accession, in view of the Copenhagen criteria.
As regards the paragraph on the possibility of enhanced cooperation between the EU and Turkey in the event of a breakdown in negotiations, such a move is not appropriate at the moment.
We are in the midst of an ongoing process, and we cannot be pessimistic right from this stage about the conclusion of the negotiations.
With this vote, I want to show the considerable progress that Turkey must make in order to join the European Union, but, in doing so, I do not want to create any further obstacles to its possible accession.
In my opinion, Turkeyâs entry into the EU represents both an opportunity for Turkey and an opportunity for Europe.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, on behalf of the Transnational Radical Party, I voted against the Eurlings report on Turkey, because Parliament is thereby authorising the European Union to shut itself off from the Mediterranean and the Middle East yet again.
Instead of showing its willingness to speed up the process of integrating Turkey into Europe, Parliament is proposing alternative ways to bring Ankara closer to Brussels that have nothing to do with serious accession negotiations.
The European Union must not just shut itself off and focus solely on its Constitution, as President Barroso explained to us a few days ago.
Nor should it pin its hopes on the Popeâs good offices to establish a dialogue with the Islamic world and the Middle East, as the Eurlings report suggests.
Josef Ratzinger is not Javier Solana.
Instead, starting with MrÂ Pannellaâs appeal for peace in the Middle East, we have to revive our federalist and democratic aspirations, so as to create a Europe that can include the largest possible number of people in a political project of freedom, democratic reform and peace.
Â Â  I voted in favour of this report and I support the principle of Turkish accession to the European Union upon completion of the accession negotiations and provided that Turkey meets the necessary standards in terms of human rights, the functioning of the democratic system, respect for minorities and coming to terms with its past.
Â Â  Developments in Turkey are very worrying in a number of areas.
A number of cases in which journalists and authors have been arrested and accused of committing crimes against âTurkishnessâ have been observed.
While these developments are naturally very worrying, Turkeyâs democratic forces and forces sympathetic to reform must not be forgotten.
That is now our task as the EU: to continue to help and support these forces as they set Turkey back on the right road again.
MrÂ Eurlings includes justified criticism of Turkey in his report, but other criticisms of his suggest that Turkey should be handled differently from other candidate countries.
That is unacceptable.
It is important for Turkey to come to terms with its history, including in relation to Armenia.
The issue must not, however, be allowed to determine whether or not the negotiations with Turkey are to continue.
It is important for the EU to feel a sense of responsibility now and not to play into the hands of fundamentalists and reactionaries.
Instead, we need to vote a balanced report through.
We have therefore chosen to vote in favour of paragraphÂ 50 and the amendments that promote a constructive approach to Turkey.
Â Â  I voted against AmendmentÂ 51 from my own group to paragraphÂ 50 of MrÂ Eurlings' report on Turkey's progress towards accession.
I did that with some regret, but the consequence of the amendment passing would have been to delete the reference to the Assyrian community, amongst others.
As someone who has consistently complained that the plight and even existence of the Assyrian community is being ignored in Iraq, it would be hypocritical of me to collude in exactly the same way for the case of Turkey.
I did the same for the other amendments to this paragraph.
Â Â  . â I voted against the Eurlings report because it reflects Europeâs growing hypocrisy regarding Turkey.
In my opinion, Turkey is destined to become a member of the European Union: it has always been part of Europeâs political, economic and cultural past.
Even though it is clear that Turkey still has more work to do in many areas, certain political forces within the Council and Parliament are multiplying the obstacles that Turkey has to overcome.
I, for my part, intend to dissociate myself from these shameful tactics which, at the end of the day, are merely designed to preserve a âChristian Europeâ!
Â Â  . â If you had not incorrectly described Turkey as a European country â which it is not â then you would not be in the position today of having to acknowledge a number of truths.
You tell us today that religious minorities, and Christian minorities in particular, are oppressed in Turkey and that respect for human rights in general, and womenâs rights in particular, is not guaranteed there.
You have discovered that Turkey is still refusing to recognise Cyprus - even though it is a member of this Union that Turkey wants to join â and that it frequently provokes border incidents with another Member State, Greece.
You declare that Turkey is breaching one of the basic principles of the European Union, freedom of movement; and there are many more that could be mentioned.
All that you have to say on the matter is: âlet us continue with the negotiations, but be aware that, at the last minute, we will still be able to say âNoââ.
Who can believe such a tale?
On 3Â December 2005, you had a duty to listen to the people of Europe, the majority of whom were opposed to Turkeyâs joining Europe.
Your duty was to propose to Turkey a privileged partnership that respected our differences, and not this political and diplomatic farce, which is humiliating for both parties and especially for the people of Turkey.
Â Â  The report is a survey of the progress made so far by Turkey regarding its future accession to the EU.
Only one chapter, âScience and Researchâ, has been opened and provisionally closed.
Consequently, there is a long way still to go.
The June List does not see Turkeyâs geographical position or its religion as an obstacle to possible membership of the EU.
We believe that the same accession requirements should be laid down as were laid down in the case of earlier enlargements â neither more nor fewer.
Turkey does not fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, so EU membership is not appropriate as matters stand.
However, it is not only Turkey that has to adapt.
The EUâs agricultural policy and structural funds must be reformed.
A possible future Treaty is another issue that must be discussed before further enlargements of the EU can be carried out, with particular attention being given to the voting strength of each Member State so as to prevent a situation in which a small number of large Member States become able to dominate the whole of the EU.
Both Turkey and the EU have a very long road to travel, politically and economically, before Turkish membership can be an imminent possibility.
If and when that day comes, the June List would, however, welcome Turkey.
We have therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . â I abstained from voting on this report.
The report presented in plenary has the virtue of finally seeing things as they are.
For a very long time, Parliament demonstrated naÃ¯ve optimism on this issue.
This report is more solid than previous reports, but I regret the lack of courage shown by Parliament on the issue of the recognition of the Armenian genocide.
That is why I decided to abstain from the final vote.
For years now, I have been opposed to Turkeyâs joining the European Union, but I would ask for a privileged partnership to be set up with that country.
More MEPs have now adopted this position, which was still very much a minority position a few years ago.
Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States of the European Union â the Republic of Cyprus â and has been occupying it for 30 years!
Turkey does not recognise the Armenian genocide.
Turkey does not approve of freedom of association, and 97% of its territory is situated outside Europe.
Europe has a duty to help this country on the road to democracy, but because of its geography, history and culture, Turkey cannot claim to be part of the European Unionâs political project.
Â Â  . A year on from the opening of negotiations over Turkeyâs accession to the EU, the Turkish authorities have not taken any steps towards recognising Cyprus, an EU Member State.
Turkey also continues its military occupation of the north of that Mediterranean island, in breach of UN resolutions that have been in place for dozens of years.
After a year of negotiations, reports have come to light of a downturn in the economic situation of the Kurdish people and of breaches of the Kurdsâ legitimate political and cultural rights.
News has also come of increased repression by the Turkish police and military in the region.
These two issues alone are indicative of the many questions raised by Turkeyâs accession negotiations.
Its accession is being promoted by the major powers in the EU, since the large economic and financial groups in those countries want to be able to exploit Turkey's economy and resources and to use its geostrategic position for their plans to influence and dominate the Middle East, the Caucasus and Central Asia.
The accession process has also brought to the surface contradictions in the way the major powers share control over the EUâs decision-making process, and has served to deepen the divisions between the ambitions of the major European powers and the USA, in terms of their subordination to, or participation in, North American imperialism.
Â Â  Ever since the Middle Ages Turkey has been a large entity that is beset with problems.
Today the most complicated issue in relation to Turkey is that of the criteria for measuring the countryâs progress.
One chapter of the accession negotiations has been closed, and it has undeniably been a success.
A further 28 chapters remain open, however, without even mentioning the Copenhagen criteria.
There are problems everywhere, including an electoral law that tramples on the freedoms of the citizens, women and national and religious minorities; inadequate infrastructure in the east of the country; tense relations with its neighbours; the employment structure; the manner in which the police and army investigate crime; and the occupation of part of an EU Member State.
The process of implementing new laws will undoubtedly be a long and complicated one.
On the other hand, I personally know a number of well-educated Turks and I know how enthusiastically they welcomed the opening of negotiations with the EU.
Following the adoption of a number of amendments which remove the most urgent problems from the report on Turkeyâs progress towards accession, it is unfortunately not acceptable to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left.
We therefore felt obliged to vote against the adopted wording.
Â Â  . â MrÂ Eurlingsâs report contained some excellent passages, particularly those concerning the Armenian genocide - which the Turkish authorities refuse to acknowledge - the economic blockade imposed on Armenia and the refusal to recognise Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union.
Just one of those elements ought to lead us to the conclusion that the negotiations concerning Turkeyâs accession to the European Union must be stopped.
Not only does the rapporteur not come to this conclusion, but, more importantly, he does not mention the following obvious fact: Turkey is not a European country.
95% of its territory is in Asia; its capital, Ankara, is in the heart of Asia Minor; and, with the Christian communities having been wiped out during the 20th century, 99% of its population belongs to the Muslim world.
Turkey therefore has no reason to join the European Union.
This obvious fact, which is acknowledged by the people of Europe, particularly in France and Austria, is not acknowledged by those who govern us.
This morningâs vote illustrates this divide: not only did the majority of our Parliament vote in favour of Turkeyâs accession, but they also rejected paragraphÂ 49 calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, thus bowing to Turkeyâs wishes.
Â Â  â Despite the fact that the Eurlings report is critical regarding Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, in particular by calling for the recognition of the Armenian genocide, it does not go so far as to call into question this accession.
It is true that the European Commission, MrÂ Chirac and the British, as the main champions of the Ottoman regime, are there to prevent any wayward paths or measures being taken that are likely to delay or prevent accession.
We, for our part, have not changed according to the circumstances and to the fluctuations in the Turkish Government, which blows hot and cold with the negotiators from the European Commission and the main Member States.
We are against Turkeyâs joining the EU as a matter of principle.
Turkey is not a European country and does not meet any of the Copenhagen criteria, which are meant to define a countryâs accession to the European Union.
The negotiations should move in the direction of privileged partner status by maintaining the visa requirement for Turkish nationals, as is the case at present.
Turkey will not join the EU without the people of Europeâs approval.
As defenders of the people of France, we will protect their interests, which hinge, among other things, on the rejection of Turkeyâs accession to Europe.
Â Â  â I have always felt that Turkeyâs entry into the EU could not be considered within the present context of European integration.
I advocate a Europe that is comprised of three circles.
The first circle consists of a federal nucleus, with countries that share ambitious social objectives and the desire for a âpowerful Europeâ, a player on the international stage.
The second circle groups together the existing 27 countries of the EU.
In view of the difficulties and of the crucial need to consolidate this circle, any further enlargement must be ruled out.
The third circle must set up a close, global partnership with neighbouring countries in the Balkans, the Mediterranean and elsewhere.
I would emphasise the importance of close partnerships with the Mediterranean region that treat Turkey and the Maghreb - as areas of the world with which our Europe has forged long-standing and important links â equally.
I therefore abstained from all of the votes except for the one on the recognition of the Armenian genocide, which Parliament has always defended, and I did so to prevent anyone from thinking that I had any reason, in principle, to be prejudiced against Turkey.
This is a different view of Europe.
Â Â  . â We voted against this text. It levels a criticism at Turkey, which, when all is said and done, is very unfair: that of being Turkey, that is to say of not being European.
What is the use of plying this country with recommendations and demands? The people of Europe do not want Turkey to join, because the evidence is right there in front of them: Turkey â and this is not intended as an insult to the country â is not part of the European family.
It has its own culture, its own values and its own sphere of influence.
That is the meaning behind the amendment that we have tabled on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group.
We must now put a stop to the hypocritical and devastating game of accession negotiations, which can only end in a major crisis, since the potential accession treaty has no chance of being ratified by the people, and particularly by the people of France, where the referendum procedure will be obligatory.
Let us spare a thought today for our French fellow Members, who are suffering from a bout of full-blown schizophrenia.
Even though they claim to be against Turkeyâs accession, they vote, each year, in this House and in the French Parliament, in favour of Turkeyâs receiving pre-accession appropriations, and they have welcomed within their own European party â the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â observers from the AKP, the Islamic party led by MrÂ Erdogan.
Â Â  I welcome this report on the accession of Turkey.
The report commends the opening of the active phase of negotiations and the completion of the first chapter of science and technology as well as the resumption of legislative change in Turkey through the ninth package of legislative reform.
Despite welcoming all of these advancements, I regret the fact that Turkey has not fully addressed the Cyprus issue.
The Cyprus issue needs to be settled conclusively before Turkish accession; it is essential that Turkey recognises all Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  Sinn FÃ©in looks forward to Turkey joining the EU, if it decides to do so, on the same basis as other countries did including the respect for human rights, civil government, acceptance of the political rights of the Kurdish population and the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus.
We welcome todayâs decision by the European Parliament to recognise that the resolution of the problem caused by Turkeyâs occupation of part of Cyprus is a major issue which must be dealt with before Turkey can join the EU.
While believing Parliamentâs position fell short of what it should have done on the question of the rights of the KurdishÂ population in Turkey, we are also glad to see the plight of the Kurdish population in Turkey being raised as a key issue in the accession negotiations between Turkey and the EU.
Â Â  . Negotiations with Turkey are in the interest of the Kurds, Armenians, religious minorities and political prisoners.
They are also important to the millions of Europeans of Turkish origin, who will feel confirmed as equal EU citizens as a result.
I hope that those negotiations will eventually lead to a democratic, multi-ethnic and multi-religious Turkey that lives in peace with all its neighbours.
This seems unlikely for the foreseeable future.
Chances are that the negotiations will soon run aground as a result of the delay in Cyprusâ federalisation and the ongoing tensions between Turkey and Cyprus that result from that.
Moreover, there are forces at work within Turkey that persistently refuse to accept equal rights for differing cultures or opinions, and consider any accommodation with the Kurds and Armenians as an attack on Turkeyâs honour.
If Turkey is eventually to accede, it will probably take thirty years of negotiations interspersed with many interruptions.
Anyone who wishes to accelerate this process in order to equip Europe with a larger army or more cheap labour will leave Turkeyâs democratic forces and its disadvantaged people in the lurch.
Accepting an unchanged Turkey will lower the standard of democracy and human rights in Europe and will make the EU even more a cause of public contention.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report despite the endorsement contained therein of full Member States status as the ultimate objective, and, in a roll-call vote, together with the other CDU/CSU MEPs, expressed our repudiation of the idea that Turkey should be a full Member State.
The realistic and critical view taken by the report of the situation in Turkey makes it appropriate that it should be adopted.
It notes that, from the very outset of accession negotiations, Turkey has not by a long way met the Copenhagen criteria in such core areas as human rights and freedom of religion.
It also speaks in plain terms of the failure to come to terms with what happened to the Armenians in Turkey.
It is inconceivable that Turkey should become a Member State of the EU without facing up to the facts of history.
The report also calls for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus issue; if Turkey continues to deny Cyprus recognition, the EU must suspend the accession talks.
Turkish accession would overstretch, and therefore weaken, the EU.
European unification has been a success story so far, and can continue to be one only if the EU remains strong.
A Europe without political or geographical contours is a Europe that the public reject.
Enlargement must not be seen as an automatic process.
We want Turkey to be an important partner alongside the EU, and it is for that reason that we advocate a privileged partnership as an alternative to full membership.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of the Eurlings report on Turkey's progress towards accession to the European Union because I am in favour of Turkey's European prospects.
However, Turkey's leadership should put into practice â and quickly â the undertakings which it made in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria.
The European Parliament is rightly insisting on real compliance by Turkey with European standards and rejects pressure from the Washington/London axis for Ã  la carte concessions, especially for Turkey.
I am especially satisfied because amendments seeking to play down the Cyprus question were rejected and the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left highlighting the need for a policy to resolve the Kurd question were approved.
The Turkish leadership needs to implement the undertakings it has made under a specific roadmap.
It is absurd for a country wishing to join the Union not to respect European principles in practice.
Â Â  . The debate on Turkeyâs possible accession to the EU should take place transparently and clearly and without any blackmail on either side.
Accordingly, it must be made abundantly clear that this needs to be an open process in which the final outcome has not been pre-decided.
Furthermore, it must be acknowledged from the outset that this is not only about Turkey honouring a series of criteria without which accession would be impossible, but also about the EU being in a position to receive and absorb Turkey.
On the other hand, as I noted at the beginning of this negotiation stage, I feel that a negotiation in which one of the parties does not recognise the other in its entirety, as in the case of Turkey towards Cyprus and, by extension, the EU, is a negotiation that has got off on the wrong foot and that suffers from severe shortcomings.
Lastly, this process has a great deal of potential in terms of promoting economic openness, development, democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey and this should not go to waste.
The worst outcome of this process would be a chasm developing between Turkey and the EU.
Â Â  . â Yes, I ended up voting in favour of this report on the accession of Turkey.
I did so with a heavy heart, or something approaching it.
We have confirmed the vote that took place within the Committee on Foreign Affairs on many points: we regret the slowing down of the reforms and highlight the persistent violations in relation to freedom of expression, religious freedom, minority rights, womenâs rights and even cultural rights.
We are very clear as regards the Cyprus question.
We maintain above all that, if accession is the aim of the negotiations, then it will in no circumstances be automatic.
That is why I voted in favour of the amendments to the rapporteurâs text.
Why, then, do I have this huge regret?
Because of the issue of the Armenian genocide, whereby Parliament has blatantly gone back on what it voted for previously.
By yielding to the pressure of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and others, plenary has just taken a step backwards: we are no longer calling on Turkey to recognise the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite for accession.
This is an unacceptable U-turn that sends out what is, in my view, a disastrous signal to the negotiators: Parliament is eating its words, losing its memory and, even more seriously, losing sight of its duty to remember.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome this realistic report, though do think it could have been stronger.
I in principle support Turkeyâs eventual accession provided they have taken reform seriously and faced up to their past.
I do not believe that they have, and it is up to us to keep the pressure up.
On the recognition of the Armenian genocide and on treatment of the Kurds in particular I believe this report could have been more uncompromising, though on balance I support the findings and congratulate our rapporteur on a major piece of work.
Â Â  I have decided to abstain from the final vote on the own-initiative report by Mr Eurlings on Turkey's progress towards accession.
This is because I do not feel that such a report is appropriate or relevant given that the European Commission, which is responsible for following Turkeyâs progress towards accession, has not yet published its report.
The European Commission alone has the competence to judge the progress made by Turkey.
What is more, the Eurlings report struck me as imbalanced.
The efforts that this report requires of Turkey on a number of subjects, including freedom of expression, the rights of minorities and womenâs rights, are of course essential. However, the report gives very little recognition to the advances made by Turkey in the area of the rule of law and respect for human rights.
Since submitting its application, Turkey has been making substantial efforts to comply with the accession criteria; admittedly, there is still much progress to be made, but it is on the right track.
The amendments adopted during the plenary session, in particular those from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament removing the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prior condition to accession, have gone some way to redressing the imbalance of the Eurlings report.
However, I was not completely satisfied by this.
Â Â  Recognising that Turkeyâs accession negotiations will take many years and that substantial reform is needed, there are many elements of the Eurlings report that I can support.
Nevertheless, the report is excessively negative and very unbalanced, particularly in relation to the Cyprus issue, where there is no recognition of Turkish Cypriot support for the Annan Plan or of the EUâs unfulfilled promise to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus.
There is also no call for any constructive movement on the part of the Republic of Cyprus, which is left to determine the pace of Turkeyâs accession negotiations (according to recital B) and whose interests even intrude into NATO, where Turkey is then blamed for making difficulties (paragraph 54).
Furthermore, future enlargement of the EU is specifically linked to the revival of the EU constitutional process, to which I fundamentally object.
