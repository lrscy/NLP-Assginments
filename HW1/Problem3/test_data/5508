Transfer pricing and the shifting of losses are just two of their favourite ways of making sure that profits appear in the accounts at the precise place where the taxman is least inclined to stick his hand in.
Quite apart from this sort of fiscal dumping, the co-existence of tax systems has prompted a competitive approach to cutting tax rates.
The average corporation tax rate, for example, fell by a total of 15 percentage points across the old EU from the end of the 1980s onwards.
One demonstration of the fact that these cuts are not by any means nominal is to be found in a long-term study by the University of Mannheim, according to which the amount of tax effectively paid by the 50 biggest European conglomerates fell from 36% in 1988 to a mere 31% in 2000, which means that billions of euros in public revenue have been given away and wasted.
Bizarrely enough, the European leader of the tax dumping pack â particularly where company taxes are concerned â is neither an Eastern European state nor Ireland, but the Federal Republic of Germany, supposedly a high-tax country, where a tax reform forced through by the former SchrÃ¶der Government â which justified its action by reference to fiscal competition across Europe â brought corporation tax yield to an utter standstill.
Only the harmonisation of taxes across Europe can put a stop to this lunacy, which sees companies making enormous profits while taking less and less of a part in funding the community as a whole and people on average and low incomes â and, via taxes on consumption, even pensioners and the unemployed â ending up having to make good the shortfall.
I do not, however, believe that it is enough to harmonise the tax base.
What we need, as a matter of urgency, is a Europe-wide minimum tax rate for company profits of at least 40%, and on a broad tax base.
Tax dumping is omnipresent, and this is the only way to stop it in its tracks.
Â Â  .
Mr President, one of the principles of good taxation is certainty, both of the bases of assessment and the tax rate.
Yet the only certainty about the proposals to harmonise the base for company tax is that they create uncertainty.
If the negotiations follow the pattern of development of the European company statute, for instance, it will be decades before we have a settled position.
Continuing changes in tax rates and tax rules and the prospect of future changes are bad for business.
In this report, as in early Commission reports on this subject, it is accepted as a matter of faith that the single market must be pursued without question, with the elusive level playing field as the means to achieve it.
If we are to harmonise the base for corporate tax, why insist that tax rates should not be harmonised too?
It does not make sense.
Like Mr Konrad, I suspect that uniform rates are on the future agenda, despite the denials.
There is much to be gained from simplifying tax rules in the individual Member States, particularly the older ones, but this has to be a matter for those Member States.
If the Member States see a need for cross-border cooperation on tax matters, this too should be their concern and not that of the Commission or the European Court of Justice.
My recommendation is leave it alone.
Then the countries that prosper and attract investment will be those with the lowest tax rates and those with the simplest and least bureaucratic methods of assessment and collection.
If taxation is to be made more business friendly, this will be at the initiative of the individual Member States and driven by market forces.
I fear that coercion by the European Union is the wrong way to achieve tax reform.
Â Â  Mr President, it is quite clear to me that the Commissionâs proposal is indisputably an assault upon taxation as an exclusive competence of Member States.
A common tax base would inexorably lead to common tax rates.
By the stealth of this proposal, it is clear that Brussels aspires to replace the nation state as the deciding authority on company taxation.
National control of corporation tax has been a key weapon in the arsenal of many countries in fighting for international investment.
Estonia, with its growth economy, well illustrates the point, as does the experience of the Republic of Ireland.
Thus, harmonisation of tax would rob Member States of the right to adjust their tax regimes to suit their own needs and would bestow across Europe yet another stultifying one-size-fits-all suppression of national initiative.
For economic growth, independence and freedom of action are essential with more, not less, national flexibility.
For example, corporation tax in my area of Northern Ireland should be radically reduced as a means of stimulating investment, thereby moving us away from over-dependence on the public sector.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the subject of our debate today is a single base for taxation, something that is, in principle, surely to be welcomed, certainly from the point of view of small and medium-sized businesses and particularly in terms of making life in a single internal market easier for them.
We cannot always draw a strict distinction between the tax base on the one hand and the tax rate on the other, as the tax base has undoubted effects on the classification of taxes and on the internal balances, and that is something that certainly has to be borne in mind when considering the Commissionâs next steps.
We do not want some sort of approximation of the various tax systems introduced through the back door, and I think the Commission has a vested interest in that not happening if it is to make headway with the Member States.
Finally, I want to say â and I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say this â that we are, without doubt, in favour of fiscal competition.
You need only imagine what would happen if we were to lock the 25 European finance ministers in a room and let them out only when the white smoke had appeared and they had agreed on tax harmonisation; if we were to do that, we would be turning Europe into a high-tax region, and that is not what we want.
Before I sit down, there is just one other point I would like to make, and it is in the form of a question, namely: how do we arrive at a single tax base?
The answer invariably given to that is that we should draw on the international accounting systems.
I do not propose to address the question of whether these systems are good or bad or of how they are implemented, but it is, in any case, a process on which European policy-making has scarcely any influence.
It is all the more extraordinary that politicians should recommend this system as a guide to how to bring in a single tax base.
If this were to be done â and I warn this House, the Council, and the Commission against it â it would mean that policy-makers would have capitulated and surrendered essential competences in this area, and that cannot be the road down which we go.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commissionâs proposal and the proposal in the Bersani report for the introduction of a common base for company tax.
It leads to more transparency, which benefits our economy and employment.
It has to be said, though, the Marks [amp] Spencer dossier, to which reference has already been made, will, whether we like it or not, very quickly lead to the debate turning to tax harmonisation.
I would therefore like to draw Membersâ attention to the amendments that I, together with some forty fellow Members, have tabled, not with a view to harmonising taxes, but in order to introduce a minimum company tax rate.
This amendment allows for fiscal competition between the Member States, but one that is fair, not least to enterprises.
It ensures that sufficient funds are raised to finance our social model and that sufficient funds are left for the government to finance such things as corporate infrastructure.
I would, in this connection, like to quote the Hungarian Social Affairs Minister, Kinga GÃ¶ncz, who takes the view that ever-lower taxes do not fit in the European social model and imperil the social protection funds.
Despite the short-term benefits that they bring, it is possible that they will soon cause us to run out of the funds needed to guarantee prosperity and to implement the social model, and this is something we want to avoid.
We already have minimum capital gains tax, and we want minimum corporate tax tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by clarifying what we are talking about, because, on the basis of a speech by Commissioner McCreevy, it seems to me that his ideas do not coincide with those of Mr KovÃ¡cs, within the Commission itself, and of course do not coincide with those of this Parliament, not even with regard to the subject of the discussion.

What we are talking about now is establishing common rules for defining the tax base.
We are not talking about harmonising or approximating tax rates, which will remain in the hands of the Member States.
Having clarified that, why am I in favour of consolidating the tax base and why do I approve and applaud the report by Mr Bersani?
Firstly, because I believe in an internal market that works.
And in order for an internal market to work, companies that operate throughout the market, multinational companies, cannot be subject to twenty-five different rules when it comes to defining what is taxable income and what is deductible spending.
Secondly, because I am in favour of the European citizen, and the European citizen who wishes to invest his or her savings in a company will be able to judge the assets of companies with more clarity if they are all defined according to the same rules.
Thirdly, because I do not like tax fraud, and I believe that by consolidating the tax base we will be able to eliminate transfer pricing and the location of company operations in those countries that are most permissive in terms of not taking account of an item of spending or being able to deduct an operation.
Finally, because if we say here that we advocate fiscal competition amongst the Member States, competition will be cleaner, more transparent and, if I may say so, more brutal, if the different States apply different rates â the rates they want to apply â to homogenous realities.
Because that will be the only way to calculate it
I would like to end with a warning, Mr President: if we do not do it, as we have done in the case of the code of conduct, the Court of Justice will do it, to the shame of this Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I hope that Parliament, when it votes on MrÂ Bersaniâs excellent report, will give you its strong support for the discussions before you, Commissioner, be it in the Council or within the College of Commissioners itself.
I am aware of how much progress we have made since this matter has been up for discussion and I know that you are considering enhanced cooperation procedures.
Let us hope that we will not be forced to go down that route.
But we think that your approach to this subject and your desire to make real progress are very positive signs.
My second comment would be that taxation can influence the internal market, and all those here who spend their whole time telling us to make the internal market work better should concern themselves with the fact that excessive tax competition can have a fundamental impact, particularly in terms of cross-border effects, on the operation of the internal market.
In a way, this report presents us with a paradox: I hope that we can reach agreement on the BersaniÂ report, but it nevertheless conceals some differences of opinion.
Whether you support tax competition or harmonisation of tax rates, we all need this harmonisation of the tax bases.
So, let us take this first step together, in the knowledge thatÂ -Â as we saw during the expert hearingsÂ -Â there is still much to be done regarding tax rates and that thinking in terms of a range does not completely rule out any competition.
It simply enables us to create healthy, viable conditions for the internal market, in line with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  Mr President, in large measure I am pleased to support Mr Bersaniâs report.
He has been very helpful in agreeing compromises with us in the PPE-DE Group.
I will, however, support a couple of group amendments to delete the last clause of recitalÂ I â regarding unfair tax competition â and paragraphÂ 2, also regarding tax competition.
This proposal has nothing to do with harmonising tax rates.
I want there to be competition between Member States in terms of rates of tax.
However, I believe that a common base for corporate tax will be in the interests of competition between Member States and to the benefit of enterprises in the European single market.
Only with a common tax base will it be possible to compare the relative fiscal advantage of locating or investing in a particular Member State rather than another.
It will put pressure on Member States to provide an attractive tax environment for our businesses and to be efficient and careful in their public spending and budgeting.
Some finance ministers might complain that it could limit their ability to provide particular incentives, for example for research and development.
I would consider these to be consistent with a common tax base so long as they are fully transparent.
They would be no different from varying general rates of corporate tax and should be permitted within clear and simple rules.
I would ask the Commissioner to confirm that such clear and transparent tax incentives would still be permitted under any proposals he brings forward.
With that clear understanding, I am pleased to support and congratulate Mr Bersani on his report.
Â Â  Mr President, one consequence of the lack of a single strategy for tax is that the standard of the stateâs welfare provision at the heart of Europe can no longer be maintained, and this is becoming more and more the prime cause for jobs being moved elsewhere and lost to us.
Harmonising the regulations in trade and tax law relating to the calculation of profits must now be given high priority.
Nowadays, even tax experts can get no overview of what businesses that operate across national borders are actually doing.
The tax bases must be harmonised; the business tax systems must not only be harmonised but must also become transparent and comparable, and fiscal giveaways and special enterprise zones, which have lost any connection with fiscal competition, must become things of the past.
The Council can no longer look on from the political grandstand while we cope with the unhealthy distortions of competition that result, to an ever-increasing extent, from its fiscal policies.
One could just about cope with what Ireland is doing, but Ireland multiplied ten- or twelve-fold would be too much; who, Commissioner, is to foot the bill for this â the workers?
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a misunderstanding in this Chamber if it is believed that it is high tax rates that provide social protection.
That is not the case.
It is growing investment, new jobs and high and increasing tax income that creates social protection.
The European country that has some of the highest corporation tax rates of all, Germany, receives less tax income in relation to the national economy than, for example, Slovakia, which has a low rate of corporation tax but a flat tax rate.
It is not the countries with the low tax rates â which obtain new investment and new jobs â that threaten social protection.
I believe that, in a Europe in which we have 20 million unemployed, there is reason to be self-critical about the way in which our policy has operated.
The fact of the matter is that a tax system that is clear, transparent and predictable creates good basic conditions for investment and new jobs.
We see this in countries that have the highest growth rates in the European economy.
Having a common tax base and a common method for calculating tax does not mean harmonising taxes.
On the contrary, it is good that each country be able to choose the level of corporation tax that best suits that countryâs basic conditions.
It is good that we should have competition.
Transparency is also very much to be desired, so that we see which countries in reality have the high tax rates and which the low ones.
It is not the case that some of the new Member States are dumping their tax, as the former German Chancellor, Gerhard SchrÃ¶der, said they were.
On the contrary, it is those countries that have lots of loopholes and variable and unpredictable tax systems that make things difficult for small enterprises and that prevent new investment.
I therefore support this report and congratulate MrÂ Bersani on a good piece of work.
Â Â  Mr President, as the last of the speakers of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I should obviously like to join in congratulating Mr Bersani on his report, but I should also like to thank a number of shadow rapporteurs and members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the way in which they have handled this issue.
I should also like to join Mr GarcÃ­a-Margallo y Marfil in saying that I am pleased that it is Commissioner KovÃ¡cs who will be handling this dossier, rather than his fellow-Commissioner Mr McCreevy, who paid us a recent visit.
Direct taxes, as we have noticed in this debate, are a subject that stirs up huge emotions and controversy, and it has always been very difficult for this House to reach common positions in that area, not least in the previous part-session.
Even so, I have a feeling that we will succeed this time and I hope that Commissioner KovÃ¡cs, will also succeed in reaching agreement with the Council or at any rate with a large number of Member States.
I am pleased that common sense will prevail over ideological sabre rattling.
Common sense also obliges me to consider the modest role that the European Union plays in this.
I want to dissociate myself completely from the comment that was made earlier, among others of the kind, about Brussels taking power away from the Member States.
I think it is quite simply necessary in this area to guarantee an internal market and a level playing field and to ensure that these are not disrupted, along with the simplicity and certainty that will allow enterprises to operate in the European Union.
It is not without reason that the call for this common consolidated foundation originates from the entrepreneurial ; it comes, without exception, from companies, including UNICE and the Round Table.
This has nothing to do with seizing power at European level.
It is simply about accommodating the wishes of industry.
I think it is important to consider what the win-win situation can be.
If everyone is clear what foundations we are working from, then enterprises will have a smaller administrative burden and governments will not need to compete for rates indiscriminately.
Many of the new countries enjoy low tax rates, while also basing them very broadly.
I therefore think that the solution to this process of harmonising the tax base lies in bringing rates much closer together than they are at present, and we need that kind of transparency.
The discussion as to what will happen subsequently, also about possible minimum rates or forks or whatever, will not be held until later.
For now, it is crucial to make this first step, and I can tell Commissioner KovÃ¡cs that he can count on our support.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all let me say that it seems there is no more a case for harmonising corporate tax rates or bases than there is for harmonising property taxes, wealth taxes or capital gains tax.
Firstly, a common consolidated tax base cuts across national sovereignty and subsidiarity.
Secondly, the Commission maintains that it is not trying to harmonise tax rates, but how is it possible to separate the issue of tax base from the issue of tax rate?
Would the harmonisation of the base not lead to a harmonisation of the rate?
Some colleagues may have confused harmonisation of the tax base with the harmonisation of company accounts and requirements for transparency between companies and their accounts.
This is erroneous.
Accounts can, of course, be harmonised, but harmonised accounts can then be adjusted for tax purposes in Member States and that is an issue for Member States.
Thirdly, the European Commissionâs proposal for corporate tax harmonisation is based on the assumption that harmful tax competition results in a shift in taxation away from taxes on mobile capital and towards taxes on comparatively immobile labour and that this development is harmful for employment and ordinary EU citizens.
This assumption is open to question in my view.
Whilst there has been a downward trend in corporate tax rates in some Member States, this has been accompanied by both a widening of corporate tax bases and an improvement in the underlying company profitability.
In my own country, for example, the lower tax rate has meant a multiplication of the tax take.
We went up from EURÂ 385Â million in 1996 to a EURÂ 5Â 707Â million take in 2004.
Finally, let us not forget that the Lisbon Agenda is about making the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2015.
Paving the way for minimum tax rates or corporate tax plans will not prevent companies from looking outside the EU for more competitive rates.
Â Â  âIt is widely accepted that the current state of the EU economy is in part due to the fundamental problem of a lack of competitiveness in comparison with advanced countries such as the United States.
Tax competition has a considerable effect on the state of the European economy, and this is currently reflected most noticeably in the low economic growth recorded by some of the older and larger Member States, as against the more rapid growth of the majority of new Member States that are implementing vigorous structural reforms, including tax reforms.
The lack of political will for implementing structural reforms is often brushed over by accusing new Member States of tax dumping and then claiming a need to address any imbalance by harmonising direct taxes.
This debate on corporate tax base harmonisation is a consequence of such efforts.
The argument that tax base harmonisation will have no impact on tax rates and therefore no direct impact on tax competition is not entirely correct.
The tax base and tax rate are to some extent interrelated, depending on the breadth of the harmonised tax base and the scope of exclusions and deductibles.
For instance, taking the present German model as the basis, Slovakia would be forced under current circumstances to increase its tax rate in order to maintain current tax inflows.
On the other hand, I understand the argument that tax base harmonisation should lead to greater transparency among the individual systems in the European Union, providing for simpler comparison between individual countries.
A reduction in transaction costs for businesses and in the number of court disputes would also constitute considerable advantages.
Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission should consider carefully all of these arguments in respect of the tax base harmonisation proposal in order to maintain an appropriate degree of tax competition between Member States as a necessary prerequisite for increasing the overall competitiveness of the European Union.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have listened to the Houseâs debate with great interest and I am impressed not only by its knowledge but also by its enthusiasm for and interest in the subject.
As I said earlier, I am pleased that the draft report is so supportive of Commission policy on the common consolidated corporate tax base.
I should like to comment on the proposed amendments.
Mr Konradâs proposals do not pose any problem for the Commission, so we support them.
However, the Commission does not support the amendments that deal with a possible minimum tax rate and the common consolidated corporate tax base as an instrument for bringing tax rates more closely together.
The Commission has no intention of limiting fair competition and harmonising the tax base.
It just wants to increase the transparency of the tax burden.
Tax rates should remain within the competence of the Member States.
If we were to favour a minimum rate, I suspect we would lose valuable support from both Member States and business, which will, after all, be the major beneficiaries of a common consolidated corporate tax base.
As they benefit, so will consumers through the general economic benefits.
I appreciate the amendment concerning research and development and acknowledge that this is an important subject.
Nevertheless, it is not an amendment that the Commission would welcome, as the fiscal treatment of research and development is just one of the issues that we will be discussing as part of our work.
I believe it would be wrong to highlight it in this way.
I will say no more at this stage.
I welcome the European Parliamentâs interest in the subject and I look forward to learning the outcome of the vote on the report.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0366/2005) by MrsÂ Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and the Council on the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All (2007) â Towards a Just Society [COM(2005)0225 â C6-0178/2005 â 2005/0107(COD)].
Â Â  .
Mr President, the European Union can be proud of its achievements in the field of non-discrimination, which place it amongst the most advanced regions in the world in this respect.
In 2000, we adopted two key directives: one which outlaws racial discrimination, and another that bans direct and indirect discrimination in employment on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
However, legislation alone is not enough to counter discrimination effectively.
Many Member States are falling behind with their transposition schedules, and where national legislation complies with the European directives, it is unfamiliar to the general public and not properly implemented.
The Commission has therefore proposed, inter alia, to declare 2007 the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
It is intended to make the public aware of the benefits of a just society that offers everybody the same opportunities, irrespective of sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, capacity, age or sexual orientation.
It will highlight the benefits of diversity as a source of social and economic vitality, which Europe must acknowledge and make use of.
This diversity enriches the social fabric of Europe and is a vital component of its economic prosperity.
The discussions and activities during the year will be organised around three main topics.
Firstly, the right to equality and protection against discrimination.
A key element will be to make the general public aware of the fact that equal treatment does not necessarily mean identical treatment, but that, sometimes, different treatment is required in different situations.
Secondly, recognition of the positive contribution that everybody, whatever their personal characteristics, makes to society.
The aim will be to make the public aware of the rewards and advantages accruing in Europe through diversity.
Thirdly, better representation in society of disadvantaged groups: a debate will be initiated on ways to rectify the under-representation and under-participation of certain groups in society.
Fourthly, respect and tolerance and among the various communities that make up European society.
Civil society and the social partners will be fully involved in implementing the European Year.
One of the key principles of implementing the Year will be that activities will be decentralised at Member State level.
To get this message across effectively, the Year must be implemented as closely as possible to the citizens.
Finally, it must be ensured that, during the Year and in all the Member States, equal importance is attached to all the grounds for discrimination set out under ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty, namely discrimination based on sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, there are no institutional barriers separating one group from another, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from demonstrating their worth and being rewarded for it.
Specific systems, in the form of examinations and competitions leading to qualifications, have been set up to assess the aptitude of each individual.
Access to the highest offices is, in principle, open to all, without distinction.
However, although people are equal in the eyes of the law, they are not always equal in reality.
At the very least, we do not seem to have achieved equality of opportunity.
Despite a few examples of spectacular social advancement, cited with particular smugness given that they are such exceptional cases, people do not have equal chances of success, and a society that does not allow all its members to demonstrate their capabilities harbours the seeds of serious frustrations and tensions.
Neither effectiveness nor justice benefit from this state of affairs.
If that is indeed the situation, around two centuries after the publication of the Declaration on the Rights of Man, we need to understand why.
Should we conclude that we have no prospect of success?
Are our democratic principles merely a mirage, an ideal that recedes as fast as we can approach it?
We refuse to accept this.
It is true that inequalities tend to mount up.
The children of poor families are, on average, less likely to reach a high level of education.
People with a poor level of education are less likely to achieve a high social standing or to have a well-paid career.
The number of women in high-level positions, of whatever kind, is still very limited, if not infinitesimal.
Power still remains, in general, the privilege of men.
Disabled people still do not have the right to a proper place in our societies.
Homosexuals still suffer discrimination far too often, and some still consider this to be a normal state of affairs.
Many men, women and children are left by the wayside because of their skin colour or ethnic origin.
Do we have the right to put up with this situation?
Do we have the right to conclude that nothing can be done to bring reality closer to the democratic ideal?
The obstacles may seem huge, an inherent part of society itself.
But denying their existence will not help us to overcome them.
We need to face the facts and condemn them.
For example, discrimination often forces people into unskilled labour and insecure jobs that almost always provide poor pay and therefore a poor standard of living.
People suffering such discrimination find it very difficult to access decent accommodation and healthcare.
They have virtually no chance of promotion via continuing vocational training, and they have few leisure opportunities.
Under such conditions, their childrenâs education is mortgaged right from the start.
They are deprived of the material conditions, relationships and emotional environment that they need in order to plan their lives.
And there is a considerable risk that they will end up in the same situation as their parents.
In short, one disadvantage engenders another.
Someone who suffers from one aspect of the effects of social inequality is at serious risk of suffering from other aspects.
Although we can intuitively recognise this phenomenon of the accumulation of disadvantages, it has not yet been extensively studied.
I would therefore like to call on the Council and the Commission to make a firm commitment to combat all forms of discrimination in all countries of the Union, particularly as part of the Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
We want you to make a firm commitment, Commissioner.
We listened to what you had to say just now.
We were happy with it, but you will understand that we will be keeping a close eye on how it is put into practice, and I will conclude by reminding you that, on 28Â AugustÂ 1963, in Washington, in his famous speech âI have a dreamâ, Martin Luther King evocatively expressed the hope, the dream of a world of freedom and justice for all.
âI have a dreamâ, he said, âthat my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their characterâ.
Let us have a common dream that, by the end of the decade, we will finally have a Union without discrimination, a Union that gives every child a chance.
Let us have a common dream, Commissioner.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking MrsÂ Roure for her work on this report.
The European Union has made a commitment to promoting basic rights and equal opportunities for all.
We have some of the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the world.
But ask yourself this: are our fellow citizens aware of the European anti-discrimination directives?
Do they know that all the Member States are obliged to transpose those directives into their national legislation?
Unfortunately, I think the answer is no.
That is why the initiative of launching the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All is a very constructive one.
A media event on this scale is an effective method of increasing awareness and providing information.
Equality of opportunity is a policy involving specific measures that aim to help the disadvantaged by establishing fair access to rights, goods and services.
For equality to become a reality, we need to combat all types of discrimination.
Every day, men and women suffer discrimination when they try to access jobs and services, particularly due to their sex, their origin or their religion.
That is unacceptable, and we cannot continue to tolerate such practices.
The activities that the EU will support inÂ 2007 and the awareness and demonstration campaigns are a step in the right direction.
It is also vital to have a real political will for this, and all the Member States must join forces, without exception.
Full implementation of our anti-discrimination legislation therefore remains a top priority.
It is distressing to see that certain Member States have been condemned for not having correctly transposed the European directives in this field.
Tomorrow, Parliament must send a strong message to our fellow citizens by adopting this report by a large majority.
The fight against discrimination is not just fought by the left or by the right.
It is fought by men and women of conviction with a common objective: fighting for respect for human rights and, more specifically, against discrimination of all kinds.

Â Â  The key message of the European Parliament in response to the proposal of the Commission is to fight against all forms of discrimination, and this is why I am particularly pleased to congratulate Mrs Martine Roure on this report.
I would like to emphasise that the equality of opportunities â as the first human right formulated by the European Union â is a horizontal area stretching across all sectors.
Therefore the enforcement of equal opportunities cannot be of utmost priority for Parliament only, but also for the EU, and for all government bodies of the Member States.
I particularly welcome that President Borrell has set up the high-level Committee on Equal Opportunities, and I am proud to work as one of its members.
I would like to call attention to a recently published important work of the Committee, which mentions the benefits arising from applying the principles of diversity when a workplace interviews and employs its workforce.
Workplaces that implement such a policy, companies that take into account cultural diversity are more competitive in the long term, and in some cases also experience increased efficiency in the short or medium term.
Therefore equal opportunities are not an obstacle to the increase of economic competitiveness, but act as a strengthening factor.
I would also like to stress the individual responsibility of Member States in preparing for the Year of Equal Opportunities, and would like to propose a number of initiatives myself.
I have organised the first public Parliamentary hearing in Hungary, which will take place next week, when participating citizens will talk about their personal experiences to illustrate the discrimination they have suffered.
A blind girl who has not been admitted to university because of her blindness, and a young Roma man will talk about their lives.
I would like to make this customary in Hungary, and to introduce in my country the personal hearings that we experience here.
Â Â  .
Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for all the good work she has done: it was not an easy task.
The Year of Equal Opportunities for All is very welcome because fundamental rights are the close to the hearts of the European citizens and they must be made a reality for all citizens.
Against this backdrop there are two issues I would like to raise.
First, there is the budget.
I think that everybody in this room will agree that it is embarrassingly insufficient â EURÂ 15 million for fundamental rights!
If I compare that to the money we spend on a lot of other things that are less valuable than fundamental rights, I have to say it gives me stomach pains.
The second issue is decentralised implementation.
That is very good, but I am rather worried about the possibility of cherry-picking by the Member States.
I am not entirely reassured by all the warm words we have heard in recent years about fundamental rights, because the reality is different and the Commissioner himself mentioned that some Member States are still lagging behind in the implementation of anti-discrimination legislation.
There is still a hierarchy of discrimination and I think that with this programme for the Year of Equal Opportunities for All we should not be encouraging this.
I would like to ask the Commissioner to commit the Commission here and now, publicly and on the record, to ensuring that Member States will use the funds available for this Year to target all forms of discrimination equally.
This is not to say anything about the way the money is distributed, but we want certain â let us say â more âawkwardâ groups that are currently suffering discrimination â homosexuals, certain reglious groups or the Roma, for example â to have equal access to this programme with all the other groups that are suffering discrimination.
I am looking forward to a positive answer.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for her work, and I appreciate the need for maximum preparation time if the Year of Equal Opportunities is going to have any meaningful impact.
That constricted timing has meant that there are one or two areas, as my colleague has just indicated, where we might have liked to tighten things up a little more but have not been able to.
We all hope that the Year will provide an incentive to those Member States that are being particularly tardy on implementing the ArticleÂ 13 Directives to make progress.
Those directives reflect the more positive dimension of the European Union and people need to be aware of their rights.
As we have seen on issues such as the Working Time Directive, people all too often do not realise that they have rights, let alone that they can enforce them.
I agree with Mrs Roure that equal opportunities are an important factor in social inclusion and that we need to combat bigotry and prejudice at all levels, whether that is on the street or in government, as it prevents so many people from reaching their potential and prevents society benefiting from their talents.
I also echo the comments made about the money being totally inadequate.
When you think about the amount that we, as political parties, spend on our election campaigns to try and persuade people of something different, it is going to take more than the money in the current budget to persuade people that others in their society have rights which should be recognised as well.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I too would like to commend the rapporteur for her work in this very important area and to lend my voice to support the call for designation of 2007 as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
We must commit ourselves not just to the concept of equality of opportunity, but equally and crucially to the attainment of equality of outcome.
All people should be entitled to their full social, economic and cultural equality.
This, of course, encompasses the equality of all people, irrespective of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, marital or family status, sexual orientation, disability, socio-economic status or indeed political or religious affiliations.
If we are serious about the attainment of equality, we must, on an ongoing basis, not only guarantee equality of opportunity across those categories, but we must be in a position to measure accurately and adequately outcomes as against each of those categories.
We all know that societal inequality is not a natural phenomenon; it is the direct result of power inequalities, and so to address inequality itself, we have to address issues of power in our society, we have to challenge the way things are.
I think 2007 as the Year of Equal Opportunities for All can become a platform for just that.
I also think that the very fact that this initiative is being suggested is an explicit recognition that we have failed so far in our journey towards equality.
In my own country of Ireland, we are still coming to terms with the legacy of British rule and the continuing partition of our country, along with decades of discrimination in the electoral process, in housing, employment and policing.
Celtic Tiger Ireland should be a success story for all the Irish people, and yet we remain one of the most unequal societies not just in the EU but in fact globally.
The Roure reportâs focus on both migrants and women is commendable and particularly relevant again to my home country.
The European Year must be about much more than raising awareness simply about discrimination.
Equality legislation alone will not succeed in tackling the deep-rooted inequalities that exist without the political will of politicians, of policymakers and others to grasp the nettle and comprehensively tackle discrimination.
To that end, may I finish by echoing Mrs Roureâs call for both the Commission and the Council to put their money where their mouth is as regards tackling inequality across the Union.
Â Â  2007 is a very important year for the issues to be resolved in the area of equal opportunities and the implementation of equal opportunities throughout the European Union.
Equality of opportunity forms the basis of the common European system of values, and its implementation will promote the enforcement of basic human rights.
This report, which is being prepared with a codecision procedure, addresses all areas of implementation â from the creation of the legislation framework to the definition of financial means â including possibilities of participation of Member States and civil organisations.
My honourable colleague Martine Roure has done a considerable amount of work.
The most important thing is to apply the regulations already approved and accepted, and to make sure that those affected are aware of the laws enacted in their interest.
Therefore we need action, not words.
It is not sufficient to implement the principle of equal opportunities at Community level â we must make sure that everybody is aware of the fact that all citizens, regardless of their sex, race or ethnic origin, religion or views, disability, age and sexual orientation, are entitled to equal opportunities and equal treatment.
Continuous information, education, cooperation with civil organisations and European citizens are important.
We need campaigns that win over public opinion, and lively social dialogue.
A social Europe is inconceivable without the protection of vulnerable social strata and groups that are most exposed to discrimination.
Discrimination or exclusion has a hundred faces: it can be based on race, ethnic origin, religion, age group, sex, physical and mental disabilities.
Everybody plays a role in the implementation of equal opportunities, from government bodies to national authorities, from the civil society to individual European citizens.
Solidarity is the most appropriate and the most expedient approach to the fight for equal opportunities.
We are all responsible to ensure that every person has equal opportunities to achieve their potential in any area of life.
In my amendments I also emphasised that we must make every effort to implement equality, not only at Community and individual levels, but also at regional, national and local levels.
I propose that the report be accepted.
Â Â  Mr President, like other speakers, I agree with the Commissioner that the EU must have one of the most advanced legislative frameworks to combat discrimination.
Therefore, I appreciate that Parliamentâs amendments to the Commission proposal enforce the demand that the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All should speed up the transposition process of the two anti-discrimination directives, for which I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roure.
I have to say, with regret, that my country, Latvia, is among those states that are delaying transposition.
New Member States have to be subject to infringement proceedings for violations of Community law in the same way as the old Member States.
In that context, NGOs have a vital role to play in raising awareness.
The Commission should ensure that especially NGOs representing the groups that suffer discrimination are involved at all stages of the work in connection with the European Year.
I hope that the Commissioner will also agree with this.
Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all I would like to express my thanks to the honourable Members for the support voiced in this debate.
I would like to underline that the Commission shares your commitment to fighting forms of discrimination in Member States.
The Commission is prepared to urge all Member States to allocate the financial resources accordingly.
Generally speaking, the Commission accepts all the amendments proposed by Parliament.
I will not go through them individually, but will concentrate on the key issues.
We support the amendments aimed at reinforcing the involvement of civil society and the implementation of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
This will be a key factor in its success.
We can accept the increased references to gender mainstreaming.
We are fully in agreement with the fact that, during the Year, Member States should attach equal importance to all the grounds for discrimination set out under ArticleÂ 13 of the Treaty, namely discrimination based on sex, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
It is acceptable to set up a simplified system for administrative management of the funds at national level, as proposed.
We agree to the increase in the budget from EURÂ 13.6Â million to EURÂ 15Â million.
To sum up, the Commission can accept all the amendments proposed.
I conclude by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, whose commitment to non-discrimination issues was instrumental in bringing the negotiations with the Member States to a successful conclusion.
These went very quickly and were very rewarding.
The text, which is submitted for your final approval, reinforces the Commissionâs initial position and gives us the means to take action in favour of diversity throughout the European Union.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on International Tradeâs draftsman, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, who is on Hong Kong with virtually all the other members of the committee apart from me.
I am the only one left here.
The Commission has requested urgency for an increase in commitment appropriations to Georgia for 2006-2007, to the sum of EURÂ 10.5Â million.
The Commission has already come to us asking for urgency at a very late date, on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Frankly, if we were dealing only with the issue of the Commission, we would say ânoâ to urgency, but in this case the people who would lose out are the people of Georgia.
It has taken the Commission 10Â months to carry out an impact assessment, without even warning Parliament that the issue might be on the agenda.
However, we welcome the âvelvet revolutionâ.
We recognise that the Georgians need increased help.
On that basis we will support urgency, but warn the Commission that, if it tries to do this again, we may have reached the limit of our tolerance.
Â Â  If we approve this, the consequence will be that it will be debated on Wednesday evening, with an opportunity to table amendments tomorrow â which is Wednesday â until 10 in the morning, and the vote on the report itself would be on Thursday.
We have now heard one intervention in favour of that, and now is the opportunity for someone to speak against it.
Â Â  Mr President, this is not actually an intervention in favour, but just an expression of the opinion of my committee, which is in favour.
I would just ask, further to what Mr Ford said, that the Commission and the Council be urged, when moving urgency debates, not only to explain why they are matters of urgency, but also why the motion for an urgency debate is being tabled only now.
The situation really does need to be avoided in which a considerable period of time goes by before a motion for an urgency debate is tabled, without, perhaps, it being necessary.
Perhaps you or the Bureau might ask the Commission and the Council to justify this practice.

Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
â the report (A6-0396/2005) by Mr Pitella and Mr Dombrovskis on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 as modified by the Council (all sections) (14864/2005 â C6Â 0415/2005 â 2005/2001(BUD)) and Letters of amendment Nos 1/2005 (14862/2005 â C6-0413/2005), 2/2005 (14863/2005 â C6Â 0414/2005), 3/2005 (00000/2005 â C6Â 0000/2005) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006,
â the report (A6-0395/2005) by Mr BÃ¶ge on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in favour of the European Union's external actions according to point 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 COM(2005)0278 â C6-0211/2005 â 2005/2137(ACI)) and
â the report (A6-0397/2005) by Mr Garriga Polledo on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on draft amending budget No 8/2005 of the European Union for the financial year 2005 (14861/2005 â C6-0412/2005 â 2005/2179(BUD)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, we have concluded the budgetary procedure with a success.
It is a success for everyone but, if I may say so, it is above all a success for Parliament, which has been able to fight for its political priorities.
I should like to thank all the political groups, all my fellow Members, the committee Chairman and secretariat, and all those whose competence and generosity have helped to bring the procedure to a successful conclusion.
The outcome speaks for itself.
We had asked for a decent level of payments in line with strict control over spending but also with the need to have sufficient funds available to carry out the Unionâs essential policies.
We have achieved a budget of EURÂ 112 billion and a joint declaration that an amending budget will be put forward, particularly for the Structural Funds, if spending picks up in the new Member States, as we think it will.
We had asked for the budget lines for growth, competitiveness, education, research, small and medium-sized enterprises, and youth, environmental and cultural policies to be prioritised, and we have achieved renegotiated sums for a good half-dozen codecided programmes and the allocation of EURÂ 100 million in additional resources.
I feel particularly pleased that we have achieved our aim of sending out a strong political message to the youth of Europe through the reinforcement of the Socrates, YOUTH and Leonardo programmes.
We had asked the Council to reflect on the inadequacy of the Berlin spending levels for external actions, and we provided indisputable evidence in that regard.
We reminded it of the solemn commitments made by the Heads of State or Government on issues such as Iraq, the tsunami, sugar and Afghanistan, to which Parliament intends to make its own contribution, without, however, sacrificing geographical programmes, humanitarian actions, essential initiatives on human rights and democracy, and inclusive development actions.
What we have achieved is that for the first time we have broken through the fateful EURÂ 200 million ceiling for flexibility in external actions.
Let me be quite clear: having an extra EURÂ 275 million available for external actions and a protocol that better acknowledges Parliamentâs competence in foreign and security policy is not a trophy for us to show off but a necessary response, a decision warranted by everything that we, together, are expected to do in the world.
We are also pleased on other, more general grounds.
In recent years the European Union has gained historic prominence; it has made and maintained peace on its soil; it has brought down borders without resorting to the use of force; it has proposed its values without imposing them; and it has promoted growth and cohesion in an often troubled and unstable world.
Today we are experiencing a profound crisis in the European project, but it is not an irreversible crisis.
As Henri de Saint-Simon wrote, at such times what is needed is a force able to unite desires, to focus movements and to make interests mutual and commitments firm.
Our political project was rocked by blustery winds back in the 1980s as well; despite the impending storm, however, strong political leadership enabled us to weather the elements and emerge even stronger than before.
None of us is pretending to be a new FranÃ§ois Mitterrand or a new Helmut Kohl but, if we cast aside selfish attitudes and if we adjust national budgetary priorities to the priorities of our European duties, we shall, all together, be able to stop the European project from drifting and crumbling.
The right response to a downturn is a change of course and, after our setbacks, we have together scored a positive point this week â we have put the ball in the net â with the annual budget.
As Minister Lewis and Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ know, we could have used the annual budget for leverage on the financial perspective, but we did not want to do so because we have a sense of responsibility and realise that the European Union does not need conflict among the institutions.
The Council should understand, however, that it cannot offer us a tiny little Europe; nor can it think that the European Parliament will settle for miserly compromises that mark the end of the European dream.
The European Parliament has made an important contribution to the debate on the budget for 2007-2013 in the excellent BÃ¶ge report, which has so far been unfairly ignored.
The proposal from the UK Presidency, on the other hand, I am sorry to say, is unacceptable because it is the exact opposite of the worthy project that MrÂ Blair himself set out before Parliament, in that it releases the Member States from their duties towards Europe and gives out little sweeteners here and there, without setting a process of budgetary reform in motion or providing the Union with greater financial leeway.
It is not just a case of Robin Hood in reverse, as somebody suggested: there is also the danger, which I should like to avert, that we shall be responsible for burying any hope of a European revival.
With the annual budget, however, we are making a positive response, and for that I am also grateful to Minister Lewis and Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ.
We remain convinced that, at a time of uncertainties and concerns, the empowerment of Europeâs financial conscience is the only basis for fruitful and confident European integration.
Â Â  Perhaps I might also point out that it is made very clear in the relevant paragraph of the Inter-Institutional Agreement that the use of the flexibility instrument this year would have yielded up to us easily more than EURÂ 400 million, if we had adhered strictly to the wording of the Agreement.
That being so, agreement to EURÂ 275 million for the use of flexibility also amounts to mutual , and I ask the House to vote to adopt this report on the use of the flexibility instrument in relation to the 2006 Budget in its present form.
I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that this House did, in the course of negotiations on the Financial Perspective, make a proposal as to how we might in future take a more flexible approach, albeit one based strictly on budgetary discipline, and also observe that it is not only the issue of a globalisation fund that is on the agenda, but that we also have to respond much more rapidly and consistently in many important categories of European Budget policy.
This House made it perfectly clear, on 8 June, that its negotiating position on this is in fact not itself subject to negotiation.
Let me add in conclusion that, for the British Prime Minister Mr Blair, as President-in-Office of the Council, to say, on the subject of the negotiations on the Financial Perspective, that either there is a deal in December or there will be no more agreement under the Austrian or Finnish presidencies, is for him to threaten a blockade.
I note with satisfaction that, in interviews, he adduces Parliament as what one might call an argument, along the lines of: if the Council will not come to an agreement, then the decision on the budget will have to pass to Parliament.
I can tell him that Parliament is ready for it.
Â Â  . Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this year we are once again debating the Community budget at second reading.
It is my duty to present amending budget No 8.
As in other years, as we Members of this Parliament well know, we are facing the same budgetary problems relating to execution and political representativeness.
With regard to the 2005 budget alone, 10% of payment appropriations have not been able to be used, appropriations that you, ladies and gentlemen, voted for in December of last year.
Furthermore, we are going to have to return EUR 3Â 800 million to the Member States, since it has not been possible to commit that money in the decisions that we MEPs had voted for.
It is difficult to establish the extent to which the European Commission, the Member States or this Parliament are responsible for this situation, which is repeated year after year.
We in this Parliament vote every year for budgetary appropriations in accordance with our own political debate and the interests that we believe our electors bring to this Chamber, and that is why we are here.
We vote according to what we believe are the Unionâs interests, in terms of foreign policy, internal policy and the Structural Funds.
We must acknowledge that the European Commission makes more effort every year to better implement policies, the budgetary mandates that we are given as European parliamentarians.
And we are aware that the Member States make an effort year after year both in order to fund the budget and in order to implement Community policies.
But it can be deduced from the execution figure every year that something is still failing in the process of budgetary allocation of the appropriations that we vote for and in their final application, both in the Member States and in Community programmes.
Amending budget No 8, which I am presenting for your approval, includes, amongst other things, returning EUR 3Â 800 million to the Member States.
We know that this is good news for the Finance Ministers of the Member States, since this is a sum that they do not have to incorporate into the Community budget in order to fund the 2005 financial year.
Nevertheless, from a European point of view, it is not good news, because the saving results from a very significant under-execution in payment appropriations corresponding to the Structural Funds.
During the 2005 budgetary procedure, we agreed with the Council a significant reduction in the Structural Funds, below our first reading of the budget, and also below the preliminary draft budget presented by the Commission.
We also agreed a joint statement with the other two institutions, in which the Council committed itself to presenting an amending budget which would include the payment appropriations necessary to pay Structural Funds, in the event that the execution was as expected.
During October, the European Commission presented us with a first draft of amending budget No 8, which talked about certain real budgetary needs; it also talked about EUR 600 million in Structural Funds, which should have been included in the Community budget.
In the end, none of that happened.
During November, the Commission altered its figures on the basis of the news about budgetary execution reaching it from the Member States and, in the end, what were funding requirements have been turned into surpluses.
Even with this return of EUR 3Â 800 million, there could be a surplus of payment appropriations in the Structural Funds at the end of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, we can only interpret this as a bad thing.
It is bad news, both for the 2006 budget of MrÂ Pittella, and for the negotiation of the financial perspective.
The Unionâs budget can never be drawn up solely according to the principle of saving, but rather according to the principle of effectiveness and European added value.
Mr President, where is the European added value in returning payment appropriations to the Finance Ministers year after year?
This is not a good way to produce a Community budget or to build a truly effective Europe.
The political message we are sending to the European citizens every year is very disappointing.
Commissioner, representatives of the Council, when this Parliament votes for budgetary appropriations, it does so with the hope and desire that they are correctly executed by everybody.
I believe that this is the lesson that we must learn this year, and let us hope that the execution is better during 2006.
Â Â  . Mr President, it is an honour and a privilege to be back in this Chamber to represent the Presidency of the Council in this important debate on the budget of the European Communities for 2006.
The European Parliamentâs second reading of the annual budget, culminating in the vote on Thursday, is a key part of the European Union calendar and is probably more important this year than ever before.
The agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation on the main elements of the 2006 budget was reached in the end in the best spirit of cooperation and compromise.
By putting that agreement into effect in the adopted budget, the European Parliament has the opportunity to send a clear signal to the people of Europe that, despite the challenges we face over the Constitution and future financing, the European Union is still operating effectively and in their best interest.
I do not need to remind honourable Members of the historical importance of this budgetary procedure.
They will be acutely aware that the last procedure under the current financial perspective has a special role in bridging past priorities and future objectives to provide a measure of continuity and the basis for coherence between two financial perspectives.
I believe the agreement we reached in Brussels two weeks ago broadly satisfies those objectives. But it does something more than that.
The difficulty of reconciling our policy priorities with the core principles of budget discipline and sound financial management highlights the fact that the current budget structures are stretched to breaking point.
The next financial perspective must offer the prospect of real reform and renewal in the future if the EC budget is to remain relevant and genuinely meet the needs and expectations of European citizens in the 21st century.
It will not be easy, but if the two arms of the budgetary authority â the Parliament and the Council, which I represent today â can build on the spirit of cooperation we found in the end to deliver a 2006 budget, we have a chance to create a shared vision in the next few days for a better future in 2007-2013 and beyond.
Returning to 2006, honourable Members will be aware that the budget agreement between the Council and the parliamentary delegation focused primarily on three key elements.
Each required some compromise from both sides, in some cases, frankly, going into uncharted budget waters, which perhaps explains why it was necessary to take a little longer over negotiations than has been the case traditionally.
I stress that in each case, the parliamentary delegation drove a hard bargain and, as a consequence, several members of the Council felt unable to support our final compromise.
But I believe that we reached a fair and balanced outcome in the end, one which I was able to steer through Council by a qualified majority.
Firstly, we agreed to amend upward the financial envelopes for six codecided programmes in heading 3: Internal Policies.
The Council did not see the need to propose these increases in its draft budget; however, the parliamentary delegation argued strongly that the six programmes concerned would be severely constrained without additional resources.
In the spirit of compromise and consistent with the Interinstitutional Agreement, I was able to persuade the Council to accept these changes.
This is the first time that has been agreed in the current financial perspective.
It is perhaps fitting that it happened in the final year of that perspective, and I am sure that both arms of the budgetary authority would want to consider it as an exceptional event.
Secondly, we agreed to mobilise the flexibility instrument for programmes in heading 4: External Actions, for a total of EURÂ 275Â million.
The Council took the initial view that it ought to be possible, with some reprioritisation, to finance all external actions within the budget ceiling.
However, I stress that the Council remains firmly committed to meet the urgent needs of external partners consistent with promises made and commitments undertaken.
Member States recognise the tight budgetary constraints in heading 4, demonstrated no more clearly than the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the Council was ultimately persuaded of the need to mobilise the flexibility instrument to ease these constraints.
I believe the outcome, which exceeds the Commissionâs proposals by more than EURÂ 110Â million, represents a fair compromise, ensuring resources for key urgent priorities, such as Iraq, tsunami reconstruction, traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, and CFSP.
It also recognises that further demands on the external actions budget are likely during 2006.
However, I stress that this is the first time it has been necessary to exceed EURÂ 200Â million in a single year.
The Council considers this an exceptional event and some Member States remain convinced that it is an unnecessary step.
I hope that honourable Members will appreciate the significance of this outcome and share with me the hope that more effective use of the principle of reprioritisation and reallocation will prevail in similar circumstances in future years.
Finally, as required by the Treaty, the Council and the parliamentary delegation agreed to set the level of overall payments for 2006 at EURÂ 111Â 969 million.
This represents the Commissionâs original proposal which, after taking account of Amending Letters 1, 2 and 3, is more than half a billion euros above the Councilâs original position.
I recognise that this figure is somewhat lower than some Members of Parliament would have liked.
However, it is firmly based on the Commissionâs estimates of what it is able effectively to spend.
I am sure honourable Members will share my concern not to create an unnecessary budget surplus and so would recognise the case for prudence.
Of course the budgetary authority stands ready to consider an amending budget to amend the level of payments, should that prove necessary during 2006.
As I said earlier, I believe that this compromise agreement represents a fair and balanced outcome for all three institutions â Council, Parliament and Commission.
There are no doubt elements of it that each of us might like to improve, but that is the essence of compromise.
No one is entirely satisfied, each of us has made a sacrifice and modified our positions.
Both the Council and Parliament had tough mandates this year and it was no easy matter to find common ground.
Consequently, I commend this solution to you and look forward to your vote.
I should now like to touch very briefly on other aspects of the Councilâs second reading, which honourable Members might like to take into account.
In heading 1: Agriculture, the Council reinstated the EURÂ 150Â million reduction from the first reading and accepted instead the Commissionâs Amending Letter 2, which reduces expenditure on subheading 1a by EURÂ 361 million compared to the preliminary draft budget.
In heading 2: Structural Operations, the Council reinstated its first reading position for a reduction of EURÂ 150Â million for payments compared to the PDB.
This reflects the Councilâs view of the expected implementation rate and is based on past evidence of implementation shortfalls, including amending budget 8 for 2005.
In heading 3: Internal Policies, the Council largely reinstated its first reading position but made some modest changes to a few key budget lines, including an increase in the payments for research lines, reflecting the increased emphasis on Lisbon from Hampton Court and entrusting the Commission to improve the implementation record in this area.
This allows a 16% increase to research payments, compared to 2005.
In heading 4: External Actions, the Council reinstated its first reading and also accepted the Commissionâs Amending Letter 1 concerning traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries, allocating resources from its first reading margin.
In heading 5: Administrative Expenditure, the Council partly accepted Parliamentâs first reading amendment to the Commission budget in light of new evidence about vacancy rates.
It also accepted the proposal to reduce EUR 20 million from Parliamentâs budget.
Otherwise it reinstated its first reading position, recalling the need for savings in operating costs from interinstitutional cooperation and economies of scale.
Finally, in heading 7: Pre-accession Strategy, the Council reinstated its first reading position.
Of course, Parliament will need to make changes to the Councilâs second reading position to implement our agreement on payments, codecided amounts and mobilisation of the flexibility instrument.
I very much hope that Parliament will take account of the Councilâs position, especially concerning commitments in headings 3 and 5, where there are clear opportunities to make savings and ensure there is a margin for the unexpected during 2006.
In conclusion, the agreement we reached on 30Â November provides adequate funding for the European Unionâs various priorities.
It broadly respects the important principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management, of which the Council and Parliament are joint guardians.
It deserves the confidence of the citizens of the European Union and will contribute to rebuilding public confidence in the Union and its institutions.
I hope honourable Members will forgive me if I do not remain in the Chamber for the duration of this morningâs debate, as I need to return urgently to London.
However, I will be staying to hear as many speeches as possible, which I am sure will be of the usual thoughtful and constructive nature.
I intend to return to Strasbourg on Thursday for the vote and the adoption of the 2006 EC budget.
Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to say that it has been a privilege and a pleasure to work through this process â although not on every occasion â and we can be rightly proud of the agreement that we are seeking to conclude during the course of this week.
Â Â  . Having successfully reached this culmination point of the budget cycle, we can conclude that a constructive approach, realism and political responsibility have prevailed in the budget negotiations.
It is due to prudent and inevitable compromise that we are near our goal today â an EU Budget for 2006 that may play a decisive role not only concerning the financial possibilities of the coming year, but also in shaping the further financial fate of Europe.
The approval of the budget may, and I hope will, become a vitally important message to the European Union that its institutions are still operational and able to function constructively, to make important decisions together and to achieve positive results.
I consider the results of the 2006 EU Budget negotiations to be one of those optimal successes.
Mr President, regarding the positive outcome of the negotiations for 2006: overall, a successful result has been achieved and one with which Parliament can be satisfied and proud.
I would like to thank Mr Pittella, MrÂ Lewandowski â the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and all the rapporteurs involved in the process.
From the very beginning, the Commission strongly supported Parliamentâs interpretation of the flexibility instrument which the Council, after hard negotiations, has now accepted.
Despite the Councilâs refusal to go over EURÂ 200Â million, now, with the final outcome, EURÂ 275Â million has been made available under the flexibility instrument, creating essential room for manoeuvre in headingÂ 4.
Turning to the co-decision programmes, you have achieved an important EURÂ 100Â million over 6Â programmes.
From the earliest stages, this was a strategy supported by the Commission in the process of negotiation, and now that agreement has been reached by both arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission will do its utmost to ensure implementation of the new amounts.
I would like also to thank Parliament, and in particular, Mr Pittella, for taking into account so many aspects of the Commissionâs letter of executability of the amendments from the first reading.
I would now like to turn to the level of payment appropriations.
It is important that the payment appropriations in the budget can cover the incoming bills, and ensure that beneficiaries receive the payments they are expecting.
The level of payment appropriations agreed for 2006 is accompanied by the agreed declaration, so that, if necessary and on the basis of the most up-to-date information, this will allow for any additional appropriations needed to be made available as soon as possible.
In order to facilitate the deal between the two arms of the budgetary authority, the Commission has proposed Amending LetterÂ 3, which is technically well founded, but the Commission will keep a close watch on the implementation of the 2006 budget and will not hesitate to use the budgetary tools at our disposal, if certain areas need to be reinforced.
In the first instance, appropriations can be transferred, and, notably, we can also call on the provisions of the declaration agreed at the trilogue, should an amending budget be required.
I would finally point out that the total payment appropriations figure on the table today represents an increase of almost 6% compared to the 2005 budget.
The budget agreed is optimal and fair, and it is necessary for Europe.
I wish Parliament a constructive debate and successful vote on Thursday.
Â Â  . I am pleased that an agreement concerning the EU Budget for 2006 has been reached.
Significant concessions were made by both the European Parliament and the Council, and thus, today we can expect that on 15 December the European Union budget for 2006 will be approved.
The European Parliament Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, of which I am a member, should be satisfied with the results of the agreement, as we have succeeded in achieving our main goals.
In 2006, allocations will be increased for codecision programmes, such as scientific research, SOCRATES, LIFE, small and medium-sized enterprises, youth programmes and European cultural organisations.
Growth, competitiveness and support for SMEs have always been and will continue to be the priority areas of the European Peopleâs Party.
It is also very important that we have come to an agreement to use the flexibility instrument for external policies and new needs, allocating EUR 275 million to Iraq, reconstruction efforts in tsunami-affected countries and consequences of sugar reform in the ACP countries, of which EUR 40 million will go to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
The level of appropriations for 2006 was a very important subject of negotiation for the European Parliament, and the agreement reached on EUR 111.969Â billion, or 1.01% of GNI, is within the limits of the Financial Perspective and therefore should be seen as a positive outcome of the negotiations.
Although at the first reading Parliament voted for significantly higher appropriations, the compromise reached with the Council 2006 provides a good foundation for agreement on the new Financial Perspective, as well as for negotiations on the EU Budget for 2007.
I congratulate my colleague and main rapporteur Giovanni Pittella, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets MrÂ Lewandowski, the Commissioner and the Council for having reached this solid agreement.
Â Â  .
MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like today to thank all those who participated in our work, beginning with our general rapporteurs, MrÂ Pittella and MrÂ Dombrovskis, before moving on to MrÂ BÃ¶ge and MrÂ Garriga and to the entire Committee on Budgets led by MrÂ Lewandowski. I also do not wish to leave out our administrators and assistants.
In actual fact, we have ended up today with a smaller budget than we were hoping for, but one that has been drawn up quite legally and that adheres to the current financial perspective, namely 1.09% of commitment appropriations.
That is important and exceeds the results obtained last year.
Furthermore, we can use the flexibility instrument to adhere to the promises made by the Council.
We will remember, though, the problems we had in securing this option when we embark upon the forthcoming negotiations.
What is more, all the margins have been adhered to.
In short, we have attained a modest and reasonable budget, which will do no damage to the revenue provided by the Member States.
The budget adheres to the priorities we set and, thanks to several policies adopted under codecision, it mainly enables us to anticipate the Lisbon Strategy and to hold on to the bulk of external aid, the aid that we give to the poorest countries and that we value highly.
I should like, however, to return to a number of points close to our hearts, which relate to the implementation of the budget.
Today, the budget that we are presenting has a political dimension to it.
It is up to the Commission, however, to make sure that this political dimension is maintained when the budget is implemented.
Clearly, we must avoid having any surpluses next year.
In fact, if the budget headings continue not to be implemented, then the European Parliamentâs political commitment, as budgetary authority, is likely to dwindle.
Commissioner, we no longer want to see returns of EURÂ 2 billion on whichever Fund it may be.
Everything must be implemented; we have given you the resources for this.
If you encounter difficulties, let us know in due time.
Finally, I should like to say to the Council that, admittedly, we now have a proper budget for 2006, agreed upon in the wake of a whole host of problems.
We are in this situation because the promises made by the Council are not often backed up with funds and because you had made a commitment, more than two years ago, to implement an information system on security policy.
We are one of the two branches of budgetary authority, and we consider it disgraceful that the European institutions, and the Council in particular, seem to be unaware of this fact.
The Committee on Budgets approved of the Councilâs wisdom in seeking to make strong political decisions for this 2006 budget.
We will harbour the same concerns where the forthcoming financial perspective is concerned.
Today, we have the only legal proposal: the vote on 8Â June, widely adopted by our Parliament.
Since then, we have been awaiting a genuine proposal from the Council.
When this reaches us, we will be ready â ready to work and to negotiate, in view of our shared years of experience.
The Committee on Budgets will work for a budget benefiting Europeans.
It will adopt a similar approach in the negotiations on the financial perspective, and Parliament will support it with a view to providing the European Union with a budgetary framework that will enable it to fund the activities in which it is required to engage with a view to developing quality jobs and protecting the environment.
We want this to be done in the context of real solidarity not only among the nations of Europe, but also with the poorest people.
As regards the 2006 budget, Parliament rejects the intergovernmental approach in relation to the financial perspective.
Our Parliament wants to represent Europeans.
It wants us to be united in diversity.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, MrÂ Lewis, I wish to start by also thanking the rapporteurs, headed by MrÂ Pittella, for the constructive outcome we have now achieved following the negotiations.
I think it good that we were able to reach a conclusion concerning the 2006 Budget, even though there is no clarification of the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
It does show that, despite everything, the Councilâs and Parliamentâs positions on the 2006 Budget were not so far removed from each other, even though the negotiations were quite tough.
My group does not, then, wish to support the proposal to reject the 2006 Budget in protest against the British Presidencyâs proposals concerning the financial perspective.
We too are angry that the British Presidency has proposed cutting back on aid to the poorest EU countries in order to give to the rich countries, but that is of course a debate to which we shall return later.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is particularly pleased that increased appropriations to development and research programmes â over and above what has been agreed in the past, moreover â were successfully obtained.
We are delighted to have obtained more money from the flexibility instrument so that we can fund the post-tsunami reconstruction, together with reconstruction in Iran.
Regarding the size of the payments in 2006, which in fact remained at 1.01% of gross national income, it will of course be the actual level in 2006 that will determine the budget over the next few years, if it should turn out that we do not obtain an agreement on the financial perspective.
That is something we could, of course, easily live with.
We should then approve annual budgets with only the Treaty as a framework, and we should then see how things went.
My group wants a financial perspective, but not at any price.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Lewis, Commissioner GrybauskaitÄ, ladies and gentlemen, we too believe that we have succeeded in achieving a defensible and credible compromise.
Our aim was to exercise discipline over expenditure while nevertheless showing an ability to shape policy, and I think we have succeeded in doing that.
Mobilising the flexibility instrument for an amount of EURÂ 275 million has given us the leeway to help the victims of the tsunami to rebuild their countries, to promote reconstruction in Iraq and also to bolster the new market organisation for sugar.
I am equally glad that we have been able, through our codecision on the programme, to do more for young people and for education, for that too is all about the ability to shape policy.
Our strategy of moving away from oil and towards more renewable energies, of benefiting research, small and medium-sized enterprises and culture too is the very thing for reaching people where they are â reaching, that is, their hearts and not just their heads.
That is what makes me glad that our negotiations have produced this result.
The prospect of the 2006 budgetâs commitment appropriations amounting to 1.09% offers us the opportunity for an appropriate basis for the next financial perspective, and means that we are going beyond the figures proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency this summer.
I do, nevertheless, want to remind the House that difficult negotiations in the Council on the financial perspective lie before us.
I appeal, as a matter of urgency, not only for the same single-mindedness in pursuing a single Europe as in the 2006 budget, but also for an awareness at Council level that it is our common Europe and its ongoing development that is at stake.
What matters is that any agreement should be made with a view to the needs of the new countries and also to the way in which Europe can be made fit for the future, with new ecological products on the global market to give hope to young people and to us.
The negotiations that are about to begin must not be characterised by the sort of repellent haggling that gets up peopleâs noses; instead, all parties must see themselves as negotiating for the Europe we share and in a European spirit.
I therefore appeal to France, to the United Kingdom, to Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, to give a little bit of ground and come to a real agreement that makes for a better future for us all and does not ruin Europeâs image.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, Parliament and the Council have arrived at a conciliation solution for next yearâs budget.
It came just prior to the negotiations to be held tomorrow and the guidelines for future budgets in the period 2007â2013 to be presented the day after tomorrow.
Neither party negotiating the budget wanted to take the risk of allowing these talks to founder on account of the 2006 budget.
There are probably not many Members in this Chamber, apart from those representing the United Kingdom, who, within the context of those talks, would like to see Great Britainâs special rebate continue in the years to come.
There are no good arguments for it.
Next yearâs budget will follow the guidelines indicated by the Council.
In payments the 1% limit is to be approached from above, without Parliament being able to defend its own territory.
The very fact that there might not be budgetary harmony would, under Article 272 of the Treaty, have given Parliament the use of more payment appropriations than the proposal which the negotiating parties have agreed on.
At first reading, Parliament blew up the biggest balloon by increasing Structural Fund payments by more than EUR 3 billion.
The Council burst this bubble in conciliation, without any special negotiations or Parliament keeping to its position.
It is strange that the Commission did not feel the need to defend its own original proposal, but instead took the side of the Council.
We in Parliament will remember this if there is not enough cash in the Structural Funds to make payments.
Under the EU Constitution the Union will be militarised to an astonishing degree, even though no EU Constitution yet exists nor will ever exist in the form which was rejected by the people of France and the Netherlands.
In this way the EU will increase its powers, even though the Member States have not legally bestowed them.
Our group takes a very critical view of next yearâs budget.
It may be that some members will agree with the proposal to reject it.
We want a more social and less military Europe.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to pay tribute to MrÂ Pittella, the rapporteur, and to MrÂ Lewandowski, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets.
MrÂ President, the 2006 budget is a poor budget, and it should be rejected.
A justified proposal to this effect has been tabled by members of the Independence and Democracy Group and of other political groups, and we would call on all Members of the House to lend it their support.
The facts are as follows.
In 2004 10Â new Member States joined the EU, which meant a rise of 20% in the number of EU citizens.
A constantly increasing number of these Member States are in need of assistance, solidarity and subsidies because they are not sufficiently advanced.
The European Union will gain another two Member States in 2007 when Bulgaria and Romania join, and the number of citizens will increase by 6%.
The second point I wish to make is that the European Union has been experiencing falling growth rates of below 2% for many years now, whereas the growth rate of the US and South-East Asian economies is many times faster.
The competitiveness of EU businesses is declining.
Yet the 2006 budget fails to take account of these factors.
The budget will increase by around 2% after inflation, which means that there will be less and less money for each EU citizen.
What is more, no changes have been made to the way in which budgetary expenditure is structured, so as to provide more money for backward countries and regions, and for sectors that are highly effective in economic terms.
The budget keeps the old mechanisms in place, and rewards economic sectors that are both costly and inefficient.
A budget of this kind will turn backward countries into net payers.
In addition, there are special reasons why the 2006 budget should be rejected.
It is being used as a threat to force the less advanced countries to consent to the adoption of the British proposal for a reduced 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
If they do not adopt this Financial Perspective, they face the prospect of having to agree to an interim annual budget based on the 2006 figures, which would mean even less money.
If the 2006 budget is a forerunner of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, then it should also be rejected, because Parliament proposed expenditure of around EURÂ 1Â 000Â billion for this period, whereas the current proposal refers to a figure of around EURÂ 850Â billion.
Given a difference of this magnitude, it is hard to believe that any Member of this House could fail to see that Parliamentâs opinion counts for very little and that it is being treated with contempt, or that the interests of individual countries are being given precedence over common interests.
I think I can safely say that I speak for all the Members proposing that the budget be rejected when I say we believe that the declarations and slogans proclaimed by EU leaders and the actual policies they implement stand in fundamental contradiction to each other.
Their policies are in fact simply an expression of the selfishness of the rich.
Â Â  .Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, I am speaking on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
Our group will vote in favour of the agreement reached by the Council and Parliament on the 2006 budget, even though it is far from satisfactory.
We find it hard to accept that the level of payments has been set at 1.01% of GNI.
The compromise that has been reached on this issue is in fact nothing less than a capitulation to the Council. The latter cuts the EUâs spending with a tenacity worthy of a better cause, in so doing violating the principles of solidarity and cohesion in order to further the local interests of the net payers into the EU budget.
The concessions granted by the Council on the flexibility instrument and on programmes adopted under the codecision procedure do not compensate in any way for this propensity to make cuts.
We have been disappointed by Commissioner GrybauskaitÄâs position.
During the conciliation procedure, she did not even remain faithful to the Commissionâs previous stance on the budget level.
This latter is now worryingly close to 1%, or in other words the symbolic, and indeed real, threshold below which achievement of the EUâs basic goals cannot be safeguarded.
This is all the more alarming because the 2006 budget may become a point of reference for the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective, which has been extremely difficult in the making.
The risk that this may happen increases the likelihood that negotiations on the Financial Perspective will end in fiasco, which would mean the 2006 budget serving as a basis for future annual budgets.
The solidarity and cohesion policies could therefore suffer as a result of the Councilâs position for many years to come.
We must ask ourselves whether this is the kind of EU that we want.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most inadequate of all the proposals tabled has been adopted.
We must realise that a small budget cannot be a good budget.
I agree that a large budget may not necessarily be a good budget, but it is impossible for a small budget to be a good one.
This House has heard comments along the lines of, âthe budget before us is small but goodâ.
There is no consensus that this is the case, however, just as there is no consensus on a budget that will ignore the needs of countries, especially the new Member States. Solidarity is a basic concern for these latter.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are certain incidents that cause many EU citizens to lose their enthusiasm for Community policies, and their belief in the momentous idea which is the European Union.
An example of one such incident is the position recently adopted by MrÂ SchrÃ¶der, the former German chancellor, on the construction of the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Baltic Sea. There is much controversy about this pipeline in many of the new EU Member States, and it has received a lot of negative publicity in these countries.
Indeed, it is not only in the new Member States that the publicity has been negative, for I have before me a list of German newspapers that have been extremely critical of the former chancellorâs decisions.
If the intention is now to tell the new EU Member States that there will not be enough money for them to achieve their fundamental goals, even though the aim of these goals is to promote what could be termed a natural impulse of the European Community, and if such incidents, which ruin the reputation of leading EU politicians, are accompanied by cuts to funding for the new EU Member States, we must realise that this impulse of the European Community, which also goes by the name of solidarity, will be weakened rather than strengthened.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a poor budget.
I say this not only because it is small. As I said before, it is a poor budget because it has implications for the future, and because it will destroy the natural inclination and impulse of the European Community, which should be the first concern of every one of us.
Â Â  The 2006 budget figures proposed by Parliament provide a clear message when viewed dispassionately.
Commitments, or potential expenditures, as a share of gross domestic product exceed 9%.
This is a good springboard for negotiations on the long-term financial perspective.
Payments increased by almost 6% compared with 2005, which is a substantially higher increase in budgetary resources than in many Member States of the European Union.
Considering the fact that the expected rate of inflation and economic growth in the European Union in 2006 is around 2%, it is apparent that the proposed budget is also reasonable from the macroeconomic standpoint.
The problem that continues to dog us is that the gap between commitments and payments is too wide.
This gap is again nearly EUR 10 billion, which reduces the flexibility and efficiency of the EUâs budgetary instrument.
I therefore still consider it crucial that issues regarding the effective use of budgetary resources be resolved, that mechanisms for accessing financial resources in structural and cohesion funds be made more flexible and that the extensive âcushionâ between resources available those that are actually used be greatly reduced.
I would like to conclude by expressing my appreciation for the work of my fellow Members and of the rapporteurs from the Committee on Budgets.
The results of their work also give us hope for the long-term budgetary outlook.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the enlarged European Unionâs second budget is in the process of becoming reality.
The broad consensus reached within Parliament means that the final vote should hold no surprises, and so I will start by saying some âthank yousâ, for which I will otherwise run out of time.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs, MrÂ Pittella, MrÂ Dombrovskis, MrÂ BÃ¶ge and MrÂ GarrigaÂ Polledo, the political group coordinators and our secretariat, headed by MariaÂ Fialho.
Our partners in this undertaking, or in other words MrÂ Lewis and CommissionerÂ GrybauskaitÄ, are both well aware of the fact that this yearâs budget was a challenge, and that tensions ran high during the negotiations. This does not diminish the mutual respect shared by the players in this EU institutional triangle, however.
Parliament had to fulfil its mission and the commitments it entered into upon being elected, and indeed it did so.
This was apparent from its endeavours to defend its priorities under the headings of internal and external policies, which was a far from easy task in the final year of a financial perspective.
I am delighted that we have managed to find extra funding for six of the programmes adopted under the codecision procedure.
It has also been necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument, and even to exceed its annual ceiling.
All these decisions were taken in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, which is proof of the value of this latter.
I am quite sure that it will be a long time before we forget the team spirit demonstrated by the members of Parliamentâs delegation during these nerve-wracking negotiations.
This was an example of genuine unity in diversity, and a good sign for the future.
Yet our joy at having a proper annual budget for 2006 is tempered by the uncertainty that surrounds the multi-annual Financial Perspective.
By this I do not mean uncertainty on our part, since we have adopted a position and are now awaiting developments.
I can only hope that we will finally see signs this week that the European Union is overcoming the crisis in which it finds itself, by reaching an agreement on the most challenging issue of all, namely money.
I also hope that the agreement is not one that leaves poorer countries with their backs against the wall, since we are all aware that these countries need to be able to plan ahead in order to conduct sensible regional policies.
Â Â  Mr President, our budget rapporteurs have presented us with a practical budget which addresses the Unionâs political and social realities.
To a large extent, our groupâs recommended priorities for 2006 have been incorporated.
They include: creating an effective information strategy; providing an efficient service for Members and visitors; continuing to purchase property and buildings under the right conditions; streamlining manpower policy and improving activity-based budgeting, which focuses more on core operations; critically examining all forms of expenditure; making better use of our resources, thus reducing waste, and other inherent malpractices â so adding real value to our performance.
The successful conclusion of a very well structured budget becomes even more relevant considering the potential outcome of the 2007 to 2013 financial perspectives.
In the budget conciliation process Parliamentâs negotiating team went a long way to find a workable, balanced formula.
Likewise, we should do our utmost to reach an agreement on the financial perspectives, but, as Mrs Jensen said, not at any cost.
We should not agree on a set of financial perspectives that would make it very difficult, if not impossible, realistically to deliver on our promises and to meet our commitments and objectives.
We cannot, and should not, pay lip service to high-flown ideas such as growth, employment, research, social solidarity and enlargement and, at the same time, not provide the funds to achieve them.
If we fail our citizens in this respect, apathy and their perception of the barrier between the EU institutions and ordinary citizens will grow much bigger.
In other words, if we really mean what we say, we should put our money where our mouth is.
Â Â  Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for all the work they have done.
I think that what we have achieved, namely payment appropriations amounting to 1.01% of the gross national income, is especially significant in the light of the negotiations about the financial perspectives.
It is higher than what Luxembourg offered under its Presidency and it is, if I am not mistaken, also higher than what is currently on offer by the British Presidency.
I agree with the many who say that Parliamentâs most important achievement has been the broader scope of the programmes relating to young people.
We have received more funds in the framework of the flexibility instrument, which is also one of Parliamentâs important criteria for subsequent financial perspectives.
Let me turn to the common foreign and security policy, during the negotiations on which something strange happened.
The Council wanted to teach us a lesson in cutting budget spending, and virtually every hour, the appropriations for this policy area increased.
This I regard as particularly bad budget policy on the part of the Council in this area, and it has resulted in considerably higher amounts than first proposed at first reading.
One possible explanation I could offer for this is the fact that we are now, for the third time, concluding an agreement with the Council on democratic control on the spending of common foreign and security policy funds.
The Council ignored the agreement on the first two occasions.
Third time lucky, we hope.
Â Â  Mr President, it is evident that good policy, of the kind that benefits the European public, results where the European Parliament possesses powers of codecision and that difficulties arise whenever the Council puts national interests first.
It is also apparent from the current debate that this House was very far-sighted in European agricultural policy and in initiating the reduction in export subsidies.
In CancÃºn, it was at the behest of the European Parliament that Mr Fischler and Mr Lamy proposed that these export subsidies be suspended outright.
We have also used the budget and codecision to foster rural development and to qualify the agricultural policy.
Certain governments â the British one in particular, which is now proposing cuts â should take good note of the fact that this rebate will nullify the Houseâs qualification, in part through budget policy, in this area, and put the brakes on a modern agricultural policy founded upon rural development, which will be particularly to the detriment of the new Member States of the European Union.
Â Â  â Generally speaking, there is no harm in comparing the 2006 ceiling, and the Communityâs budget priorities, which stands at around 1.01% of Community GNI, with the 2005 figure, or with the proposals made by the Luxembourg and British Presidencies for the 2007-2013 Financial Framework.
Let us not forget, however, that the Financial Framework for 2000-2006 provided for 1.08% of GNI for the following year, that Parliamentâs proposal for the 2007-2013 Financial Framework provides for 1.0% and that the Commission is proposing around 1.14%.
In recent years, there has been a real terms reduction in the Community budget, which some are trying to set at around 1%.
That would mean that the Structural Funds would account for 0.36% to 0.37% of Community GNI, which would suit the most economically advanced countries in the EU.
Once again, a mindset has taken hold that oddly views every concession as a victory, in reference to each increasingly damaging proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, every year, around this time, we live through a period of unprecedented extravagance in the European Union.
I am talking about the surpluses, which give us a small foretaste of what we can â unfortunately â expect on a larger scale later on.
Yesterday, the Committee on Budgets was discussing something the presence of which on the agenda was cause for bafflement, namely the purchase, for the sum of EURÂ 3 million, of a building for the European Parliament in Valletta â it is worth mentioning that the intention was that the Commission should be a tenant.
All five Maltese MEPs are against the idea, saying that it is too remote and difficult to get to, and that they would rather carry on renting at the present favourable rate.
They have to accept it, though, since there is a surplus and it has to be spent.
So along comes one of your colleagues, Mr President, the Vice-President Mr Onesta, and says, âthat is a good property investment, and I promise you that, in three yearsâ time, if we find something better, we will be able to sell the building at a profit and move on somewhere elseâ.
We are forced to accept these benefactions, and the European Parliament is made into a property speculator by the mere fact of having too much money, and then people wonder why it is that, in Malta, the public wonder what this is all in aid of, what sort of waste this is, what sort of attitude this is to take.
Away with such practices, and let us have proper budgeting â the sort that is not guaranteed by the draft budget we have before us, and so I, of course, will be among those voting against it.
Â Â  I shall just clarify something with regard to what you were saying about MrÂ Onesta, because I too am a member of the Bureau.
The European Parliament is obviously not a property speculator, but endeavours to be a good administrator of the funds entrusted to it.
The desire to spend in appropriate conditions should therefore, in my opinion, be approved by a man who is as fond of budgetary rigour as you are.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here we are again, with everyone in this House embracing one another and congratulating themselves and each other on this budget.
While this congratulatory reception is going on, though, I have substantial criticisms to make, notably that the second reading in the Committee went ahead without documents, so that resolutions were put together orally, and that the cutbacks and redeployments of funds neither were nor are justifiable.
I am quite surprised to see, in the foreign policy sphere, that non-governmental organisations and democracy programmes have gained a great deal, more indeed than they have ever had before, while cutbacks were the order of the day almost everywhere else.
While I am on the subject of cutbacks, the Commission has, in negotiations with the Council and in the Committee on Budgets, proposed to make them, to the tune of over EURÂ 150 million, to the payments made from the Structural Funds, leaving EURÂ 70 million.
It justified this by reference to an alleged lack of opportunity for implementation in the countries concerned.
Looking at the programme of cutbacks, I wonder why it is that the Commission, and the Commissioner, have lost the courage to do the right and proper thing.
The present cuts in the internal policy areas and in foreign policy hit hardest those areas in which the money could actually have been put to good use, and this is something of which I really do take a very critical view.
We will look carefully to see whether the money remaining in the Structural Funds actually does get spent.
What I find regrettable about this sort of thing is that it is yet more evidence of our inability to trust those who administer the funds, and so I ask, as a matter of urgency, that there be no repetition of it, or else we will see a great gulf opening up between old and new, between those countries that contribute and those that receive, and that is precisely what we cannot afford with the financial perspective and the debates on it in the offing.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to congratulate all those who have worked hard to put in place the 2006 budget, especially our rapporteur, Mr Pittella.
I have just three points for the Commission and Council to reflect on.
Firstly, every year we have a similar struggle to agree the EU budget.
It is increasingly a challenging task due to ever more exceptional demands on the EU at home and abroad.
At the same time, the traditional priorities continue to require as much spending as before.
I do not think, therefore, that we should worry if the budget requires a heated and lengthy debate to achieve a compromise solution.
However, we should be concerned by the fact that, after devoting time, money and effort debating, negotiating and agreeing the budget, we then fail to use the funds.
This is totally unacceptable and I know that many others, including Mr Garriga Polledo, have made this point.
I would ask the Commissioner to take full responsibility for improving implementation, not only in the programmes that the Commission champions, but also in respecting Parliamentâs will.
The fiercely negotiated funds must have an impact on the lives of EU citizens and it is payments that have the most direct effect.
My second point is that collectively we need to be more aware of our public image and the importance of demonstrating the collaborative working habits that drive the EU project and inspire confidence in the European Union.
These are currently clearly lacking.
I would like the Commission to note that Parliament has improved resources for communication policy.
Now it is the responsibility of Commission officials to be more imaginative.
In this age of the competitive mass communications market, the need to sell ourselves and our EU vision and deliver a clear, simple and compelling message is absolutely imperative.
That goes for Parliament too.
Outdated, incomprehensible legacies such as our travelling circuses do nothing to help us win this game.
Thirdly, a word on headingÂ 4.
As the chairman of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of South Asia and SAARC, I am deeply disappointed with the reduction in amounts for Asia, even with the additional flexibility.
The Council needs to think seriously about this dysfunctional heading.
We have a knee-jerk reaction to major disasters.
We have commitments to the MDG global health funds.
We do not, however, have adequate resources.
Let this be a priority for the Council Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to thank MrÂ Pittella and MrÂ Dombrovskis, rapporteurs for the budget, for their excellent budget draft, as well as Mr Lewandowski, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, for his conciliatory role as leader of the negotiations.
The draft budget before us aims at improving employment in Europe.
Certain multiannual programmes are to be started, on Parliamentâs initiative, as a result.
This particularly applies to the research framework programme and training programmes.
In this way Parliament is showing the direction in which the work of the EU should be developed.
This budget is the last under the current financial perspective.
The new financial framework should bolster European entrepreneurship and therefore employment.
Research and development, and training and the promotion of cohesion will have key roles to play in this.
Unfortunately, however, the best laid plans can run into trouble.
The proposal at Luxembourg back in June drastically reduced the appropriations intended to improve competitiveness by a hefty EUR 60 billion.
Although Prime Minister Tony Blair promised improvements, Britainâs proposal is even worse.
There has been no increase in appropriations for research and development whatsoever.
Another EUR 12 billion has been cut from the Structural Funds in addition to the reduction of EUR 29 billion made at Luxembourg.
Rural development, which is an important element in agricultural reform, is threatened with total collapse.
At Luxembourg, EUR 14 billion was cut from the framework and now Britain is cutting a further EUR eight billion.
The budget should aim at the future and endorse action which no single Member State can afford on its own.
This budget shows the way.
Â Â  Mr President, some aspects of the funding of the so-called Common Foreign and Security Policy are highly dubious.
Money from wholly disparate budget rubrics is used to fund the EUâs operations, whether of a military or police nature, and the so-called flexibility instrument makes an additional EURÂ 40 million available for the CFSP.
What I would like to know is for what, precisely, these EURÂ 40 million are being used.
The EUPOL operation in Kinshasa is funded by the European Development Fund, that is to say by EURÂ 4.3 million of development aid.
The AMIS operation in the Sudan, which includes military training, is funded jointly by ten Member States, as well as by the fund called the African Peace Facility.
The EUPM mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina is part-funded from the Commissionâs budget, and the ALTHEA operation in Bosnia by means of what is termed the ATHENA mechanism, in other words, in an undemocratic manner and without Parliamentary scrutiny.
Mr Brok is now proposing that there be an increase in this area, from EURÂ 100Â million to EURÂ 300Â million.
As you know that the Treaty of Nice prohibits the European Union from maintaining an independent military budget, perhaps you would refrain from these sorts of tricks!
Â Â  Mr President, since I oppose virtually everything that the European Union proposes to spend money on during the budget year of 2006, I cannot be expected to support this report or its motion for a resolution.
The European Union is a self-perpetuating mega-bureaucracy that has carte blanche to finance its own programmes.
I particularly oppose the allocation of funds for the brainwashing of young people, referred to in this report as being used for advancing the idea of Europe.
I believe that even the most backward of students will be aware that the continent of Europe has been around for quite some time and is a bit more than an idea.
Bringing secondary school pupils to this institution for all-expenses-paid visits, during which they will be given disingenuous one-sided briefings about the wonders of the European Union, is a crude brainwashing exercise, as is the flooding of educational establishments with equally one-sided literature.
The reportâs repeated references to the now almost wholly discredited Lisbon Strategy hardly add to its credibility.
I would urge any Member of this institution who generally believes in democracy and accountability to the electorate to vote against this budget and any other documents that purport to legitimise it.
Â Â  Mr President, the Member States are in reality the EUâs paymasters without discretion.
Whatever the arguments about the budgets, they pay and then argue about how it is all to be spent, which is not real budgeting in any sense that I understand.
That is why the argument about the British rebate is about politics and not proper financial management.
It is a continuing running sore, only because MrsÂ Thatcher was foolish enough to agree that it should be paid back by the Member States to what is now the fourth largest economy in the world and, since enlargement, it comes from some of the smallest and poorest in Europe.
Had that been a deduction made in London and a net sum paid over, the argument would never have arisen.
Whatever the budget, the European project is stuttering, unsure what to do about the faltering eurozone and unable to come to terms with Anglo-Saxon enterprise that the countries of Asia have made their own.
You have big problems and many of them are of your own design.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am delighted, first of all because from now on the Council will negotiate CFSP issues with us at ambassador level, thereby upgrading Parliament's role in the shaping of the CFSP.
Secondly, I am delighted because an agreement was reached in time on the 2006 budget.
In this respect, the British Presidency took the right decision, given that noÂ one would have tolerated two major impasses at the end of a Presidency and Mr Blair wanted to close the 2006 budget in good time so that he would have more room for manoeuvre when negotiating the financial perspectives.
Thirdly, payment appropriations for 2006 are 1.01, compared to 1 in 2005, while the British proposal makes provision for 0.98 for the seven-year period from 2007 to 2013.
We have a slight improvement compared with this year, we achieved more than the British Presidency is discounting for the next seven years, but we have no reason to celebrate.
We shall not achieve European integration with so little money.
I should like to reply to the minister by saying that we do not agree with what he said here today about the heading 3 financing needed and legal use of the flexibility instrument supposedly being 'exceptional events'.
I am afraid that the minister should not have said this in his intervention, because, on the contrary, we shall not achieve integration with less money, especially less necessary money.
To divide the Member States into net contributors and net recipients of appropriations, when we are not going to spend more than 1% on Europe, when we are not focusing our overall synergies from common European action, does not do us credit and certainly does not testify to our regard for European ideals.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Pittella, and his team, on the excellent work they have done and I would like to add that it is not my custom to congratulate all of the rapporteurs when their reports are finished.
They have made great efforts and they have faced many problems.
Having been rapporteur for the Unionâs budget, I am well aware that it is not an easy thing to complete a successful budget.
I would like to focus, Mr President, on the aspects that I consider to be of particular importance.
Firstly, for the first time we have managed to apply a principle which this Parliament had always advocated: the sums approved during codecision are not sacred and they can be altered if the budgetary authority believes that to be necessary.
We all agree that, in order to improve the management of multi-annual programmes, the security of financial packages is an important factor.
But we cannot turn what is no more than a tool into an objective.
This is what differentiates us from the Council.
Perhaps what separates us from the Council is the definition of the objectives.
Perhaps the Councilâs objective is simply the certainty that nothing is going to change once a decision is taken. What I believe we could call âthe certainty of the accountantâ.
To all of this we must add that the programmes whose funding has increased in the 2006 budget are hugely symbolic to the European Union.
Both the Socrates Programme, which is well known to many citizens, and Youth, are examples of what a Parliament can do to create European awareness amongst the Unionâs citizens.
Furthermore, the LIFE programme, created by Parliament itself years ago, is one of those that enjoy the greatest acceptance amongst the European citizens and which demonstrate most clearly what kind of Europe we here in Parliament want to see.
I am also pleased that the Council has not been able to impose the absurd manipulation, which they call âinterpretationâ, of the rules for mobilising the flexibility instrument.
An unnecessary instrument within the interinstitutional agreement, which only exists because of the Councilâs constant and almost legendary refusal to use the appropriate instrument for dealing with cases in which more appropriations than those provided for at the beginning of a period of programming of the financial perspective are required.
That appropriate instrument is called ârevisionâ and its use does not lead to chaos or to eternal damnation.
The consequence of this more rational use of the resources available to us â the phrase should be familiar to you â has meant that the cuts we have been making since 2000 in the Unionâs external actions are less than usual this year.
Since it has taken two to achieve all of this, and I do not want to be entirely negative toward the Council, I would like to congratulate the British Presidency, in which I must confess I did not have too much confidence at the beginning, but which in the end has been up to the job.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is perfectly plain from the negotiations on the 2006 budget, and even more so from the debates on the financial perspective, that the way the Council is acting is reminiscent of someone who leaves a restaurant without settling the bill.
The Council orders more and more powers for the European Union, while being willing to pay less and less for them.
The Council sticks up for the Member States.
What the Member States want is for the EU to do more and more with the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to fight terrorism and crime, to subsidise agriculture, to organise policies for the protection of the environment and of consumers, for development aid and much else â the list is endless.
It is getting longer, and, as we all know, that costs money â a lot of money.
So let me tell the Council that it is time the simple truth dawned on it that more powers cost more money, and fewer powers cost less money.
It is irresponsible of the Council to demand more powers while at the same time being less and less willing to spend money.
Reforming the way the money is spent would do us all some good.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, there are just a few comments I would like to make at this point.
I have been through quite a few budget debates, but none have been conducted in such a shameful manner as this yearâs even though I did think that previous performances could not be surpassed.
When I consider the way the 2006 budget procedure went, and how the preparations for the next financial framework are progressing, I really do wonder, Mr President-in-Office, why your Prime Minister â to whom I ask you to pass this on â delivered such an incandescent speech in Brussels at the end of June.
The words were fine, but action has not been forthcoming.
It is not that it has been moderate, but rather that there simply has not been any.
I am glad that the British Presidency of the Council has learned, in the course of this budget procedure, that this House knows what it is for and what it is about.
I hope you will take that insight away with you and take account of it in your deliberations.
You have an image of Europe as somewhere where a few Heads of State or Government announce how things are to go and steer them in that direction, and in which the Commission and Parliament are no more than decorative accessories that have to be tolerated; well, I have to tell you that that Europe no longer exists.
If you have taken this lesson to heart, then I will be very satisfied with the British Presidency of the Council.
I will, however â and here I am addressing the Commissioner â make the critical comment that, as regards the role played by the Commission in the budget procedure, there has to be something of a rethink.
It is not acceptable that the European Parliament should act as the Commissionâs shield and defence, yet keep on getting the sense of being left in the lurch when the Commission withdraws positions in response to pressure from the Council.
That is another thing to which we will, together, need to give very close consideration if we are to achieve anything together.
Getting additional funds made available could have been achieved with less of an effort, but the fact is that presidencies sometimes need a bit longer to understand things and to come round to supporting them.
This House, though, is patient and takes its time, for we do have a few things in the field of education policy that we want to hammer out with the Council.
To you, Mr President-in-Office, I want to press home the point that the Inter-Institutional Agreement has proved its worth.
We have agreed among ourselves on the ground rules, we have insisted on you keeping to them, and that was the right way to go about it.
I do, though, also want to say something self-critical about something that has bothered me for years, and since I myself once had the honour to present Parliamentâs budget, and it is this: this House will, in the long term, have no credibility in negotiations with the Council or the Commission if we do not get a firm grip on our own budget.
When I consider the unspent funds from the 2005 budget that we had to deal with yesterday when again transferring appropriations, or the struggle we had with our good friends the Social Democrats in order to get Parliamentâs budget just EURÂ 20 million below the magic 20% limit â and I am obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Dombrovskis, for leading us in it â then we will have to give serious thought to what all this has to do with truth and clarity.
A European Parliament that fails to manage 10% of the amount budgeted for in the manner prescribed, has a credibility problem, and it is one that we have to consider in a self-critical light.
I would just like to say something else about the financial perspective.
I urge you to take home with you the lesson, which you have learned, that Europe consists of states with equal rights, not of old and new Member States.
Europe adds up to a common interest, not to the sum of 25 national interests.
If you bear that in mind, you will have a successful weekend; if you do not, it will be a flop.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to express my sincere thanks to our fellow Members, MrÂ Pittella and MrÂ Dombrovskis, as well as to Mrs Jensen, for the enormous task they carried out during this long procedure.
This budget, while not perfect, is, in my opinion, relatively satisfactory, and I am delighted that the level of payment appropriations has been brought up to EURÂ 112 billion, that is to say 1.01% of GNI, and that our operating costs have been curbed and relatively stabilised.
As permanent rapporteur for the Structural Funds within the Committee on Budgets, I might nevertheless have hoped that the Council would have granted more appropriations to all of these financial instruments, which remain the cornerstone of our policies aimed at reducing territorial disparities.
What is more, I, like many of our fellow Members, am still waiting to hear the results of the European Council negotiations, and I should like to drive home the point that it is worth keeping in mind Parliamentâs positions during these negotiations.
At a time now when we need Europe most, it is crucial that the Member States provide the European Union with genuine financial resources.
We need Europe so that we can carry out an ambitious economic policy for its 450 million people.
We need Europe so that we can carry out a common foreign and security policy, which is distinct from those of the self-contained empires throughout the world.
To conclude â and contrary to the opinion expressed by some of our fellow Members with regard to brainwashing - we need Europe more than ever in order to build a project for society uniting us around shared values.
That is my dream; I hope that it is yours too.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, I should like to take the opportunity of this debate on the 2006 budget to remind the House that the payments in this budget are set at a level that is as much as 0.07% of GNP lower than that foreseen in the 2000-2006 Financial Perspective.
They are also 0.02% lower than the payments planned for 2005, which is now drawing to a close.
This is certainly not good news, in particular for the new EU Member States.
This fundamental objection notwithstanding, I should like to thank all those who have helped ensure that the 2006 budgetary procedure will soon come to an end.
A total of two rounds of painstaking conciliation negotiations with the Council were needed to get this far, as well as the taking up of a firm position by both the negotiating group and Parliament as a whole.
This is a particularly important message to send out at a time when the debate on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the positions of the Council and Parliament on this matter are unfortunately very different.
The 2006 budget sets a figure of almost EURÂ 112Â billion to cover payments, which is the equivalent of 1.01% of the EUâs GNP.
This is substantially higher than the level of payments proposed by the British Presidency for the individual years in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective.
As I see it, this should be one of our key arguments in the debate on the level of payments for the 2007-2013 period, given that the European Union, far from wanting to abandon the funding of any of its present activities, is currently seeking to increase its involvement.
I should like to conclude by thanking the rapporteurs for having drafted the reports.
I should also like to express the hope that we will succeed in implementing this yearâs budget in its entirety, so that late 2006 does not see us complaining that we have failed to adopt a rational approach to the expenditure of such a modest sum.
Â Â  â Knowledge is the European Unionâs competitive advantage, and we are responsible for the development of a knowledge-based society.
The European Union can only offer a successful response to global changes through unity and the exploitation of knowledge, innovation and creativity at a European level.
This is the essence of the Lisbon Strategy.
All 25 Member States of the European Union have committed themselves to fulfilling the goals of this strategy.
Its fulfilment will of course require adequate financial resources, both in the financial perspective and in the annual budget.
A budget geared towards development is therefore extremely important for the common European future.
The budget for 2006 is not important simply for the coming year, but will also be of key importance in the event of our failure to agree on the future financial perspective.
For this reason I would prefer the budget to be significantly more development-orientated.
Most of the resources in the budget are still earmarked for agriculture and structural measures, within which we find agriculture once again.
Despite the increase in comparison with the 2005 budget, it is the area of internal policies that receives the smallest amount of resources in the 2006 budget and thereby the developmental part of European policies.
The ceiling set by the financial perspective has only been achieved for rural development and internal policies remain more than two percent below the threshold.
Nevertheless I remain realistic, and I wish to congratulate the European Union negotiators for their perseverance with the priorities that were set and for the funds they managed to secure.
The increase in funds, although lower than we would wish for programmes that are of great importance for the Lisbon Strategy, is significant, and says much about the direction we have mapped out for the future.
In the event of failed negotiations on the financial perspective, this means more development-orientated spending of European financial resources than was set out in the Luxembourg and British proposals for 2007-2013.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that this agreement on the 2006 budget has finally been reached, and I would like essentially to stress two aspects: one directly relating to the budget and another indirectly related.
I would like firstly to stress the fact that more than six programmes subject to codecision have been provided with EUR 100 million, which I believe to be very significant and stimulating.
I believe that this is the direction that the Community budget should take over the coming years.
The effort that has been made in relation to small and medium-sized businesses is particularly relevant.
We must not forget that, at the end of the day, we have 23 million SMEs in Europe, which represent no more and no less than two-thirds of all jobs in the private sector.
There is therefore no doubt that the success of SMEs will mean success for growth and employment in Europe.
However â and this is an important âhoweverâ â research and development are also a fundamental pillar in terms of the competitiveness of our companies, of the competitiveness of our economies.
And there is a very worrying aspect here: the current financial perspective does not include an increase in the fund intended for research and development.
Despite the fact that the British Presidency quite rightly â very rightly in fact â stresses the importance of research and development over and over again, there is no parallel budgetary effort in that direction.
The British proposal â which is not an original proposal, it has already been proposed by the Commission â to increase the funds of the European Investment Bank and, by means of soft credits and guarantees, to enhance research, is not a solution to the problem, but it must be a complementary instrument.
It is fundamental, if we want to maintain the consistency and credibility of a debate which focuses on competitiveness in innovation, development and research, that the financial perspective provides for the funds intended for research.
Otherwise, we will be moving backwards, once again, with regard to the Lisbon objectives.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this week the European Parliament will adopt the European Unionâs budget for 2006 at the second and final reading.
This will conclude the European Unionâs budget procedure for 2006 and the existing Financial Perspective.
I am pleased that after lengthy debates with the European Council it has been possible to reach a compromise.
This was also important because the 2006 budget serves as a point of reference in taking decisions on the next Financial Perspective, that for 2007â2013.
I hope that this week the Member Statesâ governments at the European Council will also be able to agree on the Councilâs position with regard to the Financial Perspective.
I call on the European Council, when debating this issue, also to take into account the opinion and ideas expressed in the European Parliamentâs resolution.
The main priorities of the 2006 budget for the other EU institutions are enlargement and the effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources.
The first priority is connected with the successful completion of the 2004 round of enlargement, as well as preparations for the next round of enlargement, when Bulgaria and Romania will join.
Unfortunately, once again it is necessary to point out that, although more than a year has passed since EU enlargement, many permanent staff posts set aside for the new Member States still remain vacant.
One of the problems to be emphasised in this connection is the excessive red-tape and slow procedures for taking on staff.
In accordance with the decision taken at first reading, the proposal at second reading is again to support all the permanent staff posts requested by the other institutions in connection with enlargement, and also other additional expenditure connected with enlargement, in order to ensure the success of the next round of EU enlargement.
The second priority is effective and highly targeted use of EU budget resources.
This priority encompasses such matters as: focusing EU institutional expenditure on fundamental tasks; giving support to new budget requests and permanent staff posts requests only after having assessed the possibility of redistributing resources and staff within the framework of the existing budget; giving support to new initiatives only after having assessed their impact on the budget and interinstitutional cooperation with a view to economical and effective use of budget resources.
Both institutions with budgetary decision-making powers â the European Parliament and the Council â endorse the principles of budgetary discipline and the rational use of EU taxpayersâ money.
At second reading the European Council proposed reverting to its initial position and reducing the administrative expenditure of the other institutions by 15Â million euro as compared with the institutionsâ original requests.
It must be said that in many cases this reduction was implemented in an ill-considered manner, without thorough examination of the specific nature and problems of the institutionsâ work.
Nonetheless, during the conciliation meeting a compromise was reached whereby the European Council will not object to the amount of expenditure by the other institutions set by the European Parliament at first reading.
Therefore, the proposal at the European Parliamentâs second reading is to retain the amount of expenditure fixed at the European Parliamentâs first reading, restoring part of the reductions in expenditure made by the European Council â in total by 7.5 million euro.
To conclude, I should like to return to the issue of the Financial Perspective.
During the conciliation meeting on the EU budget for 2006 it could be seen that the European Council and particularly the UK Presidency focused excessively on just a single issue â the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations.
It only remains to hope that at this weekâs European Council summit the Member Statesâ governments will be able to deal with EU issues within a wider perspective, and not reduce everything to just one question â the minimum possible figure for payment appropriations.
Particularly striking proof of this tendency is provided by the unacceptable proposal by the UK Presidency to find a compromise between the older Member States at the expense of the new Member States, by reducing by 10 per cent the amount of EU funds accessible to the new Member States.
We must remember that the Luxembourg Presidency had already proposed a significant reduction in the amount of resources to be directed towards the EUâs regional policy, in comparison with what the European Commission had announced.
Fortunately, this proposal by the UK has already been withdrawn.
It only remains to hope that the UK Presidency is serious about reaching a compromise this year on the Financial Perspective, and that its next proposal will be an improvement.
Â Â  The President of the Council informed me that he had to leave the debate under way.
I had been informed of this; I am surprised, though, that the Council should not wish to reply to such an important question before Parliament, but I take note of this information.
Â Â  . Mr President, I want to thank Parliament for the debate today, and I congratulate once more the whole Parliament negotiating team.
With the result that was negotiated in this political environment, in which we all participated, we have achieved the optimum possible outcome.
I wish Parliament a successful vote on Thursday.
Â Â  The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  â The next item is the continuation of the Commission statement on the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2006.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, next year will be crucial in the face of a Europe lacking modern institutions and budgetary prospects, a Europe in crisis faced with citizens who are increasingly uncertain of it and who, unfortunately, made us aware of the fact in spring.
We are therefore going to have to accept the challenge â the globalisation challenge, the climate change challenge, the energy challenge and the demographic challenge â if we are to meet Europeansâ expectations and if Europeans are to understand that Europe is not some amorphous mass bearing no relation to themselves.
From this viewpoint, we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are proposing practical guidelines to you for 2006, something that was sorely lacking in your programme, Commissioner, not least in terms of transforming the Lisbon Strategy objectives into actions.
In order to improve European competitiveness, we will see to it that all forms of bureaucracy are reduced and that all unnecessary legislation is done away with.
In this context, it is important to involve the European Parliament more and to improve the ex-post evaluation of the measures adopted.
The PPE-DE also lays emphasis on the completion of the internal market, the optimal running of which is crucial for all of our businesses, for all of our jobs and for our consumers.
Our economy must be able to rely on the rapid completion of the large-scale trans-European transport network projects, which will need to be funded not only by the European budget, but also by public-private partnerships, which are also central to our ambition for research, an ambition requiring more than just lip service.
The budget dedicated to the new framework programme for research and innovation will be enlightening.
We will be exacting with regard to the appropriations available and the way in which these are used.
This research is the key to our future jobs.
Commissioner, the PPE-DE will also pay a great deal of attention to the external borders of the European Union.
We call on you, for 2006, genuinely to begin to reflect on the Unionâs absorption capacity and openly to debate this issue with Parliament.
This is a very important issue for our citizens, who question us on this point every day, just as they question us on the fight against illegal immigration or the strengthening of border control capacities.
To strengthen our border control capacities, we must increasingly use biometric data and ensure better cooperation between information systems â a crucial kind of cooperation that we must also see applied in the contexts of cyber security, the fight against terrorism and the fight against crime.
We have a high-performance tool â Europol â and it is time we provided it with a Community legal basis.
Finally, the European Union can bring its added value to other areas, such as health care.
We look forward to practical measures being implemented in relation to the fight against obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer or psychological problems.
The PPE-DE also wants a proposal in favour of patientsâ mobility and of providing them with information.
It is also the European Unionâs duty to take charge of education.
We regret your lack of ambition, particularly in relation to improving language teaching and to developing our university centres.
Commissioner, you know that the fulfilment of our objectives together with Europeâs everyday added value are dependent on two fundamental requirements.
On the one hand, the institutional rules governing the functioning of the European Union: you are aware of our attachment to the Constitutional Treaty; a strong initiative is urgently required to restart the debate.
On the other hand, the financial perspective: a budget that meets everyoneâs expectations, a strong budget for a powerful Europe and not just a few coins casually put on the table by the Council, like some shabby tip.
Â Â  . Mr President, Madam Vice-President, I really cannot restrain myself from starting my speech with the comment that, although it was Mrs GrossetÃªteâs group that insisted on us having this debate, one can hardly be overwhelmed by the number of its members who have actually turned up for it.
Madam Vice-President, it is to our great advantage that we can support the Commission when we believe it is going down the right road and criticise it when we believe there are things to be set right.
If I may begin with Plan D, for which you have personal responsibility, I can say that you will have this groupâs wholehearted support.
I hope that you yourself will, next year, be able to devote your full energy to getting the Constitution and the debate on the issues around it across to the public and thereby completing your achievement.
Turning to Mr Barrosoâs criticisms of the draft budget â which he described as a mini-budget for a mini-Europe â I have to say that we agree with him, and our chairman, Mr Schulz, has said so in plain terms.
I hope that our President will stand sufficiently firm in the dialogue to ensure that the interests of Europe as a whole are defended.
As for the âbetter regulationâ issue, we agree with you that what really matters is that the process of enacting Europeâs laws be made more efficient and more readily comprehensible, not least from the point of view of the man and woman in the street, and, with this in mind, I would ask the members of the Commission â all of them â to read through the draft of the services directive and then say whether or not they find it comprehensible or an example of âbetter regulationâ.
Quite apart from its social content, it would be very interesting to discuss that with you, but that can, of course, wait for next year.
I would like to say something about two things to which our Socialist Group in the European Parliament will be giving particular attention next year.
The first is the defence of fundamental rights and freedoms in Europe, in relation to which especially objectionable things have come to light and occurred in recent months, and I am not referring only to the activities of the CIA, but rather â to give a couple of examples âto the restriction of trade union rights in Slovakia, and also, in this context, certain attitudes that have become apparent in the new Member State of Poland as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of homosexual persons and others.
All these developments we regard with concern.
I would like to assure Commissioner Frattini of our full support and urge him to forthrightly defend Europeâs rights and standards in this area.
That is the only thing we demand of him.
Let me turn to the most important issue, which is that of âsocial Europeâ.
We, in our group, know as well as anyone else that there is no long-term job security; we also know that many people have to change jobs again and again, but it is precisely for that reason that this Commission needs to take tougher action on social issues, and be seen to do so.
Many members of the public â as you, Madam Vice-President, will know from your dialogue with them â even believe that the EU magnifies the negative effects of globalisation; they see how many people âÂ including, alas, many companies â misuse the European Union, enlargement, and globalisation too, as a means of undermining social standards.
This is not just a matter of concern in the so-called old Member States, but in the new ones too.
It is for that reason that the Commission needs to become more active in the field of social policy; it must help to obviate or at least to alleviate the adverse effects, without fostering the illusion that we can erect a protective wall around Europe.
Speaking on behalf of my group, then, I urge the Commission to produce a proposal for legislation on, for example, non-standard working arrangements, to unveil â as the Council Presidency has not done â a workable approach to the establishment of a globalisation adjustment fund and, at last, to put on the table a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest, which are among the means whereby the public are connected to the public sector.
What they need is support from the European Union and the Commission rather than to be undermined by them.
I can tell the Vice-President of the Commission that the members of my group are not starry-eyed about social issues, but we do know that, if we fail to make this Europe of ours more social, if we fail to give greater prominence to the social dimension in addressing the issues of globalisation and the opening up of markets, then we will fail to win backing for our project from the citizens of this continent.
That, though, is an absolute necessity, and for it to happen, we need the Commissionâs support.
That, speaking on my groupâs behalf, is what I really would urge you to provide.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we Liberal and Democrats have taken a position on your work programme alongside the conservative Christian Democrats and the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
It is evident from the way we have opted to structure its content that there are tasks to occupy us next year in all policy areas.
We congratulate you on the fundamental direction of the work programme, which is aimed at making Europe more competitive, at consistent pursuit of the Lisbon Agenda and at completing the market as a means towards strengthening Europeâs economy â those are the right lines along which to go if Europe is to be made stronger and fitter for globalisation.
This policy will also bring Europe closer to its people by making visible what Europe really means for them as individuals.
I would, however, also like to make some critical comments.
This House is where many political initiatives are started, and the scene of many debates, and we would very much like to see you drawing on our debates as a source for initiatives that eventually bear fruit in legislation.
What Europe needs is a single work programme for the various institutions, which would make visible the way in which they work together.
The fact is that, at the end of the day, it is we who are the peopleâs representatives; it is we who take note of what the public in the Member States are talking about and of what they want, and so we ask you to take greater account of this.
I also have some critical comments to make about the form of the work programme, which cannot be said to be coherent when it consists of two parts, neither of which has anything to do with the other â an introductory section describing in fine words what Europe is all about, followed by a second part lacking any consistency in either structure or language.
A document such as this is comprehensible only to those in the institutions who have to work with it; it is not something with which one can give the public any real idea of what Europe actually intends to do.
In exactly the same way, we demand of you that, for every initiative that you take, you also specify the legal basis for it, making it possible to trace precisely whence Europe derives the competence to do something in this particular area.
It is also advisable to minimise the number of proposals you make, for it often makes much more sense to concentrate on a few things and then do them well.
âBetter regulationâ is not just about making proposals, but also about implementing them later on.
Above all, it must mean implementing them more simply, more quickly and more directly, with priority given to the effects of legislation, which means that greater attention must be given to the costs resulting from it.
If it turns out that a piece of legislation will cost too much, and that the costs will outweigh the benefits, then it should be dispensed with.
This applies not only to new initiatives, for those that are already going through the system, along with legislation already in force, must also be evaluated in order to determine whether it really is needed or whether it costs too much.
Working on the principle that less is often more, we have prepared our own proposals, which I ask the Commissioner to draw on, since it is important that the EU should be clear, comprehensible and on a smaller scale if the public are to know what it is all about.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I believe that the Commission must now adopt its sustainable development strategy.
The issue has an effect on the debate relating to the legislative programme insofar as my group criticised the Commissionâs programme, considering that insufficient attention had been paid to the very issues concerning sustainable development.
Since last monthâs debate with MrÂ Barroso, the European Environment Agency has published a very important and very interesting report, the third five-year report on the state of the environment in the European Union and the effectiveness of the Unionâs policies.
I am not going to summarise this 750-page report in one and a half minutes, but it is clear that, in spite of the substantial progress made, the overall situation is still deteriorating in a number of sectors, not least in the transport, energy and agricultural sectors.
This report contains â and I wanted to draw your attention to this â two more very important points.
Firstly, the fact that the cost of inaction can be higher than the cost of a prevention policy.
I was truly surprised to learn that 200 million working days are lost each year due to occupational illnesses connected to air pollution.
Secondly, this report states that household expenditure will double between now and 2030.
This goes to show the relevance and importance of guiding consumersâ choices and thus of effectively applying the principle of the internalisation of costs.
That is why the resolution tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls on you, in particular, to introduce binding measures with regard to car emissions â which are linked to air pollution â to introduce implementing measures in the context of the eco design directive, on which the Commission has fallen behind in comparison with its work programme, and to introduce a tax on aviation fuel as part of a broader fiscal reform that reduces the tax on work and that, as has long been recommended, penalises those products that are harmful to the environment.
Finally, another aspect included in our resolution is the extension of the scope of the directive on buildings in favour of a more wide-ranging policy on insulation and in favour of better building insulation.
In other words, I would say that, if Bill Clinton declared at Montreal that he was fond of Kyoto, then we, for our part, know that the Commission is very fond of Lisbon.
We would hope that the Commission is even fonder of Gothenburg, and I hope that you, in particular, will make your colleagues even fonder of Gothenburg.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just returned from the Montreal climate conference, where an extremely important result was achieved: the decision to implement the Kyoto commitments to the full and to prepare to go further, by maintaining the agreement well beyond 2012 with very significant targets for reductions.
The conference revealed a determination to choose a different development path, focusing on alternative energies and energy savings, and to go down the road of multilateral cooperation, making all that the most important mission for a world caught up in an environmental crisis and the contradictions arising from increasingly marked inequalities.
Europe played an important role in the conference regarding this choice of direction, by holding a dialogue with China on its crucial opening-up and sidelining the Bush Administrationâs attempt to sabotage the talks.
To be frank, there is no significant trace of any of this in the work programme placed before us.
President Barroso is proposing free trade and dumping, the Bolkestein directive and the working time directive, and unbridled globalisation leading to increased pollution from transport emissions, which are exceeding all limits.
In the current situation of crisis and failure, MrÂ Blair, together with MrÂ Barroso, is proposing a bare-bones budget and even nuclear power, in contrast to the Montreal conference and those countries, like China, that are calling for renewables, energy savings and clean alternative sources.
I repeat: these free-trade policies have proved to be a failure.
Europe needs a new mission, and it is our duty to find one.
It needs social cohesion, innovation, environmental quality, a renewed link between the economy and the regions, cooperation, democracy and peace.
A different Europe is not just possible but is becoming increasingly necessary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when, in 1999, the Commission President promised us access to agendas and minutes in connection with the Commissionâs meetings, officials with excessively centralising tendencies immediately set about putting together new agendas with fewer points, together with distinctly pared down minutes, while the real agendas and the most complete minutes remained secret for a number of years.
The Prodi Commission also promised us a comprehensive annual programme, stating the legal basis for every individual piece of draft legislation.
The countries also agreed to let the national parliaments check specifically whether the principle of subsidiarity was being observed and have the opportunity of showing the yellow card within six weeks.
Moreover, a public debate on the annual programme would then take place in each individual parliament.
The Danish Parliament went further and wanted to allow each individual specialist committee to carry out its own check on compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.
This was almost too good to be true, but then, true to form, the officious centralisers in the Commission made it impossible to read the programme.
No national parliaments can assess what is to happen next year.
The legal basis has been removed, so it is impossible to see whether the EU is planning a harmless resolution or a binding regulation.
The proposals are not arranged according to subject, as in budgets and statute books.
The chapters now invented are called prosperity, solidarity and security.
All the descriptions have been through an Orwellian office for newspeak, so all future initiatives benefit everyone and inconvenience no one.
Every year, between 2Â 000 and 4Â 000 pieces of draft legislation are adopted, but the annual programme has only included 32 such pieces and 64 other proposals in the annual programme.
One hundred and eighty-two other pieces of draft legislation and 295 other initiatives have also been mentioned.
Why may we not see everything the Commission intends to propose for the coming year?
Again, MrÂ Barosso, let us have a complete and detailed work programme, arranged chapter by chapter and stating the legal basis for each individual proposal.
Let us see it set out on the Internet and get the debate under way on what we cannot decide on effectively ourselves and are therefore trying to resolve through the EU or other international fora.
That debate is a very practical one, but can only be serious if it is based on the full and unadorned annual programme.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst the Commission talks in its programme about, and I quote, âclosing the communication gapâ and, and I quote again, âstrengthening the democratic foundations of the European projectâ, in practice, we have to conclude that all of this remains theory and that this selfsame Commission very often pursues a policy that is fundamentally undemocratic.
