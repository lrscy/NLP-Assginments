There is one great issue currently hanging in the balance.
This is, or should be, the establishment of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state, based on the principles of inclusion, representation and responsibility.
This issue has come to the fore because the media has played up the religious reawakening in Iran.
The latest debates at the United Nations show that past disagreements have been overcome and that there is now space for everyone to adopt constructive attitudes. Mr President, I believe this is the line the European Union should take.
We have to help promote stability in the region. We must act and we must use our ability to engage in dialogues with the countries of the region to the full.
Lebanon now has an Association Agreement with the European Union.
Syria is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Association. We are currently engaged in a critical dialogue with Iran and we should also pursue the objectives of the so-called road-map.
The United States, Mr President, has proposed an ambitious free trade agreement with the countries of the region.
The European Union must use its ability to engage in dialogue to the full. We must work to ensure that the region is stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic.
Minister, the next informal meeting due to be held in Crete on 26 and 27 May should serve as a unique opportunity to develop the role the European Union must play in this difficult situation.
Mr President, I have to say that I am surprised at how little has been said in this debate about the fact that a people has been liberated, that freedom reigns where terror once did and that Shia clerics are now able to return to Iraq in an atmosphere of religious toleration where once they were murdered.
In the last few days we have seen a reminder of the nature of Saddam's regime with the discovery of yet another mass grave.
Too much of the debate has been about apportioning blame for what has happened in the past and too little of it has been about looking forward.
Ensuring that Iraq is run by Iraqis for Iraqis should be an absolute priority.
The wishes and needs of the Iraqi people should be paramount.
It is for that reason that I welcome the draft UN Resolution, which addresses the immediate needs of the Iraqi people.
It lifts sanctions: how many people in this Chamber have been calling for that over the last few years?
It envisages a political process to put the country back into the hands of the Iraqis with the involvement of a UN special coordinator.
It sets up a process to wind up the 'Oil for Food' programme while ensuring that oil can only be sold for the benefit of the Iraqi people and it creates a new fund for the reconstruction and humanitarian needs of Iraq which involves the IMF and the World Bank.
There are of course many problems to be dealt with.
We cannot run reconstruction from the top down as if it were a military campaign.
We cannot impose systems and procedures dreamed up in Washington and expect them to work.
We have to have a bottom-up approach which involves the Iraqi people first and foremost.
In order for that to happen, the establishment of security, effective policing and the rule of law should be given absolute priority.
My concern is that American troops, unlike British troops, are not equipped for policing action and our priority therefore should be to get police into northern Iraq.
We have already seen security established largely in southern Iraq.
My final concern is that there has been no proper discussion on debt reconstruction in Iraq, nor even on who the debt belongs to.
Until we resolve these issues there will be no long-term solution for Iraq.
Mr President, after all the misery they have endured, the liberated Iraqi people are now falling victim as we debate who is allowed to help them.
Does the reconstruction have to remain in the hands of the Americans with a supporting role for the UN or will it be a truly international enterprise?
Bush and Blair of course are disinclined to give the members of the anti-war coalition a leading role and to allow them to benefit from juicy reconstruction contracts.
But only the UN can end the sanctions and in particular open the door to substantial international contributions and judge with authority whether the new Iraqi Government is truly representative.
It is very important that the oil revenues should benefit the Iraqi people rather than ending up in the pockets of the President's Texan friends.
Commissioner Nielson appears to share my fear in this regard.
Can he explain his statement that America is well on the way to becoming a member of OPEC?
The European Union can and must make a humanitarian contribution, a very important one in fact: special attention to women and children, but also to the construction of a democratic constitutional state.
If we keep arguing about the role of the EU and the UN, in the end there will only be one victim and that is the Iraqi people.
Mr President, the chairman of our group has already covered what I wanted to say.
I would point out: first, disgust and condemnation for what happened yesterday in Saudi Arabia - yes, but let us not forget that Commissioner Patten closed his speech when the war started by saying that the situation and developments in Iraq would exacerbate the problem of terrorism - and now we are reaping the fruit of the deeds of the United States and Great Britain, and of this tacit stance on the part of the European Union.
Secondly, I feel sorry for the European Parliament.
We are living through one of the darkest days of the European Parliament.
What shall we say to our citizens during the European elections in a year's time?
What did we do doing the war?
We did not pass a single decision, a single resolution.
What did we do after the war?
When we have cholera, when we have dozens dead, when we have the looting of Baghdad museum, when we have the looting of nuclear facilities, we do not pass a decision, we do not pass a resolution, because those who back the war do not want the European Parliament to pass a resolution and stand before European public opinion.
Thirdly, a call to the president-in-office: not allied forces, Mr President-in-Office, not allied forces!
They are occupying forces.
That is what we should call them, because the European Union should not back faits accomplis.
As many people have already said, the justification for the invasion and occupation of Iraq was about the existence of weapons of mass destruction but, as we all know, it was more about regime change.
As Mr Sakellariou said, there is no justification in international law for the invasion and occupation of a country to change the regime in that country.
It sets a very dangerous precedent.
However, in relation to weapons of mass destruction, none have been found.
That is clear.
This was the justification, despite what some people were saying all along about the situation.
It is essential that the weapons inspectors return to Iraq, for Hans Blix to be allowed back in.
Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there.
As we all know, that is highly unlikely.
It also means that the US, the UK and the others who supported them are pursuing a shoot-to-kill policy - i.e. we believe or suspect the Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction, therefore we go in, we shoot and kill the people and then afterwards we find out there was no justification for this action.
This is a war crime in my eyes.
I do not believe that there was any justification for what happened in Iraq.
It is essential that the weapons inspectors be allowed back in.
In relation to the proposal mentioned by several speakers, this UK-, US- and Spanish-backed proposal for a UN resolution would put the administration of Iraq, including decisions on its oil reserves, into the hands of the invaders and occupying forces.
This is blatant, modern-day colonialism and we should not allow it.
In relation to Iraq itself, Iraq was one of the countries in the region with the most advanced education system, with education for all - male and female alike.
Now that education system has been completely decimated.
Some people today have mentioned women's rights within Iraq.
One of the ways to ensure that women are liberated, have rights and know their rights, is through a proper education system.
What will happen in relation to the education system in Iraq and how will it be reinstated?
So, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, the opponents of the war were right.
The destabilisation, the aggression and the invasion of Iraq caused by the US-UK union - the only union which is at this minute still standing - no more sought to topple the Baath socialist regime than to destroy phantom weapons of mass destruction.
Very simply, the aim was the wholesale destruction of Iraq in order to realise the ideological and industrial designs of the small gang of theorists with a portfolio who reign in Washington.
They really could not care less about peace in the Middle East or the Iraqi people, who they are deliberately - and I mean deliberately - plunging into anarchy, with its terrible trail of unspeakable violence and suffering. They play with people as one plays with marbles, and that is the way of empires, particularly this US empire.
Europe has allowed its creation out of cowardice, by eradicating its only roots, its nations, in particular France, which is the only country to implement an independent global policy, and not because Europe is old but simply because, deprived of national vigour, it is politically dead.
It will therefore only be further hypocrisy to speak today in this ludicrous forum of rebuilding Iraq, when what is really on the agenda is destroying Iraq until not a stone remains standing, except, of course, for the derricks.
The question is not how to rebuild, but to what extent we will destroy Iraq, humiliate the Arab people and heighten their anger to play into the hands of the ideologists who want at all costs to provoke a general war between civilisations, which will be a war against civilisations, beginning with what is left of our own.
Mr President, the situation in Iraq now presents us with the extremely difficult task of determining how the transition process will be legitimised and guided after the end of the war towards the free, democratic system founded on political, religious and ethnic diversity that we all wish to see.
The motion for a resolution submitted by the United States to the UN on Friday appears to reduce the Security Council's involvement to a minor role, regulates the use of the oil reserves rigorously according to a preconceived order and, lastly, fails to set a term to the duration of the US and UK administration, which means it will probably remain in place for quite some time.
Lastly, it is said that the interim administration will be managed by the occupying powers, together with the Iraqi people and a UN coordinator.
The formula is generic and seems to confine the role of the UN chiefly to the coordination of humanitarian aid or not much more.
Europe is sending a specific request for much greater involvement in the immediate term.
Since the European Union is the closest entity in geopolitical terms, it would be truly absurd for it not to be involved in a process which is so important for the future of the region.
Moreover, we cannot endorse the US strategy to create a link with the talks with Iran, intended to avert the danger of the large Shiite population having a destabilising effect.
This ethno-religious situation must be evaluated with extreme care, but Europe cannot now stand by and do nothing in the face of the terrifying scenes heralded by the Al Qaeda's resumption of its strategy of terror.
The stabilisation of Iraq, with measures to ensure religious peace between the different ethic elements, is clearly necessary in a region such as the Gulf where the insidious web of Islamic terrorism is so desperately strong and has penetrated so very deep.
This attack, which is reminiscent of the attack in Chechnya, makes the challenge posed to the West by the international web of Islamic fanaticism a matter of great relevance once again.
Therefore, over and above its differences with the United States over Iraq, Europe must shoulder all its responsibilities and combat organised terrorism, which, as has now been extensively proven, is finding a home even in the Member States of the European Union, in many mosques and Islamic centres, often funded by Saudi Arabia.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, first let me say how much I welcome this debate on Iraq.
It is a sign that we Europeans wish to shoulder responsibility for the post-war situation in Iraq and look forwards.
That is why I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a resolution on the post-war situation in Iraq, because that would have meant us getting embroiled in a debate about guilt and expiation within the European Union, about our inconsistent positions towards the United States and the different roles we envisage for the United Nations.
No one would benefit from that, least of all the Iraqis themselves.
I would like to say at this point, however, that we do support a central role for the United Nations, for one simple reason: if you are administering a foreign country, you need to have legitimacy under international law.
Iraq's chief administrator should therefore have a UN mandate.
We must ensure that the money from the Oil-for-Food Programme is used for the benefit of the people of Iraq.
All the economic and financial sanctions imposed against Iraq in 1990 should be lifted immediately.
Now that Saddam Hussein's regime has been toppled, there can be no further reason to maintain those sanctions.
I regard the debate about exactly what is meant by a central United Nations role in the reconstruction of Iraq as being a somewhat artificial one.
In a country where civil order has broken down, and where the basic structures of a functioning administration still need to be set up, where the regime has left behind an appalling legacy of hardship and violence and the most basic things are lacking, it is essential to focus on humanitarian assistance and its coordination.
This is an area where the European Union has a greater part to play, and I support the ECHO programme already under way.
It is in any case time that we avoided giving the impression that the United States alone is acting while the 15 Member States of the European Union are still talking, so that once the dust has settled after the Iraq war the European Union should primarily set itself the task of sorting out its relations with the United States.
We will soon be welcoming Mr Kwasniewski, the President of Poland, who represents a state that acted alongside the USA in Iraq, but who will nevertheless be telling us that he is interested in a common foreign and security policy.
Before we start casting doubt on these countries' European ideals - and those of Member States of the EU - it would be better if we considered viewing all those countries that were the United States' allies in military action as potential bridges between ourselves and Washington.
Just as with the 'Quartet' in the Middle East, it is only credible for the EU to act in partnership with the US, not in opposition to it.
Mr President, I am not a particular friend of the Bush government, but I would take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the Americans and the coalition for the military action in Iraq.
It was swift and effective and succeeded in its purpose of removing of an evil regime.
The terrible consequences for the whole of the Middle East foreseen by some in this plenary did not arise.
Having thanked the Americans, it is time to tell them that we do not expect them to stay in Iraq for one hour longer than is necessary.
I am confident that they share this view, and it is my hope that the United Nations will play the dominant role in post-war Iraq.
The European Union too has a role to play in Iraq in the months to come - the role of supporting democratic development in order to stabilise the whole region.
We can draw on the experiences of the Union's efforts in Afghanistan and I look forward to seeing a united Europe behind this new, big challenge in Iraq, starting with the lifting of sanctions.
Mr President, in my one minute, I should like briefly to emphasise the following: it is a disgrace that there will be no resolution today, obviously because the majority does not want the unprovoked illegal attack by the United States and Great Britain to be condemned.
That was also clear from most of the speeches today.
Neither the Commissioner nor the Presidency, while condemning the terrorist attack in Riad, had so much as a word, even of disapproval, for the predatory, terrorist, criminal attack by the United States and Great Britain.
It is a disgrace!
On the contrary, even today they essentially wanted to legalise the crime by unashamedly acknowledging the responsibility of the occupying forces for keeping order and for reconstruction, obviously hoping that the European Union will be given a slice of the pie.
It is a disgrace!
Neither one nor the other stood up against the position of the United States on a preventive strike, leaving the way clear for the crime to be repeated.
Besides, they all, including the European Union, agreed in Prague on the preventive strike.
Once again, it is a disgrace, Mr President.
It is up to us to roundly condemn the crime.
To call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq and for the invaders to pay the cost of restoring the damage they caused.
For the invaders and their Iraqi associates to be convicted as war criminals.
The UN must decide even at this late stage on strict sanctions against the invaders and must supervise payment of the compensation.
And finally, for the Iraqi people to be left free to take its fate in its own hands without conquerors.
Consequently, the Iraqi people must organise and develop their national resistance.
Only the defeat of the conquerors will bring peace and order.
We owe them our solidarity.
Mr President, I regret the fact that this debate is not to be followed by a resolution, as it is vital for Parliament to send a political signal to the general public regarding this serious international crisis triggered off by the United States' warmongering diplomacy.
That has demonstrated to a ridiculous extent what virtually the entire international community condemned as the real driving force behind this unilateral aggression, as my colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group had already pointed out.
These measures, however, cannot be reduced to mere verbal condemnation. In the fact of this global hegemonic power, the credibility, and even the future, of the UN has received a dangerous blow and we cannot remain indifferent to this.
It has had a knock-on effect on the political goals of our Community project too, on its attempt to unite the voices of Europe in both a spirit of consensus and international legitimacy.
Twenty-four million souls are abandoned to their sorry fate, without even a guarantee that their daily needs will be met.
This is indeed a very, very serious hour and a European initiative is urgently required.
We cannot content ourselves with becoming a reconstruction agency, although that task is absolutely necessary and urgent.
The jeopardising of a potential historic turning point in the international situation has now become more than just a slick, journalistic phrase.
The threat is very real and seems to be being overlooked in this Chamber.
It is therefore up to this enlarged Parliament, including the observers from the new Member countries, to realise that the European Union must propose a more mature, more long-term alternative in light of the United States' opportunistic and mercenary calculations.
It is up to us to consider, for instance, the legalist voices, such as France, Germany and Belgium, and establish a common, united position.
Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the UN must be restored to its place at the centre of the international negotiating mechanism.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today I want to talk about the lessons the Union must learn from its impotence throughout this entire Iraqi crisis, something that you yourselves have quite rightly lamented.
On 10 April, by a majority of three-quarters, Parliament adopted a resolution on the new European security and defence architecture, desirable at the end of this war.
This very broad consensus does not come as a surprise as even the latest Eurobarometer polls indicate that 71% of EU citizens are currently in favour of the development of a common policy in this area.
Moreover, this request is also coming from outside the Union, from the many parties who wish the European Union to play its part in managing the affairs of a world whose future must no longer rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America.
It must be said that this long-awaited Europe does not yet exist, and it will not exist until the institutional reforms which are vital for its operation have been implemented.
That is the inspiration behind Parliament's proposals, although we are well aware of the limits to their scope.
We are quite aware that it will ultimately be up to the Convention to recommend whether they be adopted.
If three quarters of the Members of Parliament were prepared to take up such a clear and, in certain cases, courageous stance on this issue in a roll-call vote last month, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is because, thanks to the Iraqi crisis, they understood that it was essential to give their unreserved support to our colleagues currently working in the working groups on defence, chaired by Commissioner Barnier, and on foreign policy, chaired by Mr Dehaene.
Having learned the lessons of the Iraqi crisis and appalled by the cacophony that prevailed within the Union during the crisis, all those in favour of building a common house agree that tomorrow's Europe of 25 members will take its rightful place in the international arena, which it has been unable to retain as a Europe of Fifteen.
The main goal must be to enable Europe to speak with a single voice at last.
If the Convention succeeds in this, it will be because it has been able to learn from the recent divisions, which I, like you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, am convinced are more illusory than real.
Mr President, there are no bounds to my joy at the toppling of Saddam Hussein and of his regime, but that does not mean that I do not believe as strongly as ever that this war was wrong.
It was in contravention of international law and there was an alternative; I am surprised that so few Members remember that in May 2002 we agreed on an alternative course.
It seems that many of us have a very short memory.
However, let me peer into the future: the conscience of the world, and that includes the conscience and the views of the Polish Pope, has been assuaged by promises that the United Nations would be involved after the war and that the international community would come into its own then.
The draft Security Council resolution is a farce and the British minister Clare Short has acted consistently by resigning.
Now let me look a little further into the future, and consider the Middle East peace process.
In this case too we were told that the Iraq war would make it possible to set the peace process in train, but that nothing had yet been decided.
So how do things look now?
On the Palestinian side an important step has, thank goodness, been taken in response to pressure from the US and principally from Europe, with the appointment for the first time of a prime minister, Abu Mazen.
We wish to give him our full support so that he can do what he has promised and what in my view he would really like to do - to fight violence and terrorism.
But the reaction on the Israeli side, or to be precise on the part of Mr Sharon's Israeli government, is not exactly positive.
If Mr Sharon refuses to welcome Mr Solana, then that is something the entire European Union should be protesting against.
Just as Mr Sharon cannot claim, thank goodness, to speak for the whole of Israel, nor can Abu Mazen - unfortunately - claim at present to represent the whole of Palestine.
Arafat is also a force in Palestine that we need to win over to this peace process, and that is why discussions with him are also both necessary and justified.
I have to say, however, that I have heard relatively little from those people who claimed before the war that we would be on the 'peace front' after the war, working to achieve peace.
I have in mind in particular Spain's Prime Minister Aznar.
I am pleased to say that Mr Papandreou, on the other hand, is very active.
I also hear a lot from Mr Solana, and I hope that everyone in this House and in Europe will now at least attempt to achieve progress in the peace process in Israel and Palestine, and to implement the road map, even if it leaves a lot to be desired.
For there can no longer be any excuse nor the least justification for this war, if we cannot even get the peace process going.
Mr President, we are glad the dictatorship in Iraq has come to an end. It should be borne in mind however that the war was not fought simply to end the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.
The United States tolerates other dictatorships around the world. Wars are not fought about those.
We Spaniards lived for over 20 years under a dictatorship directly supported by the United States.
The stated aim of the war was the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons have been found, however.
I would like to point out that a conference was held in the Azores prior to the war in Iraq. It was attended by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of Spain.
The last group photograph before the attack on Iraq was taken there.
Now the war is over, however, control of Iraq has not been divided between those who attended the Azores conference. It has been divided instead between the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland.
Spain has been sidelined.
Its involvement does not seem to be consistent with its government's support for the war.
Much more than the Archaeological Museum has been destroyed in Iraq.
There is a great deal of reconstruction work to be done.
Let us hope too that the United Nations will once again become the guarantor of world order.
It is perhaps not generally known that the small country I come from is among those countries that have given the United States an unconditional endorsement.
In this quite surrealistic debate, I should like, moreover, to draw attention to a most outstanding contribution by my fellow countryman and fellow MEP, Mr Andreasen from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, who is closely associated with the Danish Prime Minister. Normally, he speaks in Danish, which is a good idea.
As a symbolic act, he gave his speech in English, however, and that of course brilliantly reflects his close relationship with the Danish Prime Minister, who belongs to the same political party as himself and is a close colleague of his. The Danish Prime Minister spent five days in Washington, and the press - the Danish world press, with which my fellow MEPs are probably unfamiliar - described how, during the concluding session, as the Prime Minister paid tribute to President Bush for his honourable conduct, the strains of Mendelsohn's Wedding March from the famous play were suddenly heard.
I should like, moreover, to emphasise - for my fellow MEPs may well not be aware of this - that Mr Andreasen, who gave the Prime Minister his unconditional endorsement, is certainly no slouch when it comes to irony.
The rhetoric on which the Danish Government's endorsement of the United States is based is so absurd that only a major ironist could expose it, as my fellow MEP did so brilliantly, it being understood that what is so surreal about this debate is that the EU has no common foreign policy and that this Parliament would in any case have no influence over such a policy.
Mr President, I wish firstly to thank Commissioner Nielson and Mr Yiannitsis from the Greek Presidency for their contributions.
Commissioner Nielson deserves special recognition for his visit to Baghdad to ensure that the EU's humanitarian activity was getting under way quickly.
In the debate here today, I agree with Mr Titley that we have a tendency to ignore the fact that the population of Iraq has in actual fact been liberated from a tyrant.
Baroness Nicholson, who has just returned from Iraq, testified to the joy felt by large portions of the population at having been liberated following decades of terror.
I was among those who were opposed to the war, but I cannot refrain from expressing deep satisfaction at the fact that a people that has lived under oppression for so long is now being given the opportunity to build its own future.
Everything depends of course upon how the reconstruction is organised.
The United States went into Iraq on the basis of arguments concerning Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and links with Al Qaeda.
It was emphasised very often that economic interests had nothing to do with the matter.
Nonetheless, an organisation for reconstruction is now emerging that is under the total control of the Americans.
The Bush administration has already distributed multi-billion dollar contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq to American companies.
As I am well aware, having worked for the UN, tender procedures of this type normally go via the UN or the World Bank, and that is of course what should happen in this case too.
Otherwise, there are no guarantees against arbitrariness in the tender procedure itself and in the way in which the income from Iraqi oil is used.
Only a UN mandate can give legitimacy to the reconstruction of Iraq.
That should of course be obvious, especially to us Europeans.
The basis on which we ourselves are entitled to make agreements has been established precisely in order to create stability and predictability in relations between our states.
I appreciate that it is difficult precisely to define the EU's role in the reconstruction until UN decisions have made matters clear.
The difficulties also have to do, of course, with the division between the Member States before and during the war.
I agree with what Mr Poettering said, namely that that there is more that unites our Member States than divides them.
I am therefore disappointed that the EU has not succeeded in uniting around a proactive plan for how best to make use of our special experience of reconstruction.
I read in Scandinavian newspapers that individual Member States, such as Denmark, are preparing to contribute to the long-term reconstruction.
That is naturally commendable, but what would of course be more significant is for the EU, under the leadership of the Commission, to draw up such a plan.
Time will not now permit me to define which tasks we are concerned with here, but, clearly, we are talking, above all, about efforts in the legal area and in the areas of education and of medical treatment and health care etc. I would therefore call upon both the Presidency and the Commission immediately to devise such a proposal so that the EU can regain a portion of its reputation and, above all, play that central role in international politics and in this region that the situation demands.
Mr President, the highly predictable military victory of the US and UK forces in Iraq has generated among some people a sort of ad hoc opportunism: let us forget all about past quarrels and let us build a democratic Iraq under the expert leadership of the US.
This vision, although legally tenable, is unlikely to get European foreign policy off to a good start again.
We will not pick up the pieces and re-establish European unity as a future project by drawing a veil over the causes of the unilateral military operation and the manner in which it was planned and decided.
We must first expose the falsehood, which I would call the falsehood of the century, the claim that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction that could threaten global security.
Not a single prohibited weapon has been found.
It becomes clearer every day that the people of the world as well as the United Nations have been fooled by those who have wanted for a long time to find a pretext for war at all costs.
We must also condemn a second falsehood, which claims that the United Nations has failed and that, as a result, the reconstruction of Iraq and its oil - which some call the spoils of war - should be a matter for the victors.
The United Nations has not failed.
It has been brutally swept aside by those who did not succeed in achieving the qualified majority required by the Security Council.
Although international law has been violated, there is now a chance to reestablish it.
As far as the European Union is concerned, this means reestablishing the United Nations' responsibility for crisis management in full.
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to reject the United States' requests and to remain firm in their desire to entrust the UN, and the UN alone, with a central role in post-war Iraq.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, however strange it may sound, I do not feel there is any point in taking advantage of and squandering the 3 minutes at my disposal to make you suffer by repeating everything that has been said to saturation point in this Chamber on the tragedy in Iraq over the last few months.
That is why I shall also confine myself to one question which, in my opinion, needs to be asked as a matter of priority now by the European Parliament, the elected representative body of the peoples of Europe, to whom we have to answer for our judgments and decisions and who are interested and ultimately entitled to have at least one answer as regards the pretexts which the leadership of the war coalition used primarily in order to justify its actions and persuade or deceive international and, in particular, European public opinion.
What, in other words, was the specific outcome of the attack on Iraq and the triumphant military victory over the regime of Saddam Hussein, as regards the location and neutralisation of the banned Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, the establishment of a democratic and representative Iraqi government and the elimination of international terrorism and, in particular Al Qaeda?
Mr President, today's interesting debate has allowed us to look at certain interesting things.
The first interesting element - a positive element for me - is the revision of the views expressed by the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Poettering.
The second interesting element is that certain people created a climate in favour of our thanking Mr Rumsfeld, who overturned Saddam, his old friend, because it looks like it means a pure revision of opinions.
The third element is the effort and the positions to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq; this too is positive and I hope there will not be some people, in a few years' time, who maintain that the stolen exhibits are in various museums, just as the Acropolis marbles are in the British Museum, and that these antiquities or cultural monuments are better protected than they were in the countries in which they originated.
In all events, today we face political premises.
The only body that can resolve the problem and restore international relations where they need to be restored is the United Nations Organization.
So, under these circumstances, the European Union and its members which are also members of the Security Council must make a contribution in this direction and the fact that the new resolution which is being discussed was again submitted jointly by certain members of the European Union and members of the Security Council is not a positive factor.
I hope that the experience and problems will lead us to more positive thoughts, will lead the leadership of Europe to more positive prospects.
However, there have to be certain principles.
What are they?
The Middle East, the wider area, for a number of years recently, if we want to take a brief look at history, has been absolutely tormented by various regimes, one after the other, in a bad era, a colonial era.
If certain powers continue to endeavour to give answers to the area with similar variations, be they sultans or maharajas or emirs or puppet political prime ministers, Europe must not allow it.
We 25 came here with an understanding of democracy, freedom and rights.
We did not come with the intention of reproducing nineteenth century premises with new forms and new compromises.
Mr President, the success of the US operation in Iraq and the speed with which the objective of liberating the country from the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein was achieved, with a relatively low toll of victims, are confirmation of what many had thought, namely that the war was going to be the least difficult part of this operation.
The attack in Riyadh - which is already giving some people, not least in this House, a perverse, ill-concealed sense of satisfaction because they now feel justified in saying 'We knew there was no point in attacking Iraq' - is proof that the real war against terrorism is only just starting.
Now starts the phase of reconstructing the country, which has been destroyed and laid waste, and of mending the alliances compromised by the war.
With the help of the 10 countries which we have just welcomed into our midst, the European Union must show that is capable of genuine unity.
Of course, it is exciting to see that, after this war which some people still persist in describing as unnecessary, pamphlets, books and newspapers are being sold on the streets of Baghdad which would have led to a prison sentence and torture under Saddam Hussein - or, elsewhere, under Communism.
We will soon be listening to the President of Poland, Mr Kwasniewski, speaking in this House.
He and I belong to different political wings, but he has shown himself to be a courageous leader, giving his country's support for the intervention in Iraq, and this has earned him the criticism of those Heads of State and Government which made the wrong political decision and now find it hard to admit their error.
In his meeting with Mr Chirac and Mr SchrÃ¶der last week, President Kwasniewski asked for Poland not to be forced to choose between Europe and the United States: it is possible to be the friend of both.
We in Parliament must endeavour to be the friends of both as well.
Mr President, it is a matter of regret that Parliament has found it impossible to construct a resolution for today's debate.
It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree.
We would, of course, have had to leave aside a lot of the self-justification that we all tend to engage in on all sides.
I oppose the war and I continue to oppose its outcome and the direction which Iraq is taking at the present time.
However, we must seek to reconstruct confidence in a law-based world order.
We cannot do that by seeking to justify ourselves in terms of our attitudes to the war.
We have to do it by, in the first place, seeking to construct a unity in the European Union.
We have to find a middle ground between those who see a need for a unipolar world and those who see the need for a multipolar world.
There is no way out of this.
The European Union has to address this issue.
It could give a lead in trying to do this and I hope that when they meet next week the leaders of our groups will seek to put in place some mechanism to enable Parliament to address this matter.
We cannot seriously ask the people to support us in the European elections next year and at the same time pretend we do not have a role and that we have nothing to say about the direction the world is going in.
This is of the utmost importance.
We are talking about war and peace.
Life is still cheap in the Middle East and we will continue to count the cost of the recent war for a very long time.
We need to get to grips with our different world views.
We need to get to grips with the United States and persuade them that a law-based world order is far better than a Pax Americana.
In their interests and in our interests it is essential that we do this as a matter of urgency.
Mr President, I first wish to join with the other Members in condemning the terrible terrorist atrocity in Riyadh and offering sympathy to the bereaved and injured.
Now that the war in Iraq has ended, the emphasis shifts to rebuilding and reconstruction.
As well as the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq, we also have to rebuild relationships within the EU itself and our credibility in the field of common foreign and security policy, we have to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the UN and, last but not least, we have to rebuild the transatlantic relationship.
The attitude of the US in the post-war situation will provide the key as to whether or not we can achieve any or all of these.
I value the transatlantic relationship.
It is in the interest of both the EU and the United States that the present rift in our relationship be healed.
However, it has to be said that it must be a genuine partnership of equals and not simply one in which the EU role is that of a junior partner and in which we are automatically expected to support US foreign policy without question and, if we disagree with aspects of it, are accused of being disloyal and anti-American.
What has been totally unacceptable is the reported anti-French hysteria, in particular that attributed to the Washington Government establishment.
There needs to be a change in the attitude of the current US Administration if the transatlantic relationship is indeed to be restored.
Giving the United Nations the lead role in post-war Iraq, as EU leaders have requested, would be the clearest demonstration on the part of the United States that it values the transatlantic relationship and it genuinely wants to rebuild it.
It should not be forgotten that the United Nations fulfilled a similar role in East Timor in 1999.
This experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of Iraq.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, before the war, during the war, and today, after the war in Iraq, Parliament has faithfully analysed the situation and expressed its views.
Unfortunately, these views have differed, but that is the way things are: the European Union is divided.
Today's debate therefore allows us all to reaffirm our principles.
Mine have not changed. I wholly condemn Saddam Hussein's regime, but I fear that the way in which the United States brought it down has created a situation which is, if not equally horrific, at least as unmanageable.
I do not endorse wars that are decided upon unilaterally. I believe the role of international organisations must be reaffirmed, particularly the role of the UN, not only in approving the use of force but also in supervising reconstruction.
Reaffirming principles is a good start but it is not enough.
Rebuilding after destroying is a duty, including for those who in no way participated in the destruction.
Yet this is still not enough.
We must also do everything in our power to understand why and how Europeans as well as Europeans and Americans have become so divided.
We must do everything in our power to rebuild our union, not just around a table but in our minds too.
This means that we must work flat out to agree on a vision of the world or, at least, to achieve converging visions on major problems such as transatlantic relations, the role and reforms of international organisations, the role of the law and of force, and so on. These are difficult subjects and are sometimes even taboo subjects.
These efforts to achieve mutual understanding and clarification of ideas by seeking consensus whenever possible, however, are utterly essential for us after the blow we have been dealt.
It is absolutely vital to rebuild Iraq and to save human lives.
Nonetheless, we must also rebuild, or rather build, a common vision of the world and our responsibilities in the world.
The Greek Presidency has endeavoured to begin this work, but we have a long, long way to go.
Mr President, we have to recognise that the relationship between the European Union and the United States is at an all-time low.
I believe that over the coming months we have a role to play in this Parliament, along with the Council and the Commission, to rebuild that relationship.
When we recognise the great need there will be to rebuild Iraq, we must also recognise the tremendous need to rebuild the relationship between the European Union and the United States.
We have to face up to the truth.
The truth is that we have grown apart.
Each of us has focused on different priorities and, in many ways, we have ceased to understand each other's concerns.
After the attacks on the Twin Towers on that terrible day in 2001, the United States concentrated on terrorism: where the next attack was coming from, homeland security.
In Europe we went on to bring in the euro and concentrate on enlargement.
To some extent we have lost track of what we have been trying to do.
We have both retreated to hurling insults at each other across the Atlantic.
Now is the time for each of us, on both sides of the pond, to take a step back and allow things to calm down.
We must begin to rebuild that relationship.
We have far too great a common bond.
We share common values.
We must not allow recent events to continue, or ferment or destroy us.
Yes, it will take time and no doubt it will be difficult.
There will always be disagreements between us and the United States.
Let us hope that those disagreements, in the future, will only be in the WTO, over steel or on trade.
Those are natural disagreements, which we can have.
But let us begin a renewed, an improved, deeper relationship and one that will not crumble as the last one did.
Mr President, I too should like to express my deepest disappointment at the fact that we proved unable to agree on a joint resolution of the European Parliament, despite the fact that today's debate shows that there is common ground, that there are the materials to build a common European identity.
An identity that can offer politics, logic and culture against the violence and the social and cultural barbarity being promoted by the new military doctrine of the United States.
The European Union has a duty and an obligation to study in depth the new international situation being created by American expansionism and the untrustworthiness of the neo-conservative American leadership.
We have a duty to demand answers to questions which still remain open:
First, about the blatant violation of international law with an aggressive war; secondly, about the attempt to deceive public opinion about alleged weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be the lie of the century; thirdly, about the barbaric looting of cultural treasures, and I hope that no museum will dare receive the stolen goods; fourthly, about the annihilation of hundreds of civilians, about the destruction of infrastructures, about the bombing of television stations and the murder of journalists and, last but not least, about the war unleashed by the United States against the United Nations.
Certainly, the collapse of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein cannot be used to whitewash the Americans and their allies.
Finally, I should like to stress that the worthy women of Iraq can make a decisive contribution to the ending of the chaos in post-war Iraq, to the reconstruction of the country and to the future democratic governance.
The presidency and the Commission must demand the immediate application of unanimous UN resolution 1325 calling for increased participation and representation of women in all decision-making centres at all levels.
And finally, we hope that on 21 June the European Union will exert its influence so that decisions are taken that will implement the road map, so that a fair solution can at last be found to the question of the Middle East and a climate of trust can be restored with the Arab world.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your office informed me today that during this debate I would receive a satisfactory response to my request concerning the disloyalty to Europe shown by Mr Aznar in relation to the war in Iraq.
Would you not agree that the disloyalty shown by Mr Aznar is reprehensible?
There is abundant proof that Mr Aznar worked actively against the letter of the Council agreement of 17 February.
Clearly, he acted disloyally with regard to the common position he was bound by.
He acted disloyally in supporting a unilateral, immoral and illegal attack.
What can the European loyalty and mutual solidarity we committed ourselves to in the Treaties mean to Mr Aznar?
Where was his loyal cooperation?
Do you not agree that such disloyalty is reprehensible?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we should not hush up or ignore the growing disloyalty of Mr Aznar. Over 90% of the people of Spain condemn the disloyalty shown by their Prime Minister.
They feel profoundly European and call for the principles of loyalty and solidarity to be defended. After all, these principles are key to our progress in future.
Mr President, a few very brief final comments on the debate in Parliament this morning.
We have to deal with three issues that are closely bound up with each other.
The main issue, I think, is what we are doing in Iraq immediately, what we are doing in Iraq in relation to the problems that have arisen, with the misery, with the people, with the need to restore normalcy, to combat the phenomena tormenting the people over there.
I think that, at this stage of the debate, this is much more important than debating internal divisions and a series of other issues which are of course important, but which are not as pressing or urgent as the situation in Iraq.
I think that the European Union, to judge by appearances, has answers to this.
It has both practical answers - humanitarian aid, support for cultural issues, support and pressure to find a peace process in the Middle East - and political answers to a series of issues which I shall not repeat, because it is important that the European Union has come out, has supported these principles, has made the efforts it has made during all these months for a different position to be heard on a series of such issues.
The second point, of course, is what happens with the international system, with the role of the UN, where this war in Iraq has got us in terms of weapons of mass destruction.
There are important gaps here which need answers.
In fact, the European Union does, I think, have a position here and you here, today, raised a series of issues and it is important that they be raised and answered.
The third point, the major issue to come out of this entire crisis is the need for a common foreign policy, a common policy on security and defence issues.
I think that, within all these procedures, a new momentum has started up in the European Union, from which we need to learn lessons and see what we can do.
I should like, however, to close by commenting that many who speak of the need for a common foreign policy or common security or defence policy consider that what must of necessity emerge from these procedures are decisions or positions which correspond absolutely to their creed and their positions.
This is precisely the problem we have in developing a common foreign policy.
This policy will prosper, will become a reality only once we realise that we need to broker compromises between us, understand the positions developed by all of us and find those elements that can unite us, that can act as a common denominator, and not those elements on which we have differences.
It was this approach, moreover, that allowed us, I believe, over the last two or three months, to take certain steps in this direction, steps which were welcomed both by public opinion and by you here, by the European Parliament.
Mr President, my first remark in response to this discussion is that I am very pleased to note, and I agree with the way Mr De Rossa put it, that there is broad agreement in Parliament on most of the important elements of the situation.
This discussion in Parliament has shown that the European Parliament is a source of constructive ideas in the EU and a lot of inspiration can be drawn from what has been said this morning.
A lot of inspiration is needed.
My second remark is specifically to Mr Titley, who raised the issue of Iraq's debt.
This is a core element in clearing the ground so that we can move forward.
Success depends on focussing on the issue of handling and clarifying Iraq's debt.
To do this an honest broker is needed.
It is not conceivable that the occupying power would ever be seen as that.
This is one very good illustration, relating to a very practical and crucial point, of the need to have the UN playing exactly that role of honest broker.
We need to ask all creditors to come forward to present their case.
We can use the IMF and the World Bank as the treasurer of this operation, and use the UN as the honest broker.
Anything else will not work, but instead create suspicion.
To Mr Andreasen, who expressed a strong hope that the UN will have a real role, I would say, please spend the minutes it takes to read the draft resolution now on the table at the Security Council.
Having done so, please talk to your Prime Minister.
This is what must be done to bring that hope into what looks a little like political talk.
On the big, broader issue of the role of the Commission and reconstruction, it is not enough for Member States to say that they want the Commission to do something in this area.
If we do not organise the basic political conditions properly, it will be difficult for the Commission to play a meaningful, effective role.
The reality here is that we are still in a phase where the basic, real, political issues must be addressed first.
Finally, many Members have correctly pointed out that the big problem is the ability to agree a position in Europe.
I agree that a qualified majority vote is better than disqualified unanimity.
People will say that is not a guarantee that Europe will have one single standpoint.
No, but Europe will have a standpoint and that is the one which will have authority.
There might be disagreement after a vote, yes, but Europe will have a standpoint.
The dynamics of everyone in the Union knowing that a standpoint can emerge after a discussion is a very pedagogical instrument, which will discipline politics in regard to how things are being discussed.
There is a world of difference between qualified majority and disqualified unanimity.
Mr President, I asked Commissioner Nielson a question to which I would like a reply.
I asked him to explain his statement that the Americans are well on the way to becoming members of OPEC.
I should like to hear what he has to say about this.
I hope that you can give him the opportunity to give me a reply.
I am not going to restart the debate.
The Commissioner can reply if he wishes.
Mr President, it would look strange if I did not reply.
This was my way of condensing the analysis, linguistically speaking, in order to express the concern that if the resolution before the Security Council does not give the United Nations a real role, and if it is adopted, then the occupying powers will de facto be the ones to decide on the oil in Iraq. That is self-evident, and is not adding anything of substance to this discussion.
The ending of all sanctions would also normalise Iraq's situation as a large oil producing and exporting country.
It was a member of OPEC.
In putting it the way I did, I was trying to clarify the discussion.
I think, to some extent, I have drawn attention to the reality of who would be in power if the United Nations is not given an authoritative role.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN STATEMENTS (RULE 120)
The countries that have tried to prevent military intervention in Iraq have failed from every angle: they made this action even more inevitable, indirectly encouraging Saddam Hussein; they have pushed themselves out of the running for the reconstruction of the country; worst of all, they risk brushing aside the UN, which is now accused of chronic paralysis and of being biased.
Indeed, there is no doubt that the period now beginning in Iraq is going to be very dangerous, almost as dangerous as the war itself, although in a different way, and that a highly operational authority that can take firm, quick decisions will be required to manage it.
In the light of the experience before the war, it is hard to imagine the UN in this role.
Nonetheless, the UN, although not embodying 'a universal conscience transcending states', as claimed by Dominique de Villepin (on what basis?), represents a broad range of countries that could be useful in stabilising Iraq.
The UN and the European Union should therefore use their influence to help the coalition forces to restore order in the country, quickly establish a credible government and provide humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, electricity and hospitals, which the Iraqis so desperately need.
. (PT) The illegal, unjust and illegitimate war against Iraq waged by the UK and US armies, with thousands of highly destructive bombs including cluster bombs being dropped, with the deaths of thousands of people, the destruction of huge residential areas, markets, hospitals, schools and other public places, followed by the sacking and pillaging of the historical and cultural heritage of the Iraqi people and of humanity as a whole, demands that the Bush Administration and its allies be called to account for their actions.
We cannot accept any attempt to whitewash the crimes that have been committed, in an attempt, after the event, to justify the aggression and occupation.
We regret the fact that the EU has not issued a clear and resounding condemnation of this aggression against Iraq and we insist on the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces.
The sovereignty of the Iraqi people and the territorial integrity of its country must be respected.
Solidarity with the Iraqi people, with the Palestinian people and with all peoples engaged in a struggle means that we must step up the fight for peace, for disarmament, to abolish nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, for military bases in foreign territory to be dismantled, for NATO to be dissolved, against militarism, for the UN Charter to be respected and for peoples' sovereignty and their right to decide their own destiny to be safeguarded.
Mr President, I have just found out that some observers are taking part in votes by raising their hands. Would you please make it clear once again, for the avoidance of doubt, that it is of course only full Members of this House who may take part in votes.
We are very keen that the observers play as full a role as possible in the work of Parliament, but they are not entitled to vote. That is quite clear.
Thank you for pointing that out.
Report (A5-0140/2003) by Neena Gill, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2004 (2003/2016(BUD))
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
Mr President, on the voting slip which we have in front of us it says that Amendment No 85 is identical to Amendment No 99.
I should like to point out that this is not actually the case.
The two amendments are significantly different, especially in relation to the Nuclear Conventions of Paris and Vienna.
In Amendment No 85, the paragraph which is under the IMO provisions is not under the nuclear provisions.
In Amendment No 99, it is.
I know this is slightly confusing, but it is a confusing directive!
They are not the same and therefore should not be voted as identical amendments.
To me they are similar so we can vote on them together, if possible.
They are the same.
Different parts are highlighted, but if you look at Paragraph 2 of both of them you will see that they are identical, except that one is in bold.
We will thus vote on Amendments Nos 85 and 99 together.
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)
President.
That concludes the vote.
EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
.
(PT) I support this report, which finally creates the legal instrument that has been for too long awaited by the cooperative sector.
I share the concern that creating the Statute for the European Cooperative Society should respect employees' acquired rights and the protection of these rights, both when an SCE is set up and in the structural changes of an already-existing SCE.
Furthermore, the SCE must ensure that workers are informed and consulted and are permanently represented and involved in the management of the SCE.
Consequently, decisions must take account of the opinions of employee representatives.
Lastly, I wish to highlight:
a) the legislative role given to Member States in the regulation on the Statute for employee representatives on the SCE and the importance of the principle that employee representatives should benefit from the same level of protection as employee representatives at national level;
b) the initiatives in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility, which must be promoted by employee representatives when they participate in the management of SCEs;
c) gender balance.
We must ensure that the methods used to nominate, appoint or elect employee representatives promote gender balance.
.
(PT) With the proposal for a directive addressed in this report, the Commission is seeking to supplement the Statute for a European Cooperative Society with regard to the involvement of employees.
In addition to the legal and institutional issues involved in this entire process, we need fundamentally to adapt its content on reconciling employee participation and rights in European Cooperative Societies.
The rapporteur broadly accepts the Commission's proposals and confines himself to tabling a limited number of new elements, specifically concerning: gender balance, Corporate Social Responsibility and the level of protection afforded to employee representatives, which must be the same as that afforded to employee representatives at national level.
There is also a proposal to remove the clause that would allow Member States not to implement the system of employee participation in the event that a European Cooperative Society is established by the merger of two cooperatives, which would clearly call employee rights into question. It is therefore appropriate to remove this clause.
. I have voted for the De Rossa report on cooperatives and its implications for working people because it is an excellent contribution to the development of cooperatives in the European Union.
My colleague, Mr De Rossa, has produced a report which will assist in the proliferation of the cooperative model which when experienced by working people is seen as having key advantages.
In the UK cooperative sector, which is now growing and has gone through a process of modernisation, this report will be welcomed.
.
(PT) I am voting against the report because I feel that the issue directly related to the involvement of employees in European Cooperative Societies (SCE) exceeds the scope of Article 137.
In changing this legal base, the rapporteur has attempted to promote new powers for Parliament which do not appear to comply with the letter and the spirit of the Treaties.
In my opinion, just like Paragraph 1(e) of the same article, which runs counter to the recommendation of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Paragraph 3 of that article does not constitute a sufficient and necessary legal basis for the desired employee participation in the life of these cooperative societies.
The use of Article 308 is, therefore, fully justified.
Similarly, I believe that allowing arrangements for the involvement of employees to be renegotiated in the case of substantial structural changes following the creation of an SCE could be at odds with the aforementioned article, which makes me fear for the solidity and viability of these bodies.
.
(PT) Although I acknowledge the merit of the Delegation of the Conciliation Committee and the fine work of Mr Callanan, I still believe that we have not achieved a sufficiently ambitious outcome with regard to noise pollution, to atmospheric pollution and to promoting the quality of water for human consumption.
I therefore disagree with the derogation granted to steam-powered craft, with applying the 3dB allowance to all engines types and with the limit values set for exhaust emissions in specific inland waters.
. (FR) This text must enter into force as soon as possible.
Some people will undoubtedly say that Article 308 of the EC Treaty is not the appropriate legal basis, that this legal base excludes the EP, in other words that it is denied codecision in this area and, in future, will merely be consulted.
The arguments put forward by a number of my colleagues in favour of rejecting the text for this reason are relevant and convincing.
Article 95 of the EC Treaty on the approximation of national laws which have as their object the establishment and functioning of the internal market certainly seems to be the appropriate legal base.
Yet is it wise to risk postponing indefinitely a statute that has already been awaited by the social economy for several years?
I do not think so.
I will therefore abstain on Amendment No 1, which disputes the legal base, with a view to ensuring that the text is adopted in due time.
.
(PT) This regulation is intended to create a European legal statute for cooperative societies, so as to enable them to operate beyond their national borders, within the single market of the EU.
This statute for a European Cooperative Society, which shares the aims of the statute for a European Company (Regulation No 2157/2001), seeks to adapt production structures to Community level, thereby enabling companies of all kinds to promote the reorganisation of their activities at Community level, in other words, to speed up the process of centralising and concentrating the capital of the huge multinational corporations - a process that will enable them to overcome the 'obstacles', as they call them, of national legislation to the mergers of companies from different Member States.
We have rejected this aim, where companies are concerned, of creating European capital, as well as the socio-economic consequences that such restructuring and mergers will have, in particular for an outermost country such as Portugal.
With regard to the cooperatives, with their own specific characteristics for the participation of their members and for the redistribution of profits, our abstention is based both on our doubts about the entire legislative process, and on the aim and content of this Commission initiative, although Parliament did propose some welcome amendments to the proposal submitted by the Executive Committee.
. (PT) I am voting against this report because I believe that the European Cooperative Society (SCE) exceeds the scope of legislative harmonisation and constitutes a new supranational legal form.
I do not agree with the view that the high number of exemptions made for national legislation would not damage the innovative nature of the SCE.
In fact, at a strictly interpretative level, I consider the view that a legal framework must be impervious to specific local characteristics in order to warrant the term reductive. I would instead suggest that this factor can only enrich the organisation and enable it truly to adapt to specific cases and situations.
The argument of 'completing the internal market', which is presented as a justification for using Article 95 is not clearly delimited, since it applies to almost all legislation.
There is a clear political attempt by the rapporteur and the committees delivering an opinion to promote the allocation of more and greater powers to Parliament, and they all allege that this claim is merely based on doctrines accepted in law.
I am genuinely sorry that this approach has been used as a weapon and as a justification for yet another institutional conflict.
Prudence dictates that instead of demanding further power, we should make good use of what we have.
Mr President, I just want to explain why I voted in favour of Amendment No 1 to the Gill report.
I think at a time when so many of our citizens are facing such uncertainty about pensions and other work-related benefits, it would be quite wrong of Members of this House to vote themselves extra privileges and would send out all the wrong signals.
I am very pleased that on this side of the House at least the majority of colleagues voted against the proposal to extend health benefits to retired Members.
. All Members of the House benefit from free medical insurance.
It is a sad example of a failure of solidarity between generations that an alliance principally composed of Socialists and Greens has voted against even an investigation into extending the system to retired Members.
I voted for the Manders report on environmental liability because the amendments adopted ultimately responded quite well to the objections I had raised during yesterday's debate.
A very significant majority of Members (312 in favour, 179 against) held the same view.
The main amendments that convinced me to vote in favour are: 1) Amendments Nos 85 and 99, which call on the Commission, in particular, to draw up proposals for the application of the directive to environmental damage caused by nuclear pollution and maritime transport; 2) Amendments Nos 86 and 103, which do away with the exemption from liability linked to the prior issue of an administrative authorisation or the insufficiency of scientific and technical knowledge; 3) Amendment No 107, which calls on operators to use appropriate forms of financial security to cover their responsibilities.
Amendment No 54 was also adopted, which is not perfect but I can accept it.
It calls for additional legislation regarding liability for damage caused by GMOs, notably damage that could affect non-GMO products.
Of course, I call for the moratorium on GMO authorisations to remain in place until this legislation has been adopted.
. (FR) The Manders report claims to be based on the polluter pays principle: businesses that cause environmental damage must bear the costs of the damage they have caused.
As some of the amendments were a step in the right direction, we voted in favour of this report.
However, one major problem remains: putting it into practice.
It is not enough for Parliament to adopt these recommendations for them to be enforced, nor is it enough for it to appoint a competent authority for operators to shoulder their responsibilities.
This is particularly true where the operator is a multinational group that has the resources to evade them and the competent authority usually gives in to its demands, as we saw in France with TotalFinaElf (Erika oil slick, explosion at the AZF factory).
The rapporteur's emphases regarding the polluter being responsible up to a certain limit would be funny if the behaviour of these large groups, which are concerned first and foremost with their profit margins, did not have tragic consequences for the population.
Similarly, it is not enough for financial guarantees to be established.
The IOPCF, which is supposed to cover oil tanker risk, has just announced that it will only reimburse 15% of the Prestige damage as it has no money.
To appease the anger of the victims, the French Government did not consider looking to the charter company but will make the taxpayers pay instead.
In other words, faced with the harsh reality of a profit-oriented society, this report will make absolutely no difference at all.
.
(PT) It is our view that policies for protecting the environment and natural resources are crucial to sustainable development.
Priority must be attached to policies and measures aimed at prevention, for example, developing forms of research and support for access to the best technology available, paying particular attention to the problems and specific characteristics of small and medium-sized companies.
There is, however, an increasing need to enforce liability for remedying environmental damage.
I would highlight the recent example of the Prestige.
For this reason it is important, in the context of a broader set of measures and actions, to ensure that heavy industry - and this is the main culprit - accepts liability for preserving the environment and natural resources, through correct, fair and effective methods; that we combat impunity and avoid public finances ending up bearing the costs and having to remedy the environmental damage caused by negligence or commercial strategies - almost always private - which seek only to obtain the greatest possible profit.
This EP resolution improves the Commission proposal (based on the 1983 Green Paper) on environmental liability in terms of preventing and remedying environmental damage, by casting doubt on the positions advocated by heavy industry (see the opinion delivered by UNICE) which typified the proposal presented by the Commission.
. Public authorities, especially local authorities, currently face significant burdens arising from environmental damage, from a wide range of sources, both major and minor.
This directive gives an opportunity to better identify and assign responsibility and should follow the 'polluter pays' principle.
I opposed committee Amendment No 37, which is contrary to that principle and which would place unacceptable burdens on local authorities and also be potentially disastrous for local economies.
Particularly in the UK, governments have been guilty of seeking to leave local authorities to pick up the cost of EU legislation - such as disposal of refrigeration equipment - and blaming 'Brussels'.
The costs of implementing this directive must not be inflicted unfairly upon hard-pressed local authority budgets, either through approving a faulty directive or as a result of ultimately flawed implementation by government.
.
(EL) The directive on a system of environmental liability based on the trite 'polluter pays' principle, which has proven to be efficient for the restoration of environmental damage by those responsible but also detrimental, in that it has weakened actual prevention and is ultimately proving to be the most cynical excuse for new tax burdens on 'polluted citizens' in that the polluters - big industrial business - not only are not paying for the restoration of the huge disasters they cause (Erika, Prestige, Sevezo etc.) but also, in addition, they are being strengthened by incentives and tax relief.
Environmental damage is being reduced to manifest hypocrisy, in that the 'financial guarantees' on the part of the operator are being shifted to the state and to the workers either by increasing operating costs or by passing them on in product prices.
With the exemptions and its limited scope, it is being reduced to a 'fig leaf' for monopoly interests, in that it does not include overall protection of biodiversity, oil pollution, nuclear damage, non-ionising radiation, GMOs etc. and provocatively exempts from liability charges those who cause huge ecological damage through unprovoked and barbaric military interventions.
The limited definitions of damage, liability and other basic concepts, which are shot through with exemptions and peculiar 'presumptions of non liability' make us particularly cautious and critical with respect to this 'environmental liability'.
. (NL) Not only do businesses produce goods and services, they also produce pollution and accidents.
The costs of repairing the damage to the environment fall on the injured parties or the government. The benefits of the economic activity that has led to the damage, on the other hand, fall to the business.
To combat this injustice the 'polluter pays' principle was developed long ago, but businesses continue to exert pressure to undermine it as far as possible.
We can see this in the right-wing amendments submitted, which seriously limit liability.
After 21 years of preparation nothing seems to have come of the original intentions.
The directive is applicable to just 13% of the EU's territory, the regions indicated in the Birds Directive and Natura 2000.
Marine pollution and damage due to nuclear energy do not count and even if people were acting on the basis of a licence or the state of the art at the time, there is no liability.
Oil disasters at sea and contamination of natural crops by genetically modified crops do not lead to liability.
Advances in environmental protection at national level are made impossible if Article 95 for a uniform market is placed ahead of environmental protection in Article 175.
Only the left-wing amendments, taken as a whole, can make this proposal in any way acceptable.
.
On behalf of the EPLP I would like to indicate our support for the general principle of 'the polluter restores'. This is a fundamental shift in the direction of environmental policy in the EU.
No longer should the public bear the burden of clean-up costs when often the polluter has walked away.
The EPLP does not, however, support the inclusion of GMOs in this directive as, firstly, we believe it is the wrong directive and, secondly, there is existing legislation on this topic and this could give rise to confusion among potential operators as to which legislation is applicable.

(PT) This Commission proposal intended to ensure the adoption of an overall Community system for preventing and remedying environmental damage including water pollution, damage done to biodiversity and soil contamination, which constitute a serious risk to human health, is extremely important.
After several years of debate and many environmental disasters, we have reached a crucial point for effectively preventing and remedying environmental damage, in a genuine 'parting of the waves'.
I have supported the Commission's approach of largely leaving the specific institutional and procedural measures for achieving the intended results to the discretion of the Member States, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
I consider the Commission proposal's approach too vague, however, on issues such as: the scope of its definition of biodiversity (restricted to the Nature 2000 network), the system of compulsory financial guarantee/insurance (for operators listed in Annex I of the Proposal), adopting a system of exemptions, removing objective liability for introducing 'mitigating factors' and excluding damage resulting from certain activities.
I therefore expressed my disagreement on certain aspects, but I believe I must contribute to the adoption of this Directive, which moves, overall, in the right direction and constitutes an undeniably important milestone.
The proposal for a directive on environmental liability entails considerable progress in the environmental sphere in Europe and will hopefully be able to prevent many accidents in the future.
The proposal is very welcome, but we believed that it needed to be strengthened in some areas.
The definition of the biodiversity in connection with which liability for damages might arise was too narrow.
In our opinion, species and environments protected by national legislation should also be covered by the directive.
In our opinion, the proposal to remove strict environmental liability from activities tested for their compliance with permits comprised too sweeping an exception and is not in keeping with national legislation.
This should, however, be a factor of which account is taken when establishing the amount of the damages.
. (FR) The questions raised concerning environmental liability and specific liability in the area of maritime transport are different in nature despite appearances.
The text adopted by Parliament is going to breed confusion.
The concept of environmental liability, which is still tentative, is based on the need to determine who is responsible and to establish a causal relationship between the event in question and the pollution: it entails long procedures and delays in providing compensation.
The system of liability without fault laid down by the CLC/IOPCF international conventions has the advantage for victims of designating a responsible party who must be insured and creating a compensation fund which, in theory, is available immediately in the case of pollution.
Nevertheless, the experience of recent oil slicks shows that it is absolutely vital to extend this system to cover charter companies and include changes to biodiversity. The role of the IOPCF must be substantially improved and it should be made permanent.
These requests must be put to the IMO by the Member States that are most directly involved and most prepared to take action.
If this does not work, it will be up to these same states to urge the European Union to operate unilaterally, as the United States has done, by taking over responsibility for making these vital improvements.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
Mr President, a Bilderberg meeting will open in Versailles tomorrow.
The reason I raise this issue is that a number of Commissioners - Monti, Liikanen, Solbes Mira, Verheugen, Vitorino and Bolkestein - have all in the past attended Bilderberg meetings.
Indeed, Commissioner Prodi was actually a steering committee member in the eighties at the same time as Wim Duisenberg was the treasurer of Bilderberg.
Another reason I have raised this issue is that I have submitted a priority written question through Parliament but whenever I raise the issue of Bilderberg I am sent from pillar to post.
I should have had a reply on 25 April but still have not received one.
The Bilderberg meeting is starting at the weekend.
When I have tried to put an oral question in this Parliament or in the last one, the Commissioners have basically been afraid to answer.
What I really want to know is whether the Commissioners attend these meetings in their own private capacity or whether they are representing the Commission.
If they are representing the Commission, we need to know what happens at these Bilderberg meetings because at the end of the day this is a secret organisation which is deciding global policy without any input from the public.
It is about time the doors of Bilderberg were opened and the public really knew what goes on, because most of the major players in the world today are all playing a part in Bilderberg.
The President of this Parliament, Mr Cox, actually attended one of these meetings in Sweden a couple of years ago.
The people need to know what happens at the Bilderberg meetings, and if I ask a question in good time the Commission should answer that question.
There is no justification for the Commission not to answer it.
Mrs McKenna, I have noted your comments, which I shall also pass on to the European Commission so that, as you are referring to Commissioners, you can receive the relevant reply from it.
The next item is the statement by the Council on the EU-USA extradition agreement and the International Criminal Court.
The Minister of Justice of Greece, Mr Petsalnikos, has the floor on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we have the opportunity to bring you up to date on the current state of negotiations between the Presidency and the United States of America on the two agreements, one on extradition and one on mutual judicial assistance.
These negotiations are now in their final stage.
The text of the draft agreements was sent to the European Parliament two weeks ago.
The Presidency hopes that they will be approved and signed at the JHA Council on 6 June.
This will allow the Presidency to sign the agreements within the framework of the summit meeting of the European Union and the United States due to be held in Washington on 25 June.
If we are today in a position which allows me to be optimistic about the outcome of these negotiations, that is also largely due to the important efforts of previous presidencies.
After a first round of negotiations under the Spanish Presidency, extensive negotiations were held under the Danish Presidency with the help of the Commission and the support of the Council Secretariat.
At its meeting on 28 February 2003, the Council agreed that the Presidency had conducted the negotiations efficiently, with an encouraging outcome, and that the negotiation of the agreements should be suspended, in order to allow time for the Member States to examine all relevant aspects of the text.
Certain Member States are still in the process of consulting their national parliaments, which is why the Council decided at its meeting last week to facilitate the completion of the information process.
The Presidency, I would remind you, has informed the European Parliament on the state of negotiations with the United States of America several times; in fact, the last time, we had the opportunity to inform the LIBE Committee on 20 March.
If the Council on 5 June authorises the Presidency to sign the agreements on behalf of the European Union, certain of the Member States will need to follow their constitutional procedures, which implies approval or ratification by their national parliaments.
Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union expressly allows Member States to state that they must follow constitutional procedures before being bound by an agreement.
Indeed, certain Member States have already stated to us that they will be making such a statement.
The European Union will only be bound following the exchange of the legislative acts with the United States of America, which will consequently only take place once the Council has taken a second decision authorising the Presidency to exchange the legislative ratifying acts with the United States of America.
Between the signature of the contracts and the exchange of the ratifying documents, the Presidency will update the European Parliament on the text of the agreement on an ad hoc basis, despite the fact, of course, that the Treaty on European Union contains no such requirement.
It is logical for this update to take place at this stage, given that the constitutional procedures have traditionally made provision for governments to seek the assent or advice of national parliaments on the final text of the agreement.
Obviously a text only becomes final once it has been signed by the contracting parties.
The Presidency believes that this agreement has added value in comparison with current bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the United States of America.
I must stress that, if we do not reach some sort of agreement, we shall have to live with the existing bilateral agreements which the Member States have concluded.
In all events, the EU-USA agreements will not repeal bilateral agreements between the Member States and the United States of America.
The agreements I am telling you about today are based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union.
They will exist alongside bilateral agreements. They will complement them and, in certain cases, they will replace provisions in the bilateral agreements.
It is also important for us to understand that the Member States will be able to continue to cite the grounds for refusing extradition or providing judicial assistance which are contained in the bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual judicial assistance.
If a bilateral agreement on mutual judicial assistance or extradition between a Member State and the United States of America makes provision for certain grounds for refusal, that Member State will be able to continue to cite them even once the EU-USA agreements have entered into force.
In addition, the draft agreement on extradition contains a provision which, as far as I know, has no precedent in international extradition law.
It recognises that the state being asked to extradite a person may refer to its constitutional principles, which need not be included in the actual text of the constitution, but which can be enshrined in a text on equally as high a level as the constitution for historical or other reasons which are legally binding and which prevent it from honouring its obligation to extradite a person.
In such cases, of course, the state requesting that a person be extradited and the state being asked to extradite a person must consult in order to resolve the matter.
This also becomes particularly important with the express reference in the preamble to the principle of a fair hearing by an impartial tribunal established by law.
This provision does indeed allow the Member States to refuse to extradite a person in the case of special courts, if they do not have this right on the basis of their bilateral extradition agreement with the United States of America.
The Member States which conclude new agreements with the United States of America in the future will clearly have to comply with these EU agreements, in that they will form part of the acquis of the European Union.
Therefore, these future bilateral agreements will have to be compatible with the EU-USA agreements.
In the opinion of the Presidency, the negotiations were successful.
We managed to make a positive contribution to the current level of assistance, to improve efficiency and, most importantly, to agree on additional safeguards.
It is of the utmost importance that we understand that the agreements add safeguards to existing bilateral agreements and that, if these agreements had not been concluded, the present legal protection would have shortcomings in comparison to how things will stand when the agreements are concluded.
The draft EU-USA agreement on extradition contains a provision which prohibits extradition in the case of the imposition or execution of the death penalty.
This provision exceeds the level of protection for which provision is made in bilateral extradition agreements, given that it creates a general precondition for the result described and does not make the non-execution of the death penalty dependent upon the assurances of the Government of the United States of America in the case in question.
Contrary to what has applied to date in almost all bilateral extradition agreements, the non-execution of the death penalty by the Government of the United States of America will not depend on the assurances given in the case in question by the Government of the United States of America each time on an ad hoc basis, and will probably be put forward as a precondition by the Member State in receipt of an extradition request from the United States.
In addition, the Member States of the European Union can impose the precondition that the United States of America will not impose the death penalty.
The United States of America will then be bound by this precondition, unless this is impossible for procedural reasons. One such case is when the death penalty has already been imposed before the person is handed over or when the criminal prosecution of the offence of which the person stands accused automatically implies the possibility for the competent court in the United States of America to impose the death penalty, as happens in very few states in the United States of America.
The Member States that wish to follow their bilateral practice will, however, be able to do so if they do not apply this provision and/or if they make a joint declaration at bilateral level with the United States.
Some of the other issues to which the draft agreements bring added value in connection with extradition are as follows:
In the case of sensitive information, the draft agreement allows consultations to be requested in order to determine the degree to which the information contained in a request can be protected by the requesting state.
With regard to multiple requests, the agreement addresses the issue of the simultaneous submission of an extradition request by the United States of America and another state or when that other state is a member state of the European arrest warrant.
Within this framework, I should like to mention the issue of the International Criminal Court, given that the Presidency is aware of the particular sensitivities and concerns of Parliament on this account.
When negotiations started, it was agreed by both the negotiating missions that the agreement would not have any repercussions whatsoever on the relative positions of the Member States and of the United States of America with regard to requests by the International Criminal Court for a person to be handed over.
The European Union and the United States of America agreed at the negotiation level to set this out in writing in an explanatory memorandum which states that Article 10 is not intended to affect the obligations of the states who are party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Consequently, the question of a simultaneous request for a person to be handed over from the International Criminal Court and an extradition request from the United States of America is regulated and shall continue to be regulated so that it is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Member States, while the Council will not be able to proceed to make any declaration on this.
With regard to mutual judicial assistance, some of the main achievements of the negotiations with the United States of America are to be found in the following sectors: the draft agreement improves cooperation in the field of investigations into the possible financial elements of serious crime, including organised crime, terrorism and fraud.
The Member States which do not at present have an agreement on mutual judicial assistance with the United States of America can fall back on public order, security, national sovereignty or other interests of the state in receipt of the request in order to refuse to transmit information in some cases.
The agreement contains extensive provisions concerning data protection and the provision of evidence and information.
The draft agreement contains provisions which facilitate the use of joint investigation teams and the facility for teleconferencing between the Member States and the United States.
These provisions make it easier for the Member States to use these facilities but they do not oblige them to use them.
The draft agreement permits the use of modern means of telecommunication, facsimiles or e-mail in order to exchange requests for mutual judicial assistance and replies with express confirmation of receipt.
Mutual judicial assistance, insofar as this sort of thing does not already happen under bilateral agreements, can be used by the administrative authorities both in the United States of America and the Member States, when they are conducting investigations into criminal behaviour with a view to criminal prosecution or to reporting such conduct to the investigating or prosecuting authorities.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you once again for giving us the opportunity to give Parliament a progress report on negotiations between the European Union and the United States of America on the extradition and mutual judicial assistance agreements.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the information you have provided, but unfortunately I do not think you have responded to the oral question tabled by my group. It remains outstanding.
Clearly the agreement before us is especially relevant for both the European Union and the United States. The United States has decided to foster closer cooperation, especially in relation to the fight against organised crime.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as rapporteur I therefore feel we must welcome this type of initiative. I am especially pleased that for the first time the European Union is going to sign an agreement on cooperation on judicial and criminal matters.
This should serve as a model in arriving at similar agreements with other third countries.
I would however like to provide some additional details on three issues.
Will this agreement make the fight against organised crime more effective?
As I understand it, it will. This level of cooperation will clearly help the fight against money laundering, trafficking in human beings, drug trafficking and terrorism.
Will this agreement reinforce the European Judicial Area?
I think it will inasmuch as it will oblige Member States and candidate countries to speed up the ratification of the European texts that form the basis of this agreement. These texts include the protocol on money laundering and the decision on the detention and surrender procedure and on joint investigation teams.
The third question is whether these texts represent added value over and above the bilateral agreements currently in force.
I have to say that the answer to this question is also affirmative. As regards existing agreements, the new agreement will streamline cooperation and provide for increased guarantees to be given in the interests of those accused.
Nevertheless, I feel I must draw the attention of the Presidency of the Council to the doubts expressed by Parliament, as reflected in the question that led to this statement.
Firstly, we want to be sure that the same guarantees offered by the European arrest warrant would apply in the case of the United States issuing a request for extradition.
The second issue concerns the doubts over whether a Member State has the capacity to decide if a person should be sent to the United States or referred to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. Although there is an explanatory note on this in the text of the agreement on the International Criminal Court, as you mentioned, we believe it would have been much clearer if this reference had been inserted into the text of the agreement.
This would have eliminated the uncertainty on the subject and made it quite clear that a Member State may take that decision.
The third issue relates to procedure. I would like to highlight a positive and also a negative aspect of this subject.
Firstly, we would like to thank the Greek Presidency for publishing the text of this international agreement before it had even been signed. This allowed Parliament to consider its contents.
An important precedent has been set. Nonetheless, this cannot be deemed adequate in terms of democratic control.
I will move on to outline the negative aspect. To date, the European Parliament has never been consulted on any similar international agreements, even when they concerned fundamental aspects of foreign policy and cooperation on judicial matters.
In our opinion this is unacceptable. Furthermore, unfortunately agreements of this type do not have to be ratified either by national parliaments or by this House.
When neither the European Parliament nor national parliaments are involved, how can we say that the European Union's actions in this regard are in line with the democratic principles on which it is based under Article 6 of the EU Treaty?
This is why it is appropriate for the European Parliament to be consulted and not merely informed, as you have said.
We feel this is a central and highly relevant issue.
I communicated this to the Presidency of the Council in a letter sent in December last year.
I could not understand why I did not receive a reply. I also made the current President-in-Office of the Council aware of the strength of feeling when the latter appeared before meetings of the committee I chair.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the liberties and fundamental interests of the citizen's of Europe are at stake. We are dealing with judicial and criminal cooperation, a subject on which the Treaty provides for a closer level of cooperation than that provided for by the Common Foreign and Security Policy.
I would therefore like you to reconsider your position should no consultation be allowed for. I also call upon you to convey Parliament's opinion on this matter to the Council.
I have communicated this opinion to you in the strongest terms. If our message is not brought before the Council, Parliament would have to consider the possibility of taking its case to the Court of Justice.
Lastly, I would like to thank the Presidency once again for the positive attitude it has shown in relation to such a sensitive dossier, as demonstrated by your presence in the House.
Mr President, I too would like first to thank the Council for distributing this document and for facilitating this debate.
Thank you very much for being here today.
I have strongly defended the European search and arrest warrant in this House.
In doing so I have argued strongly that international cooperation, not the restriction of rights and freedoms is what will make us better able to deal with new security problems.
I therefore think that in principle increased cooperation with the United States is a positive development.
Nevertheless, Mr President, I feel compelled to raise a number of questions here and now. My questions concern the contents of this agreement with a country whose judicial system remains significantly different from ours.
My first question relates to the fact that there is a guarantee that a person who is extradited cannot be condemned to death.
I understand this; it has been made very clear.
I would however like to know how we can guarantee that judicial cooperation and the handing over of evidence does not amount to collaborating to ensure someone is executed.
I would welcome further clarification on this matter.
I will now outline my second question.
The European search and arrest warrant will not come into force for a few months.
It provides for the International Criminal Court to prevail. When, in the future, Member States are bound by this arrangement, how will it be possible to guarantee that a summons issued by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over a request for extradition issued by the United States?
There are indeed measures that protect against the Patriot Act and extraordinary laws. Clearly, we are not going to hand a person over to the United States if he or she could be tried under laws of that kind.
This leads me however to pose another question, relating to politics rather than to the contents of the proposal. There is evidence that at least twelve European citizens are being 'detained', if I may put it like that, in Guantanamo Bay.
Has the Council taken any action to guarantee the right of European citizens to proper consular protection abroad, as provided for further to the Maastricht Treaty? Has the Council instructed the Commission to take such action?
Or are we to admit that there are different classes of citizens? Has anything been done to ensure the United States allows the detainees to appear before a judge?
Lastly, Mr President, is it politically acceptable to sign an agreement strengthening judicial cooperation with a state that is keeping nationals of our countries in such conditions? I firmly believe it is not.
How will we be able to call for justice from third countries in future when we find ourselves in a similar situation?
Mr President, 18 months ago when I had the honour to serve as chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this House adopted a resolution on judicial cooperation between the Union and the USA.
That resolution set out four key requirements for any extradition agreement: full respect for the European Convention on Human Rights; no extradition of persons likely to face military tribunals; no extradition if the accused risks facing the death penalty; and that any measures affecting data protection should be proportionate, effective and time-limited.
The terrorist outrages in Saudi Arabia on Monday night once again remind us that terrorism still poses a deadly serious threat. We need a robust and effective response.
However, the Liberal Democrats in this House insist that anti-terrorism measures must always respect fundamental rights and be subject to proper democratic oversight and control.
Striking the right balance is essential to success in fighting those who seek to undermine the fabric of democratic societies.
The current draft agreements between the EU and the US on extradition and legal cooperation must not escape the parliamentary scrutiny provided for in our Treaties.
They concern 'fundamental choices' within the meaning of Article 21.
They fall not only under Article 38 but also under Article 24, and it is scandalous that the Council does not consult this House in advance on all the Article 24 agreements.
In France, the Conseil d'Etat has refused the AssemblÃ©e Nationale the right to approve such agreements: so unless the Council consults us, what parliamentary scrutiny exists in the European Union?
These agreements on extradition and legal co-operation are very ambitious.
The United States declines to sign the UN conventions on cybercrime, on crime prevention and on the International Criminal Court.
In the Union, Member States have not yet ratified our decision on money laundering or the framework directive on terrorism.
Yet these proposals cover the whole Palermo agenda.
They should at the very least provide for the establishment of bodies to oversee their operation and provide feedback.
I can only regret that this agreement makes no reference to the International Criminal Court.
I would urge the Council to rectify this.
The Council must seek to reconcile the potential conflict between a request from the ICC to surrender a person to the court and the obligation stemming from this extradition agreement.
The slide away from democracy can start with the best of intentions.
The European Union must guard against it. Do not let the Council's haste facilitate it.
I can fully endorse the criticism made by the previous speakers.
I would just draw attention to the fact that, under Articles 38 and 24 of the Treaty, Parliament has no right whatsoever to be heard.
It is an extraordinary provision, which means that the Council can enter into these agreements off its own bat.
In April of last year, the Council wrote to the British human rights organisation, State Watch, which had requested information about these agreements, and said that the negotiations that were under way had to be kept secret, since the Council's interest in secrecy counted for more than its interest in democratic scrutiny.
It is easy to see why the Council has kept these negotiations secret for more than a year, for, if they lead to an agreement, very important parts of the legal certainty by which most of our legal systems are characterised would be successfully abolished at the stroke of a pen.
Broadly speaking, the state of our law would be reduced to something reminiscent of what it was in the Middle Ages, both by the extradition agreement, which goes very much farther than what was urged, covering, as it does, very many more types of crime than terrorism - it is enough to have been sentenced to one year's imprisonment under the penal legislation of the country by or from which extradition is requested - and by the second part of the agreement, namely that relating to what is termed mutual legal aid.
Ask the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.
These agreements are being entered into with the United States in the name of legal certainty at the same time as everything is being done to infringe legal certainty.
Ask the 3 000 prisoners - overwhelmingly foreigners - suspected of terrorism and consigned to American jails without having access to any information.
Ask the eleven million active FBI informers who, if this agreement is ever implemented, will be given permission to operate within the territories of the EU countries. That would, as has been said, be a decisive retrograde step.
As I said before, this Parliament has no influence at all, either legally or constitutionally, but the debate may be of use in raising the storm that will be necessary for checking these attempts to undermine legal certainty.
President-in-Office of the Council, today, for the first time, we are debating an extradition agreement between the European Union and the United States on which no parliament in the European Union, not even the European Parliament, has been consulted.
I would therefore like to thank you very much for being here with us today, but I am also quite aware of the fact that we have virtually no room for manoeuvre at all, given that, as you yourself have said, everything may well have been decided by 5 June.
Once again, negotiations on matters which are absolutely crucial for the citizens' freedoms and rights are being carried out, or rather have been carried out, with a complete lack of transparency, and we have only been able to see behind the veil where faits accomplis are concerned.
The Council persists in refusing any kind of formal consultation of the European Parliament.
At times like these, when there are many who believe that democracy and rights can be exported by means of unlawful wars, I find this particularly disturbing.
We consider it to be a clear violation of the Treaty, and we are assessing the feasibility of appealing to the Court on the grounds of violation of the prerogatives of the European Parliament.
I genuinely hope that the majority of Parliament will be of the opinion that it is possible to lodge an appeal of this kind.
We have many grounds for scepticism and concern regarding this agreement, including the failure to give priority to the European arrest warrant in the event of simultaneous requests and the ambiguity which persists even on matters on which there is as little disagreement in this House as data protection or the death penalty.
We wonder, moreover, why it is that we are in such a hurry to conclude this agreement when we know that a number of European citizens are being held prisoner wholly unlawfully at GuantÃ¡namo, as has already been mentioned by other Members, and that nothing is known of them.
If the Union and Parliament want to live up to their reputation as at least verbal champions of rights, we must get moving and send a delegation without delay to ascertain the conditions in which those citizens are being held before we sign an agreement with the United States.
It will be interesting, and possibly even amusing, to see whether the United States allows us to do that.
Today, however, we would like to receive answers on the possible - or rather, probable - contradictions between this agreement and the Statute of the International Criminal Court, on which, I regret to say, you did not focus, President-in-Office.
We would like a clear response to the following questions. Is it true that the United States, actively supported by the United Kingdom, is opposed to any reference to the Criminal Court in the agreement?
What will happen in the event of conflict between the Rome Statute, in particular the obligation to cooperate with the Criminal Court, and the EU-US extradition agreement?
Lastly, given the unambiguous position of the European Parliament, not least, which is opposed to the bilateral agreements guaranteeing the impunity of US citizens, could you please tell us whether any of the present or future Members of the European Union have been asked to sign these agreements?
Do you know of the existence of any agreements of this kind?
Mr President, in my opinion the Council has made a conscientious attempt to reach a balanced result where these accords are concerned.
On the one hand it is important that we support our NATO friends where possible in the fight against terrorism.
It is also in our own interest that together we fight against organised crime.
If this becomes easier as a result of the extradition and legal cooperation agreement, then that is a major gain.
At the same time I can see that the legal systems of the United States and the European Union are not the same.
It is logical therefore that the United States cannot be treated on a par with an EU Member State.
The United States is a democratic unit in which human rights are guaranteed, but their interpretation is not always the same as that of the EU Member States.
The issue of the death penalty now appears to have been settled to general satisfaction by the Council's compromise.
There is still the question of competing extradition requests by way for example of a European arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court.
I understand that the Council has discussed this and also recognised it as a problem, but can this be adequately resolved by leaving it to the Member States?
There is also the question of whether the requirements of the European data protection directive can be adequately met.
In view of these sensitivities the Council has rightly decided to put these proposals to the national parliaments for ratification.
Mr Donner, the Dutch Minister of Justice, declared that the proposals remained within the limits of current Dutch treaties with the United States.
His calm reaction was a relief after the overwrought reaction of various fellow parliamentarians at home and abroad.
There are some who are making the United States into a bogeyman.
No wonder they are not leaping at the chance to become involved with the International Criminal Court.
I understand that the Council has reached a compromise here too.
Member States can conclude a non-extradition treaty with the United States with representatives dispatched by the government in Washington.
This provides an opening for further negotiations.
I am assuming that the Council will be keeping us informed about this.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am not going to repeat the excellent points made concerning the untenable situation as regards what is known as the third pillar.
In reality, there is the possibility that this situation could affect many areas and send out an undemocratic image of the European Union, especially to the candidate countries.
At the Parthenon, we celebrated the advent of the democratic Europe, yet, at the first part-session which our observers - the few that are here - are attending, we must in all conscience kick up a fuss, because you are not consulting us on key issues such as the one in question.
I do not want to go into details on this subject, particularly as I have very little time.
I wanted to say to you, Mr President, that you have said very little about the Criminal Court.
I also wanted to say to the House that it is, in any case, important to take account of the extradition provided for by the Rome Statute.
The handing-over of those who are accused is not extradition in the legal sense of the term.
The fact that this is not discussed is not, therefore, a problem in itself.
Naturally, Europe must remember its undertaking to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Statute as well as the contents of the declaration of 30 September 2002.
This declaration recommends to all candidate countries and all Member States that they should not sign any bilateral agreements that would go against the principle that is the basis for the Court, which I am glad to say has existed since 11 March and will, I hope, be able to start operating very soon.
Mr President, this agreement is very important, not just because it will be useful in the fight against international crime but also because this is the first time the Union as such has negotiated an international agreement on this matter, which binds the Member States and takes precedence over any bilateral agreements they have concluded.
The rules and criteria adopted will therefore serve as useful benchmarks for similar agreements with many other third countries, and that is another reason why they must be considered carefully.
The Union is bound by the provisions of the Treaties and the acts signed by its institutions.
In matters of respect for fundamental rights, it is bound by Article 6(1) and (2) of the Treaty on European Union and by the Charter on Fundamental Rights, which lay down more stringent guarantees than those provided for in third countries and, in particular, in the United States - I too am thinking of the European citizens still imprisoned at GuantÃ¡namo - and it is therefore these provisions of the Treaty, not respect for individual rights in general, which must be referred to in the EU-US agreement.
The reservation not to cooperate if the accused is liable to face the death penalty is expressed in relation to extradition but not - as it should be - where judicial cooperation is concerned.
This is a requirement that binds not just the Member States but the Union as such too, which does not have the power to conclude agreements which provide for derogations from this principle.
I therefore consider Article 9 of the agreement on judicial cooperation to be inadequate.
Then it is absurd that the Council should conclude agreements with third countries which it has not yet implemented within the Union because the Member States have failed to ratify the agreements or because of failure to implement framework decisions which have already been adopted.
It is also absurd that, as provided for by Article 10 of the agreement, a request for extradition from a third country might take precedence over a request from a Member State to hand a person over made by virtue of a European arrest warrant.
We must therefore remedy these shortcomings, and the agreement will then be a model for European Union cooperation with third countries to combat international crime, with due regard for the fundamental rights which the Union acknowledges all human beings to have.
Mr President, I should like to associate myself with what Mr Watson and other fellow Members here have already said.
In itself this is an extraordinarily important agreement and it is therefore all the more a crying shame that the consultation of the various people's representations is not properly organised.
In my own country, for example, the agreements had to be read in a room because the agreement was a secret one.
We have now had them handed out and I wonder whether this method of discussion is the right one?
I share the view of the Chairman of our Committee that we may possibly have to go to the Court of Justice if a different procedure is not followed.
In any event I have some specific questions. Is it right that the American Government should refuse to accept the International Criminal Court?
Can you say explicitly what role the Council is planning to assign to the International Criminal Court?
Have the candidate countries been consulted? This proposal does after all affect them too.
Is not the lower limit of one year, on the basis of which people can be extradited, far too low?
In short, Mr President, I doubt very much that this will be handled properly and I should therefore be very glad to see that we can discuss this subject more and better than is currently the case.
Mr President-in-Office, as you will understand, both the matter of the European prisoners in Guantanamo and the conditions they face and the matter of the transfer of confidential data to the United States on airline passengers give us cause for distrust and concern about the agreement and about the stand which the European Union will maintain.
There are three points but I mainly want to mention the first to you.
On the question of the death penalty, the other day the Community paper, Europe, printed Article 13, in which it says that, if the party in which the death penalty applies requests an extradition from another party that does not apply it, then the other party, that is, the European Union, may stipulate that the death penalty must not be applied or imposed and the article ends:
Mr President, a year ago Mr John Bolton, the Deputy US Secretary of State, said that the sole purpose of the International Criminal Court was to constrain American military power.
Well, if we have to choose between might and right, we obviously have to defend the international legal order.
The coming weeks will test the EU's support for the ICC, as the US is intensifying its efforts to obtain bilateral immunity agreements from third countries.
We must support those countries which are coming under pressure.
We must also monitor the situation and find out who is going to agree and who is going to resist.
We do not have this information.
Furthermore, we would still like to know what steps the Council is taking to guarantee that Iraqi prisoners will not be arbitrarily tried by US military courts, but judged by independent international tribunals, preferably under the auspices of the United Nations.
Mr President, do the various European Member States have sufficient trust in each other's legal systems?
That was the essence of the discussion on the European arrest warrant.
If the Council is to have its way such trust will have to be placed blindly in a third country outside the borders of the European Union, namely the United States.
In my view this is, for the present, a bridge too far.
First, a critical and public debate on this matter is required.
After all, we are dealing here with fundamental human rights, personal freedom of movement and the preservation of personal safety and property.
It is surely unacceptable simply to try to force citizens and their elected representatives to swallow important amendments to those rights whether they like it or not.
First as regards the extradition treaty.
The norm for extradition between the US and the EU Member States is to be that an offence should carry a minimum sentence of 1 year's imprisonment.
For some Member States that already have a bilateral extradition treaty with the US this is nothing new.
But conspiracy, participation and an attempt to commit an offence will also require compulsory extradition and that is definitely far-reaching.
But for Member States without a bilateral extradition treaty and for Member States that operate a so-called positive list there will be a sweeping change.
My question to the representative of the Council is therefore whether we can be given a list of the various consequences of the implementation of the treaty for individual Member States.
As is generally known, the rights of suspects are not generally adequately protected in the United States.
The European Union must guarantee the civil rights of its residents, in this case those of suspects and convicted persons.
I doubt whether the Union will be able still to do so when this treaty is implemented.
It should be possible, at the very least, to demand that the treaty refer to the ECHR and that EU Member States should not be permitted to depart from it in implementing this treaty.
That is why the escape clause on the problem of the death penalty is totally inadequate.
It is not sufficient that EU countries should be able to refuse extradition, if there is a threat that the death penalty will be imposed, no, they should be bound to refuse.
Better still, Member States must include a provision in the treaty giving them the option of trying cases themselves if extradition to the US is refused.
In that case EU citizens would at least be assured of an adequate legal process with guarantees secured within Europe for the trial.
The treaty on judicial cooperation in the criminal field raises the question of the judicial and political responsibility for the consequences: the detection teams.
Is Miami Vice about to arrive in Europe?
Experience has taught us that the US has far less rigid views than our own on the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.
Who is to sound the alarm if in the future we are confronted with American agents who introduce a system of logging off?
Other Members of this House have already pointed out that data protection is not adequate.
In conclusion, I should like to warmly support what was said by the chairman of our committee, namely that he finds it unacceptable that the Council should yet again refuse to consult Parliament.
We simply cannot accept this any longer and to be quite honest, I fail to understand how the Greek Presidency dares to continue the process by repeatedly making fools of this House.
I find this nothing short of scandalous.
Mr President, in the fight against international crime and terrorism, there is already cooperation between the Member States of the European Union and the United States as regards information and this has produced significant results.
It must be developed at judicial level in order to improve efficiency, but also in order to comply with our fundamental principles and the protection of freedoms.
Indeed, the more effort we put into stepping up international cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime, the more care we will have to take not to lose the democratic guarantees and legal principles on which our action is based along the way.
Like Mr Watson, I would also mention Parliament's resolution of 13 December 2001, and, in particular, the principles it set out concerning the negotiations on judicial cooperation with the United States.
Firstly, complete respect for the European Convention on Human Rights and minimum procedural guarantees of a fair trial, as confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights.
Article 6 of the Treaty establishing the European Union must be mentioned explicitly in the agreement and there should also be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was proclaimed by the Council, by the Member States, and will, I hope, be given constitutional value.
Secondly, extradition to the United States must be refused for people who may be tried before military tribunals.
Thirdly, extradition must not be allowed if the defendant is liable to be sentenced to the death penalty.
Mr Alavanos is right: it is not simply a matter of stating that it 'may be denied'; it must not be possible if there is a risk of execution.
Fourthly, we must ensure that the provisions on data protection are proportionate and effective and only last for a limited period of time.
As regards the connection with the European arrest warrant and the International Criminal Court, I believe that, where there is a choice, the Member States must be free to choose between requests for extradition by the United States and requests to hand people over under the European arrest warrant or from the International Criminal Court, but I would like you to inform us of the positions in the Council.
Is it true that the United States rejects all references to the ICC and a number of Member States support this position?
The United States has asked for a reextradition clause to be included in the agreement that would prevent an EU Member State sending a US citizen to the International Criminal Court or another international tribunal without its express agreement.
Is this request also supported by Member States?
Lastly, does the Council acknowledge that such a reextradition clause would be contrary to its commitments regarding precisely the International Criminal Court and the Rome Statute?
Mr President, I have listened with particular attention and have noted the views, comments and observations expressing specific and justified concerns on the part of the Members of the European Parliament.
I shall try and reply to these concerns.
First, as regards the role of the European Parliament in relation to the procedure to conclude these two agreements. It will perhaps be superfluous, but I am obliged to remind you that the agreements being negotiated are based on Articles 24 and 38 of the Treaty on European Union, in which, unfortunately, no provision is made for some sort of role for the European Parliament.
On the contrary, provision is made indirectly, not to say clearly, for referral to internal constitutional procedures.
However, over and above that, we as the Presidency consider that, after the signing, a detailed progress report must indeed be given and we must listen to the views of the European Parliament.
Despite the fact, in other words, that there is no legal basis under current provisions, as Presidency I repeat and emphasise that the Presidency will update the House and the House will also have the possibility of expressing its views on the two texts, because we too consider that, on such important issues, there must be continual contact and a two-way exchange of information with the European Parliament.
As far as the comments made on the International Criminal Court are concerned, I should like to repeat and stress that the draft extradition agreement makes express provision in an explanatory memorandum, as I said, for the obligation to extradite to the United States of America not to affect the obligation to hand over to the International Criminal Court.
So I would say that it expressly safeguards the right of each Member State to honour its obligations towards the International Criminal Court.
Now, as regards simultaneous extradition requests in relation to the European Arrest Warrant. The draft extradition agreement leaves every Member State complete freedom to choose which country a person will be extradited to.
I would remind you that, within the framework of the European Union, when we debated and agreed on the European Arrest Warrant, the idea of the arrest warrant from one Member State taking precedence over every request to extradite to any other third country was not accepted.
However, even if we decide under our own internal procedures in the future to give such priority to the European Arrest Warrant, the draft agreement contains a special provision which makes it easier for us to take such a decision.
Specifically, it acknowledges that the future development of the European Union may have repercussions on the application of the agreement and makes provision for the agreement to be reviewed in the light of these developments.
However, I repeat that, under the draft extradition agreement, every Member State also has the facility to decide itself which country the person requested will be extradited to.
Now, as regards the relationship between the EU-USA agreements and the bilateral agreements which apply between the Member States and the United States of America, I shall repeat what I said in my first intervention that the EU-USA agreements do not repeal individual bilateral agreements between the Member States and the United States.
The EU-USA agreements will bring added value.
That is what we want.
For there to be more assurances, over and above those that apply within the framework of the bilateral agreements signed to date by the individual Member States and the United States of America.
What we want precisely, and this was also what we were trying to do throughout the negotiations, and this is what we are trying to do until the agreements and our negotiations with the United States are completed, is for there to be the necessary guarantees for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which will respect the constitutional principles of the Member States.
I think that it is an achievement that the references both to constitutional principles and to public security etc. which have been included in both draft agreements are now express references.
And, of course, the Member States who so wish will be able in future to further strengthen the framework agreement in question with the United States by concluding bilateral agreements, if they wish, and going even further, provided of course that they are compatible and add even greater value in comparison with the EU-USA agreements being discussed.
As regards special courts, both the extradition agreement and the mutual judicial assistance agreement, in other words the drafts of the agreements, expressly stipulate that the Member States may continue to cite their reasons for refusal already set out in the current bilateral agreements which they have concluded with the United States of America.
In addition, the draft extradition agreement expressly recognises that constitutional principles may obstruct extradition, which is why the agreement makes provision for a specific consultation mechanism.
Moreover, in the preamble to the drafts of both agreements being discussed, there is an express reference to the principle of a fair trial, including a hearing by an impartial, ordinary court, and to the question of special courts, which do not fit in with the judicial legal culture of Europe and are a matter that we raise at every meeting and in all talks with the United States delegation.
As regards the death penalty, and here I must also refer in connection with the death penalty to the draft on judicial assistance, because perhaps it is clearer than in the draft on extradition, and point out that, on the basis of Article 13 of the draft agreement on mutual judicial assistance, the Member States have the facility to refuse a request for assistance from the United States of America if they consider that the execution of the request might affect their sovereignty, security, public order or other fundamental interests.
This wording which we have managed to get included, and this was an objective pursued on the European Union side, gives the Member States the facility to refuse assistance if they consider that the evidence, information etc. requested may lead to the imposition of the death penalty.
Under Article 9, Paragraph 2, a Member State may also impose additional conditions on the United States of America with regard to the further use of evidence, for example, that it should not be used for prosecutions which lead to the imposition of the death penalty.
I shall continue with regard to the death penalty on the basis of the comments made by Mr Alavanos.
The arrangement in the draft agreement with the United States of America has been put there precisely in order to bring more added value to existing bilateral agreements between Member States and the United States of America, which do not contain adequate guarantees.
There are cases in which the current agreements have not to date contained adequate guarantees.
And in every case, the provisions in the bilateral agreements, I must stress, are not affected.
In other words, if some current bilateral agreement is more advanced, this acquis is not affected.
On the contrary, on the basis of everything we have included in the draft, we go much further, by safeguarding and guaranteeing that the death penalty will not be imposed, will not be executed, than a series of bilateral agreements which have no such guarantees.
The wording 'may be denied' does not mean that the Member States will ignore their constitutional principles, which will be expressly cited in their entirety.
And, of course, I must remind you that all the Member States have signed and ratified the protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights banning the death penalty.
I should like to finish by thanking Parliament once again for giving us the opportunity to update and listen to you and to assure you once again that we shall listen to the views of the European Parliament with particular attention before the completion of all the procedures.
Thank you, Minister.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the statement by the Council and by the Commission on the New Neighbours Initiative and the Wider Europe.
The Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Yiannitsis, has the floor on behalf of the Council.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the prospect of completing the enlargement procedure with the ten new Member States gave rise last year to a new initiative regarding the European Union's relations with its new geographical and political environment, its new neighbours.
Essentially, over and above naming issues, what we see here is a new debate on how the European Union should see the future of its relations with a series of countries which encircle it.
This debate, which has been given the name 'Wider Europe - New neighbours', was basically inaugurated last year with interventions and contributions from the Member States.
I refer to the letter from Jack Straw, Mrs Lindh and Mr Pagrotsky, the Minister for Trade, followed by a joint letter from Mr Solana and Mr Patten.
The Council discussed and adopted conclusions on the new neighbours initiative on 19 December 2002 for the Ukraine, Moldavia and Belarus, asked for specific proposals to be formulated for the endeavour and widened its limits to other neighbouring areas.
Thus, the Council stated its intention to create an ambitious, long-term and integrated approach for each of these three neighbouring countries.
This approach is based on the principle of differentiation, taking account of the conditions which characterise each country, its political and economic power, its performance and the Union's objectives for each.
Today, approximately one year after it started, completion of the enlargement procedure has strengthened our prospect of such an approach, in that it tables the wider fabric of relations between the Union and its neighbours, thereby managing to spread basic principles such as peace, security and prosperity, which are hugely important to the citizens of Europe.
The objective of combining this sort of policy with continuing and deepening enlargement is to create a ring of friends around the European Union.
The Copenhagen Council talked about common political and economic values, it talked about preventing the creation of new dividing lines and about promoting peace and stability inside and outside the Union's borders.
These thoughts were debated in depth in April, when the strengthening of cooperation between the European Union and its eastern and Mediterranean neighbours and how to evaluate their progress was examined.
The same issue was examined at the European Conference held at head of state and government level in Athens on 17 April and it will be discussed at the next Euro-Mediterranean Conference on 26 and 27 May 2003.
In particular, the European Conference on 17 April provided an opportunity to start the dialogue on the general principles of the overall initiative and to issue a statement specifying its common objectives, objectives which are accepted by the new Member States, which are accepted by the associated countries, the EFTA countries, the countries of the western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldavia and Russia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the New Neighbours initiative is an attempt by us to give new momentum to a framework which already exists and concerns relations with our neighbouring countries to the south and east.
It does not, of course, concern candidate countries or potential candidate countries, the countries of the western Balkans.
Its scope may be reviewed in the future, depending on developments.
The situation is also being monitored in other areas which are not very far away, in the southern Caucasus, which also does not at present come under the initiative, and I should like to point out that Russia is a special case and that needs to be reflected in its relationship with this initiative.
The principle of differentiation to which I referred concerns the means, the preconditions and the time frame which will be set to achieve our objectives, which are to promote the new political and economic values, prosperity and peace.
As regards the political values, these constitute the basis for improving political relations and are a necessary component for internal political stability and economic prosperity.
Promoting the political values will also contribute to the creation and operation of a responsible and efficient administration.
The Union can learn important lessons from its enlargement process and can also extend programmes on which it has acquired experience to neighbouring countries.
For the Mediterranean countries in particular, we also have a variety of religions and cultures and this can constitute a source of creativity rather than an obstacle to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation.
On the contrary, we need to find ways to bridge the communication gap which different languages, religions, customs and behaviours create, so that we respect cultural diversity at the same time.
That brings me to common economic values.
Here too, the ultimate objective for neighbours not contemplating accession is participation in the European area in which common movement of goods, services and capital will apply, the European Economic Area.
This is a prospect which can also constitute a medium-term alternative in other cases.
The integration of Russia and the Ukraine in the global economic system is of particular importance.
In addition, the procedure which we have already started up with Russia to create a common European Economic Area can also be examined for the other three eastern neighbours, including of course Belarus once conditions allow.
Membership of the World Trade Organisation will remain the sine qua non to the conclusion of a free trade agreement with Russia and the Ukraine.
Preparations for concluding this sort of agreement with Moldavia, which has already joined the World Trade Organisation, will continue.
Nor should the prospect of establishing a regime for the free movement of people be completely excluded today, even as a long-term objective.
Provided that it is linked to strict conditionality, it could give us a powerful weapon in our effort to persuade our neighbours to the east to proceed with the necessary reforms.
It would also demonstrate that the European Union is resolved to prevent the creation of dividing lines on account of enlargement and, in all events, it would give us flexibility in our handling.
As far as the Mediterranean partners are concerned, the legal structure of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation has essentially been completed and most of these partners have been integrated into the procedure for the gradual establishment of a free trade zone with the European Union.
The liberalisation of trade will also prove to be a catalyst to economic reform.
The third objective is to safeguard peace and prosperity inside and outside the Union.
Within this framework, it is advisable for us to examine the possibilities for closer cooperation on important international issues, such as terrorism, organised crime, the Petersberg tasks, environmental protection, development aid and immigration.
Enlargement is creating new opportunities, but also new challenges, especially as regards our neighbours to the east.
The Petersberg tasks and reinforced cooperation with Russia and the Ukraine are an important tool in the direction we want.
Reinforced cooperation on combating dangers such as the threat of environmental and nuclear disaster also has major possibilities.
On our new eastern borders in particular, combating these threats must be fundamental and must have the position it deserves in our priorities.
Within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, we must reinforce political dialogue with a sense of security and create an area of peace and stability.
It is advisable to strengthen this dialogue both on a bilateral basis and within the framework of the Barcelona process.
On the political side of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, measures need to be taken that will improve mutual understanding between the partners, lead to the prevention of misunderstandings and, ultimately, create the preconditions for promoting cooperation in the security sector as well.
Following an initiative by the European Parliament, we are promoting the development of the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation by creating the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly.
The objective of creating an area of common prosperity through sustainable and balanced economic and social development is linked to five more specific elements.
First element: the establishment of a free trade zone and environmental protection are complementary, not incompatible.
We consider that it is advisable for the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean environmental integration strategy adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Environment Ministers in Athens to guide our development actions.
Second element: the strengthening of the rule of law.
The objective of the current framework adopted at the Euro-Mediterranean conference in Valencia is to implement a regional cooperation programme in the field of justice, combating narcotics, organised crime and terrorism and cooperation in dealing with issues to do with the integration of immigrants, immigration itself and the movement of persons.
Third element: the development of cross-border cooperation and the integration of our neighbouring countries into the trans-European networks, especially the transport, telecommunications and energy networks.
On our eastern borders especially, it has proven difficult to coordinate the elements of cross-border cooperation with the tools we already have, Phare, Tacis, Interreg, and the possibility of creating a single special tool which will have all the elements of cross-border cooperation of the existing programmes is under serious examination and we await the relevant proposals of the European Commission with interest.
Fourth element: close cooperation in the energy sector.
Many of our neighbours are important suppliers and our policy will focus on the energy security of the Union, again in keeping with the principle of differentiation.
Fifth element: adequate criteria for progress with reforms.
The Union's position as regards what these countries should expect once they meet the criteria set must be clear cut.
The ultimate objective must be attractive, such as the conclusion of an enhanced agreement.
We must examine the issue of the name especially carefully.
Often, symbolism can prove to be a useful tool and incentive for essential reforms.
And here the principle of differentiation must be carefully applied.
These are the thoughts I wanted to present to you on this subject.
Thank you for listening.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission made a detailed statement to this House about the New Neighbours Initiative back on 11 March, and to be honest not very much has happened since then that I can report to you.
The Member States have begun dealing with this subject in the Council, and Mr Yiannitsis has just reported on that in some detail.
We have discussed this subject with the future Member States, and there has been the very laudable initiative of the Greek Presidency, in connection with the signing of the enlargement treaty in Athens, to discuss this subject with those partner states that will be affected by this New Neighbours Initiative in the course of a European Conference.
I am delighted to tell you that responses to this were thoroughly positive, so we can assume that this initiative can rely on a sufficient level of political support across the board.
The starting point for our proposals on a new neighbourhood policy is of course enlargement, but now is not the time to discuss the membership prospects of our new neighbours.
What we need for the coming decade is above all a differentiated strategy for intensive good-neighbourly relations that is not linked with any statement about the question of accession.
It is our intention to export the stability, security and prosperity that we have created and hope to build upon in the enlarged European Union.
President Prodi has already described this objective as a 'ring of friends' surrounding us, a ring extending from Russia to Morocco.
This will allow us to share with our partners much of what makes the European Union what it is, not least the common market and its rules, our Community programmes and political dialogue, but not our internal institutions.
The Commission has already explained that the countries of the western Balkans and also Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey are not included in this ring, and why that is.
These countries already have prospects for future membership, and in the case of Romania and Bulgaria this already involves a specific time frame.
It goes without saying that the intensity and pace at which relations between the EU and individual countries develop will depend on the capabilities and ambitions of the individual partner states.
But in this case too, as for enlargement, the principle of differentiation will play an important part.
We therefore want to work out an action plan with each individual country based on experience and our present treaty commitments.
These action plans will set out our common road map, and will contain objectives, timetables, modalities and monitoring mechanisms binding both sides in the same way.
It will emerge from this process whether or not we need new treaty instruments.
However, it is in any case intended that work should proceed under the existing partnership and cooperation agreements, and should not be delayed by the prospect of further agreements in the future.
Where do we stand at present with this project?
Well, for the time being, in conjunction with the candidate countries and the partner states, we are making our contribution to the discussions and conclusions planned in the Council.
We have held our first exploratory talks with Ukraine and Moldova, so as to pave the way for the necessary cooperation.
For the EU-Ukraine Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, both sides have jointly produced a detailed analysis of what has been achieved and have jointly determined what further steps are required.
Internally, within the Commission that is, we are now in the process of working out the basic planks of the action plans.
Each national plan must relate to a comprehensive and coherent framework covering all areas.
It must be possible to measure how this has been implemented in practice against predetermined criteria, so that the progress reports envisaged can be drawn up.
So you will see that we want to make use of an instrument that has already very much proved its worth during the enlargement process.
We are developing the basis of a new financial instrument and although we have already outlined the general purposes of this instrument, we still need to define it more precisely and to establish the planning principles and the overall financial envelope.
We intend to bring forward a special communication on this subject in the autumn.
We should then be in a position to start on the practical work, as soon as we have been given the necessary political green light.
As you have heard, the Presidency is working on that and the Presidency's approach has the Commission's full support.
Parliament's contribution to the further debate will not only be significant but will also carry weight.
The representatives of the people in our partner states must play their part in contributing to further progress.
We can take it that the parliaments of the partner states will attach great importance to the views of the European Parliament, and I would also be grateful if the Members of the European Parliament would use their contacts to enter into an intensive dialogue and exchange of experience with parliamentarians in the partner states.
That is why I am very pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has already appointed a rapporteur and had its first discussion on this.
I wish Mrs Napoletano every success with her task, and I would like to assure her that she can totally rely on the full support and cooperation of the Commission in her work.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform the House that Mrs Louise FrÃ©chette, the first deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, is with us.
Mrs FrÃ©chette was in the European Parliament today for bilateral meetings with a number of honourable Members and will be meeting President Pat Cox this afternoon.
We welcome her, we congratulate her on her deep dedication to the performance of her duties and we trust that her stay at the European Parliament will be very, very fruitful.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from the generally accepted historical reasons for the enlargement of the European Union, another factor which has played an important part in our decision in favour of this initiative is that since the fall of the Iron Curtain there have been differences between the West and former Eastern Bloc countries in terms of prosperity, democracy and law and order which cannot be allowed to continue. We therefore have good reasons for working to ensure that prosperity and democracy also have a chance in those countries where that was impossible under Soviet dictatorship.
With enlargement, we are pushing the boundary of prosperity and democracy further eastwards, so that the question once again arises, this time in the case of our new neighbours, of how we can live alongside them, and the Commission is to be congratulated on the way it has racked its brains to find solutions.
I support all the activities described by the Commissioner down to the last detail - with one exception, where I am opposed. That is your suggestion, Mr Verheugen, that you can manage all this without making a statement about possible decisions on accession.
On that particular point I think you are wrong.
I think it is essential, while we are in the process of enlargement - a process that will keep us busy for a long time in fact - that we should spell out who is to be a neighbour in the future and who is to be a future Member State of the European Union.
It is now absolutely imperative for us to address the issue of the borders of the European Union - and I do not just mean its geographical borders.
The Treaty itself obliges us to address this issue, because, as the Commission communication correctly mentions, European states may apply for membership of the European Union.
However, we need to consider how far the political union that we consider desirable can be extended, what the limits to integration are, what the shape of our future structures will be, and what the nature of the European Union must be.
That is not something we can or should try to resolve conclusively today, but it is very much under discussion in the Convention.
We do not need to resolve the conflict about whether the European Union is a federal state or some other kind of animal.
In such cases we lawyers tend to talk about something being sui generis. However, we do need to make a decision about who in future will be neighbours and who will be Member States, because on the one hand we owe the citizens of the European Union some clarity on this issue, as they want to know how far the European project now extends, but on the other hand we also owe clarity to our neighbours, whose hopes we should not raise if they cannot be fulfilled.
That is one of the problems that we have with Turkey, which is an important partner and ally.
The question of how to deal with Turkey has been left unresolved for too long.
The objective of 'political union' also has its limits.
The process of enlargement has now essentially reached a stage where there may still be some scope for 'rounding off', but any further accession that would jeopardise the Union's capacity for integration and totally undermine the balance between these 25 states has to be ruled out.
Enlargement has reached a stage where to shape a common view by reconciling varying positions and conflicting standpoints would take so much energy that there would be no scope for effective external action.
That is indeed one of the lessons of the Iraq war, where divergent viewpoints within the European Union condemned us to inaction.
Who can seriously believe that the accession of countries ranging from the Mediterranean area through Turkey to Russia could possibly make the Union stronger and more effective?
That is why we need to resolve the question of the borders of the European Union now, and only then can we try to act as good neighbours.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to start by telling the Commission how timely and appropriate the communication on the Wider Europe and on relations with its new neighbours to the east and south is, not least in that it makes it possible to structure the debate to exclude improvisation or extemporisation, which have the effect of raising easily-raised or vain hopes in a situation which is extremely complex and in a state of constant flux.
Indeed, there could not be a worse moment to raise false hopes regarding new dimensions of enlargement than that when we have to successfully carry the integration of ten countries through to a conclusion and to assess the effectiveness of the reforms decided on by the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference.
This, however, does not mean that the Union must become inward-looking.
Thus, the Commission is right to produce a wider integration strategy involving countries and geographical areas located to the east and south of the enlarged Union at the very time when the accession treaties for the ten new Member States are being signed.
It is, however, right, as the Commission communication states, to avoid making a misleading parallel between neighbour countries and countries which will never become part of the European Union, and, at the same time, to avoid accession to the European institutions being the only instrument which can be proposed for a closer cooperation policy addressing common problems and interests.
In other words, we need to ensure that the strategy and enlargement are relatively independent of each other.
For precisely this reason, in the initial debate which took place in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the need emerged to provide a single framework for a broad strategy which is also practical enough to propose policies for today, not for an unspecified time in the future which we are unable to foresee at this present moment but for which we can and must pave the way.
In this regard, the initial ideas which have emerged during the debate are along these lines.
To complete the geopolitical framework, considering the countries of the Caucasus too.
To look, including in the context of the Mediterranean, beyond the countries of the current partnership.
Not to exclude from this strategy, Commissioner, countries which are already about to join the Union, not in order to cause confusion but because these countries too will need to be able to interact with the areas on their borders.
If borders are considered to be more than just physical borders, it is extremely important that, between now and when they join the Union, the Balkans, for example, are able to interact in a Mediterranean context.
This does not mean that we are to iron out or fail to preserve the differences between the instruments, from the preaccession agreements to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: quite the opposite, we must strengthen them through the proposal the Commission puts forward on the cross-border dimension.
The strength of this strategy lies precisely in the fact that common objectives are established for a geographical area which, because of its history, culture and adjacency to the Union, can be described as a pan-European and Mediterranean region - the arc stretching from Russia to Morocco - as President Prodi maintains.
What can the countries of such a diverse area have in common?
I want to say to the Commission and the Council that we insist on one thing: politics, first and foremost.
We want to share, first and foremost, values, democracy, the rule of law and freedom and to develop new as well as existing instruments and policies in this framework.
I therefore believe that Parliament can - and will - contribute to this framework, for we are delighted with the spirit of openness already displayed in the speeches of the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commission.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, clearly the accession of ten new countries to the European Union is set to change the relationship we have with our neighbours.
I would like to highlight a fundamental aspect of the Union's cooperation with our neighbours, that of cross-border cooperation.
Cross-border cooperation has played a key role in European integration.
It should also play a key role in our relations with our new neighbours following enlargement.
It is to be hoped that the new European Constitution will give cross-border cooperation the place it deserves.
Our new neighbours can be divided into three different groups. There are the countries of Eastern Europe and the countries of the Mediterranean basin.
The Balkan States must be borne in mind too, although further accessions may take place in the future in that area.
Cross-border cooperation may not be sufficient to facilitate perfect collaboration with neighbouring countries. We can and must however take advantage of its benefits.
It allows us to get to know neighbouring countries, and to understand and trust them. If we know, understand and trust each other, we can work together and improve our relationship.
We will be able to export well-being and stability, to quote the Commissioner. These two elements are crucial to the future of both the European Union and of our neighbours.
I would also like to draw your attention to the particular case of Kaliningrad, in Northern Europe. This area will become an island surrounded by Member States of the European Union.
We therefore need to establish a special system of cooperation with Kaliningrad.
As Mr Yegorov, the current governor of the area has said on many occasions, there needs to be a system of cross-border cooperation with both Lithuania and Poland.
In my opinion, relations with neighbouring countries from the Mediterranean to northern Russia pose a significant challenge to the European Union.
Mr President, the historic enlargement of the Union and, perhaps to an even greater extent, the new situation created by the occupation of Iraq and the imperialist pretensions of the United States, mean that we need to think about the role the European Union wishes to play in the future and, in particular, its role with regard to its future neighbours.
This is urgent.
The logic of force is persisting after the war.
By helping itself to the resources and monopolising all of the levers of power, the Bush administration is continuing to both impose the fait accompli against the interests of the Iraqi people and disregard the UN and thus respect for international law.
To line up another view of the world against this veritable doctrine, the European Union now needs political courage, initiative and dialogue.
In my view, forging new relations with our future neighbours could be a first decisive step, particularly as regards the Arab Muslim world.
The virtually constant condemnation and humiliation it is suffering, combined with the economic and social gap, can only serve to fuel religious fundamentalism and the use of terrorism by increasingly dangerous groups, as a result of which the extreme right here hopes to prosper.
