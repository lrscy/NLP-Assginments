When we look at overall debt, though, we see that it is already well in excess of 60% in some Member States, and so I think that reinterpreting the Treaty and the Stability Pact would encourage new indebtedness and should therefore not be contemplated.
The course that the Council has chosen can â as we have seen â both guarantee that the preset Budget procedure will continue and encourage a number of Member States to revert to the budgetary discipline that the Treaty prescribes and which is vital to the future of Europe.
I would like to encourage the Commission to put forward a new proposal within the framework laid down by the Council, and would ask them to prevent the impression being created that we, by reinterpreting or even by amending the law, are pursuing a new European deficit management policy for which we will all have to pay dearly.
For how will investment be possible if interest rates end up spiralling and we have to service the debts, and then there is no money to invest in the economy?
My advice to this House, then, is that we stay within the framework of the Treaty, while making use of the necessary flexibility that it provides, both when times are hard and when things are going well, in order to guarantee the continued stability of the European currency in the future.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we note with pleasure the evidence of movement in the Council at the weekend, and I am addressing you, Mr Zalm, as one whom I know as a vigorous defender of the former interpretation of the Stability Pact.
Pardon me if I exaggerate somewhat, but I sometimes got the impression that you and some of your colleagues had a positively Manichaean way of interpreting it.
There is only âeither/orâ.
Some life has been injected into the debate now that it has become evident that there is one thing that we must keep in sight if we want to save the Lisbon strategy, to defend it and advance it, and if its objectives are indeed to be achieved, and that is that all the resources at our disposal â including the Stability and Growth Pact â must be mobilised in making the Lisbon targets realities.
Initiating an open-ended inquiry into whether all the measures associated with the Stability and Growth Pact, or all the interpretations placed upon it, were actually conducive to achieving this objective or whether certain modifications or revised interpretations are necessary, that is a step in the right direction, and that, I believe, is what was embarked on at the weekend.
Commissioner Almunia made a very important point about the 3%, which nobody wants to abandon, nor should anyone give up the 60%, but the crucial point is that if we retain this guideline â and our group too knows that it is indispensable â then the Commissionerâs statement to this House to the effect that, because conditions differ from one country to another, no one objective can be imposed, and that each country must be enabled, within its own specific limits, to overcome its difficulties in order to get back on track for the goals when it has problems, is also a step in the right direction, for those who want to save the Pact are thereby put in a position to be able to do so.
Those who interpret the Pact only in black-and-white terms â and recent developments in some countries show that this happens â and those who say that there can be no alternative to what we conceived fourteen years ago, overlook the dynamic social and economic changes that are taking place.
Commissioner Almuniaâs reference to demographic development shows that we must acknowledge and take into consideration the developments of which we were as yet unaware when we first debated the Stability Pact.
That means modifying it, modernising it and adapting it to present circumstances, it means securing it and guaranteeing it as the long-term basis of a stable currency.
Commissioner Almunia, you have shown courage, and we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, will back you up as you go down this road.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, history tells of many attempts at introducing a single currency in countries that were not joined together in a political union.
Sooner or later, all of them ended in failure.
It was intended that the euro should escape that fate.
The Stability and Growth Pact was concluded in order to oblige the members of the eurozone to adhere to standards meant to guarantee the currencyâs stability.
There was meant to be an effective sanctions mechanism to bring those sinners who transgressed these rules promptly back to the path of virtue and thus make the euro credible to the finance markets and in the eyes of the public.
The reality is rather different.
For the third time in succession this year, Germany and France have breached the 3% deficit limit.
Despite that, the sanctions mechanism has not yet kicked in.
The pact risks being revealed to be a paper tiger; confidence in the euro is shattered, and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the promptness and decisiveness with which Commissioner Almunia has come up with proposals for saving the Pact.
We see it as a good thing that the deficit threshold should, in principle, remain at 3%.
We think it right that a stateâs overall indebtedness should be more closely monitored.
We accept the need to take account of population change in the Member States and its â largely adverse â effect on budgets.
We welcome the observation that Member States have to accumulate surpluses in good times in order to be able to build up reserves for the bad ones, self-evident though that is.
Favourable though our assessment of individual elements is, we are critical of the Commission proposal as a whole.
We could exaggerate and say that, as reality is not obeying the rules, the rules are being adapted to fit it.
In policy terms, Germany and France have got their way, at least for the time being.
For as long as the wrongdoers play a part in deciding whether or not an offence has been committed, it remains uncertain whether the sanctions mechanism will ever become operational.
The origin of Germanyâs difficulties is not to be found in the Stability and Growth Pact; the problems are structural and start at home.
No reserves were built up when the going was good; reforms were needed but were not tackled with sufficient determination, and the stateâs finances were not consolidated.
The only things that will help to increase competitiveness and generate sustainable growth are a simple and attractive tax system, deregulated labour markets, and renewal of the social security and education systems.
Our principal criticism of the Commissionâs proposals has to do with the criteria for assessing whether or not a country is adhering to the Pact, which leave a great deal of room for interpretation of such factors as, for example, adverse economic conditions, particular circumstances resulting in poor long-term growth, and factors specific to individual countries relating to the adjustment of excessive deficits.
We find it doubtful that group pressure has any positive effect on the way Member States behave; on the contrary, there will be even more political chumminess of the âyou scratch my back and Iâll scratch yoursâ variety.
For that reason, the evaluation criteria must be unambiguous and easy to understand.
We welcome the Commissionerâs intention to make Member Statesâ budget policies more transparent and more binding, not least as a result of the publicity that regular reports to the European Parliament and debates on them will attract.
Last weekend, Mr Jean-Claude Juncker was elected President of the euro group for the next two years.
We hope he will manage to get the Member States to identify more with the Stability and Growth Pact and develop a greater sense of responsibility for it.
The euro is a unique success story and must remain stable for Europeâs sake and in the public interest.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens warmly congratulates the Commission on its plans for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact and is delighted that the Council appears to have given it a warm welcome.
Starting with the Dublin and Amsterdam Councils, the Greens had taken the view that the Pact would, in time of recession, be neither applicable nor applied.
That is what has come to pass.
The Council imposed no sanction on the big countries when they went over the 3% threshold.
Today, they account for 80% of Europeâs domestic product, and it is certain that, without this policy, Europeâs stagnation in 2003 would have turned into a recession.
At the same time, the United States, China, Japan and even the United Kingdom triggered global recovery by applying a budgetary policy that would have been prohibited in Europe.
There is indeed a need for reform of what President Prodi, two years ago, called âthe stupid Pactâ.
Of the four recommendations that we made at that time, the Commission accepted three: to push for the restoration of a balanced budget only during periods of growth; to tolerate reasonable deficits during periods when growth is poor; to lay down monetary and budgetary rules as part of the governance of democratically debated broad economic policy guidelines.
We do, to be sure, regret the failure to consider our proposal to remove from the remaining deficits those investments in the areas covered by the Gothenburg and Kyoto targets: economy in energy, shared large-scale transport networks, and renewable energies.
However, we reject the idea that provisions for future expenditure, such as retirement pensions, should be included among debts from now on, for we need to bear in mind that, apart from the ageing process, the disruption of the climate is the most significant debt bequeathed to future generations.
If, though, the Council proceeds now to adopt the Commissionâs proposals, it will demonstrate that the requirement for unanimity in twenty-five countries does not prevent necessary and intelligent reforms from being adopted.
Today, our fellow-citizens need such evidence and we are grateful to you for it.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, rather than producing stability and growth in Europe, the Stability Pact has resulted in the opposite.
Growth rates in most European countries are lower today than in previous years, and what has increased has been poverty, unemployment, McJobs and bankruptcies of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Do you seriously want to tell Europeans that this is what stability means?
Nobody wants inflation, yet price stability bought at the cost of employment and quality of life benefits only Europeâs rich, and harms the vast majority of Europeans.
It is unfortunate that the Commissionâs proposals on reform of the Stability Pact do not indicate a change in thinking, but are simply cosmetic corrections aimed at reviving an obsolete concept.
It is obvious that critics who accuse the Commissionâs proposals of watering down the Pact have simply not realised that the Stability Pact in its original version is beyond saving.
After all, there are now six European countries which have been so successful in cutting back that they are now experiencing a crisis, and it is as a result of this, rather than of expansionist spending policies, that they are no longer in a position to comply with the âstabilityâ criteria.
Use of the Pact as a cudgel to push through cuts in social services and privatisation policies demands that it be more flexibly applied, and this is why we of the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left reject the Commissionâs proposals as well as the spirit and letter of the Pact itself.
Anyone who has a genuine desire for stability and growth in Europe must abandon neo-liberal dogmas.
Budgetary consolidation cannot be an end in itself.
Public investments secure the future and employment.
The internal market requires mass purchasing power if it is to thrive, and this cannot be achieved without renewed increases in wages and social spending.
While we are on the subject of deficits, if large European companies were finally forced to pay up by means of a high-level EU-wide harmonisation of corporation tax, and if a new Constitution committed Europe to disarmament, not rearmament, a much more effective step would be taken towards the prevention of escalating government debts than through any aggressive programmes of cuts which only serve to aggravate problems.
We would unreservedly support a Stability Pact for Europe which was genuinely worthy of the name and which committed the Member States to reducing poverty and unemployment instead of to indiscriminate deficit goals, with sanctions imposed on countries that failed to meet them.
We are, however, firmly opposed to life-prolonging measures for an instrument which is designed to destroy the European social model.
Â Â  Mr President, it is clear that the larger eurozone governments have no intention of tying their hands by promising to adhere to the 3% deficit limit.
One would not expect them to.
The Stability Pact is rather like the common fisheries policy: every country has an interest in other countries keeping to the rules but in not being restricted itself.
The fisheries policy is not working very well, nor is the Stability Pact, but â to maintain the pretence â we are now going to have a more flexible pact taking into account economic growth rates and country-specific circumstances.
It sounds like a good idea, but in practice all these criteria depend on judgment, as Mr Almunia has just explained.
All it will mean in the end is that a country having trouble sticking to the rules of the pact does not have to.
A flexible rule ceases to be a rule.
The root of the problem is that there is no credible means of enforcement; there never has been.
It was always ridiculous to suppose that a government having trouble paying its bills could be punished by imposing a fine; yet, as the European Central Bank points out, sound fiscal policies are vital for the euro.
There are many examples of what happens to fixed exchange rate regimes when governments do not keep their budgets in order.
An EMU is just a sophisticated form of a fixed exchange rate.
Argentina is the most recent case of such a collapse.
The problem could of course be solved by much greater control of national budgets, but that does not seem very feasible right now.
Certainly we in Britain would not like to see Brussels running our Treasury.
Let me end on a positive note.
I can only say how thankful I am that Britain has not joined the euro ...
... and as the weakness of the Stability Pact becomes more obvious, the chances of us ever joining are becoming more and more remote.
Â Â  Mr President, we live in a European Union in which an internal market operates and where there is free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.
We have also seen the success of the internal market in terms of net job creation.
The success of economic and monetary union has eliminated the possibility of seeing hungry speculators playing one currency off against the other for personal gain, while doing serious economic damage to European countries and to their citizens.
The euro is a strong currency for business and it is succeeding, but we must analyse the rules governing economic coordination.
Some EU countries are breaching the Stability and Growth Pact rules and are doing so with impunity.
There is a question of economic credibility at play here.
We either all comply with the rules or we do not.
There cannot be some rules for the larger countries and other rules for smaller countries.
This not only impinges on the credibility of our economic rules, but it leads to a broader problem of selling a focused message to the citizens of Europe about the positive work of the European Union itself.
For example, the Commission reprimanded the Irish Government a few years ago about the economic governance of our country, at a time when our economy was growing at 10% per annum.
I support economic coordination, but everybody playing in the same pitch must play according to the same economic rules.
I support a review of the rules governing the Stability and Growth Pact.
Countries with low debt should be allowed to invest in key infrastructural projects of national importance.
This is serious business and EU governments must look closely at the different options available to us.
Any possible change to these rules must be fair and equal to all participants.
In Europe we have difficulties concerning the operation of the Stability and Growth Pact, but we must work through them with a sense of purpose and determination.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am strongly opposed to some countries not complying with the Stability Pact and to the European Commission allowing any kind of discussion on a possible relaxation of the Pact.
I believe that soft budget rules equal higher debts, and I believe that relaxation and non-enforcement of rules equal a loss of credibility for the entire European Union.
The only message we are sending out about ourselves is that it is not those who prosper, make a profit and create jobs who are held up as an example in the European Union, but those who live on credit and put off finding a solution to their countriesâ economic problems.
Let us not hide from the fact that in Europe today a number of Member States are struggling with stagnation, high levels of unemployment and growing debts.
I therefore believe that any display of leniency by the European Union would be out of place.
In my opinion, the Commission must instead bring greater pressure to bear on the prosperity of individual countries, as well as calling for budgetary restraint, the reduction of debts and the creation of new jobs in these countries, and, above all, ensuring that the rules which the European Union has laid down for itself are complied with.
I would like to point out that it will not be this House, or the spin doctors of individual politicians or individual governments, which pass judgement on the Commissionâs economic measures, but the global market, and the market is well known for imposing extremely heavy penalties on debtors and those who are unreliable.
If the rules are relaxed, I believe that we will see a massive stampede of firms out of the European Union to Asia and Ukraine, or quite simply to regions where taxes are lower, the workforce is cheaper and, it must be admitted, the social state is cheaper.
Neither prosperity, nor more jobs, nor a greater competitiveness of the European Union in the global economy can be achieved by a relaxation of stability and growth.
Unless the European Commission realises this and puts the brakes on spending which is not based on economic results, the Stability and Growth Pact will turn into an Instability and Failure Pact.
I thank you for your attention.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am surely not the only one who feels a little strange when reading the communications and listening to the declarations that were made a moment ago.
Although the intention is, reportedly, to strengthen the Pact, nearly all speakers have referred to its being weakened or relaxed.
While it is apparently not the intention to touch the 3% standard specified in the Treaty, my gut feeling is that it is precisely this budget standard that is proving difficult to deal with.
Furthermore, the enforcement of the Pact needs to be stepped up, but there is a great deal of wishful thinking about the greater impact of what is referred to as peer pressure, which certainly did not work for the big countries, and there is little in the way of more power for the Commission or of a decision-making alternative in the Council, which would lead to truly better enforcement.
The advantage of the announcement is, though, that it was made now and that an open debate will follow suit, and we have plenty of cause for this.
In the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, this has already been the topic of an extensive debate, and we want to contribute our might with an open mind, but we will not change our guiding principle.
Consequently, we have never said that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid.
On the contrary, we found it to be a valuable instrument, and still do.
The fact that more harmonisation is sought with other economic policy instruments, as well as fine-tuning in certain areas, an optimisation of the debt ratio, economic realism, all of these are open to discussion.
What is unacceptable to us, however, is that the Stability and Growth Pact should be adapted to please a few governments.
The Pact should prompt discipline, it should be a big stick to keep us on the right track.
That means that the Pact must be geared to long-term challenges of our social market economy, and should not be thrown off course by short-term sirens.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as Mr Schulz has just said, my group fully supports the proposal that Commissioner Almunia has put forward.
It breaks the taboo on tampering with the Pact as initially defined and suggests that you be pragmatic in learning the lessons of the first five years of the EMUâs operation. This it does in order to usher in a new period in the history of the single currency, which makes it possible, in reality, to combine stability with the prioritisation of growth and employment.
The present framework has not only shown itself to be deficient as an instrument of growth in comparison with the performances of the worldâs other major currency areas, including those of the EU Member States that remained outside the eurozone; it has also shown itself to be vulnerable in terms of its own credibility, bearing in mind not only the number and the size of the Member States that have broken its rules, but also the uncertainty prompted by the decision of November 2003, which the Court of Justiceâs ruling in July really did nothing to allay.
So it is that we endorse your proposals, particularly those about taking better account of the link between debt, deficit, economic cycles and countriesâ specific situations in order to get away from the âone size fits allâ approach; we also endorse the emphasis you place on prevention, on early warnings, on peer pressure, and, finally, on anticipating events rather than simply relying on the sanctions machinery.
My group, however, would insist on two other items, which my colleagues will address, as it seems to us that additional measures are needed.
Reform of the Pact must have as its primary objectives growth and employment, an increase in which will contribute to stability â or, to be more precise, will give the eurozone a real basis for stability â and will be achieved by making a link, which is de facto absent at the moment, between reform of the Pact, the Lisbon strategy, coordination and the Member Statesâ economic policy guidelines.
Specifically, then, we think that the issue that has to be addressed is that of how to encourage investment in growth and how to take into account, in a nuanced way, those investments that contribute to the Lisbon strategy and to achieving its objectives, namely research, innovation, infrastructures and the major trans-European networks, without forgetting lifelong learning.
Secondly, we also have concerns about the long-term nature of debt and, at the same time, we are concerned to ensure that taking account of ageing does not become a pretext for propelling Member States towards the privatisation of their social security systems, pension schemes in particular.
We would prefer this to be clarified and this argument not to be used tomorrow in an attempt the bottom line of which is to reduce social protection and social security that the people of Europe enjoy.
Â Â  âWhile endorsing the views expressed, that the main provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact do not need to be revised and that the means of implementation are clearly defined, I would still like to point out that the Pact's long-term stability depends on economic flexibility, taking into account ordinary citizens' preparedness for change.
Now the impression has formed that the main criterion of this Pact is the size of the fiscal deficit, and its sole goal is to ensure the stability of the euro, and all that can only be achieved by carrying out structural reforms, but the purpose of economic decisions is to ensure a growth in citizens' prosperity, allowing them to realise their potential.
Unfortunately, in real economics structural reforms mean a reduction in expenditure for social programmes, which make up the largest proportion in the state finance structure.
Lithuania's experience of reforms shows that if a favourable environment is not created for the transfer of capital and labour from less efficient to more productive activities, i.e. a liberal window of new opportunities is not opened for the population or business, social expenditure on structural reforms is very great and the results, due to great opposition, do not match expectations.
Thus the Pact's main priority ought to be to stimulate economic dynamism, creativity and a growth in new quality jobs, so that even my sceptically minded colleagues from Britain would not doubt the substantiation of financial and economic stability.
Â Â  â Mr President, when President Prodi, two years ago, described the Stability Pact as too inflexible, he was met with sneers.
Mr Zalm, you were one of the harshest critics, because anyone who wanted to change the Stability Pact was considered a softie.
As was often the case, you took visible delight in tarring all critics with the same brush, because they were all useless.
May I ask you something?
Is it not the case, though, that what is now acceptable to you, what you read out a moment ago, very much resembles what those self-same critics of the Stability Pact stated two years ago?
Two examples: my group has always argued for more attention being paid to the public debt and somewhat less attention to the annual budget shortage.
We have always said that there are situations conceivable in respect of which a Member State should not be penalised for exceeding the 3%, for example in the case of slow growth over a long period of time.
Finally, I applaud the fact that the Council and Commission now appear to be willing to be more flexible in their interpretation of the Stability Pact.
MrÂ Zalm, I would urge you, though, to display the same level of honesty and flexibility, and refrain from saying that you will be clarifying and improving the statute.
Instead, I would prefer you to say that you are finally taking the constructive criticism of the Green and Left Members of this House seriously and are therefore updating the Pact.
Mr Zalm, there comes a time for everyone when they have to admit that they are wrong.
This is the time for you to do so.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that a number of Member States are now openly violating the criteria of the Stability Pact, thereby serving the short-term economic interests of the monopolies, the European Union insists that it be maintained, even underlining the need for it to be applied more rigorously in order to step up pressure for new anti-grass roots measures to be taken.
The proposed amendments, in conjunction with the 3% deficit and 60% public borrowing criteria, make the Stability Pact even more reactionary, the aim being to implement the Lisbon anti-grass roots strategy more quickly, with a coordinated increase in taxation on the workers being promoted in order to generate financial surpluses.
They put national budgets under greater control, in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European monopolies by reducing taxation and granting new privileges to big business.
They place particular emphasis on public borrowing, in order to persuade the pension systems to make immediate changes, they further commercialise care, they reduce social spending and they promote quicker capitalist restructurings, in order to reduce the cost of labour and increase the profits of big business.
The proposed revision confirms that the only way to combat the Stability Pact and the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in general is insubordination and disobedience on the part of the workers and by stepping up the working-class struggle.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in modern economies, the budget balance operates as an automatic stabiliser of the real economy.
Stability in the real economy and, thus, employment therefore presuppose instability in the budget balance.
The Stability and Growth Pact was, therefore, in essence badly thought out.
By placing the emphasis on stability within the public finances, it contributed to instability in employment.
The Commissionâs reform plan is therefore a step in the right direction, but it gives cause for concern.
This step is being taken because large and powerful countries failed to meet the demands made in the Stability and Growth Pact.
Intellectual arguments and political will to stabilise employment were not enough.
It does not bode well for continued cooperation within the EU that power is more important than intellectual arguments.
It was therefore right, and important, to demand that large countries too follow the applicable rules even when these appear less appropriate.
The problems are now diminishing for countries with high structural budget deficits such as France and Germany, but increasing for countries with high public debts such as Italy, Greece and Belgium.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Stability and Growth Pact is a success.
Twelve countries belong to the eurozone, and the Pact lays down the rules for membership in it.
It is the basis for public debate on the link between budgetary discipline, inflation, price stability, growth and employment, for the debate on structural problems in Europe and for the debate on the Commissionâs role with regard to the Member Statesâ economic policies.
The Pact must not be used as an excuse for personal failures and omissions; it is a mandate for action by the Member States and the Commission.
The European Court of Justice has strengthened the Commissionâs position and, in doing so, the Pact.
The new Constitution has strengthened the Pact and the European Central Bank by including price stability as an objective in the Constitution.
We will not change the ground rules, which is precisely what those who believe that flexibility means relaxation do.
Those who, like Mr Eichel, wish to muzzle the Bundesbank, fail to recognise the role played by an independent issuing bank and the importance of transparency for trust, reliability and credibility.
I support the Councilâs position and the ECB President, Mr Trichet, in the comments he has made.
We need clear rules that apply to everyone and successful implementation.
We have no problem with the Pact; what we have is an implementation deficit.
This is why I am also in favour of a debate on the ways in which we can boost the significance of total debt, establish criteria for accumulating much-needed budget surpluses during times of economic prosperity, incorporate the consequences of demographic change and conduct a public debate on the difference between structural debt and investment debt.
We also need a debate on the Commissionâs powers to implement the Pact.
Anyone who incurs debt for debtâs sake is selling off the future.
We want the European public to have confidence in the rules we set for ourselves, and we want the public to be sure that everyone in Europe is equal before the law and is treated fairly.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to join in congratulating Mr Almunia, who has made a valiant attempt to breathe new life into the stranded Growth and Stability Pact.
I should also like to congratulate, and thank, Mr Zalm, Chairman of the Ecofin Council, for the fact that, indeed, he has not remained stuck in the past, and like Mr Lagendijk, I would not like to be the one to resolve past issues either.
What I do hope, though, is that he does not only act out of self-interest and on the basis of tactical considerations, but that, in terms of substance, he is now also convinced that it is important economically speaking to place more emphasis on the growth element of the Pact.
I would also like to note that my group very much appreciates the fact that you have indicated a wish to continue the debate with our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I think it is important for us in the European Parliament to be involved in this too.
As far as content is concerned, clearly, my group is positive about the direction that the Commission document is taking.
We have always called for a better balance to be struck between the objectives for growth and stability.
We would like to put a stop to the conflict of, on the one hand, ambitious Lisbon objectives and, on the other hand, budget standards that have been set too low over a longer recession period in order to be able to invest in renewed economic growth.
It is absurd that, for example, in Portugal, expenditure for research and development and education is being cut rather than increased and that Greece is being punished â another example of a country exceeding its budget â in connection with those splendid Olympic Games which we all thoroughly enjoyed.
Even in my own country, I can give the example of the discussion with local governments about the way in which they are permitted to fund investments out of the reserves.
That would be positive for growth if it were not for the fact that they would be faced with an investment ban if the budget shortage of 3% were exceeded, which is absurd at this stage.
My group therefore supports a Growth Pact that is formulated more precisely.
I should like to bring you two elements at this stage.
First of all, I am keen to hear your views about the golden rule.
As you know, in the United Kingdom, of all places, a country outside the eurozone, a very strong appeal is being made to draw the distinction between current budget spending and investment spending.
Your objection had always been that those boundaries cannot be clearly marked.
My appeal would not be to leave this also to the resourcefulness of the national finance ministers individually, but, in fact, to find out whether we cannot extract common standards from the Lisbon objectives, the broad economic guidelines, and hopefully soon also the opinion of Wim Kokâs high-level group.
My argument is that we would then be able to transform those many fine commitments of Lisbon and of subsequent summits into real investment and growth plans.
Secondly, I would propose to implement this in multi-annual plans complying with the deadline of 2010 or later.
What do you think of the idea of writing off that growth and those growth investments over several years, so that they are not included in the 3% standard on an annual basis?
I would like to hear from you whether you are prepared to conduct discussions of this kind in the Ecofin Council, and I hope that, in doing so, we can get the pact back on its two feet, which it needs, namely stability and growth.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, of the Prodi Commissionâs final initiatives, the proposed reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the most significant acts at a time of uncertainty in the European Unionâs economy.
The decisions made in recent years have ensured stability and kept inflation under control, but growth has remained low and there are no binding rules for implementing the Lisbon objectives.
Growth in Europe must be raised in qualitative terms back to rates of at least 3%.
Reform of the Pact may be one of the means by which we can get out of the slowdown.
The Commissionâs proposal, presented here by Mr Almunia, is a good starting point but needs to be improved.
The Member States must turn this debate into a really thorough discussion, like the one that accompanied Maastricht.
The discussion should be structured around three key points.
First, the future Pact should be âLisbonisedâ, giving greater weight to all those criteria connected with structural reforms, innovation and investment in research and development.
The proposals concerning the golden rule should be restored, but with the constraint that investments beyond the 3% should be set up and managed at Community level and should not deteriorate into a mere market for the interests of the various countries, as Mr Klinz has just said.
Secondly, with regard to debt, the trend needs to be the decisive criterion, not the amount.
Thirdly, clarification is needed regarding the credibility that the Commission wants the Pact to have, since the Pact was thrown into a serious crisis by the Ecofin decision in November and by the final text of the Constitution on the balance of power between Ecofin and the Commission, which favours the national governments more than the Conventionâs text did.
In conclusion, I must point out that, if no solution is found to the political problem of the credibility of the Pact and of the Member Statesâ commitment to abide by it, then the whole point at issue is likely to be merely academic.
Â Â  â Mr President, the changes being promoted by the European Commission in the Stability Pact do not affect its neo-liberal philosophy.
They serve the particular requirements â let us face it â of the French and German governments and they will place a particular burden on countries such as Greece with high public borrowing, borrowing which will increase as a result of the exorbitantly expensive Olympic Games and high defence spending.
These changes to the Pact do not address the crucial problems of low growth rates, high unemployment or huge social and regional inequalities, problems which have blighted the progress of the European Union over recent years.
The Confederal Group of the United European Left â Nordic Green Left, at the opposite end of the spectrum to criticism by European bankers mouthing their absolute neo-liberal doctrine, is demanding radical reform of the Stability Pact.
We demand a European pact on employment, growth and social cohesion which will introduce social criteria with quantifiable and verifiable indicators and will make provision for penalties and sanctions for the countries which infringe them, such as countries which maintain high unemployment.
Â Â  Mr President, it is almost two years ago that President Prodi described the Stability and Growth Pact as stupid.
In those two years, the debate has continued to rage and culminated in the Commission proposals which were discussed during the last Ecofin Council in Scheveningen.
In my opinion, the Commission proposals offer a basis for continuing to shape the discussion about the Stability and Growth Pact, and the implementation of the Pact continues to benefit from clear and transparent decision-making.
There is still a need for unambiguous sanctions.
The discussion that is now being held should not harm the Pactâs implementation or trust in the euro.
At the time, it was said in the debate that more account should be taken of economic trends, thus enabling the surpluses saved up from prosperous years to be used in lean years.
I should like to hear from Mr Zalm whether this suggestion has been taken on board and whether that might well prove to be the key to an acceptable new Pact.
I should also like to ask whether the Council could shed more light on the tasks and responsibilities of Ecofinâs next chairman, Mr Juncker.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, two or three years ago your predecessor, fellow countryman and party colleague, MrÂ Solbes, spoke before this House and responded to MrÂ Prodiâs comments, which have been quoted a number of times today already.
The Pact is sufficiently flexible and does not need to be changed.
The question we must therefore now ask ourselves is why, two years later, there is a sudden demand for change â one that may appear different, but comes from the same family of parties.
The way I see it, it is to your credit that you are undertaking a final rescue bid for the Pact, because what has become apparent is quite simply that the finance ministers, in particular the German and French finance ministers, may create European legislation, but do not abide by it.
I remember how Mr Zalm, the Finance Minister, addressed our committee and, amongst other things, called for everyone to be treated equally.
I would like to stress this point; everyone must be treated equally, and the law applies to everyone.
I also welcome the fact that you do not wish to amend the Treaties and that there will be no change to the figures of 3% and 60%.
You spoke of flexibility, and indeed there are good economic reasons for flexibility.
I would, however, like to make it quite clear that these reasons must be specified.
In this instance flexibility appears to be a license for anyone with a few national peculiarities to ask to have these taken into account, and the Commission hands them what they want on a plate.
The Commission must make improvements in this respect and elaborate on the relevant details.
What I find particularly regrettable is that even the Commission is not addressing the problems relating to the Pact, and you need to have a better procedure for dealing with them.
If you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive, I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to, but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves.
This, then, is where the Commissionâs role must be strengthened vis-Ã -vis the Council on this issue.
The members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) in this House support you, and I hope that at least some of the finance ministers do too.
Let me conclude with one final comment; the Stability and Growth Pact should not be blamed already for the likely potential failure of the Lisbon Strategy, which is the fault of national governments.
That would amount to myth making, which should not be allowed under any circumstances.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I warmly congratulate you.
Those who do not treat the Stability and Growth Pact as a fetish have been waiting for this moment for a long time.
A taboo has been broken; we can talk about the Stability and Growth Pact, and can even talk about reforming it.
Commissioner, you really do have my warmest congratulations, because the Finance and Economy Ministers have said that they regard your communication as a good basis on which to work.
It seems to me, then, that we have taken a major step forward.
No doubt you have been aided by the French and German situations, and by the ruling of the Court of Justice, but the step has been taken, so let us make good use of it and of the space that it has opened up to us.
This is an opportunity to be seized, primarily to put things back in order, and so I cannot go along with Mr Radwanâs assessment.
This is not a matter of ascertaining whether the Lisbon strategy has failed or whether the Pact needs to be saved.
What is at issue is how we use the Pact to make the Lisbon strategy succeed, and, looking at it from that angle, it strikes me that we must and can make more of an effort to keep track of expenditure.
By this I mean the expenditure that contributes to the implementation of the whole Lisbon strategy; I do not think of competitiveness as being the alpha and omega of the Lisbon strategy.
The Lisbon strategy will succeed if it is founded upon a strategy aiming at full employment and sustainable development on the basis of research and knowledge.
Commissioner, I turn now to a point that you raise in your communication, but which appears to me to be no more than lightweight and needing more work to be done on it, namely the link between coordination and the Stability and Growth Pact.
You know better than I do that this coordination exercise has been, up to now, a purely academic one.
The thing that makes it possible for it to become a ground rule and to define the quality of policy, does not work.
The result is that all we have is a Stability and Growth Pact that, like a balance sheet, enables us to observe how things happened, without being able to determine the dynamics of it or the collective choice.
That brings me to my last point, the only thing that involves this House: the issue of the democratic debate on your proposals, on the implementation and coordination of the Stability Pact.
Here there is much to be done.
You make reference to this House at one point in your communication, but it would appear that this is almost a formality and that, at the end of the day, debate is, in essence, reserved for a very select and very definitely closed club consisting of the euro group speaking through the Ecofin Council.
This wall has to be broken down.
The debate must break out of this enclosure, for if it does not, economic policies, which are, in the final analysis, a matter for the collective choice of societies for the good of their peoples, will not be placed in the public arena.
If this House, and the committee I chair, can contribute to this, I think we will have done a good job of work together.
I wish you good luck!
Â Â  Mr President, I cannot say congratulations to the Commissioner, but I have three questions.
Why are you in such a rush, Commissioner, to devise new rules?
Why do you not follow your predecessor, MrÂ Solbes, who thought that the Stability and Growth Pact was perfectly alright.
I think we must wait until the new Commission begins.
It is the Commission that is to administer and oversee these rules.
We also have MrÂ Zalm back in his seat as the Netherlandsâ representative, so that we might again hear his normally tough position on this issue, which I of course love.
So let us wait a little.
Why is the time not being used to discuss the Commissionâs role in the Stability and Growth Pact: the issue of whether a warning can be given without the finance ministers having to approve it, as well as the issue of its having been possible to contrive for those countries that act contrary to the Stability and Growth Pact generally to have voting rights in the Council?
I should also like to ask the chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who has unfortunately left his seat, why someone does not get hold of MrÂ Schroeder and tell him that he should observe the rules?
A flexible Stability and Growth Pact will not, of course, help him.
MrÂ Schroeder has the problem of not keeping to the Stability and Growth Pact, and flexible rules will not help him, so make sure now that he is made to follow the rules.
What Germany needs are major structural reforms.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Commission has finally acknowledged that the different economic and social realities of the various countries calls into question the rationale behind nominative criteria in applying the Stability and Growth Pact.
This justifies, albeit belatedly, the criticisms that we have made from the very outset.
We have criticised the 3% public deficit limit and warned of its social and economic impact.
We can only regret, however, that these proposals have come to light only after successive years of non-compliance by France and Germany, and are really little more than a cosmetic exercise that lets France and Germany off the hook.
We know how the Stability and Growth Pact has served to justify withdrawing public investment, particularly in the social areas for which the State is responsible, thereby encouraging further privatisation.
We all know that the consequences of a slow-down, of stagnation and in some countries, such as Portugal, of economic recession are rising unemployment and social exclusion.
What we are saying, therefore, is that we urgently need to revoke the Stability and Growth Pact and to undertake a root and branch review of economic and monetary orientations in the EU.
In order to safeguard economic and social development, it should be replaced by a pact that genuinely helps to create jobs and to foster social progress, a pact that prioritises social economic cohesion, jobs and social inclusion.
Â Â  Mr President, I am well aware that I represent a nation that is not a member of the European Monetary Union and I represent a party which is opposed to future membership of the euro.
I am not going to apologise for that because I believe the British economy is better off outside the eurozone, and our significantly higher growth rate compared to the average eurozone country bears this out.
However, as my party leader, Michael Howard, noted in a recent speech in Berlin, we believe that different combinations of Member States should have the possibility of pooling their responsibilities in different areas of their own choosing.
Thus we wish our colleagues in the eurozone well.
I am all for the principle that governments should avoid excessive budget deficits, especially when an economy is growing strongly and unemployment is low.
It should have been simple for us to have kept our spending within the limits required of members of the European Union, since all of us â not just members of the euro â are supposed to abide by these guidelines.
When Britain exceeded the 3% budget deficit ceiling, it escaped the censure of the Commission because it is not in the eurozone.
The people of other European nations were not so lucky: the Dutch and the Portuguese have had to rein in their public spending in a tight effort to comply with the pact at a time when they have been hit by recession.
However, far from being congratulated they were kicked in the teeth by the governments of France and Germany using their muscle to bend the rules and escape the fines which, if imposed, might have given them the incentive to be the team players that they sometimes urge us to be.
It is difficult to overstate the damage this has caused.
The euro is an ambitious project.
All such projects require the injection of a vast amount of political capital.
Strong currencies require credible leadership, which is lacking in this case.
Ever since the euro was introduced, the very authors of the rules are the least prepared to abide by them.
The new guidelines announced last week pay lip-service to the need for clear and effective rules.
They are in essence a surrender to political might.
Many have suggested that the eventual success of the euro will be measured in the long run by whether Britain, Sweden and Denmark decide to join.
I am not going to look into the crystal ball, but I have to say that the most recent moves by the guardians of the currency have done nothing to encourage those of us who are cautious and wary to sign up.
Â Â  Mr President, a Community with a shared destiny, such as this Europe of ours, cannot function unless freely accepted rules are complied with.
This was the essence of the Court of Justiceâs message on the case relating to the Stability and Growth Pact.
The Courtâs ruling confirmed that the Member States have discretional power at their disposal and that they have no obligation to follow the Commission; the Court also helpfully supported the Commissionâs sole right of initiative.
The Commission recently took an initiative aimed at altering the existing rules.
We must welcome this political act by the Prodi Commission and must thank Commissioner Almunia.
Socialists advocate a policy of stability and of fighting inflation, yet stability without growth leads to a sacrifice of future expenditure and to an austerity policy, on account of which the poorest sections of the public will be the first to suffer.
Even though the two pillars of the Pact, the famous 3% and 60%, are not based on pure science, the aims must not be changed.
The individual situation in each of the twenty-five Member States varies markedly.
According to the evidence, a State with a debt of around 60% of its GDP has more room for manoeuvre than a State saddled with a public debt of over 100%.
Socialists would like to give Member States a margin of flexibility in the event of an economic downturn, so that they can pursue a structural policy of regeneration, even if that means â and on this point I agree with Mr Radwan â imposing tighter budgetary discipline during times of strong growth.
We must, above all, assess the quality of public spending.
We must choose between consumer spending and expenditure for the future.
Borrowing must be restricted solely to productive investment.
This is based on a premise of better economic governance at EU level and of more thorough coordination of economic policy.
Whilst one must welcome the fact that the Eurogroup has a permanent chairman in the shape of Mr Junker, it nonetheless remains the case that a chairman simply presides over meetings and does not make decisions.
For the Stability Pact to become a Growth Pact too, coercive measures must be implemented in the area of national budgetary practice.
The ECB has reacted negatively towards the Commissionâs proposals.
I am grateful to Mr Zalm for responding somewhat frostily to what was said by the European Central Bank.
The ECBâs independence is, and will remain, set in stone by the Treaty.
Whilst the responsibility for monetary policy lies solely with the Central Bank, the responsibility for economic policy lies solely with the Member States.
European economic policy must be coordinated by political power, not against the ECB, but independently of a world view that is limited solely to monetary considerations.
Â Â  Mr President, the Court of Justiceâs ruling of 13 July was a positive development in the battle of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It was a clear signal from an independent body, which decided in the European Commissionâs favour with regard to its approach towards Member States exceeding the 3% standard structurally.
Now, however, the self-same Commission, albeit with a new Commissioner, is tabling a proposal for reforming the Stability and Growth Pact, the ambiguity of which will make it particularly welcome in the auditorsâ offices of those governments that do not play by the rules.
The Commission has a more intelligent application of the Pact in mind, but I wonder which definition of intelligence it is using, for since when has it been intelligent to reward infringements?
Let us not make things more complicated than they already are.
The Pactâs strength lies in its simplicity.
Two large Member States are now seeking a solution for their economic situation in difficult times, at the expense of the Pact, and are all too pleased to take an advance on the future.
How can we be certain, though, that in a new system, those Member States, France and Germany, will continue to observe the agreements and above all, as Mr Klinz commented earlier, will carry out the necessary economic reforms?
I totally agree with the Chairman of Ecofin that a review of the Pact could, of course, prove useful.
However, whilst in the past I was a fervent advocate of a much stronger role of the Commission in enforcing the Pact, the new Commissioner will have a job persuading me that the Pact is in good hands with him.
It is just as well that the Council, under the Dutch Presidency, has at least demonstrated its responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr Zalm, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the French contingent in our Group feels that the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the pillars of the European economy and currency.
We want it to be implemented in practice, so that we can keep control of public spending, combat excessive deficit and ensure sound management of Member Statesâ public finances.
This is precisely why we support the Commissionâs proposal and why we are pleased with the Council of Ministersâ positive reaction.
Taking on board what has been learnt from experience, the Commissionâs proposal consists, purely and simply, of making the rules of the Pact fully and intelligently enforceable, without changing the two main criteria: deficit percentage and debt percentage.
The communication of 3Â September builds on principles of which we approve: enabling the Commission to issue early warnings, placing the emphasis on the level of debt, establishing budget surpluses during times of economic growth to allow room for manoeuvre in times of economic slowdown âÂ the squirrel strategyÂ â being responsive to exceptional circumstances â a concept that the Council of Ministers should incorporate thoroughly â and, finally, coordinating the main objectives of economic policy with the decisions made in national parliaments.
This proposal therefore places greater importance on economic developments and makes strenuous efforts to avoid the risks to which dogmatism is in danger of exposing business and jobs.
If France can make a major contribution to growth in Europe this year, for example, it is clearly because the Pact has not been applied to it like a hatchet.
We also welcome the appointment of a permanent chairman of the Eurogroup in the shape of MrÂ Juncker, which is a step in the right direction.
In the future, budgetary policy will make a greater contribution to growth and will, accordingly, play a decisive role in achieving the Lisbon objectives, which determine the prospects for competitiveness and prosperity in the EU.
Â Â  Mr President, I am speaking in support of the Commissionâs Communication entitled âStrengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactâ.
It is important to return to economic governance because what we are seeing now stems from the Treaty of Maastricht, when Economic and Monetary Union was decided upon: Monetary Union was defined and realised, Economic Union less so.
And the Stability Pact, which is now ten years old, was conceived on the basis of a degree of mistrust towards certain countries which appeared incapable of passing the exam.
The European Unionâs capacity for creation demonstrates that those who were the exam candidates are now the most virtuous and, curiously, those who demanded virtue are the ones who have sinned most.
So this gives us hope in terms of European integration.
Since then, we have introduced the euro, we have decided upon the Lisbon strategy, we have drawn up a Constitution â I would like to point out that all the representatives of the governments went to the Conventionâs working group to oppose the implementation of economic governance.
We are therefore obliged to review and update the Stability and Growth Pact, because in many respects it does not work â particularly in relation to growth â and because we have had to go to the Court of Justice to get certain States to apply it.
I believe that this is what justifies both the Commissionâs actions â which we clearly support â and the positive reaction of the Council, because, just as the European Central Bank has to be monetarist, the Council has to concern itself with the functioning of the economy.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, strengthening economic governance and clarifying the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact are important matters, not only in order to refocus attention on the Pactâs underlying ethos and to strengthen the foundation which lends stability to the monetary union, but also in order to avoid undermining the trust which the public placed in us in 1997 during the discussion on the introduction of the euro, a discussion which took place both in this House and elsewhere.
The Stability and Growth Pact is a requirement for justice and sustainability.
It must therefore remain in existence, and its direction and application must be preserved and strengthened in accordance with the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht and the European Constitutional Treaty.
The Stability Pact illustrates the simple economic and fundamental truth that todayâs debts always end up being tomorrowâs taxes, to be borne by future generations.
The Pact therefore rightly calls for an end to state indebtedness and for a budget that is balanced across the economic cycle.
Under the Pactâs rules, as has already been noted, temporary deficits can and may be tolerated during economic upturns, but during the next economic upturn these new debts must then be cleared again.
Against this background, the Commission communication rightly poses the question of long-term viability, and calls for better links between the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact.
A critical view should however be taken with regard to an issue which is given much space in the communication, namely that of placing greater emphasis on the Commissionâs recommendations on economic development.
The Commission communication contains a total of five key proposals; due to a lack of time I can only evaluate one of them, the improved coordination and implementation of budgetary policy.
The closer links between the Commissionâs recommendations on the essential features of economic policy and the Stability and Growth Pact are to be welcomed, and have meant that the Commission has been able to stimulate competition among systems in the Europe of 25 and to make a major contribution to moving closer to the goals set in Lisbon.
We should therefore lend our unreserved support to these renewed proposals for increased transparency and accountability in the Member Statesâ budgetary policies, and it must be especially in the interests of all participants in the monetary union to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact by means of transparent data.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the primary task of the European Unionâs financial policy must be to provide a sound basis for the economy.
It must be stable and predictable, but must never become ideological.
I am quite astonished to hear it said in this House that confidence in the euro has been shaken.
Where have you found even one piece of economic evidence to support such a statement?
The truth is quite the opposite; the businesses with which I am in contact are more concerned at the strength of the euro against the US dollar and at the fact that we are experiencing low economic growth.
The people with whom I am in contact are concerned at the high rates of unemployment in the European Union.
I am sure that Mr Almunia will have the opportunity to discuss confidence in the euro and the international view of the euro in his answer, and we can in any case continue the discussion in this House.
Mr Poettering, it was with great interest that I discovered how broad a discussion is being conducted on this issue within your group.
This discussion is a fascinating one, and apparently this is also the case within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats).
Our proposal is this: let us be reasonable and avoid ideology, and let us support the Commissionâs ideas, which are capable of making the Pact more effective and of turning a stability procedure into a Stability and Growth Pact.
It is high time for us to tackle this task.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner Almunia, ladies and gentlemen, every day in our debates we say that for Europe to be competitive in the world economy it needs more economic growth, more concrete and materials-based infrastructure, and more reforms.
Every day we say we must implement the Lisbon Agenda, but the results are there for all to see.
The current Stability and Growth Pact, as structured, cannot provide a solution either for growth, or for the infrastructure gap or for the call for reforms.
It is just a poor surrogate for a common economic and growth policy which does not exist.
It was wanted by the strong countries because they did not trust the weak ones, but in the end it was the strong countries who were the first not to abide by it.
Something, therefore, is not working, and we have to be honest and admit it.
As we all know, the three strategic objectives of growth, infrastructure and reforms can be synthesised by policy makers in a formula that economic theory calls the golden rule, which allows for intergenerational investment spending to be financed through deficit and at the same time requires current spending to be financed without generating a budget deficit.
Until now, European bureaucracies and governments have said no to the introduction of the golden rule for fear of opportunistic behaviour by the Member States.
Such fears are correct, but Europe cannot be built on fears.
To prevent national opportunism if the golden rule is implemented, it is important that there should be clear European objectives and clear European rules, as well as equally clear financing with checks on its appropriateness and checks on the outcome, without leaving any room for accountancy tricks or bullying tactics, which have been used all too often in the recent past, even by countries considered to be hard-liners.
Why not try out the golden rule?
If the golden rule is not included in the Pact reforms, the ECB will be right in saying that it is better to give up and leave the Pact as it is, stupid and open to being bypassed at will by the strong, but also useless if not damaging, given that the timid interpretative corrections, sponsored by various parties, regarding the flexibility of medium-term deficits as well as the sustainability of debts are of little use.
Mr Almunia, I wish you all the best in your work and urge you to be as courageous as necessary at such a difficult time for the integration of this Europe of ours.
Do not listen to the hordes of self-interested sirens in disguise that are likely to permanently sink not only the credibility of the Pact but along with it the credibility of Europe as a whole.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to point out to the Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats â but evidently not to Mr Brunetta, who has rather different ideas on the matter â that the Stability and Growth Pact is not being changed to make it less strict.
That would be a mistake.
The Pact should be changed because it has started to contradict itself.
Its mechanisms balance if the nominal growth of the economy comes to around 5%.
Our potential growth in Europe is consistently below that figure, and so the Pact does not hold.
If it is left like that, debt will rise as a result.
The Commissionâs proposals are sound.
They can be enhanced and strengthened in relation to Lisbon and in relation to the strengthening of European integration, which means avoiding the risk of policies breaking down at national level.
If, for instance, precise mechanisms are identified to make the Pact fully and automatically cyclical, to support European investment programmes or to give set flexibility margins to countries that approach the Lisbon reforms structurally, all that would not mean making the rules less strict but making them more effective and directed towards growth and integration.
Lastly, it is fair to look more carefully at debt, not the amount of debt but its dynamics.
In fact, for mathematical reasons, under equal conditions of growth and deficit reduction, a larger debt falls more rapidly, and so it is appropriate as well as fair to punish not the accumulated errors of the past but, if anything, the laxity in remedying them.
Â Â  â The President-in-Office of the Council has informed us that he has to leave our debate for unavoidable reasons.
We shall therefore proceed as follows: I shall give the floor to Minister Zalm of the Council, who will give an account of the impressions and content that he has gathered from the debate, and then we shall return to the debate, which will conclude with the speech by Commissioner Almunia.
Â Â  . I am very grateful that you have given me the opportunity to say a few words now.
I apologise for leaving earlier but the problem is that I am not only President-in-Office of the Council and Netherlands Minister of Finance, I am also replacing the Prime Minister at the moment because he is in hospital.
I have many obligations to fulfil.
After listening to all the statements it is clear that there is a wide variety of opinion in Parliament.
I am not surprised by that.
Maybe we can reach some consensus here.
As President-in-Office of the Council I must be very careful in expressing my views because I have not had an opportunity to check whether all my 24 colleagues agree with my answers to some of the remarks made.
Let me pick out a few themes.
First of all, as asked by various speakers, why did we have problems with the Pact?
The basic mistake in the past has been that we did not make use the good times for consolidation.
I believe that both Mr Poettering and Mr Klinz said a few words in that regard.
My colleagues in France and Germany also concluded that if they had been in surplus or in balance before the downswing started, they would not have breached the 3% limit and all these troubles would not have arisen.
I think that is an important consensus.
Those who now criticise the Pact for its rigidity are probably not the same people who advocated more rigid consolidation in the good times.
Perhaps they felt that the good times were so nice that we could spend even more than the governments planned.
That is my experience, at least.
We must be consistent during the entire cycle.
If we consolidate firmly in good times then we can be more relaxed when the economic cycle takes a downturn.
Stabilisation over the entire cycle â that is one of the lessons learned.
I hope, as I am sure you do, that we are now at the start of the upward part of the cycle.
If we use that time well, the inevitable downturn will not, once again, lead us to the problems that we have previously encountered.
We do not need any change to the text of the Pact in that regard.
As has been remarked by some speakers, the Stability and Growth Pact is not a solution to everything.
We also have the Lisbon process.
I do not believe that there has to be tension between the Stability Pact and the Lisbon process.
Mr Schulz spoke of this tension.
Personally, I do not believe that low deficits, the fact that the deficits were not high enough, are the real problem in relation to the lack of growth in Europe.
We have to look at the necessary reforms and also set the right priorities in our budgets, so that we really spend the money within a budgetary framework and on the issues that are important for the Lisbon process.
I must point out that if we were more relaxed on deficits, interest payments would gradually crowd out other expenditure, such as expenditure on R[amp]D and education, which we all want.
In the medium and long term, higher deficits are certainly not a solution for any Lisbon objective.
They may even conflict with the Lisbon objectives.
A few of you were a bit afraid of an ad hoc approach, that we would not apply equal treatment to all the countries based on clear criteria.
We discussed that in the Council and stated that we need a rules-based system for the future.
There were some questions about the golden rule.
As such, the golden rule is a pro-cyclical system.
It was used in the 19th century in many countries.
I do not think it would be good for economics today.
Other questions were asked about the role of MrÂ Juncker.
He will be President of the Euro Group.
There are some advantages to having a longer-term president, who will also be its face the outside world, for example in the G-7.
If people see a new minister of finance come from the Euro Group every six months, it will not make a very strong impression.
Such a president also organise and plan for a longer period than just six months.
I hope that in the coming weeks and months we can work further on this issue.
As I said, the Commission proposals are a good basis for discussion.
They will probably not be accepted lock, stock and barrel, but I do not think the Commission ever expected that.
We already have some basis for consensus in the paper I presented to you today.
I hope that we will get full consensus on an operational Pact that is really implemented.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Almunia has interpreted Shakespeare brilliantly.
As in Mark Anthonyâs funeral speech, he sings the praises of budgetary austerity but, at the same time, tells us that he has put in place the necessary explosives to bring down the pillars supporting it.
The Commissioner advocates simple rules but, at the same time, he tells us that we must take account of the national circumstances of each country, which means there will be 25 different rules.
What we were saying yesterday about the Stability Pact is still true today.
It is absolutely true that we must maintain the austerity pact in order to maintain price stability; that budgetary austerity serves to free up resources for education, research and development in order to make the Lisbon process possible; and, above all, that it is necessary to meet the implicit, hidden, unbudgeted-for obligations resulting from the ageing of the population.
What we were saying yesterday is still true today.
And if we are saying other things, that is simply because we are treating the Stability Pact as done for.
The Stability Pact was good, the bad thing was that it was not complied with.
Secondly, Commissioner, all of those who have always been in the Stability Pact are the ones who are today applauding your measures and all of us who have always been in favour of the Stability Pact are the ones who are against the Commissionâs proposal for making it flexible, unequal and discretionary.
Thirdly, Commissioner, the applause of the governments is not disinterested applause.
The Stability Pact is not a pact in favour of the governments, it is a pact against governments, for restricting their action, in order not to neutralise the actions of the Central Bank and in order to maintain price stability.
And if it is a pact against the governments and in favour of the citizens â and in this regard I agree with what the chairperson of the committee has said â you will have the support of my group in enhancing the powers of the Commission, against the Council, and the powers of Parliament, as representative of the citizens, to defend that budgetary stability, which will provide the citizens with lower prices, lower interest rates for their mortgages and will help to guarantee that we will have resources in the future to attend to the needs of our pensioners and that we will not have squandered those resources by paying interest and paying off debt.
The PPE-DE Group will support the Commissioner in this debate.
But if the intention is to draw up rules that make the application of the Pact discretionary, unequal and ultimately unfair, in accordance with the ââ principle, the Commissioner will not have our support.
Â Â  . â It is in the interests of Hungary, and presumably in the interests of the newly-acceded countries, that the euro should remain strong and become attractive for the population since, we too have to step into this zone and it will be extremely useful for us too.
I support the fact that, in the interests of the euroâs prestige, there should be strict framework rules for the Member States and this is why I do not agree with the weakening of the Stability Pact, or in an extreme case, its abolition.
I also agree that the Commission had examined the experiences of previous years and, in the area of implementation, it foresaw more flexibility which must, however, strengthen the willingness to observe strict framework conditions.
I also agree with the Commissionâs approach that several views must be considered when revising the Pact, such as supportable state debt, protracted slow growth, harmonisation and co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies.
One must be careful however, that for the unity of the requirements system an equal judgment must prevail.
I see that as a very important criterion.
As for myself, I believe that it would be very complicated to work out a country-specific conditions system.
Instead, one ought to concentrate on the individual characteristics of the economic situation and incorporate this into the whole system.
Apart from such a characteristic as excessive indebtedness, there could be other aspects to consider such as the excessive openness and vulnerability of small countries, but, above all, the consideration of the principle according to which one of the most important aims of the Union is cohesion, that is, the joining up of less developed countries and regions that are lagging behind.
This is particularly pertinent to the ten out of the twenty-five Member States, the newly-acceded states where, apart from ensuring conditions of growth, one must pay attention, when assessing the observance of the criteria, to certain reforms in public spending, such as for example the reform of the pensions system, the need for a quota of higher investment and the appearance of an occasional higher rate of inflation.
But these of course, in these circumstances, are economic phenomena.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I could perhaps accept that the Stability Pact has been useful.
However, it needs amending, because it has not always been applied correctly or fairly.
In some countries, the Commission has exhausted its strictness, and in others the Council has exhausted its leniency.
I agree that we must take account not only of the actual but also of the structural deficit, by overlooking short-term cyclical fluctuations in GDP.
Had we done so, Germany would not have had a problem in either 2002 or 2003, or even this year, while France would have had a problem in 2002 and 2003, but not this year.
A source of friction would have thus been eradicated.
I also agree that we should not overlook borrowing, but this means that we need to use the primary structural deficit; in other words, we need to subtract amortisation costs.
I also agree that we need to examine the extent to which a country has exorbitant expenditure for which it alone is not responsible, as with Greece and the extraordinary spending on the Olympic Games.
Finally, I want a pact which will achieve stability in the eurozone, not unequal treatment of Member States, a pact with a long-term strategy, not knee-jerk reactions, which safeguards the Lisbon objectives without sending the economies into a vicious circle of recession.
If we are to achieve all this, we need to clearly amend the Stability Pact, the Regulation itself, not merely hope that it will be applied better in the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to begin by making one point: let us look to what is really important in the European economy, namely that we now have low inflation and low interest rates throughout the European economy.
It is easy to look back to the Seventies and see how matters were then, for at that time we had high inflation, high unemployment and governments that added to their budget deficits.
Thanks to the Stability and Growth Pact, we have a common code and a common criterion that has counteracted these factors.
The paradox is that we are now having this debate partly because the Stability and Growth Pact has operated as it was supposed to do.
It has put political pressure on those countries that increase their deficits and, for that reason, it is of interest to us all, irrespective of whether or not we have the euro or of whether or not we participate in monetary union.
The basic problem in the European economy, affecting the image of the Stability and Growth Pact, is that too many countries have inflexible economies that are incapable of handling the deficit situation when times are hard.
In this context, I want to say that there is a direct link between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon process because we either develop flexibility in the Member Statesâ national economies, providing dynamism and growth, or have a more flexible interpretation of the rules, but we do not solve Europeâs problems by introducing other rules.
I therefore wish to appeal to the Commission to be objective and clear, no matter what form the criteria take.
The solution does not lie in change but in reform of the European economy.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share with you my concerns as an MEP from a new Member State.
Especially before accession, we saw the Stability Pact as a powerful and comprehensible symbol of Europeâs stability, and this was not because of its name, but thanks to its contents.
It was the symbolic custodian of a healthy economy and of reliable rules and justice, for everyone and without exception.
I say âwasâ, because today this is no longer the case.
It is a symbol which needs rehabilitating.
Budgetary discipline is a political risk today for governments which have embarked on public finance reform, and yet it is of crucial importance for the stability of the entire European Union.
Flexible interpretations and relativisation of the Pact are a stab in the back for these courageous governments.
It is not flexible interpretations of the rules which citizens and businesses expect, but a flexible EU trade policy.
I would like to draw the Commissionâs attention to the threat posed to the EUâs internal market by the dishonest trading practices of third countries.
These mean that it is important for the Commission to open negotiations with the WTO on import quotas, in particular with regard to imports from China, which disregards the social and environmental regulations of our market.
A threat to three million jobs in the textile industry and womenâs unemployment are at stake, which means a threat to employment stability as of January of next year.
A flexible trade policy and reliable rules are conducive to stability.
I welcome the Commissionâs efforts to increase the transparency of rules, I believe that it will open negotiations with the WTO, and I am keeping my fingers crossed for it.
Â Â  Mr President, it is imperative for me in this debate to set out clearly the issues at stake, and to highlight what is necessary and realistic.
We start from a most regrettable situation. Non-compliance with the Pact on the part of a growing number of Member States is clearly a serious breach of good budgetary behaviour.
I am not unaware of the effects of the economic situation, yet I have noticed that the Member States that have had the courage to avoid slipping into extravagant spending show indicators that are perfectly in line with the legislative provisions.
The good behaviour of some is unfortunately suffering from the backsliding of others.
Having said that, let us not fall into the traps either of blind devotion or of dogmatism. The future ex-President of the Commission, moreover, did not hide his feelings on the Pact, using extremely undiplomatic language.
I find the guidelines set out by the Commission interesting because they could lead to a less simplistic understanding of Member Statesâ public finances.
Therein, however, lie further difficulties: how can we reconcile an understanding of the complex and unique situations of each Member State with maintaining rules that are clear, understandable and applicable across the board?
I wish all the best to those who will have to undertake the task, including my compatriot, the future President of the Council and the future âMr Euroâ, who is well known for unravelling the most complex problems.
Lastly, the crisis that we are enduring is highly symptomatic of the way in which the EU operates.
Nobody would deny that the EU is a community governed by the rule of law, yet it is clear that the power to exert force over the Member States quickly comes up against its limits.
Overall, the dilemma is a tough one: rather than witness the slow death of the Stability and Growth Pact, I would prefer to see its regeneration, given that its demise would also have incalculable repercussions for the euro and that I still set some store by the value of the currency and of the money in my wallet.
Â Â  â Proposals for the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact would be worth discussing, even though the proposed amendments to the Pact would require careful evaluation.
However, in my view, in the current situation a revision of the Pact should not be contemplated, because certain states chronically fail to observe the existing criteria and a growing number of states may well fail to observe them in the future.
Nor does the inadequate penalty regime serve to encourage the maintenance of budgetary and fiscal discipline.
The proposed reforms give a dangerous signal to market forces about inability to control the situation even in the long term.
That is why I cannot support the proposed reforms, especially those relating to anchoring the budget deficit level and the different deadlines allowed to Member States for eliminating excessive deficit.
Budgetary and fiscal policy are particularly sensitive areas of political responsibility.
Any exceptions in these areas will inevitably tend to be never-ending.
Of concern is the proposal for an extended period of weak economic growth, which would in effect offer a limitless time for those politicians who are unable or do not want to undertake structural reforms in their countries.
A relaxation of the rules will not motivate politicians to undertake unpopular reforms.
Similarly, the proposal for country-specific adjustment paths for correction of excessive budget deficits is of special concern.
These specific adjustment paths for various countries may prove to be not simply specific but also significantly different, because transparency in these matters is hard to ensure.
That would lead to a loss of confidence in the Pact as a whole.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would firstly like to thank all the honourable Members who have contributed to this debate, sometimes with support, sometimes with critical support and sometimes simply with criticism.
All these contributions will be extremely useful for me as I carry out my future duties as Commissioner responsible, insofar as it falls to me, for carrying out this adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact and of economic governance in general, and they seem to me extremely useful in terms of communicating arguments and objectives on such an important issue as the economy of the Member States of the Union and of the European Union as a whole from Parliament to the public.
I would like to say once again â I have done so in my initial speech and it has been said in several of your speeches, but I want to repeat it in this final speech â that the Treaty is not in question, nor what the Treaty says about public finances and about budgetary stability.
The limit of 3% of GDP for the public deficits of the Member States of the Economic and Monetary Union and the limit of 60%, in relation to GDP, for public debt remain in force.
The countries that are not complying with these limits are obliged to do so.
They do not remain in force for no good reason, but because one of the objectives of the Economic and Monetary Union must continue to be budgetary stability as a condition for the effectiveness of the extremely important political decision we took when launching the Economic and Monetary Union and, in particular, the creation of the single currency.
And it is still necessary to preserve the objective of budgetary stability and those reference values by means of the system of rules â as has been said on many occasions during the debate.
But we must also be aware that the ultimate objective of the Economic and Monetary Union, of the budgetary stability of economic policies, is to guarantee more growth and well-being for some of our citizens.
And some of you have expressed the opinion that the debate on the reform of the pact could even in some way affect the stability of our currency, the euro.
I do not believe that is the case if the debate is held within the limits we have set for it as in the Council last weekend and as in this debate today in Parliament.
What has been discussed is the fact that the eurozone and the European Union as a whole are growing less than other areas of the world.
We have more stability, thanks to the decisions we have taken within the framework of the Economic and Monetary Union, but we have less growth.
And that is a response we must find not only through the instrument of the Stability and Growth Pact, but also by rereading it, revising it and adapting it, introducing more economic rationality into it, taking account of the heterogeneous nature of the European Union of 25 following enlargement, taking account of the fact that the Treaty also talks about the need to preserve the sustainability of public finances and not just of preserving and ensuring budgetary balance in each financial year, by monitoring public deficit, and bearing in mind that, over the years the Stability and Growth Pact has been applied, its credibility has suffered because the rules in force have not always been adopted and applied by the institution which must ultimately do so, which is the Council.
We must therefore strengthen the pact, the framework for budgetary surveillance and our instruments for economic governance.
And how must we do this?
With more flexibility or more rigour?
With both things.
In certain respects, we must be more flexible, because experience shows us that the room for manoeuvre, which a reasonable interpretation of the rules we decided upon allows us, is not sufficient to take account of very powerful arguments arising from economic rationality, from the specific situation of the economy of the country at a particular time.
And in other respects we must be more rigorous, such as in our surveillance of the evolution of levels of public debt or in the mechanisms for application of the Pact for example, both in the preventive part and in the corrective part of the Pact, in the excessive deficit mechanism.
We must take account of the economic cycle, preserve equality of treatment for each and every country â and this is a task the Commission identifies itself with in particular â and ensure better compliance.
And we must link the Pact better with the other instruments of economic governance â as many speakers have said this afternoon â the Lisbon Agenda and the economic growth objectives in order to make the European Unionâs Economic and Monetary Union the most competitive area in the world and, at the same time, the most socially cohesive and the most sustainable from an environmental point of view.
Does this require a debate?
The Commission believes this is obvious.
Should this debate take place within a certain limits?
Of course, and that is established in the Commission's Communication.
Must we seek agreement and the greatest possible degree of consensus in our dialogue and cooperation with the Council?
I believe this is absolutely essential.
The debate â and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Zalm, has said this as well â must lead us, and I trust that it will lead us, in November, on the second analysis by Ecofin of the adaptation and improvement of the Stability and Growth Pact, to a level of agreement and consensus between the Member States, at Council level, and between the Council and the Commission, which is even greater than the very considerable level of agreement demonstrated last weekend.
Changes to the rules will be necessary, as few as possible.
In any event, the touchstone of the discussion must not be whether or not an article, an item or a paragraph of a regulation should be changed.
The touchstone will be whether the reason why it has become necessary to change that regulation has been agreed, is reasonable and is in accordance with our objectives of budgetary stability, of maintaining a framework for fiscal and economic governance and of that framework preserving the stability and growth of the European Economic and Monetary Union.
Finally, Mr President, a comment on the issue often mentioned in many speeches from France and Germany.
The judgment of the Court of Justice of 13 July basically considered the European Commission to be right.
The Council was not entitled to act as it did last November.
We must now apply the Treaty, as interpreted by the Court of Justice.
The Council has no choice but to respect the Commissionâs right to initiative.
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and must therefore ensure compliance with the rules of the Treaties and their implementation by means of the Stability and Growth Pact in force and we are committed to doing this and we are going to act on the basis of the judgement of the Court of Justice.
What action are we going to take?
We are following the development of the public finances of many Member States very closely, but in particular that of France and Germany during 2004, and the budgets that each of the two governments are beginning to draw up and which they will communicate for discussion to their parliaments in the coming months, before the end of the year.
At the end of October, when we will know the content of the budgetary policies formally announced by the two governments and while we await the final decision of their respective parliaments, the Commission will publish its estimate and economic forecasts and we will estimate how public debt in France and Germany may develop in 2004 â we could practically give an accurate estimate now, but I would prefer to wait until October â and our estimate for 2005.
On the basis of the Commissionâs economic forecasts and with the precise information we will have in the weeks following the publication of those assessments of the real and concrete content of the budgetary policies agreed by both of those countries for 2005, the Commission, employing its right to initiative and carrying out its duty fully, will tell the Council what its proposal is.
The Council will have to take the appropriate decisions, of course, in a climate of cooperation, but naturally with the greatest respect for the principles and rules laid down in the Treaties and in the regulations in force in the field of budgetary stability.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, with the Commission proposal, we are out of the frying pan and into the fire: more flexibility but without clear-cut criteria.
In my view, the core of the Pact should remain intact, namely maximum 3% of GDP for budget shortage and 60% of GDP for public debt.
If the Pact is to become more flexible, this should be done on the basis of objective and general criteria.
This is where the proposal leaves a great deal to be desired.
The Commission should have more powerful means at its disposal to force Member States to adhere to the terms of the Pact.
At the moment, the Council has too many fingers in the pie, which leads to a politicisation of the Stability Pact.
The sanction mechanism in the present Stability Pact did not appear to be rock-hard or neutral: large Member States, on the basis of their position of power, were able to violate the rules and get away with it.
Although the present Pact does not conclusively specify that in times of economic prosperity its members have to work on building up a surplus, that is essential if the Stability Pact is to be successful.
The creation of such a buffer, for example, with a view to an increase in the ageing population, is indispensable.
It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission underlines the importance of such a buffer in the revised Pact.
At the same time, with the 3% limit, in principle, the Pact offers Member States enough leeway to invigorate their economy in times of economic decline.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the following oral questions
- to the Council:
B6-0008/2004 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the Council, on the ratification procedures for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe;
- to the Commission:
B6-0009/2004 by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to the Commission, on the communication strategy concerning the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Constitution has successfully overcome its first two hurdles in the shape of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference.
Over the next two years we now face a third hurdle, which could prove to be the most complex and demanding for this historic project â its ratification by the EUâs 25 Member States.
We must recognise that work will by no means be completed with the ceremonial signing of the Constitution on the Capitol in Rome on 29Â October.
On the contrary, work must go on, and everyone must bring this project to a close with the same energy, vigour and discipline.
I am aware, and our committee is aware, that there is a risk that the European spirit, which was very much present in the Convention, but which became less and less so, without disappearing entirely, in the Intergovernmental Conference, will be lost in the national debates and domestic political battles of coming months and of the next two years.
It is already noticeable that a populist and opportunist movement is being organised against the European Constitution, and it is a cause for concern that this germ has already infected one of the originators of the European idea, as is evident from the debates over recent weeks in France.
The fact that a populist and opportunist movement is turning against the Constitution should give us pause for thought, even when the reasons have little to do with this project.
We must not allow the power games and power struggles of domestic politics to water down or even destroy this historic project, and everyone who has fought for the Constitution in the past years and decades must rise up in opposition to this.
Parliament, the Commission and the Council were active participants in the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe that the three European institutions also bear a particular responsibility in this ratification stage, as we must be advocates of the compromise that has been reached.
It is therefore unacceptable for individual articles to be extracted from the overall compromise and used as a pretext for rejecting the entire Constitution, and this must not happen.
An overall compromise has been reached, and we must see the wood and not just the trees, to put it metaphorically.
It is also the task of the European institutions to explain the fundamental goals and content of the Constitution to the European Unionâs 450Â million citizens, and to provide them with information on this issue.
We would therefore like to ask the Commission and the Council whether a communication strategy exists, and whether suitable activities aimed at informing the European people about the project are in preparation.
This House would also like to ask the Council whether a strategy exists for coordinating ratification in the 25 Member States.
We are well aware that ratification will take place in accordance with the national law of each Member State, and it is also clear that some countries will require more time than others.
It would however be entirely wrong if no attempt at coordination were made, especially when this has already taken place in the ten accession countries with regard to ratification of the Accession Treaty, and with visible success.
The Commission, the Council and Parliament may not now sit back and content themselves with watching from the sidelines.
On the contrary, and as I said before, the same vigour and ambition must continue to guide us over the next two years in order to ensure that this project clears the final hurdles.
The 2004 Constitution must not suffer the same fate as the 1984 and 1994 drafts, which went straight into the archives and never made it off the printed page and into reality.
This 2004 Constitution must become a reality, as only then can progress result in increased democracy, transparency and efficiency in the European Union and hence for the people of Europe.
This is our goal, and this is what we must work towards.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you very much, I shall try to be brief.
I have another opportunity later on, in reaction to other comments on this subject, but it is a hugely important topic.
First of all, I should like to say that Mr Leinenâs words are very much my own sentiments, especially when he points at the enormous importance, after the steps we have now taken and will be taking on 29 October when we will be signing the Treaty, of carrying on with the same fervour, because we are not there yet.
Mr Leinen is absolutely right in saying this, and a very important next step is to be taken in connection with the ratification and the referendums which will be held in a number of countries.
I am also in total agreement with him that this responsibility is shared between Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
To date, our three institutions have managed to achieve that, and we will indeed need to continue in the same manner at the next stage.
I am pleased that he himself indicated that there is, of course, a national responsibility where legislation, the implementation, the organisation of the ratification and also of possible referendums are concerned, and that this does not fall within the remit of Brussels.
We will at any rate ensure, though, as we have also discussed, that information about this ratification process is collected.
The Councilâs Secretariat will be collating this information and compiling a rolling document, so that new information with regard to the planning and organisation of the ratifications and possible referendums can be processed in this document at any time.
This will be a permanent concern for us in the Council and will also be discussed during the European Council.
I can tell you that we have also agreed that this will also be routinely on the agenda of the European Affairs Ministers who usually meet at least during each General Affairs Council for an informal lunch.
It follows that from this position, we will be able to keep a finger on the pulse over the next few months.
The European Council has drawn attention to the problem in a wider sense than simply the ratification and the general involvement of the public, partly further to the low turnout at the most recent European Parliament elections.
We the presidency, and particularly the European Affairs Ministers, will make sure that we can table concrete proposals that will be discussed at the European Council of 5 November.
We will set to this task in Amsterdam on 5 October, and will discuss, as already stated, both communications in a more general sense and also specifically the best ways of taking account of the ratification procedures in the different Member States and of the harmonisation that is required for this purpose.
That means, in any case, exchanging information and learning from each otherâs experiences in this procedure.
Where harmonisation in time is possible, that should be done, but once again, that is a national responsibility.
We will also ensure, and this will probably be handled centrally, that all citizens can have access to a text of the Treaty.
On this score too, scope will need to be provided, though, for all possible information-related campaigns and activities to be handled at national level.
I think that the signal which the new Commission has sent out, also by appointing the first Vice-President with specific responsibility for communication, is an important step, and further attention is also being paid from those quarters to communication.
Perhaps I can finish off with Mr Leinenâs remark about the anxiety level, which may be rising here and there nationally with regard to public opinion.
It is precisely that too that makes it so important for national governments to be able to choose the right way and have enough scope to give their own interpretation to the entire ratification process and possible referendums.
Rest assured that we in the presidency, and in the Council, are very aware of our responsibilities and will make every effort to ensure that this whole procedure will have a successful outcome.
Â Â  . Thank you Mr President. I should also like to thank Mr Leinen for enabling us to hold this debate on a very important issue.
We are, in fact, convinced that the European Constitution will help us to build a Europe that is democratic, more transparent, more efficient and placed at the service of Europeans.
It is true, however, that, to make this institutional construction succeed, we need the combined consent and participation of the public. The Commission therefore deems it essential that this Constitutional Treaty should be extensively presented and explained to the public.
Let me say at this point that I am answering on behalf of my colleague Mr Vitorino, who asked me to convey his apologies, but I should like to make it clear that, alongside Mr Vitorino, I have followed recent Council debates on the draft Constitution, on behalf of my colleague Mr Barnier.
I shall therefore respond briefly, Mr President, in accordance with your wishes, whilst trying to be as accurate as possible.
I should first like nonetheless to point out, Mr Nikolai â and I shall just greet MrÂ Leinen as he goes by â the important share of responsibility that falls to national governments that are signatories of the Treaty.
I feel that each government is best placed to develop the most suitable approach on a country-by-country basis, depending on the particular sensitivities, and the political and social context peculiar to the country concerned.
That being the case, we in the Commission naturally intend to offer our complete support to this effort, and it is against this backdrop that, from as early as July, MrÂ Prodi, the President of Parliament and the Chairman of the Committee of the Regions, along with Mr Vidal-Quadras and Mr Vitorino, have been appealing to all European, national, regional and local parliamentarians to contribute to this debate.
It is also in this context that we launched the campaign entitled âA thousand debates for Europeâ.
This is a target that we should like to reach and even exceed.
May I call on each of you to promote these debates and contribute to them?
I naturally call on the Members of the Commission to do likewise.
I should also like to announce what has been done within the scope of the PRINCE actions, the European citizensâ information programme.
Here, too, the Commission, in conjunction with Parliament, has endeavoured to make it easier to produce explanatory notes to present and explain the text adopted and the process that was followed in order to prepare it.
With the 2004 credits, we have begun updating brochures for the general public and multilingual guides to the Constitution.
More than ten million copies of these brochures and guides will be published.
I believe we will therefore have a volume of information never previously achieved.
We have made arrangements to have a video produced, which will be distributed from 29Â October, together with information panels intended for all our intermediaries and networks, as well as for the national and regional public services that will be using them.
Next, the Commission has endeavoured to arrange seminars for journalists: we hope to reach at least five hundred journalists, who will come to Brussels to familiarise themselves with the Constitution and talk with forums comprising MEPs attending the Convention and representatives of civil society.
Lastly, Parliament and the Commission, along with the Council, may decide to hold another version of the âSpringtime of Europeâ initiative, which had reached numerous young people; schools are asked to arrange information meetings on their premises.
Mr Leinen, there is therefore a wide range of tools being put in place.
I should therefore like to say that the Commission is not in favour of launching an overall, wide-ranging, pan-European campaign on the Constitution.
That would be potentially counterproductive, because such an initiative might be perceived as a supranational propaganda exercise.
Let us not forget, as I said earlier, that ratifying a Treaty is a constitutional process and that in each Member State, therefore, there is a need to sense what is appropriate and to determine the ways in which the Commission is to intervene by means of European public funds.
All of this requires a tailor-made approach, hence the need for dialogue between our three institutions: Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
Next, turning to Mr Nikolai, I should like to thank him and the Dutch Presidency for arranging the informal meeting of competent ministers, taking place on 5Â October, precisely to look into how this major information campaign can be organised.
Mr Leinen, I am certain, as you are, that factual and objective information will be able to dispel a lot of the misunderstandings. Consequently, following the meeting on 5Â October, we must be in a position to envisage what can be done in each of the Member States.
It is on that basis that the Commission will support the efforts undertaken to this end.
I also clearly noticed your concern, which I share, that this informal meeting should able to specify timetables and to see who is in the best position to address each national situation.
All of this will, of course, demonstrate clearly what might be the best use of budgetary investment earmarked for these actions.
This is my answer on the Commissionâs behalf.
We want to set up a programme and an information plan following up this meeting organised by the Dutch Presidency with the specific aim of adopting a practical, concerted approach and of setting up realistic action programmes that cater to our countriesâ specific needs.
Please allow me, Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Parliament for having, by organising this debate, already stressed the importance of this information which, once again, we want to be objective but which, above all, we want to be as complete as possible and as accessible as possible to the greatest number of people.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased to see you chairing this plenary sitting because it has a very important significance: that the President of the European Parliament stands by his word and that the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty is this Parliamentâs political priority.
I also believe, therefore, that this oral question from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs comes at a good time and â Jo Leinen said this very appropriately â it appeared that we had finished our work by approving the Constitutional Treaty.
It appeared that the issue of ratification was now something which fell to the national authorities, to the Parliaments, to the peoples.
I do not believe this, I believe that it falls to all of us and also to the institutions of the Union.
I was very pleased, Mr NicolaÃ¯, to hear you say that the Ministers are going to deal with this issue.
You have signed the Constitutional Treaty and, therefore, you, like us, have an interest in seeing it ratified as soon as possible.
Nevertheless, Commissioner Barrotâs speech worried me because, apart from the leaflets and the video, I heard that the Commission believes it would be harmful to carry out an information campaign at European level.
How can it be harmful?
What is the Commissionâs view of the Constitutional Treaty?
If it believes it represents progress, a step forward for the European citizens, it should say so, as Parliament will do.
We are currently producing a report which will be approved on 15Â December.
If that report is in favour of the Constitutional Treaty, this Parliament must not remain neutral, but must campaign in favour of it.
I therefore believe, Mr Barrot, that the Commission must consider what it is going to do on this issue.
I believe it is very important to send a clear political signal of where we are, because the European Constitution is very important for the future of Europe and, therefore, all of us â the institutions of the Union and the Member States â must stand together in order to win this battle as well.
Â Â  Mr President, 25 Member States are about to sign and then embark on their ratification procedures.
These procedures are national.
They are matters for national and internal debate.
Does that mean that there is no legitimate interest in members from other countries participating in those national debates?
With all due caution, it is legitimate to draw attention within each Member State to the fact that their national decision on ratification has implications for everyone else in Europe as well.
It is not insignificant that 25 elected governments of our Member States have all come to the conclusion that this new Constitution is the best way forward for the European Union.
It will not be insignificant either if our Parliament endorses that Constitution in December by an overwhelming majority.
It is right to draw this to the attention of people.
It is right to try and Europeanise the debate in that way.
Some have suggested having national referendums all on the same day.
That we know is virtually impossible, but some Member States may wish to coordinate their referendums within a certain time period.
That is up to them.
It would make the debate more European.
But the most important thing we can do is coordinate our information work.
I welcome the fact that the Council is meeting to discuss that.
It is necessary if only to avoid contradictions, with the Commission saying one thing, the Council saying another, the Parliament saying something else.
We must focus on getting the facts across because the facts speak for themselves.
This debate is myth against reality.
All we need to do is provide factual information and I am confident we will win the battle of ratification.
Â Â  Mr President, to some extent I feel that the wonderful camel of the Constitution has now approached the eye of the needle.
It can, of course, be squeezed through, but it can only be squeezed through if all Members of the European Council accept that they have a collective and individual responsibility to campaign for it to be brought into force.
For several national leaders, this means that they will be obliged, for the first time, to campaign on European questions.
Coordination of the plot, getting the story right, seems to me to be extremely important.
Secondly, the European Council must avoid a scramble to be at the end of the list â .
There should be a cluster approach to ratification with the keener, more assured integrationists going first, rather than forming a nervous queue.
Public opinion will query why our national leaders are frightened of their own shadow on Europe and fearful of putting the argument for the Constitution in a positive and trenchant way that embraces the European dimension.
This is a chance for our leadership to grow the European polity.
To the Commission I would say that public relations exercises are all fine.
One should ask why the Commission, at this sensitive moment, has seen fit to cut the budget in half, but what we really need is a political Commission, a campaigning Commission that will complement the role of the European Council to bring real leadership to the European citizen.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I am extremely surprised at your position on this issue.
During the debates of the coming months on the ratification of a European Constitution, who else should act as an advocate of this Constitution, and as a guardian of the broad consensus achieved in the European Convention and of the concept of European integration, if not the European institutions, and if not this House?
Yet the institutions present a curious sight, which reminds me of children who lose their ball while playing, and who watch spellbound as the ball bounces onto the road and under the wheels of cars to see if the ball will somehow appear again undamaged on the other side of the road.
We cannot allow this Constitution to become a pawn in what are purely national and nationalist debates, and we cannot leave it to the mercy of domestic political grudges and calculations.
I would have expected the Commission to ensure that this does not happen.
What action is the Commission taking?
There is no longer even a portfolio for the Constitution in the incoming Commission, or a Commissioner responsible for it.
There were two Commissioners responsible for the Constitution in the outgoing Commission, yet there is no longer even one at this decisive stage of the debate on it.
What action is the Commission taking?
It is quartering the budgetary appropriations for communication and for campaigns to inform the public about the European Constitution.
If you wish to relinquish your responsibility for the Constitution, and if you wish to be an engine of European integration and the Treaties, but not an advocate of the development of European integration, you should continue on your current course of action.
You have an extremely important historical decision to take; do you wish, together with this House and the Council, to prevent the Constitution becoming a pawn to nationalism, renationalisation in Europe and chauvinism?
Take a look at your own country, where members of the Convention have now come out in opposition to the Constitution.
Has it not become clear to you that a great deal of courage is required to defend together this common project for a common future?
Â Â  Mr President, I am very pleased that referendums on the Constitution are to be held in an increasing number of Member States, and I hope that the Government of my own country will open the way for such a referendum as quickly as possible.
Every effort must, however, be made in this connection in order to ensure that Europe, and, more specifically, the text of the Constitution, are actually debated.
MrÂ Leinen and MrÂ Voggenhuber are entirely correct to say that we must face the risk of the Constitution becoming a pawn in domestic political or intra-party intrigues.
There can be no doubt that one of the main problems in the various public discussions which have been initiated is a lack of detailed knowledge on the contents of the Constitution, and in some cases a fair amount of nonsense is being talked already.
More action therefore needs to be taken to provide targeted information, and this is a point that I would like to make to the Commission.
Maybe for once it should not just be the facts which are conveyed to the public, but also the difficulty of the debate, the pros and cons of individual arguments, tax policy, and so on. Many examples can be given of debates that have already taken place in this context.
My final observation, Mr President, I would like to address to Mr NicolaÃ¯.
I noted with interest that the Council is considering arranging ratification at a similar time in all Member States.
Perhaps a date should be set for May of next year?
Such a date would be of high symbolic value, as it will be the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration, and this would be a viable way of doing so.
Â Â  Mr President, both my party, the League of Polish Families, and my political group, the Independence and Democracy Group, always have been and always will be opposed to the creation of a constitution for the whole of Europe.
It is appropriate for an issue of such significance for the future of our nations to be the subject of a broad and fair public debate and referendums in all 25 Member States, without exception.
The funds made available in the EU budget for informing citizens about the constitution should be split fairly between supporters and opponents of the Treaty, however.
As to the proposal by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the Treaty should be ratified between 5 and 8Â May in all Member States, as some kind of reminder of the end of the Second World War, it should be regarded as a dismal historical joke.
Europeâs times of strength have been when it existed free from domination by any country, and when cooperation between free nations was not hampered by supranational bureaucracy and structures.
Our position is clear. We will always oppose the building of a federalist Europe with a constitution that takes precedence over the laws of sovereign nations.
Â Â  At a time like this, it is always very difficult to know what balance should be struck between looking for support for a Constitution and looking for fairer debate, but the two ideas are not mutually exclusive.
In fact, further and fuller debate should be welcomed by all sides, because it would allow us to get rid of some of the misconceptions with regard to what aspects of the Treaty we would be voting on in our countries, or debating in our national parliaments.
It is also only right that we as a European Parliament, as the directly-elected representatives of the European people, should be seen to give leadership in relation to the way the discussions and the debate should take place in the Member States.
Let us not forget that, first and foremost, our most important role as Members of the European Parliament is as public representatives of the people.
We are here not to hold on to one ideological viewpoint, but to give what we consider to be a fair, honest and truthful account of what is contained within the text of the Treaty.
Therefore, I can go along with what was proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to ensure that this kind of debate can take place; to ensure that some of the lies that were told in the past about what was in the Treaty are refuted; and to ensure that those rightful concerns that people have with regard to the future of Europe are given an opportunity to be aired within a public debate.
I would urge all Members to support this resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the allocation of large amounts of EU money to institutions whose job it is to inform the European public about the Constitutional Treaty.
Yet one cannot help thinking that this is not intended to be an objective discussion on the draft Constitution, but rather an extremely biased one, and what might even be called propaganda.
In view of the fact that to date the European public has known relatively little about the content of the Constitutional Treaty, an overly biased campaign promoting the Constitution would have a negative impact on EU citizens, who would feel that they had once again been presented with .
This would mean a further increase in the euroscepticism recently highlighted by the low turnouts in the European elections, and we will therefore need to find the courage to allow a controversial discussion on the Constitutional Treaty to take place.
We will also have to acknowledge the Treatyâs shortcomings and deficits, or else citizens will not truly accept this Constitution for Europe.
Domestic referendums on a national scale and the attendant debates are in no way connected with chauvinism or nationalism, but are merely part and parcel of democracy.
Â Â  Mr President, I am one of those who, within the Convention, were, along with you, the first to campaign for the future Constitution to be submitted for ratification by the people, and, if possible, on the same day.
I am delighted to note that the decision to hold referendums is catching on.
The problem with a referendum, however, is that while it is the most democratic process, it is also, by its nature, the most likely to be used for the wrong objective.
In all the countries concerned, there is a risk that the European referendum will turn into a national plebiscite.
Furthermore, given that the danger and the aim are identical everywhere, our governments have every interest in adopting a joint ratification strategy.
Such a strategy must, to my mind, comprise at least three elements.
Firstly, the question put to the public and the explanatory notes relating to it should be presented jointly.
Secondly, there should be a timetable.
In this respect, the best solution would be, as certain Members of this House have already stated, to hold referendums on the same date in all countries concerned.
Thirdly, and I feel that this point is of particular importance, the issue of the final borders of the European Union must be set out clearly.
This is a debate that neither Parliament, nor the Council, nor the Commission have thus far had the courage to hold.
It is, furthermore, impossible to put the creation of a political Europe before the public without specifying what we mean by the word âEuropeâ and without fixing the borders or at least the criteria for defining the borders.
In several countries, including mine, the notion of belonging to a political Union without borders â the future composition of which would be left entirely to the good will of the governments of tomorrow â would be rejected by the vast majority.
The Council must be aware of this when it comes to making its decision on Turkey.
Â Â  Mr President, I too am glad that you are here, though I am naturally not surprised, because we in this House are lucky enough to be headed by somebody who in the Convention, as a member of that Convention, worked courageously to achieve the very Constitution whose ratification by the people we are trying to achieve.
The process of creating a Constitution is only complete when those whose sovereignty is at stake, in this case the people â the European citizens â give their final word on the text â in this case, the Constitutional text â which is submitted to them for consideration.
Nevertheless, we are seeing a truly worrying phenomenon: only those who are against the European Constitution are expressing themselves clearly, those who have doubts, those who are trying to use this process for party-political or opportunist purposes.
The governments in the Convention, the parliamentarians, restricted ourselves to saying that this Constitution is good and that it should therefore be supported.
Well, now we must explain this Constitution, we must state what is positive about it and that, without it, we would be heading for the paralysis represented by the Treaty of Nice.
We must do that from a European point of view.
Mr President, we must Europeanise the debate on the Constitution, we must Europeanise the process of ratifying the Constitution which, as its name indicates, is a European Constitution.
And there are only two ways of doing this.
Firstly, by coordinating its ratification in the Member States.
There are 25 of us, but we are only one Union and the referendums must therefore be held within a few days of each other and why not close to the Day for Europe.
Secondly, the institutions cannot be neutral in this debate.
Parliament, the Council and the Commission, in common agreement, must carry out a strategy of information, debate and persuading the public, in order to defeat our main enemy, which will be low turn-out.
With majority participation, this Constitution will come into being.
Â Â  Mr President, given that a ânoâ vote in one country can cause the process of adopting the Constitutional Treaty to fail for the whole of the EU, we can no longer deem the ratification processes to be national.
We are well aware, for that matter, that ratifying the Treaties, and in particular by means of referendums, is contaminated by internal political issues.
France recently gave us a lamentable example of this.
We must, as far as possible, denationalise the debate and encourage Heads of State or Government to coordinate their actions towards successive ratifications. In order to create a positive spiral of adoption, it would be worthwhile preventing the most reluctant countries from holding their vote first.
Accordingly, the proposal to hold the vote in all EU countries during the same period, namely 5 to 8Â May 2005, should enable us to employ certain symbols in the cause of adoption: the symbol of unity of place â an entire European Union expressing its opinion at the same time, as opposed to 25Â countries voting one after another; the symbol of the unity of one text â one joint answer to one joint question; the symbol of the unity of time â the whole Union voting at the same time, from Thursday 5 to Sunday 8, whilst complying with national traditions of polls held either during the week or on a Sunday; and lastly, the symbol of 8Â MayÂ 2005, the 60th anniversary of the last conflict that set us against one another.
It is therefore on the platform of these sixty years of peace, thanks to the European Union, that we could build the Europe of tomorrow.
This is the thrust of this proposal.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will go along with MrÂ Borrellâs proposal that we Catalans in the House should not speak our own language.
Instead, I will use a language which is very close to Strasbourg and the Alsace region.
As a linguist, I would like to make known my strong opposition to the fact that Spain is calling for the EUâs linguistic regime to include Catalan and Valencian as if these were two entirely different languages.
Catalan is spoken from north to south, from Salses, in Roussillon, to Guardamar, south of Valencia, and from west to east, from Fraga, in the Autonomous Community of Aragon, to Alghero, in Sardinia.
To speak of Catalan and Valencian is to promote linguistic secessionism, which has long been one of the strategies of cultural destruction.
As the Romans said, â!â which, translated into an official EU language, means âdivide and rule!â.
If Europe is moving closer to an ever more effective unity, what point can there be in fragmenting both languages, which in actual fact are spoken across borders and other divisions?
A Europe which does not give a voice to all its peoples will be an incomplete Europe.
We have a great opportunity to build a true European federalism.
Â Â  Mr President, I love the word 'democracy' because it puts the word 'people' in front of the word 'rule' â government by the people, of the people, for the people.
I have heard the word 'democracy' repeated many times in Parliament and in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on which I sit.
However, the word is empty without the reality.
I see little evidence of democracy in the strategies being designed to guarantee a positive outcome to the Constitution.
In the committee we are told that it is our job to 'sell the Treaty', that we should restrict the debate in our home countries, that referendums should be scheduled to maximise the 'yes' vote.
We are told that we must get the Council to supply funds for the pro-Constitution campaigns.
In committee draft questions were proposed to ask the Council to specify a strategy to ensure a positive outcome to the ratification procedure.
I called for the question to be amended to ask the Council to ensure a fair and free ratification procedure.
I am sorry to say that 'fair and free' lost.
I turn to the Council, Commission and Parliament: if we believe in democracy â especially in this process that you, Mr President, called the most important since the founding of the Union â I entreat you to do whatever you can to ensure a fair and free process, to ensure that resources are used to truly inform people, especially by distributing copies of the Constitution to all the electorate, and by ensuring that all sides of the debate are thoroughly aired.
If we insist on democracy in this process â not just in word but in reality â then we will have a real outcome that every true democrat can accept.
Â Â  Mr President, on a point or order and so that it may appear in the Minutes, I would like to congratulate the interpreters on the translation into Spanish of Mr Joan i MarÃ­âs speech, which was perfect.
Â Â  Thank you very much.
I feel that the interpreters will be very grateful, as I am, because I will be able to recognise German spoken by a Spaniard more easily next time.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although it is not the subject of the debate, I take the opportunity to express my feeling of regret at the fact that it was not thought desirable to insert a reference to Europeâs Christian roots in the preamble to the Constitution.
Having said that, I can only agree with the requirement to give the people as much information about the draft Constitution as possible and to establish a coordinated timetable for ratification of the Constitution itself, in the hope that all European citizens can have the right and the opportunity to take part in this stage of the constitutional process through popular referendums in all the Member States.
We should not be afraid of participation and democracy, because it is the only way in which the new Europe of peoples, of rights and of the Constitution will really be a strong and empowered Europe.
Â Â  I too am a dissenting member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the Constitution.
I oppose the Constitution because I dare still to cling to a belief in maximising meaningful national sovereignty.
Could I, in that context, ask the Council and the Commission to agree that the first priority in any referendum should be that it should be seen to be both free and fair?
In this regard, is it not imperative to guarantee two things: first, to guarantee that the case against the Constitution is not suppressed in a welter of one-sided propaganda emanating from the European institutions and, secondly, that the democratic referendum process is not distorted by unbalanced funding from external sources?
Therefore, could the Council and the Commission agree that they would resolutely resist the temptation of bankrolling a pro-Constitution propaganda offensive across Europe?
These are national referendums and they should be allowed to be so.
Â Â  â Mr President, my speech is in Finnish and Swedish.
I would like to raise three issues.
Firstly, I take a very positive view of this Constitutional Treaty.
It is a notable improvement on the Treaty of Nice, the Treaty of Amsterdam and all the earlier treaties.
It makes the EU more democratic, more transparent and more effective.
Secondly, it is the responsibility of all the institutions to approve this Treaty. It is the Commissionâs responsibility, it is the Councilâs responsibility and it is the European Parliamentâs responsibility.
If the Treaty fails in one country, it fails in the entire Union, and that is not in our best interests.
The third and last part in the Swedish of the Moomins.
I think we must all work enormously hard to get this new treaty through.
In 2005, our task as Members of the European Parliament is precisely that described by Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, Mr Leinen, Mr Duff, Mr Voogenhuber and Mr Corbett, so we must try to push this treaty through.
It is in our interests.
Â Â  â Mr President, a start may be half the battle, but it is not the be all and end all.
A start was made on the Constitution by the Intergovernmental Conference, with the acceptance of the Constitutional Treaty, a conference which finished its work during the Greek Presidency in June 2003.
It is a success of which we are all particularly proud.
However, that is only half the story; this Constitution needs to be approved.
It would, I believe, be a tragic mistake and somewhat schizophrenic on our part, to coin a phrase, if we were to consider that our worries were over and that the entire matter and the entire problem had now been shifted to the national governments because, even if this Constitution is approved by everyone, if it is approved on the basis of internal political or micro-political dialogue in each country, its approval will be a pyrrhic victory for Europe.
Given, of course, that the lion's share, as far as information is concerned, lies with the Member States, the national parliaments and the citizens, I consider that there are three basic elements of coordination which are vital to us:
First, as European and institutional bodies, we must not interfere or engage in repellent action; we need to coordinate so that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing.
Secondly, at the very least we must help to inform citizens in clear, simple words about the differences which exist between the Treaty of Nice and this new Constitution.
Anyone who disagrees with this Constitution will need to explain to themselves and everyone else why and how the present treaty protects their reasons for disagreement better than our Constitution, because we shall continue to function; it will merely be with the Treaty of Nice.
Thirdly, and this is especially important, information will also need to continue after the referendums.
The Constitution is alive.
It does not end with its approval. On the contrary, it starts with its application.
It gives our citizens rights.
Rights of participation and cooperation to force us to legislate.
Rights which they need to know in order to take advantage of them.
We have this obligation if our Constitution is to be a constitution which promotes not only democracy, not only transparency, but also the power of the citizen in the Union we are building together.
Â Â  At least ten countries are to hold referendums on the Constitution.
That is wise, because a constitution regulates the power wielded by politicians.
Such power can only be given by the people, not taken away from them.
I hope that my country will be the eleventh country to believe in democracy and let the people decide in a referendum.
The EU institutions must support the people and democracy by being neutral in what they have to say and by matter-of-factly pointing out the changes in respect of previous treaties.
It is not the role of the institutions to engineer âyesâ votes in referendums but to provide people with a basis for taking a decision.
Otherwise, the EU is failing to live up to its own democratic ideals.
I am pleased that the Commission will not be funding campaigns but, if it does so, the âyesâ and ânoâ sides must be given equal resources.
Â Â  Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs I greatly regret that todayâs discussion has been dominated by military jargon.
There has been talk of the âfight for the Constitutionâ, and of the need to win the âbattle for the Constitutionâ.
It should be remembered that wherever there is a battle there are enemies.
Yet there are enough divisions in Europe and the European Union without now creating new ones by using military jargon reminiscent of the Cold War.
My question to Mr Barrot and Mr NicolaÃ¯ is this: do you really believe that the idea of holding constitutional referendums in Europe on one single day, an idea which to my mind is quite impracticable, is a feasible one?
This would after all amount to propaganda and imposing happiness on nations by force.
Mr President, if this must take place on a single day, I would like to propose 30Â February.
Â Â  Mr President, I would briefly like to say that we have all come to the European Union because we share the same constitutional values.
Whilst there is nothing essentially new in the Constitution, apart from greater legal and political integration of the Member States, it heralds a new political era, by making it clear that Europe is more than just an economic area or a market.
It is an area of values, a constitutional area, where the guiding principle is human dignity.
As a joint operation, Europe requires joint mobilisation.
The Constitution will not be made in the classical manner of the old constitutions; it will mobilise European institutions, States and the public.
The European institutions that gave birth to the dream cannot now give birth to fear.
They must mobilise themselves in this joint task of involving the public in objective and genuine debate on the reasons behind the Constitution, which is purely and simply an extension of the constitutional convergence between different States.
The institutions must now therefore communicate directly with the public and must get away from exclusive mediation by the States.
The institutions are taking the required steps towards transversal action in the process of concluding the constitutional foundation.
We must get away from the absurdity of partitioning European discourse and, more importantly, from the absurdity of instrumentalising European discourse.
We are entering a new political era.
The European institutions must be at the forefront of this.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr NicolaÃ¯, I should like to begin by registering my displeasure at the brief introduction to nationalist-style populist rhetoric and to parochial attitudes to national languages to which we have been treated.
Even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality, people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake.
Commissioner, I should like to draw your attention to the fact that, in our view, it would be crazy for the Commission, which had a decisive role to play in tabling the draft Constitution, to renege on its responsibility to take part in a joint strategy aimed at its approval.
A joint strategy between the Commission and the Council carries a good deal more weight and goes beyond a mere information campaign used to disseminate objective information.
Whilst that role is very important, a common strategy goes beyond that and carries more weight.
Given the nature of the European Project and, in particular, of the conditions for approving the draft Constitution, as has most aptly been said earlier, in any national process of approving a draft, in every country the interests of other States, the interests of all States and the interests of all European citizens are an important factor.
The intervention on the part of the Community institutions, the Commission, the Council and Parliament itself, is, moreover, the only one, in view of its unquestionably supranational nature, in particular that of the Commission and Parliament, to intervene firmly in this process without laying itself open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of the States concerned.
Supranational institutions do not lay themselves open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of States and therefore have a greater responsibility in fighting for the approval of the Constitution.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight to have Europeâs Christian roots written into the prologue of the European Constitution will have brought into conflict, throughout the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference, the most hardened proponents of secularism, headed by MrÂ Michel and Mr Chirac, on the one side, and certain countries such as Poland, Italy or Portugal, supported by no less prestigious a figure than Pope John-Paul II, on the other.
In the end, the atheist and Masonic lobbies won the day, thereby turning their backs on Europeâs past and its magnificent Christian civilisation.
This was no doubt in order to pave the way for Turkeyâs accession to the EU.
Think, ladies and gentlemen, of the terrible sentence addressed by Cardinal Pie, a great Bishop of Poitiers, to Emperor Napoleon III: âIf the time for Jesus Christ to reign has passed, then the time for governments to reign has also passedâ.
Three years later, there was Sedan.
A Europe without memory, which is unfaithful to its past and deprived of its Christian soul, is a Europe without a future, condemned to the worst depths of servitude.
Â Â  . Mr President, your predecessor was kind enough to point out that the Council is entitled to speak for longer.
I consider it not so much a right as a duty to be able to comment on a number of really important remarks.
I cannot guarantee that I will be finished in five minutes.
I would remind you, Mr President, that I still have some minutes left over.
I will of course abide by your rules.
In my view, a number of your Members have made very crucial remarks about whose responsibility it is, and to what extent, to bring these ratification processes to a successful conclusion.
Mr Corbett, Mr Vigo, Mr Stubb and many others have pointed out that there is, of course, a joint responsibility for the success of the process after 29 October when the ratification is signed.
Â Â  I asked the Council to remain within these time constraints, given that there is another debate to follow this one in the Councilâs presence and that the Bureau was notified of your time constraints, MrÂ NicolaÃ¯.
Nevertheless, we are certain that Parliament will benefit from any time that you spend beyond that limit and from the time you spend giving answers in Question Time, which follows.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will of course comply with your rules.
In my view, a number of your Members have made very crucial remarks about whose responsibility it is, and to what extent, to successfully complete these ratification processes.
MrÂ Corbett, Mr Vigo, Mr Stubb and many others have said, there is, of course, a joint responsibility for the success of the process after 29 October, when the ratification is signed, albeit because we all rely on each other.
We all rely on the success of all 25 ratification processes for this Treaty to enter into force.
Where we can â and I am specifically saying this on behalf of the Council, we will actually do this in the Council as well â where we can, we must support and strengthen each other in this, and also learn from each other.
It would be unfortunate, as Mr Voggenhuber pointed out in his critical remarks, if we were to blame each other and pass the buck to one another, because I consider it, in fact, important and valuable, as many in this House have said, that the three institutions carry a responsibility in this.
It is my conviction that, so far, the Commission has played a very constructive, positive role in communicating Europe and informing the public about the Treaty, and it would, in fact, be wrong to put the ball in their court, because I see the Member States and Members of this House as also having a very considerable responsibility in this area.
Many of you raised the point about the coordination in time of the different referendums.
Many fine words have been spoken about how good it would be to have these referendums take place at a symbolic moment within a limited timeframe.
I hope that you will agree with me that, although we might like the idea, we will not actually entertain it, because these are matters specifically related to constitutional legislation and should remain in the national sphere.
I assume that this House, in terms of subsidiarity and the question as to which government layer would need to deal with what area, would not like to meddle in this anyway.
What is very important, though, is that the different Member States examine when and how harmonisation could be possible, and that is exactly what we at the Council and the Councilâs Secretariat are doing.
We are publishing the national schedules, thus allowing governments and parliaments nationally to take these into consideration when drawing up their own schedules so as to see whether dates can be organised close together.
This has nothing to do with whether you believe in a European approach to this issue or not, as some of you suggested.
It has everything to do with constitutional law and it also concerns precisely the sensitivities which many of you have mentioned that referendums are at risk of becoming a national plaything.
Many Members have given voice to this concern.
That is precisely why the Council is convinced that it is good to give national parliaments and national governments some leeway in choosing a sensible date for such a referendum.
This could be connected to all kinds of things, including other elections, or other current issues, in the country in question.
I think that the ratification by 25 countries benefits from those countries having a good look at each other, but that those national responsibilities should remain intact at the same time.
Talking of referendums, further to Mrs Kaufmannâs and Mr Schlyterâs remarks, I would point out that at present, nine Member States have decided to hold a referendum, eleven Member States have decided against it and five countries are still undecided.
What is crucial is the way in which we, the different institutions, the different governments, enter into these ratification procedures, the way in which we enter into discussion with public opinion, and the way in which we will tackle the referendums in those countries where referendums will be held.
I think that to start with, MrÂ MÃ©ndez de Vigo emphatically stated that we should be in favour, and I also considered this as an appeal to the Member States and governments.
We as governments and Council will be signing that Treaty and are in favour of it.
We are not impartial towards that Treaty.
It is important to us for this Treaty to be adopted and ratified.
It is important because anyone who reads this Treaty will see that, however you look at it, Europe will, thanks to the new Treaty, become much more democratic.
Simply consider the enormous widening of responsibilities of this House; finally, it is a fully-fledged European Parliament.
Or consider the level of decisiveness, which will visibly improve with the new Treaty, again an example of decision-making by majority.
Consider transparency, clarity, which will improve with this Treaty.
Another point that is very important when I listen to all your remarks is that even the Eurosceptics are, in my opinion, pleased with this Treaty.
Why?
Because it stipulates, in detail and effectively, this very subsidiarity, those questions of who decides on what.
As a result, Europe becomes more democratic not only at European level, but also nationally, because national parliaments can stand up and can argue that something could be done more effectively at national level and is not a matter for Europe.
I do not think that there is a conflict â as a number of you mentioned â between devoting all our attention to those in favour, or working on the opponents, or, as the question has been raised, giving factual information as against preliminary information.
In my view, MrÂ Crowley, among others, is right to say that the two are not mutually exclusive by any means.
I am also looking in the direction of the Commission, because it had already hinted at this fact, with good reason.
Factual information is a way of despatching the myths, the lies as they were referred to here.
Using factual information, we can illustrate why this Treaty means progress for everyone in Europe.
Finally, I should like to comment on the meeting that is to be held in Amsterdam on 5 October, involving the European Affairs Ministers, to deal specifically with communicating Europe and also with ratification and with those referendums that are scheduled.
I am delighted with what Mr Barrot had to say about this.
It is also gratifying that Mr Vitorino will be attending that meeting, and I welcome his statement that what we discuss at it should impact on the Commissionâs further plans and in turn, needless to say, also on the decision-making in the European Council on 5 November.
I am also thrilled that the President of your House, MrÂ BorrellÂ Fontelles has already confirmed that he will be attending that meeting, because as I said earlier, without the three institutions, we are unable to bring this to a successful conclusion.
This meeting should be a meeting about communicating Europe, but one that also reveals how it is possible to communicate about Europe.
It will not be a platform for reading out written-down statements, the media will be present, and I hope that we can demonstrate that Europe benefits from debate.
What is helpful in that connection is the fact that your previous President, Mr Pat Cox, was prepared to act as moderator during this meeting.
The principle underlying this meeting, and undoubtedly the entire further procedure where this Treatyâs ratification is concerned, is that it benefits the public and that we take the public seriously.
Â Â  Mr President, I wanted to be brief, but should not want any brevity on my part to have given rise to any misunderstandings.
To Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo, the first and distinguished speaker, I would like to say that there is obviously no ambiguity.
Firstly, the Commission is fully committed to the draft Constitution, and I can testify that Mr Barnier, followed by MrÂ Vitorino, whom I assisted during the Councilâs closing moments, really did do everything possible to bring it about. It will mark a very important step towards making this Union of ours more democratic and towards a whole series of advances, in which codecision, or rather the extension of Parliamentary codecision, is a major element.
It follows that there is a manifest commitment to the draft Constitution on the part of the Commission, and that there is no question of it not having an interest in the consultation that will result or in the consultations that will be held in the Member States.
Quite simply, I tried to explain that the Commission had already undertaken to prepare documents that I believe have the dual merit of being very objective and of presenting the situation as it is now and as it will be once the draft Constitution has been ratified.
All too often, in fact, the debate on how the EU should develop rather confuses matters, and it is not always very easy to distinguish what exists today from what will exist tomorrow, so we wanted the tools we provided to be practical, clear and operational, even though there is certainly room for their further improvement.
I hope I have given an account of what the Commission has done about this.
I do not want there to be any doubt about the fact that funding is a problem.
We did not allocate EURÂ 1.5 million to the preliminary draft Budget for 2005 in order to reduce the projects, but because, at the time the preliminary draft Budget was being drawn up, we were still too uncertain of the eventual outcome.
In any case, we declared our intention of reviewing the situation with you in the course of the Budget procedure.
The situation is clearer now, and we are ready to act on the basis of the appropriations that your House and the Council, represented by MrÂ NicolaÃ¯, estimate will have to be set aside for this purpose.
The Commission is imposing no restrictions in this respect.
What does actually matter is that the necessary funds be used once the enterprise is underway.
So let there be no misunderstandings on that front.
Nor let there be any misunderstanding of what I have said.
We think that the Commission would be incapable, on its own, of devising an information campaign.
While again thanking Mr Leinen, I would also like to stress the fact that we are agreed, in particular, on item 6 of the motion for a resolution, which states that the Council, the Commission and Parliament must prepare an appropriate campaign and a communications strategy, and that this necessitates a joint effort by all the parties.
When stressing the need for a sufficiently confident and effective partnership with the Member States, I certainly do not mean that there should be, in certain Member States, campaigns that are not coordinated and are not harmonized with those of other Member States.
The simple fact, which Mr NicolaÃ¯ has just explained, is that we have to take into account certain national aspects in order to be certain that our information campaign will be as effective as it needs to be.
It is, then, the desire for effectiveness that motivates us, and the Commission must not be seen as any less interested in the joint effort towards winning the battle to keep the public properly informed.
It follows that one and all must take their share of responsibility; the Commission will entirely accept its own.
If Mr Vitorino were here, he would say so forcefully.
As Mr NicolaÃ¯ has just said, Mr Vitorino will be in Amsterdam, and we may hope that the meeting on 5Â October will be productive, not only in terms of guidance for our joint information project for all Europeâs citizens â with information that will, let me repeat, be objective â but also perhaps in terms of that coordination for certain consultations for which many of you have rightly expressed a wish.
It is indeed in our interests that what is becoming a body of European citizens should be able to be heard through consultations organised in the various Member States and through their coordination.
I will close, Mr President, by expressing the wish that this meeting in Amsterdam might be able to shed as much light as possible on what would make for an effective partnership between Parliament, the Council and the Commission in winning the battle on the information front; I would suggest that it would be objectivity and truthfulness, for I have confidence in Europe and am convinced that truthful information will be likely to win widespread public support.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Ladies and gentlemen, this debate is now closed.
Voting on the resolution relating to this debate will take place on 14Â October.
The next item is questions to the Council.
I now give the floor to Mr NicolaÃ¯ to answer the first question by Mrs Ludford on fair trials for European citizens and European residents.
Â Â  The debate on these questions put by Parliament to the Council demonstrates that rather than ensuring a frank, clear and illuminating debate, in which different political opinions and arguments are aired on the Constitutional Treaty, Parliament has reacted tentatively and fearfully towards the national referendums that have been announced.
This is the only way one can interpret the fact that it has questioned the Commission on the action it intends to pursue within the scope of a communication strategy aimed achieving ratification of this Treaty.
This was also true of the fact that the Council was asked about actions that it intends to pursue aimed at defining a joint Member State approach and, if possible, a coordinated timetable for ratifying the Constitution for Europe, and of preparing a communication strategy with the aim of achieving positive results in the ratification processes.
Parliament wants an âapproachâ, a âtimetableâ and a âstrategyâ to be adopted â using Community resources, including financial resources â to ensure âa positive resultâ, which means approving the âEuropean Constitutionâ.
This is unacceptable.
This idea is nothing new, since the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations in Europe (UNICE) has called for the same thing.
Â Â  The next item is Questions to the Council (B6-0007/04).
We shall examine a number of questions.
Â Â  . Mr President, as I have already said in reply to a number of questions from your House, the Council repeats that it is the responsibility of the individual Member State concerned to protect the rights and interests of citizens of the Member States overseas as provided for by the Treaty of Vienna on consular relations.
Member States whose citizens are held in Guantanamo Bay or elsewhere are taking the steps they consider necessary in order to ensure that their citizensâ rights under their bilateral relations with the United States are respected.
The Council is unable to provide details of these courses of action, questions concerning which should be addressed to the Member States in question.
Speaking in general terms, I will point out, in response to this question, that the EU has always expressed its concern about the situation in Guantanamo Bay and has, on several occasions in its dealings with the United States, stated that the treatment of prisoners should conform to the standards laid down by the Geneva Convention and of human rights.
As recently as July, there was an official discussion between the European Union and the United States, at which the United States highlighted the establishment of what it calls âcombatant status review tribunalsâ following recent rulings by the American Supreme Court.
Representatives of the European Union set out the concerns that still exist on the European side, including those relating to the creation of a new category of prisoners, termed âhostile militantsâ.
In conclusion, the Dutch Presidency will, in its dealings with the United States, continue to raise the concerns that remain about the status of the prisoners in Guantanamo Bay and the treatment they receive.
Â Â  I thank the presidency of the Council for that reply, but I am bound to say that I find it, yet again, disappointing.
The European Union is supposed to have a human rights policy under Articles 6 and 7 of the EU Treaty.
We have the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we are constructing an area of freedom, security and justice.
We insert human rights clauses in external agreements.
Indeed, I heard the President of the Council say this morning that in future we will have anti-terrorism clauses in those agreements.
Yet when dealing with our most powerful and important international partner, the European Union has not reached a common position or made â as I understand it â any formal to the United States.
Today a lawyer for some of the remaining British detainees has described the stance of the UK Government as craven.
How would the minister describe the European Union stance overall, when some of our citizens and residents are still under illegal detention, being abused and even tortured and denied either release or a fair trial?
Why is the European Union, as such, not making formal representations?
Â Â  . Mr President, I regret to say, on behalf of the Council, that I cannot dispel Mrs Ludfordâs sense of disappointment, but I do hope that I have clearly expressed our concern and that I have stated that we, where we are able to do so, are discharging our responsibilities and taking the action described in my first intervention.
Â Â  Mr President, the Council is not aware of the practice of caging, as described in this question, being carried out in any Member State.
Having said that, the Council would remind the House that it is fully committed to respect for human rights and to fighting every kind of discrimination on the basis of age or handicap.
