At the same time, I have called on the Commission to ensure that all the valuable knowledge and technical expertise which the Agency has accumulated during the seven years of its operation is transferred to the delegations.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Kacin, I should like to draw the Chamber's attention to the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
On at least two missions, one in Thessaloniki and the other in Kosovo, the committee has noted the effectiveness and innovation of the European Reconstruction Agency's external activities.
No such previous Community action has been anything like as effective or innovative.
Action on the ground, in conjunction with the local authorities, has been outstandingly good, and I feel it would be a serious mistake if we were to fail to make use of such action in other situations and to forego its benefits.
Commission resources and European funds must not merely be handed over to the United Nations or to NGOs or to any other institution without the proper resources to administer Community funds on the ground.
The EAR's experience in administering Community funds has been most valuable, and I should like to call on the Commission not to let that experience go to waste, because that would be disastrous for the whole of the EU.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Kacin, for his work.
Although we do not always agree about matters of substance, working with him and discussing things with him are always interesting experiences.
I might add that I fully agree with his amendments.
As Mr Casaca has already said, the Agency has done a very good job, and I think that the EU can be proud of itself for creating it.
It has indeed done an excellent job, and if that is said by someone like Mr Casaca of the Committee on Budgetary Control, a body from which we can of course expect particular criticism, it counts even more.
Nevertheless, I agree with Commissioner Rehn when he says that times and situations change; individual countries go their separate ways; the duration of the run-up to countries' accessions often varies.
I would also ask him, however, to ensure that the people who have had some very positive experiences in these countries also be given the opportunity to continue to do good work for the EU and for these countries.
I should like to take this opportunity to give my sincere thanks to Commissioner Rehn, too, for his commitment to this region; as it is very important to have someone with sensitivity towards the region, someone who knows that its needs have to be met appropriately, and that that includes a pan-European approach.
I should like to ask the Commissioner to do his utmost in the coming months, at a time when the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo will be precarious, and also to join together with Parliament - and the Council, too, I hope - to guarantee the stability of this region.
I am sure that he will do so.
A great deal of the work that the Agency, too, has done, will simply be undone if we do not set clear European objectives to ensure that the path towards EU membership is clear.
The countries must increasingly do their own work, however - albeit with our help and support - as we cannot take it off them.
It is very important, therefore, that the responsible Commissioner give a clear direction.
If he does so, we shall give him our full support in his further work.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, the accession of newcomers to the European Union is at its most successful when they already enjoy more or less the same level of democracy, human rights, environmental protection and welfare as do the other Member States.
The European Agency for Reconstruction can help remove some of the differences that are still delaying the accession of seven western Balkan states.
In recent years, there were differences of opinion about the emphasis this agency should place on education and infrastructure, of both of which there is a desperate lack in those countries, or on reforms.
Those reforms in the areas of governance, justice, police and market are mainly external requests.
Internal requests, on the other hand, are requests for financial support for small projects that can be tackled independently without too much red tape, supervision or control, combined with the restoration of railway lines, bridges, flood-control dams and drinking water basins that have suffered damage as a result of war or neglect.
To pass on the responsibilities of this agency to delegations and agencies of the Commission in 2009 is a radical step.
What I would like the Commission to tell us is whether it only wants to help simplify EU intervention or also wants to meet local needs more effectively
(EL) Mr President, I too agree with the previous speakers who said that the Balkan reconstruction agency did indeed play a very important role, not only initially in sending humanitarian aid, but primarily in the reconstruction and strengthening of democratic reforms and in consolidating democratic institutions in the countries of the Western Balkans.
This role was strengthened in particular - or I would say legalised - by the decisions taken by the European Council in Thessaloniki in June 2003 to support the European prospects of the Balkans, which support we need to constantly renew with deeds and decisions.
Of course, this role became more effective because Thessaloniki was chosen as the agency's headquarters, due to its geographical vicinity and its knowledge of this area.
As we have seen, the agency was created in a difficult period for the Balkans.
I fear that this is an equally difficult period today; we are at a dead end in the negotiations on Kosovo and therefore - and I appeal here to Commissioner Rehn - particular care is needed and we need to pass new competences to the local representations of the Commission in the capitals of the Western Balkans at once, so that there is no vacuum.
Of course, there is the two-year transitional period, but what we need to secure as of now is for experience and know-how to be passed on from the agency to the local representations of the Commission.
I would even say, Commissioner, that you need to be flexible, that you should not be dogmatic, even when it comes to the possibility of negative developments in the Balkans, so that provision is made right now to extend the term of office of the agency in Thessaloniki a little, even to beyond December 2008, depending on local developments.
To close, I would say that the reconstruction process in the Balkans is not a technocratic process.
It is, of course, a political process, which is why the European Commission should keep the European Parliament informed.
I agree with Mr Kacin that periodic reports should be submitted on the operation of local ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(PL) Mr President, the Commission proposes to discontinue the European Agency for Reconstruction, but also to extend it for two years until 31 December 2008, retaining its status and mandate.
According to this plan, the Agency and its activities will be gradually phased out and replaced by Commission representations and offices which will be managed by a new financial instrument.
Reform and ensuring proper financial management is of key importance to the European Union.
On the other hand, the phasing out of the European Agency for Reconstruction should not follow a rigid schedule, but should be based on political and economic criteria and factors with full use of its potential as regards specialist knowledge and practice.
The European Agency for Reconstruction is being closed at a time of key political events concerning the development of the Western Balkans.
In eliminating the Agency, the Commission must make provision for securing stability in the region, and for the UN Security Council decision on the status of Kosovo.
Securing the role of the European Union in this process should be a primary aim in this.
- (LT) While working at the European Parliament, I had the opportunity to visit countries of the former Yugoslavia as well as Albania and witness at first hand how valuable the European perspective is for those countries.
The European Agency for Reconstruction has played and continues to play an important role in stabilising the situation and supporting reforms in the region.
As we gradually phase out the activities of the Agency, the economic and political consequences of the elimination of the Agency and the use of the professional experience and knowledge of its staff must be considered.
The next few years will be crucial for the West Balkan states on their way to the EU, while some ways of solving the Kosovo problem can once again disrupt not only this region, but much more.
I welcome suggestions of how to strengthen Parliamentary control at this stage of the Agency's operation.
The Commission's report should explain whether the delegations and officers of the Commission taking over the task of closing the Agency will be able to properly compensate for this closure.
Member of the Commission. (SV) Mr President, honourable Members, I would thank Parliament for supporting the Commission's decision gradually to phase out the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) by allowing the Agency to discontinue its activities under the CARDS Programme.
As the IPA is phased in, we shall obtain the best possible conditions for successfully continuing to support affected countries in the Western Balkans.
Many Members have expressed concern about the EU losing expert knowledge.
We are keen to retain the expertise we have and are therefore, as far as possible, inviting those staff who now work for the EAR to do the same type of work in the Commission's delegations.
Where Montenegro and Kosovo are concerned, the Commission is in the process of planning a well-structured delegation in Podgorica, Montenegro and a possible upgrading of our liaison office in PriÅ¡tina.
Mr President, I would thank Parliament for its support for our stabilisation and integration policy in the Western Balkans.
It is incredibly important that we work together in pursuit of the same goals.
I am sure that, together, we can achieve very good results when it comes to stabilising the Western Balkans and integrating them into the European Union.
I should like to thank the Commissioner and all the speakers in that debate.
I should also like to thank the interpreters for their patience.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.
(The sitting was suspended at 8.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.05 p.m.)
One-minute speeches (Rule 144)
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
(PL) Mr President, for a number of months now, Polish farmers and exporters of farm produce have been unable to export their products to the Russian Federation.
In March this year Ukraine became the latest country to ban the import of meat and meat products from Poland.
The decision was taken without giving any legal grounds for it.
It is surprising that talks between the European Union and the Russian Federation have yielded no results.
Perhaps the European Commission does not attach the required importance to matters of trade between Poland and Russia, and gives priority to other interests of the European Union and other countries.
For this reason, I again ask the European Commission to do everything it can to have the export ban on Polish agricultural products in Ukraine and Russia lifted.
This is a problem that is within the competence of the European Commission, and also within the scope of its responsibility.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a few hours ago an Internet website linked to Al Qaeda declared a holy war through the Internet, inviting all the Muslim hackers of the world to bombard Christian websites, especially the Pope's.
This is, in my opinion, an extremely serious matter and an attack on the fundamental principle of religious freedom.
When the freedom to be able to address the world by means of communication is under attack, especially at the highest level, and aim is taken at a religion, indeed at an entire system of belief, one of the basic values of the European Union is under attack: the principle of religious freedom.
Europe cannot remain silent about this.
We are faced with an escalation of actions and initiatives whose purpose is to strike at the basic principles of our freedom.
We must defend ourselves from such arrogance and from such a totalitarian escalation of Islamic fundamentalist extremism.
(HU) I feel that as a Hungarian MEP, I ought to respond to the sudden international interest in my homeland.
It is my conviction that there is unnecessarily great concern in the European Parliament with internal political struggles, and my Hungarian colleagues in the opposition have brought an atmosphere of Cold War politics into the building.
We did not receive our mandate in order to bring the conflicts among our domestic parties onto a European political stage, as this serves only to increase the distance between the European institutions and the citizens of the European Union.
It cannot be in anyone's interest to present a biased image of Hungary and to destroy the positive image of the country that we have worked so hard to build up.
If we want the decreasing confidence in the EU and its institutions to be restored, we must transcend petty conflicts of interest and engage in European-style politics to meet the not insignificant challenges that face us.
The further enlargement of the Union, offences against human rights, the negative effects of globalisation and the efficient collection and expenditure of EU funds for the development of neglected regions are but a few of these.
We have a lot to do.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, less than twenty-four hours ago I was in Moscow and, for one moment, was on the point of putting on the MEP's sash while I was among the thousands of people paying their last respects to Anna Politkovskaya.
Then I thought that that would offend the gaze of that lady, even though she could not see me, to see our emblem on display.
The journalist Anna Politkovskaya told us what you did not wish to see or hear.
On page 6 of today's Le Monde we read about people arrested in Moscow because they said: 'Georgians, we are on your side!'.
Georgians, not Chechens.
The symbols worn by those who were arrested were, moreover, those of the Transnational Radical Party.
We, as radicals and liberals, have brought to this Parliament members of the Chechen Government in exile, who came to announce that they had chosen non-violence.
Nothing was done about it.
Mr President, allow me to make a suggestion: let us no longer call our buildings 'Schuman' or 'Adenauer'; let us call them 'Daladier' and 'Ollenhauer'.
Let us remove these names that we have no right to use ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(NL) Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the poisoning scandal involving the Probo Koala in Ivory Coast a few weeks ago, the repercussions of which are as yet incalculable.
The ship has, or will soon have, permission to leave Estonia.
There is still much uncertainty as to what will happen with the poison and the contaminated crew.
My observer, who travelled to Estonia on my behalf, totally agrees with Commissioner Dimas when he says that this is only the tip of the iceberg.
Poison of that kind should never have left the EU in the first place.
This is a breach of European and international law.
Having been denied the opportunity to speak with the crew of the Probo Koala on several occasions, despite prior permission, I can only conclude that various authorities are playing a very underhand game with human lives, a game that is not yet over by a long way.
The Probo Emoe is already appearing over the horizon.
(HU) As I mentioned at the meeting last week of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the greatest and most tangible achievement of the rule of law is precisely citizens' free exercise of political rights.
These, of course, are not to be confused with inadmissible violent acts.
For this reason, I wish to draw Parliament's attention to the investigations and the offences requiring investigation which took place in Budapest on the night of 19-20 September, the consequences of which are still being felt to this day, calling into question the effectiveness of the rule of law in Hungary.
According to complaints, the police used excessive force on the two days in question, and took disproportionately harsh measures not only against the demonstrators but against young people, including several foreign nationals, who were on the streets.
Among those they arrested, punished collectively and in some cases still continue to detain were some individuals who had absolutely nothing to do with the violent events.
It is important that the use of force to curtail fundamental human rights and in particular personal freedom - such as preliminary arrest and detention - should be used only in cases where they are absolutely convinced that this is truly necessary.
(HU) Mr President, the European spirit is under threat in Hungary; we are moving further away from Europe.
The socialist Minister of Local Government and Regional Development made a promise to his fellow coalition members last Saturday that he would make the appropriate legislative amendments to ensure that, in future, development funds from the European Union are distributed based on party political considerations.
If this becomes a reality, it would no longer be elected bodies that decide on the use of funds from the EU budget, but rather party political intentions would set the course, thus providing fertile ground for non-transparent, unverifiable spending.
This declaration not only endangers Hungary's credibility in the European Union, but also the development of a European spirit in Hungary, which demands that EU funds should serve cohesion and unity among the Hungarian people, based on the realisation of the fundamental principles of democracy.
The remarks by the socialist minister unambiguously point to the fact that the use of EU funds serves the aim of enriching the Hungarian socialist party elite.
Mr President, last Friday the Hungarian Government gained a solid majority in a vote of confidence in the Hungarian Parliament.
As a result, our national currency has become stronger, economic prospects are better and Hungary has returned to normal life.
There is no general crisis in Budapest.
Only our leading opposition party, Fidesz, is in crisis.
The elected members of the national parliament lead anti-democratic demonstrations on the streets instead of opposing the government inside the parliament.
As far as I know, elected parliamentarians should work in the parliament, not on the street, where extreme-right wrongdoers who were also demonstrating set fire to a building housing a television station.
It would be very wise if the PPE-DE Group could tell its Hungarian members that parliamentary democracy should mean respect for parliament, respect for parliamentary elections and strict borderlines between democratic politics and non-parliamentary extremism.
Mr President, a report recently issued by the United Nations Human Rights Office for Iraq states that the bodies at the Baghdad mortuary often bear signs of horrific torture, including acid burns, excision of eyes and teeth and wounds made by drills and nails.
Human rights organisations have repeatedly reported that acts of torture are taking place in the prisons run by the US and British forces and the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and Defence and in prisons controlled by various military factions.
The UN Human Rights Office's position is that the level of torture in Iraq today is worse than it was during Saddam Hussein's rule of terror.
The EU, and Parliament in particular, have an obligation to respond appropriately to this UN report.
I call upon you, as well as the President of the Commission and the Finnish Presidency, to make a clear statement on the issue as soon as possible.
(PL) Mr President, at last year's confidential session of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on a new partnership agreement with Russia, the PCA, Mr Brok, the chairman of the committee, acted in a scandalous way.
Mr Brok reacted brusquely to my question to Mr Mingarelli, whose job was to reassure the new Member States that the planned agreement with Russia would not affect their energy security, and that the agreement would not be concluded in the manner of the agreement on building the northern pipeline, in other words that it would not protect exclusively German interests.
In a raised voice he replied that it was the kind of question that might be raised at an election rally in his country and rejected it without giving the speaker a chance to reply.
Leaving aside the fact that the reaction itself was quite arrogant and supercilious, Mr Brok allowed the principles of parliamentary democracy, which is based on pluralism of views and freedom of expression by MEPs, to be violated.
His behaviour showed extreme bias in the running of the committee towards securing the sanctity of German-Russian relations.
I ask the President to respond to this and to explain the behaviour of Mr Brok in his discrimination against MEPs from the new Member States.
(FR) Mr President, one event chases away another.
Nonetheless we are now witnessing live the escalation of violations of the rules of international law perpetrated by Russia against Georgia: the granting of Russian citizenship to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the rejection of the peace plan proposed by Georgia to settle the conflicts with the separatist regions and the closure of the two border crossing points.
Tension has further increased following the arrest of Russian spies by Georgia, with reprisals from Moscow which has hunted down Georgians and is trying to economically strangle its neighbour by unilaterally introducing sanctions blocking trade between Russia and Georgia.
Finally, by giving the impression that Russia would recognise the separatist regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, if Kosovo gained its independence, Mr Putin makes the resolution of the conflict even more remote.
The list is long and the Georgians are utterly exasperated.
Faced with this situation on the brink of explosion, the European Union has a crucial role to play in bringing the sides, and especially Russia on the occasion of European Union/Russia negotiations, to the negotiating table to find a solution and put an end to this latent conflict in the Southern Caucasus.
The Neighbourhood Policy allows us this; military action would be a total failure of our policies.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 10 billion is the sum that the Italian Government has concealed and written off from its debts in presenting the national budget for 2007.
I thank you warmly for having given me the floor to make it known, through this Parliament, especially to the Commission, that the budget that has reached you from the Italian Government lacks a debit entry of EUR 10 billion.
To whom is this debit owed?
To the Italian pensioners who have worked in Switzerland and are awaiting this payment of EUR 10 billion, which the Italian Government has no intention of paying and - what is worse - which they have deleted from the budget.
No one knows that there is a debit item of EUR 10 billion in the Italian national budget.
I hope that, from today, it will be known to everyone.
(ET) Mr President, last Saturday, Russia was once again the scene of a political murder.
The first few years of the 21st century have clearly demonstrated that in Russia the right to express the truth is a taboo for which people must all too often pay the ultimate price - their lives.
Political foul play has become a part of everyday life in Russia, and unfortunately we too must come to terms with this.
Anna Politkovskaya's struggle for democracy, human rights and freedom of expression is the best thing that could have been done in the interests of tomorrow's Russia and a better Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely believe and hope that Parliament and the unofficial meeting of the Heads of State or Government at the informal dinner to be held in Lahti on 20 October will be able to exert sufficient pressure on President Putin to ensure that the truth of this terrible injustice is revealed as soon as possible, and that all those who participated in it are brought to justice.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to raise the issue of water shortages, which is becoming an important matter for many citizens of Europe.
Water is necessary for life and for economic activity.
Unfortunately, the constant increase in temperatures in the 25 Member States (by 0.2oC over 10 years) and a reduction in precipitation in many regions have made access to water increasingly difficult for many citizens, leading to losses in agriculture and problems in manufacturing.
The water situation is rapidly deteriorating, while investments in renewing water resources and water conservation are a long-term, costly process.
This makes it necessary to organise training and the exchange of experience, and to popularise best practice and methods for the rational use of water and water conservation.
Economic activities should also be redirected towards rationalising the water situation in all areas of the economy.
Water shortages could become a barrier to agricultural production, and in particular to the production of raw materials for biofuels, whose supply is not a problem.
The water situation must be constantly monitored, and Parliament needs to be kept regularly informed ...
(The President cut off the speaker.)
- (LT) While travelling to the Women's Basketball World Championships, the Lithuanian basketball players ended up stuck in French Guiana on their way to Brazil and were unable to depart for four days.
Brazil refused to admit anyone who was not vaccinated against yellow fever.
After subsequent vaccination and the verbal assurances of the Minister of Health of Brazil that everything would be all right, the Lithuanian team finally reached Belen in Brazil by chartered aeroplane.
However, they were rudely forced back onto the plane by immigration officers and sent back to Cayenne.
Only the Lithuanian basketball players received such treatment.
Other Europeans who were vaccinated at the same time were admitted to Belen.
Brazilian officers made it clear that German players would face no problems in this situation.
Why is Lithuania subject to double standards, as if it were not a European Union Member State?
It would appear necessary to allocate more funding for raising awareness about the new EU countries, not only within the EU, but also abroad.
- (LT) Can a mouse really scare an elephant?
It would appear so, and the current crisis in relations between Russia and Georgia is evidence of this.
The European Union has a choice of how to react to events in its neighbourhood: it can just make a statement or get actively involved in the peaceful settlement of this conflict.
I welcome the participation of Mr De Gucht, the Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in handing over the Russian officers to Russia and his statement made on behalf of the EU.
However, this is still not enough.
I believe that, if Russia is considering the possibility of military action in resolving the conflict with Georgia, the European Union must make every effort to immediately stop the deportation of Georgians from Russia and the compiling of lists of pupils from Moscow schools with Georgian family names, as this reminds us of the policy of Nazi Germany and the deportation of citizens of Jewish nationality.
During the deportations following the Soviet occupation, my parents were transported to Siberia in wagons for animals.
Now the means of transport have changed: Georgians are deported from Moscow in planes used for the transport of cargo.
Such acts and such a policy cannot be allowed to continue.
(PL) Mr President, in May this year we adopted at second reading the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods, which states that as of 1 January 2007 European law will make food producers responsible for placing accurate information regarding the properties of food products on packaging.
This means in practice that all the health benefits of products must be confirmed by independent laboratories.
Unfortunately these regulations will only superficially benefit consumers.
Also, the EU regulation may eliminate the products of small and medium-sized companies who will be unable to afford tests of the same standard as wealthy European firms.
In effect, consumers will have less and less choice and will be unable to make informed purchases, and they will still not know what they are actually buying.
The destructive mechanism of such competition could be restricted by licensing the right to issue recommendatory health symbols, and creating a uniform system of recognising healthy products.
It is also essential to give special support to small and medium-sized enterprises, whose products are often of higher quality than the products of large companies on our common market.
(PL) Mr President, the Republic of Lithuania gained independence just over a decade ago.
This fact was celebrated by all of democratic Europe.
Lithuania immediately started to introduce social and economic reforms, the aim of which was to eliminate the remains of Soviet occupation.
An important role in achieving independence was played by the large Polish minority (10% of the total population), which has for centuries inhabited the areas around the capital Vilnius.
However, although many years have gone by since the end of Soviet rule, the Lithuanian authorities have so far failed to return to the Poles the land that was confiscated from them by the occupying forces.
And despite numerous agreements, Lithuania has refused to allow Polish names to be written in their Polish spelling, insisting that they be written in Lithuanian.
These activities are a blatant breach of European regulations on national and ethnic minorities in EU Member States.
(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, if I may, to draw the Chamber's attention to a serious problem facing the Czech Republic as regards drawing on cohesion funds for modernising the waste-water sector.
In order for us to honour our obligations under the directive on waste-water treatment, we will have to invest over EUR 4 million by 2010, more than 10% of our annual national budget.
We agree, of course, that this cannot be done without EU subsidies.
I therefore fail to understand how it is possible that in the Commission there are projects aimed at bringing clean water to Czech towns that have been lying untouched for a year and a half.
These are projects put forward by our water companies based on an operational model that is in line with Community law, and yet Commission officials, acting on the basis of personal whim, refuse to authorise them and try instead to dictate to us, the elected representatives of these towns, what sort of contracts we should be signing and how we should be solving the problems of the water sector.
Let us not forget that the Czech Republic is in the heart of Europe and that the main European rivers rise there and flow into neighbouring countries.
This is therefore not only a Czech problem, but also a European one.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have emphasised the untimeliness of the statement by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, before the vote in Parliament on the Eurlings report on Turkey, since Mr Barroso influenced the vote with his negative observations, aimed at ruling out Turkey's prospects of membership.
Furthermore, given the subsequent comments by Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen, one must think that Mr Barroso was lacking in foresight concerning not only our Parliament but also the Commission itself.
I wish to express my full support for Mr Verheugen's statement, which confirmed the objective of full membership of the European Union for Turkey and emphasised that it is in our interests to have a Turkey that is linked to the West: that is, a democratic Turkey governed by the rule of law, which respects human rights and protects the rights of minorities.
This, in my opinion, is the objective that we must keep in view: a European Union that is capable of promoting democracy and the rule of law and - please allow me to say this, Mr President - a European Union that should have had the courage to send representatives of Parliament, the Commission and the Council to the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya, something that, in the event, it did not do.
. - (SV) Mr President, you recently contended that the historic dimension possessed by the EU seat in Strasbourg cannot be viewed in the same way by certain Nordic countries that did not participate in the Second World War.
The people of the Nordic region did not suffer enough during the Second World War to be able to understand the symbolic value of having the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Thus, Nordic criticism of the European Parliament's expensive commute to Strasbourg can be dismissed.


Your statement was, of course, entirely erroneous from an historical point of view - Finland, Norway and Denmark were, in fact, involved in the Second World War - but it is also remarkable in another respect, in that the President of the European Parliament is entirely serious in believing that we should not listen to views on the sites at which the European Parliament sits if such views are expressed by citizens and MEPs from countries that did not take part in the Second World War.
This is a grotesque idea, the only redeeming feature of which is that we thus need not listen to the President either, as Spain was also a non-combatant country in the Second World War.
This line of thought is unreasonable.
The peoples of Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden today have as much right to be heard in the current debate as those of other countries.
It is scandalous that the person entrusted to be the President of the European Parliament should have such poor judgment as to consider himself entitled to tell us whom we should listen to and whom we should try to silence.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Thank you very much, Mr Lundgren.
I wonder whether you have had time to read the letter that I wrote in response to the letter sent to me by several Members, and which you will have received.
Have you read it?
If you have, I do not understand your question.
You are still saying things that are entirely false.
In that letter I explained to everybody what I said.
What I said is nothing like what you claim I have said.
In that letter, I explain clearly that I merely pointed out that some countries may be influenced in their points of view by the fact that, during their history, they did not take part in the world war.
That is in no way intended to imply that some countries have no right to express an opinion.
It does not mean that their opinion should not be heard.
I simply say that they have different opinions and that one of the reasons for that may be that they have different histories.
Why do you say that the President of Parliament is denying anybody the right to express an opinion?
Do you imagine that I am stupid enough to deny any European citizen the right to express an opinion because of their country's history?
Of course everybody has the right to express their opinion. I simply say that opinions may vary for differing historical reasons.
Quite frankly, I do not understand why we are having such an absurd debate about a misinterpretation of my words that you, I regret to say, are persisting with.
(HU) It is unfortunate that the question of the conflict between Georgia and Russia, and a debate on these unusually disturbing tensions is not on the agenda.
This would be a very opportune time for such a discussion.
Things are happening in the Caucasus that may seem astonishing at first glance, but in reality are the natural consequences of a decade and a half of Russian-Georgian relations.
The retaliation and punishment following the discovery of a group of Russian spies reflect a warlike situation.
It is unacceptable that the Russians should expel Georgian citizens from the country on the basis of their ethnic identity.
We are faced with a violation of human and civil rights and freedoms.
It is obvious that the Russian Federation cannot accept that it has lost its influence over the Georgian Republic.
It finds this hard to bear, as it feels its identity as a great power threatened.
The Council, the Commission and Parliament have a great responsibility.
They need to intervene more decisively and negotiate with the Russians.
First of all, we need to establish what the territorial integrity of Georgia means, for at present this is understood in several different ways.
It is only through peaceful means that a solution can be found, and we must avoid the outbreak of another armed conflict in the region.
Mr President, I wish to raise the European perspective of the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair.
Until recently, Aer Lingus was the Irish national carrier and in state ownership.
It was in a healthy economic situation but needed to raise finance to renew its fleet.
The Irish Government said that the EU would not permit any state investment in the airline, which is news to me.
As I understand it, a state has flexibility in investing in airlines if in fact they are in a healthy economic position - as indeed Aer Lingus was.
This is another example of the 'blame Brussels' mentality, whereby a national government can explain its own actions by saying, 'the EU will not allow that', when that is not necessarily the case.
However, that is history, and we now have Aer Lingus being targeted in a takeover bid by its main rival, Ryanair.
In a way it is ironic that on the one hand we blame the EU for the current situation when in fact no blame attaches, while on the other hand we will undoubtedly make a case to the Commission's DG Competition to block the takeover, to save us from our own actions and to protect us from the consequences of those actions.
(PT) Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to salute Portuguese workers and their union confederation, the CGT-IN, who will be holding a general day of protest tomorrow, 12 October, against the right-wing policies pursued in Portugal.
Among other issues, the Portuguese workers are fighting against the government's social security proposals aimed at raising the retirement age and at reducing pensions; they are fighting to protect and increase domestic manufacturing, to create jobs with associated rights, to defend public services and public administration designed to serve the citizens; and they are fighting for the right to collective contracts, for higher wages and for the fair distribution of wealth.
I wish to say a final word, Mr President, on the European Court of Justice's recent ruling on the Cadman case regarding maternity/paternity leave and salary calculations.
In my view, it is utterly unacceptable that this could be seen as, and used for the purpose of, bringing into question the principle of 'equal pay for equal work', which is enshrined in Article 59 of the Constitution of the Republic of Portugal.
- (SK) Last June the European Commission developed a proposal envisaging a reduction in land areas taken up by vineyards in the European Union.
The losses and consequences resulting from this reduction would be offset through a package of direct agricultural payments totalling EUR 2.4 billion.
This proposal would affect nearly 12% of the total surface area of vineyards, in other words approximately 4 000 hectares tended by about one and a half million viticulturists.
This step could entirely undermine wine production in Slovakia, which has experienced substantial growth over the past few years, especially in terms of wine quality; in addition, this comes at a time when Slovak wines are becoming increasingly competitive in European Union markets.
The Commission's proposal also prohibits the use of added sugar in producing certain types of wine, although in my country this procedure is traditional, as the vines cultivated in Slovakia are characterised by higher acidity, which is typical for the region.
I am not questioning the need for reform in the European wine market, but I believe we should look to other solutions.
Mr President, next week a LIBE Committee delegation will visit Algeria.
However, one of the Algerian visa requirements is the absence of an Israeli visa passport stamp.
Mr Gaubert noticed this and was rightly appalled at this blatant anti-Semitism.
He demanded an explanation.
The matter was referred to you, Mr President, and you were asked to make representations to the Algerians.
I understand that you refused to do so, saying it was a matter for individual MEPs.
Mr Gaubert has quite rightly refused to go on the trip.
This raises two important issues.
First, why has the European Union sent almost one billion euro to Algeria since 1996, when that country is implementing a blatantly anti-Semitic policy?
The EU should stop these payments immediately.
The second issue is the apparent dereliction of duty by you, Mr President, when you could have made a stand against Algeria's anti-Semitism, backed by the weight of your office.
Please reconsider and rectify this situation.
The truth is that I do not know what you are referring to, Mr Batten, but you are welcome to clarify what you have said to me.
If you would be kind enough to give me the details, I will be able to ascertain whether or not I have acted correctly and, if necessary, I will put things right.
I am happy for you to explain your point further.
(PL) Mr President, today's debate about the soft fruit sector gives rise to the hope that the two years of attempts to change the organisation of the fruit and vegetable market are now beginning to take effect.
Is it not strange that the Member State that supplies 90% of the EU's frozen strawberries had to wait so long for a decision to introduce protective customs tariffs?
Many Polish farmers have incurred huge losses in the past few years while waiting for an end to Chinese dumping on the market.
Nobody will compensate them for these losses.
But the fruit and vegetable market is not confined just to strawberries.
The 18 main produce types introduced by the new Member States are an issue that has still not been regulated.
These include above all cooking apples.
Polish apple growers will soon be protesting against the low prices offered by the processing industry.
Parliament has spent two years attempting to regulate this sector of the fruit and vegetable market, so far to no avail.
Suffice it to say that apples are the main fruit in the European Union as regards harvesting (they account for 32% of all fruit harvested), while the EU is also a major importer of this fruit.
How much longer will we have to wait for this and other segments of the fruit and vegetable market to be regulated as promised in the European Parliament's resolution on simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables of 11 May 2005?
Will this vote be honoured by the European Commission?
A member of the secretariat will speak to Mr Batten so that he can explain the point he has made with regard to relations with Algeria and the President's compliance with his duties.
That concludes this item.
The protection and welfare of animals 2006-2010 (debate)
The next item is the report by Mrs Jeggle, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the protection and welfare of animals in the period 2006 to 2010.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 January 2006, the Commission presented its Communication on a Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010.
The report I drew up on this Communication as rapporteur for this House was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 12 September.
The objective of the Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals is to bring together Community activities previously spread across different Commission services, councils and policy areas and to structure them in accordance with uniform guidelines.
Animal protection is an emotional, extremely politically sensitive issue.
Such protection - appropriate to the specific needs and requirements of the respective animals - should be a matter of course in our civil society.
On this basis, it is important to me as rapporteur that we establish a uniform level of animal protection in the EU.
The Commission has emphasised time and again that the EU's animal-protection standards, which are already high and are set to be improved still further, are an example to the world.
A large majority in the committee supported my emphasis on the need for precise impact assessments in the case of all legislative measures on animal protection.
In addition, it is only consistent to demand these high animal-protection standards in negotiations with the WTO and in bilateral agreements.
Genuine animal protection cannot be restricted to farmed animals and animals used in experiments, but must cover all animals.
In addition, the progress that has been made must be taken into account.
Many of my fellow Members, and many people who have written to me, are particularly concerned about animals used in experiments.
The scientific research sector has significantly stepped up its efforts to protect animals in recent years, however.
A large number of alternatives to animal testing have been developed in order to translate the 3Rs principle into practice.
Even though there is still a long way to go on this, I do think that we are moving in the right direction.
The report supports endeavours to replace animal testing with alternative methods on the basis of further research.
For this reason, we are making consistent calls for resources to be made available under the Seventh Research Framework Programme, too.
Precise scientifically based animal-protection indicators are the most reliable basis for the further development of viable animal protection.
This baseline report for the 2006-2010 period is not intended to detail any specific individual measures.
We do not support any amendments calling for the non-binding application of voluntary animal-protection standards at national level.
The report makes an emphatic call for proper application and enforcement of the existing rules on animal protection, for example in the field of animal transport.
We welcome the proposed ban on imports of cat and dog fur and call for decisive action to restrict the trade in seal products.
The need for accession countries to adapt their legislation as a matter of urgency has been emphasised.
In addition, we strongly support a simple, compulsory 'EU label' for animal protection.
There are 14 amendments.
We support Amendments 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 14 but cannot support Amendments 1, 9, 10 or 13.
We have requested split voting on paragraphs 5, 7a, 29, 54 and 71.
To the Commissioner I would say that Commissioner Kyprianou is currently in Brazil, where I am sure he will praise European animal-protection standards.
I hope that he will also speak about the deficiencies in agricultural products imported into the EU from Brazil that have been detected once again by the EU Food and Veterinary Office.
European agriculture and European consumers suffer as a result of distortions of competition.
The European animal protection standards that are being called for must also have a positive impact on our competitiveness.
I am much obliged to the Commissioner, and I am obliged to all my fellow Members for their constructive cooperation.
Mr President, with regard to the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals, I am grateful for all the hard work done by the members of the committees concerned.
Let me acknowledge in particular the efforts of Mrs Jeggle on this important initiative.
Animal welfare is a subject of major concern for EU citizens, stakeholders and Members of Parliament.
They have all been very vocal in calling for higher standards of protection for animals, not just in the EU but worldwide.
The Commission is working hard and with some success to develop a greater international consensus on animal welfare.
For instance, we have been instrumental in the development of animal welfare standards by the World Organisation for Animal Health.
We should remember that the issue is not restricted to farm animals, but also extends to experimental, zoo, circus and wild animals.
The action plan seeks to promote a broad-based approach to animal welfare involving all stakeholders, so that everyone plays their part.
It is not just a matter for farmers or animal handlers: scientists, industry, citizens and governments all have a role to play.
Moreover, it is an area which can render sectors of the EU economy more competitive, and the proposed establishment of a European information platform would facilitate an open dialogue and a sharing of expertise and experience.
There are also strong links with other Community policies, for example the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment, the principle of better regulation and paying proper attention to the scientific, social and economic principles underpinning Community policies.
As highlighted in Parliament's report and in the Austrian Presidency's conclusions, more research is needed to address current knowledge gaps and strengthen the scientific basis for our policies.
In particular, the development and validation of objective science-based animal welfare indicators are key to the successful implementation of the action plan.
This work could be improved by the establishment of a Community centre for the protection and welfare of animals.
The Commission needs and intends to consult widely during the coming months, including with Member States and stakeholders, on the expectations for such a centre.
In implementing the action plan, the Commission is keen to ensure that policies are developed and implemented in a more coherent and consistent manner, respecting our clear obligations under the protocol to the EC Treaty.
Animal welfare is an issue of major importance for EU citizens and I very much welcome Parliament's positive attitude towards our initiative.
The Commission will pay close attention to the aspects highlighted in Parliament's report, and I am sure we will return to the action plan many times during the course of its implementation.
I look forward to Parliament's future support for the initiatives necessary to follow the strategy laid out in the plan.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every day, millions of animals suffer, be it in the meat industry's animal factories, in European slaughterhouses or in the course of transport or painful animal experiments.
We now have the opportunity to make practical improvements to the conditions experienced by these animals.
I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
It was my predecessor, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, who was responsible for the matter with which we are dealing.
In the opinion we have drafted, we demand, for example, that animals should have the right to natural behaviour, that the overproduction of meat should be prevented, that all hens should be entitled to range freely by 2016 at the latest, that sows should have the right to roam freely throughout their life cycle and that a maximum time limit of eight hours should be introduced for the transport of animals.
Therefore, it is, unfortunately, with disappointment that I am forced to note that Mrs Jeggle's report does not pay heed to any of these demands.
It is thus important for us to influence this report as much as possible.
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has requested a split vote on those points we think make the value of animals dependent on commercial considerations.
If Mrs Jeggle's report is adopted, animal protection will only become something worth aiming for if it is not in conflict with the WTO and commercial interests.
That is how matters actually stand, but we cannot have them remain like that.
Animals have value irrespective of changes in competitiveness.
What is important is that we in Europe take the initiative and become competitive through higher standards and better animal protection.
I would therefore call on you to vote down the wordings in recital G and in paragraphs 51, 52, 53 and 59.
I would also call on you to vote in favour of, for example, Amendments 11 and 12, now happily also supported by Mrs Jeggle.
If you vote in this way, we can finally obtain an action plan that makes life much better for the hundreds of millions of animals in the EU.
That is something that animals deserve.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for this sound, objective, professional report.
It is well known that Austria, my home country, has a national animal protection act that is among the most modern in Europe.
I am delighted that this report has borrowed heavily from the Austrian Federal Act on the Protection of Animals, which is really very practicable and is concerned with keeping animals in conditions appropriate to the respective species.
This whole matter has been very difficult, as the European public is rightly concerned about this issue.
After all, the welfare of all animals must be taken into account.
For this reason, I am very disappointed that the previous speaker still refers only to animals for breeding and production, not to all animals.
All animals are living beings, and all have a right to be kept in conditions appropriate to their species, be it in zoos or homes or as pets.
Being a farmer who ran a farm for more than 30 years and kept animals there, I of all people know how important it is that animals be kept in conditions appropriate to their species.
The way animals are kept and fed has a particularly strong influence on the quality of the product, of the foodstuff they go to produce.
Accordingly, on the basis of my knowledge and day-to-day experiences, I hold this report in very high regard.
I am also delighted that this report mentions animal protection with regard to the WTO, and particularly to imports from third countries.
After all, it has to be made quite clear that, unless we succeed in making the breeding and keeping of all animals - be they from the EU or imported from third countries - subject to the same rules, there will be no benefit to European farmers, European animals or even European consumers, as production methods will simply not be as desired.
All animals are living beings, as I have already said, and that is why I should like, in retrospect, to thank Mrs Jeggle most sincerely once more for her report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Jeggle for her excellent report.
We are going to vote tomorrow on this report, which is the result of long labours, and I am delighted at the common position that we have reached.
I wish, however, to remind you of three fundamental issues, which are, actually, in the report and that I would like to bring to the fore.
Firstly, I would like to stress the need to speed up the development, validation and approval of alternatives to testing on animals.
We must give ourselves the financial and logistical means to find other methods that make it possible to avoid these tests.
We must also limit and strictly regulate these tests in cases where an alternative is not yet possible.
Secondly, we must not forget that improving animal welfare results mainly in increased production costs for European producers.
I wish to stress, therefore, the need to validate their efforts through labelling and through information campaigns to explain the reason for a price difference.
European producers must not be penalised because they respect the demands of the European Union and improve our food and, for their part, consumers need to know that the price increases result from an improvement in that food.
Thanks to the creation of a European label and to the organisation of appropriate marketing and information campaigns, consumers will be able to identify those goods produced with particular regard for animal welfare.
Thirdly, animal welfare must not be a European value only.
The measures that we are adopting within the European Union must also be respected in all those countries from which we import meat.
This is vital on both economic and quality grounds.
The European Commission must do its utmost, with the help of international organisations such as the Council of Europe or the World Organisation for Animal Health, to make the WTO give more attention to animal welfare and to upward harmonisation of measures relating to it.
In the long term, clearly the aim must be to reach a level of protection for animals that is as high and as uniform as possible on the global scale.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Jeggle, ladies and gentlemen, the Jeggle report contains many aspects necessary and urgent in order to take forward animal protection throughout Europe.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe give priority to all tests aiming to promote informed purchasing decisions by consumers.
After all, in free-market consumer societies, the consumer is king.
He or she decides whether our chickens lie on straw bedding or are chained to iron bars before they disappear down our throats as Chicken McNuggets; whether our pigs are pumped full of medicines to enable them to survive the torments of their short lives; or whether stray cats and dogs are skinned to make stylish trimmings for winter coats.
Consumers have the power to determine whether to boost and support those farmers in Europe to whom animal protection, keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species and healthy foodstuffs are important, or whether to force our farmers to participate in global dumping, with rock-bottom standards and prices.
I am convinced that the majority of well-informed, enlightened consumers would never buy a product that had suffered agonising torment before ending up on the shelves.
Human beings have a tendency to bury their heads in the sand.
They prefer not to admit the reality of such sad things as animal suffering when they put a joint in the oven.
It is our political duty to ensure that consumers are informed about the real conditions of production.
We politicians must spread our knowledge.
The power of advice on packaging is demonstrated by the warnings on cigarette packs.
The Jeggle report calls for a labelling programme to resolve the difficulties consumers have in recognising products that have taken particular account of animal protection.
I would make an appeal for us to be courageous in this regard.
The consumer should also be able to tell what has been produced at the cost of appalling animal suffering.
In this case, the consumer would certainly not reach for the cheap goods, but opt for a somewhat dearer product that would show his credentials as a animal lover.
We Europeans are much too defensive in this respect.
Let us not be intimidated by cheap competition from third countries: we cannot possibly produce as cheaply as they do in any case.
Let us put our trust in the ever growing community of consumers who make conscious decisions when choosing what to buy and opt for products that guarantee animals are treated with respect.
Mr President, I should like to express my respect to Mrs Jeggle for her work.
It was not a straightforward job, and there are still some inconsistencies to be found, but, on the whole, the line it takes is the right one - Mrs Jeggle is not to blame for the inconsistencies.
I agree with her that our high animal-protection standards must be an example to the world.
This is particularly applicable since we have not made a particularly good impression as a cultural area in recent years.
I am thinking here of BSE, of dioxins, of the culls as a result of foot-and-mouth disease, of the millions of animals destroyed and burned on pyres - that was not a glorious chapter to show the world.
For this reason, it is important that we adopt a new line in this regard.
There is also a sales argument that needs to be taken into account when dealing directly with consumers.
If there is someone who objects to chickens being kept in cages, you can say anything you like, but what he wants is a free-range egg - he has no appetite for the alternative when he thinks about the chicken.
There must be market orientation according to considerations of animal protection, therefore; but we must also realise that animal protection entails costs.
When we are dealing with anonymous markets - which is usually the case with imports from third countries - we must have qualified external protection to ensure that our standards are not circumvented, because this will be expressed in the price.
I would say to Mrs Jeggle that the same applies within Europe, of course.
If we do not ensure the implementation of animal protection standards in production, distortions of competition will occur within Europe, too.
Consequently, we must consider including animal protection in cross-compliance, so that there are disincentives for businesses to violate animal protection standards in the form of not only certain penalties, but also financial losses - for example, deductions from premiums.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, first of all, let me say that I warmly welcome the animal welfare action plan.
What I very much regret, though, is that this sort of thing should be needed in the first place.
The way in which people treat animals often reveals their true nature, an image that is still not always that agreeable.
It is still too often the case that animals are treated as commodities, with economic gain being more important than their well-being.
I think that this report can at least put an end to a number of diabolical practices to which animals are subjected.
The report includes something for which I have campaigned for a very long time, namely a ban on the practice of castrating piglets without any anaesthetic, which is not satisfactory for piglets or farmers.
The fact that more active support is being demanded for research to replace animal tests by alternative test methods is a great improvement for many animals.
Needless to say, I have many other ideas about animal protection that are more far-reaching, for example many more free-range cattle, the prevention of bull fighting, stopping the stuffing of geese with food to enlarge their livers, the banning of battery cages and far shorter transport times for animals, and I could go on for a while.
It is unfortunate that a number of sound amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety have been voted out by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
I should like to point out that animal welfare is certainly not just about agricultural animals; pets and wild animals should also fall within the scope of the action plan.
I would call on everyone to let their compassionate hearts speak tomorrow in respect of our fellow creatures and give their full backing to more far-reaching amendments in favour of animals.
We should demonstrate that we in this House do not behave like animals ourselves, but vote with their interests in mind.
Mr President, the protection and welfare of animals is a challenge to human culture and civilisation in the 21st century.
I am very pleased that my amendment expressing this idea was adopted for the draft resolution.
Mahatma Gandhi once said that civilisation in a society can be gauged by the way it treats its animals.
In 21st century Europe there is no place for cruelty to animals.
It degrades our humanity, and there is no place for that.
It is just a small step from cruelty to animals to cruelty to humans.
The protection of animals should not be expressed in monetary terms, because our civilisation cannot be expressed in monetary terms.
Animals should be protected from cruelty regardless of cost, but under one condition: that we apply the conditions of the European Union to all those who export their animal products to the European market.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the question of maintaining adequate standards of protection for animals in the EU Member States, and the resulting production of suitable food for consumers, is of great importance.
For this reason everything must be done to ensure that only food of a high standard enters the common market.
Strict measures must be taken to limit the import of products if there is any suspicion that European livestock farming standards have not been applied to them.
Simply increasing taxes on unfair exporters will not bring any results.
I would like to point out that to date it has not been possible for the Community to enforce respect for human rights, let alone animal rights.
A large amount of food is exported into the European market from such countries.
I would also like to say that small and family farms have traditionally treated their animals humanely, and it is large factory farms that diverge from these standards.
Distortions have also arisen in relation to the issue of guidelines on the slaughter of animals.
It is a serious mistake to prohibit the slaughter of animals for own consumption on family farms.
This is a tradition which goes back centuries, and the farmers make sure that the animals are slaughtered in appropriate conditions.
(DE) Mr President, as we know, a fair amount has happened since animal protection as a concept was born as a result of increasingly mechanised animal breeding in the 19th century.
The Action Plan now under discussion is certainly a further important step in the right direction.
As we know, the EU expressed its concern about dog, bull and cock fighting back in 2003 - and I am pleased to note that this is also reflected in the present document.
Strangely, however, fox-hunting has been overlooked.
Action is also needed, in my view, in the field of wild birds, as the EU still permits hunting of species whose populations have been declining for centuries.
In my view, it is also particularly important to change our system of farming subsidies at long last so that, instead of benefiting mainly large landowners, they reward the practice of keeping animals in conditions appropriate to their species, one in which the countless smallholders set an example.
Finally, the abolition of export subsidies for animal transport would not only show more compassion for animals, but also protect the environment and help the people who suffer as a result of transit traffic.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I must congratulate the Commission on this proposal, and in particular I must congratulate Mrs Jeggle on this wonderful report and the great work that she has done.
I simply wished to draw attention to paragraph 71.
This paragraph calls for an end to dog, bull and cock fighting.
When it talks about fighting by bulls, it is clearly talking about bullfights.
To treat bullfights in the same way as dogfights and cockfights makes no sense whatsoever.
Firstly, because bulls do not fight each other; it is not an animal fighting another animal; it is a very noble fight by a man against a bull, and sometimes it is the man who dies, or is often wounded.
Furthermore, it is a tradition and a culture in our country.
Maybe some people do not understand this, but the bull and bullfighting are very important for us, the Spanish.
I would ask that people have as much respect for the traditions of my country as I have for those of other countries.
Thank you very much.
The bull contributes to the maintenance of pastures, it contributes to the protection of the environment and it contributes to rural development.
Furthermore, of the bovine animals, it is the bull that has the best life; since we are talking about animal welfare, it should be pointed out that bulls are very well fed, they live in the open air, they run around in the way that animals like to do, and in the end they die fighting using their own defences.
The bullfight is much nobler than hunting, where at the end of the day the animal dies without being able to defend itself.
I would like to thank Mrs Jeggle and the whole of my political group, which has understood this and is going to ask that that word be removed from that paragraph.
(ES) Mr President, animal welfare, which has been included in the CAP since the last reform, is already an achievement for European agriculture, though, according to the results of the special Eurobarometer carried out in 2005 on this issue, Europeans are unaware of the efforts being made by our producers and do not therefore appreciate them, despite the fact that we have the most protective legislation.
The European Commission has already accepted that consumers need to be better informed on this issue if we want the efforts made by our farmers to be appreciated.
This high level of protection has a high economic price, however, which may reduce the competitiveness of our agri-food industry.
We need systematic impact studies that analyse the social and economic consequences of any new legislation and reliable scientific analyses that reflect the diversity of situations within the European Union and provide objective indicators of animal welfare and coherence with the Union's other policies and, in particular, with the Lisbon Strategy and with competitiveness and employment.
There are therefore five fundamental aspects: improving communication with society, rigorous socio-economic analysis, solid scientific foundations, greater coherence with other common policies and the promotion of European standards in international fora.
With regard to paragraph 71, I would like to say that my group is of course going to vote against that paragraph, amongst other things, and in particular because it contains a series of technical errors and involves a debate that is completely out of place here, a debate that is tarnishing the most important aspects of this report and, above all - I must say - the excellent work of the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, who has been efficient and conscientious and has adopted a very balanced approach.
Mr President, I welcome the action plan and wish to thank Mrs Jeggle for her work.
The awareness that many animals in the European Union are treated badly and that more has to be done is of great importance, not only out of charity but also because, as a developing market-based approach, the humane treatment of animals is an opportunity for European producers, if properly developed.
Animal protection through law is regarded positively by a growing number of Europeans, and the labelling of food products from humanely-treated animals could eventually bring economic profits to producers and become a part of the European social model.
On the other hand, global competition tends to push producers for profit at the lowest possible animal protection level.
That is why the action plan is also a strong political message to the world.
By defining our intentions for establishing minimum mandatory standards against the worst abuses, we underpin the need for discussion at a global level, at the level of the WTO.
By setting priorities for better treatment of farm animals, by avoiding unnecessary suffering caused by tests that could be replaced and by banning the import of cruelty products, improving the treatment of animals during transport etc., we are pushing for global solutions.
We would like to do more, as the amendments show, but the plan is, nevertheless, a solid beginning of a comprehensive EU policy in this area.
(ES) Mr President, cruelty is not culture; causing suffering cannot be seen as entertainment.
Mass industrial suffering is not a legitimate business.
The demand for justice in our relations with animals calls into question our prevailing human morality and extends its scope.
If we are to be successful in terms of animal welfare, we must reassess our traditional approach to moral responsibility and grant protection and rights also to individual non-human animals, which have sensory, emotional and intellectual capacities.
If we are to recognise and extend the rights of animals we must stop causing them unnecessary suffering and refrain from cruelty.
That is the purpose of this report.
We Greens will support the proposal, with a series of amendments, and we will demand that the Council cease ignoring the majority of Europeans, who are in favour of stricter animal protection measures. It cannot continue to ignore them.
We believe that we must act in an ethical and altruistic manner, but that we must also respond to people's needs and interests.
We are in favour of improving animal welfare because only in that way can we improve human health, the environment and social justice.
Mr President, so vast is the range of the initiatives proposed in this document that it should keep the EU bureaucrats happily beavering away for the next 20 years.
However, let us examine one of the high points of the EU's record on animal welfare.
In 2001, during the infamous foot-and-mouth outbreak, seven million animals were destroyed in Britain under the EU's direction; most of them were healthy.
I well remember the huge funeral pyres of burning animals.
The EU stubbornly refused to allow vaccination, which would have been in the best interests of the welfare of both the animals and British agriculture.
It preferred instead the legally questionable and morally unjustifiable scorched-earth approach.
Therefore, I do not believe that the EU is in any position to claim the moral high ground on animal welfare and to lecture the Member States about it, never mind the rest of the world, as this lofty document claims it will.
We have everything in this report, including the setting-up of an animal protection information forum.
Doubtless, this will be another highly expensive quango.
Who is going to pay for it?
The taxpayers.
Who is going to have to do all the paperwork?
The farmers, who can barely cope with the current red tape.
This document is obsessed with standardisation and uniformity.
It appears to take no account of the widely differing farming cultures and climates to be found in countries as diverse as Portugal and Sweden.
It takes no account of the already high standards of animal welfare in Britain.
It is predicated around the central thesis that the EU can do it better, but that is not so.
(NL) Mr President, before I give my reaction, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur for her excellent report and the good balance she has struck between what is and is not possible and what we want for animal welfare in Europe; I should also like to respond to Mr Titford's remark to the effect that European bureaucracy is responsible for the slaughter of 7 million animals in Great Britain during the foot-and-mouth crisis.
I should like to put him right on that score: When Great Britain joined the European Union, Europe was forced to change its legislation.
We were no longer allowed to vaccinate as a preventive measure.
We were no longer allowed to vaccinate for foot-and-mouth disease.
We owe this to the British Government at the time, so please do not try to tell me that Europe is to blame for the slaughter of 7 million cows in Great Britain, for it has everything to do with the British position at the time.
I just wanted to get that off my chest.
I am also saying this, because Mrs Jeggle's report states quite clearly that vaccination should be a valid instrument for improved animal welfare in the European Union.
In view of the outbreaks of infectious animal diseases, it is good we are making some headway and are in any event using scientific techniques in order to fight them.
That is the best form of animal welfare in Europe.
A second point I wanted to raise concerns animal transport.
We in this House have asked for a reduction in the duration of transport that involves animals intended for slaughter.
Unfortunately, the Council has not taken this on board, but the position of Parliament is clear.
In that sense, I should like to urge Mr Titford, if he really wishes to protect animal welfare in his own country too, to vote in favour of the Jeggle report.
That is essential, for then you will really do the citizens of Great Britain and those of Europe a good turn.
The third reason why I welcome this report is that it draws particular attention to the import of products from outside of the European Union.
After all, we may have fine rules and regulations, but if we cannot carry out any monitoring on Europe's external borders, then they will remain immaterial; it is essential that this House should use the Jeggle report to put this back on the agenda.
(PL) Mr President, if animals could speak I am sure they would thank the rapporteur Mrs Jeggle for standing up for them.
In her, they have an ardent spokesperson and guardian.
The report deserves considerable recognition.
It addresses all the most important issues including protection of both animals on farms and those living in the wild.
The rapporteur has also addressed transportation, production economics, international aspects, product labelling, the use of animals for research, humanitarian slaughter and so on. I believe that, with all our help, the aims stated in the report, of which there are many, are achievable.
We should, however, pay particular attention to making society more sensitive to the issue, to continued involvement of international organisations, and spreading awareness which will allow us to achieve the same results as with seal hunting.
There is nothing that needs to be added to the report.
I offer the rapporteur my warmest congratulations, and so do all the animals.
(SV) Mr President, a civilised society can never compete on the basis of lowest prices, with animals reared under conditions resembling torture.
Only by means of stringent demands in terms of animal protection will animal husbandry in the EU survive.
The future lies in local production and short distances for animal transport, as well as in consumer protection, with animals reared in natural conditions.
We have an agricultural policy that causes suffering to broilers, forces animals to be transported over long distances, causes pigs to be castrated and provides more medicines to animals than to people.
It is not pigs, but an agricultural policy like this that should be castrated.
A maximum time limit of eight hours for the transport of animals is a reasonable demand.
Minimum standards of animal protection - as per Amendment 11 - are necessary.
We have become as many as four times richer over the last 40 years.
If we cannot afford to sacrifice a percentage of this wealth in order to protect defenceless animals, we cannot call ourselves civilised.
To my Spanish friends I would say the following: a noble fight would be an unarmed matador against an unarmed bull that is untreated, does not have its back broken, is not drugged and is not tortured.
That is what would constitute a noble fight.
The way such fights look at present, however, they are about cruelty to animals, something that must not be subsidised.
Thank you, Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, and thank you, Mrs Jeggle, for a very good report, because it is essential that we look after animals in Europe.
Actually, we have a very good record here because we have high production standards, but we need to be very much consumer-driven.
I agree with one of the previous speakers who said that the consumer must have the choice and must be able to see the labels and be absolutely sure of that production.
If you go into a supermarket and look at a free-range chicken or an organic chicken or an intensively-farmed broiler chicken, you can actually see no difference between them.
You have to be absolutely confident that the label is right. Not only does it have to be right for the production that we have here in Europe, but it also has to be right for the production that comes in from outside Europe as well.
So consumers have to be very confident of the labelling.
We also have to see a reduction in animals used for testing, and that is where we have to be very careful with European legislation as well, because, if we are not careful, REACH may actually increase the number of animals tested unnecessarily.
Can I refer to Mr Titford and put him right on one or two things? First of all, he sees European bureaucrats under every bed, I think, but, as far as foot-and-mouth is concerned, it was the UK Government that was absolutely determined to slaughter.
It was the UK Government that was so worried that a general election was being delayed that they had what was called the 'contiguous cull', which slaughtered millions of animals unnecessarily.
In the Netherlands, they actually carried out vaccinations to try and stop the mass funeral pyres.
So, Mr Titford, it was not the European Union that had a problem with foot-and-mouth disease: it was the UK Government.
(EL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report.
Mrs Jeggle is a sensitive, capable and excellent Member of the European Parliament.
The great Indian leader, Ghandi, said that when man treats animals well he demonstrates his humanity and his higher feelings.
As such, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, without any doubts.
However, I would like to highlight a delicate and important point which has to do with livestock farming, which has to do with man.
I do not refer to domestic animals, to cockfights or to dogfights, on which I agree with the rapporteur; I refer to reared animals.
If the measures in the report, which - I repeat - I endorse and support, are applied, then our livestock farmers will have higher production costs, meaning that either we shall have to support them financially or we shall have to find ways of controlling the living conditions of animals reared in third countries whose meat is imported into the European Union.
Otherwise, we shall achieve nothing.
European livestock farming will shrink due to unfair competition and we shall demonstrate that we are hypocrites rather than animal lovers and that we have no sense of proper solidarity with livestock farmers.
Apart from that, I should like to highlight another issue.
I should like stricter controls on wild animal hunting.
Many of our mountains and forests no longer have any wild animals because there is uncontrolled, predatory murder of the animals and this does not only have to do with the animals.
It disrupts the entire ecosystem in the mountains and forests of Europe and the rest of the world.
(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jeggle, for her work.
This initiative responds to a social concern, one that I believe it is crucial for us to confront, not just in the European Union, but throughout the world.
Animal welfare is important, and it is important that we have a single European standard and that it be respected by all of the countries of the European Union.
We have been worldwide pioneers in relation to these standards, and they must be respected, because there are few States in the world that can say that they conform to standards like those we apply in the European Union.
We have recently talked, for example, about the rearing of chicken for meat and the transport of animals; and in this report by Mrs Jeggle we are not just talking about production farms, but also, for example, about exhibiting animals, about zoos, about circuses and about research and development - areas in which animals are also used.
We must also talk about domestic animals that we keep as pets in our homes and that also require our attention.
We must not, of course, be tolerant with people who abandon them, allow them to die of hunger or abuse them.
We must apply serious and scientific criteria that ensure that the animals that we keep as pets in our daily lives in the European Union are happy.
To this end, I would like to point out that we have held hearings in this Parliament in which we have heard international experts, such as Dr GonsÃ¡lvez, from Spain, who have told us that we must prevent epizootic diseases and invest in their prevention, that we must invest in complying with standards governing densities of animals in farms and that we must educate children to respect animals.
We must also, of course, prevent cases such as paragraph 71, introduced as a result of the ignorance and lack of knowledge of certain members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who have mixed up two entirely different issues by failing to respect the art, the traditions and the culture of other people who do not think in the same way as them and who are exemplary in terms of freedom and respect for diversity.
We will therefore vote against that paragraph 71, though we fully respect the views of those who do not think in the same way as us.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everything that humans do to animals comes back to them: Pythagoras realised this as much as two-and-a-half-thousand years ago.
Looking at the interaction between animal protection, animal health, sustainability, and environmental and food safety, I can see that this is still true today.
Thankfully, animal protection now plays a major part in our society.
The public's desire for ethically and socially sound products is increasing, and recently we have been increasingly dealing with sensitive issues such as animal protection relating to breeding, transport and slaughter.
I welcome the Action Plan for the Protection and Welfare of Animals, and I congratulate Mrs Jeggle on her report, in which she specifies unequivocally what is needed.
We need measures to keep the public better informed about modern animal-protection methods and applied animal protection.
We must improve marketing, and also labelling and communication strategies, to inform consumers and thus assist them in their purchasing decisions.
A simple, precise 'EU label' for animal protection could help us harmonise the currently diverging systems of animal-protection labelling and lay down minimum standards for animal protection applicable throughout the EU - and, I hope, beyond our borders, too, in the near future.
We must not forget to involve animal breeders and keepers and also public opinion in this animal-protection policy, however.
Why is it that Community animal-protection policy has been restricted to farmed animals up to now?
Are cats and dogs not worth protecting just because we do not eat them?
This appears to be a legitimate question, as does the one as to whether pets are always kept in conditions appropriate to their species.
We hear of all sorts of things taking place, for example birds being kept in cages, and snakes and other reptiles in urban flats.
That is why this view has a rightful place in the report.
We have been advocating a reduction in the use of animals in research, science and product approval.
Animal testing should be carried out only in the absence of any alternatives.
Mr President, thank you for what has been, overall, a very interesting and supportive debate.
I shall inform my colleague, Mr Kyprianou, of your comments.
I should like to touch upon just a couple of your comments.
Mr Holm emphasised trade issues and suggested that competition is incompatible with animal welfare; I disagree.
It will be very difficult for EU producers to compete in the global market on the basis of price alone.
This is clear if you look at the competitive advantage of certain third countries in terms of lower land, labour or infrastructure costs.
Instead, I think high animal welfare standards should be promoted as one of our competitive advantages.
We should also remember that, as Mr Tarabella said, there needs to be real choice for consumers.
Recent surveys and research projects have demonstrated consumers' active interest in the welfare of farm animals.
It is clear that consumers believe that they can improve animal welfare through their purchasing power and that a large proportion would be prepared to pay a premium price for such products.
Ms Resetarits also emphasised this point.
The Commission thinks that labelling will eventually make these products more competitive, to the benefit of the industry, and in particular to those who produce in a welfare-friendly manner.
We believe that Europe's high animal welfare standards need to be seen as a marketing opportunity and a competitive advantage, rather than as a burden or liability.
The policy of using vaccination to prevent the spread of animal diseases has been carefully considered by the Commission and is now integrated into the specific Community legislation on foot-and-mouth disease prevention.
The same principles are today in the avian influenza measures just adopted.
I have to remind Mrs Ayuso GonzÃ¡lez that the Treaty does not allow the Community to act in respect of the use of animals in cultural and traditional events, such as bullfighting.
Therefore, the action plan does not foresee any measures in this regard.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
I welcome this debate.
The EU has slowly but surely improved the welfare of animals through a number of measures relating to the housing and transportation of animals.
We now have to build on this and develop quantifiable animal welfare indicators and create a formal framework for animal welfare impact assessments for future EU policies.
We should also look at the introduction of an EU labelling scheme to identify products produced from higher welfare standard systems to enable consumers to make informed choices.
Finally, as a member of the Committee on International Trade, I would place particular emphasis on establishing internationally recognised animal welfare standards for trade.
(SV) Proper animal protection is a necessity in a modern society.
There are big differences between the EU Member States when it comes to animal protection.
It may therefore be appropriate to have certain common rules, for example where the transport of animals is concerned.
The June List sees the EU as a union of values, where ethical issues in relation to animals are important.
We are, however, doubtful about and, indeed, opposed to having an animal protection authority under the auspices of the EU.
The existing structures in the EU Member States should be sufficient.
If there were Community legislation, the Member States would be forced to apply it.
If they did not do so, the Commission, in the first place, and ultimately the European Court of Justice would have to take measures against the state or states that did not comply with the legislation.
As so often, it is very difficult to strike a balance between decision-making at EU level and decision-making at national, regional or local levels.
There are, however, certain values that must be protected at any cost, such as human rights and basic animal protection.
This should preferably be done at international level.
Follow-up to the report on competition in professional services (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Ehler, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on follow-up to the report on competition in professional services.
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by presenting a report in September of last year on professional services under the heading 'Scope for more reform', the Commission has actually expanded on the report it had already drawn up back in 2004 on the topic of competition in professional services.
Parliament expressed its views on this on the basis of the reports from 2001 and 2003.
In March of this year, the Committee on Legal Affairs and this House again positioned themselves in relation to the special sector of legal professions.
What links all public discussions, between economists, as well as between Parliament and the Commission, is a significant phenomenon: all participants have extremely forthright opinions but are weak when it comes to figures.
The figures which form the basis of the mainly sector-specific or national investigations largely date from the early 90s.
The most recent investigation dates from the start of 2001.
What unites all of the investigations, however, is the fact that they are either limited to specific sectors or nationally or that they are founded precisely on an empirical basis which basically goes so far back that it is barely suitable for generalisation purposes.
Viewed rationally, the economic importance of the services cannot be overestimated.
8% of European GDP is made up of business services, of which at least one third can be attributed to professional services.
In this respect, and I believe that Parliament also welcomes this in the context of the Lisbon agenda, it is entirely justified asking what contribution this sector may make to growth and employment in Europe.
It seemed important to us to not just approve the Lisbon agenda using nice speeches but to also get involved in this specific instance in the question as to what contribution liberalisation can make to growth.
The Commission should be commended in bringing some sort of order to a discussion which hitherto, I should say, has run wild.
Basically, the Commission has made the following economic consideration: First of all, it has looked at six professions: lawyers, notaries, engineers, architects, pharmacists and accountants.
It has defined five restrictions on competition (fixed prices, recommended prices, rules of competition, advertising rules and the entire gamete of entry restrictions, business structures and merger practices).
The Commission has put forward four large categories of consumer for comparison purposes - public authorities, large enterprises, small- and medium-sized enterprises and private consumers - and then acknowledged that certain special regulations apply here given the presence of asymmetries - in the sphere of market transparency, as far as externalities are concerned, or on the issue as to what extent a public good is furnished here.
This rationalisation is welcomed.
It enables discussions to proceed and makes it logical for Parliament to position itself in relation to this discussion at this time.
For our part, we have tried, on the one hand, to lend a degree of support, but also, on the other, to contribute to differentiation as regards this discussion.
First of all, it needs to be emphasised that there is a large amount of agreement on the theme of subsidiarity.
The difficult task of achieving coordination between Member States on this subject will fall to the European Community.
We have requested, on the other hand, and I consider this to be extremely important, also as a result of the discussion on the Services Directive, that the objectives of liberalisation are clearly named and empirical evidence produced too.
What level of growth is expected from which liberalisations?
What is the desired impact on employment?
This also really needs to be stated in terms of figures, otherwise there will not be sufficient acceptance in the Member States.
We have emphasised that we see self-administration having equal status vis-Ã -vis state regulation.
We have said we believe that we must differentiate between this system.
By way of example, we must distinguish between public authorities because there is a difference between whether a small community invites tenders or whether a nation state invites tenders for professional services.
We have stated that whilst we recognise the geographical and traditional conditions, we view them as special regulations which do not obviate the necessity of continual analysis in these sectors as to what opportunities for liberalisation and growth exist there.
We have stated in no uncertain terms that we consider special regulations regarding mergers and advertising to be dubious.
We have stated that we want to differentiate clearly between certain restrictions on competition according to categories of consumers and finally, we have stated that in the very area of voluntariness, the voluntary Code of Conduct for professional services is very welcome indeed.
The crux of the matter is that we want to go back to the Commission saying that we welcome these observations.
It must also be stated categorically, however, that rationalisation, further differentiation in these areas, is required.
Only then will the necessary acceptance be achieved in the nation states.
Mr President, I would like to thank Dr Ehler and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for this report.
The Commission welcomes your support for the work that needs to be done in the sector.
Your assessment of the importance of professional services to the EU economy is welcome and pertinent.
Reform by Member States in this sector must be an integral part of delivering the Lisbon and Better Regulation agendas.
The Commission fully supports your call for us all to work together constructively.
We agree, too, that is important to learn from the experience of Member States which have already taken steps to modernise.
We think you are right to insist that Member States eliminate special advertising and business structure restrictions and ensure fair and equal access to the professions, including eliminating geographic and demographic rules on entry.
Your call for more economic evidence is a fair one, but let us not forget that we are not proposing harmonisation of regulation in the professions.
Member States remain free to determine regulatory solutions based on national needs and circumstances.
So our experience is that the best way to add value is through historical and international comparisons.
And that is why we have commissioned another piece of external comparative research to look at the EU property services market - selling and buying property.
That study will evaluate the impact of professional regulation on consumer choice, price, quality and other important indicators and, where feasible, the effect on jobs and growth.
National authorities can also play an important role in evaluating the impact of reforms already undertaken.
They, along with key stakeholders, such as professional bodies, are likewise well placed to evaluate the current state of regulation of the professions in their countries, explore what can be modernised and evaluate the impact of possible reforms on growth and jobs.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the professions make up one of the areas of excellence in the provision of services.
In the majority of European countries, although not in all of them, basic regulation dates back to the codification of civil law on contracts.
Obviously this is primarily in civil law countries.
Over time, the professions have become the jewel in the crown of civil society, but often also a conservative and closed field, risking the loss of their outstanding quality in order to keep their privileges.
In this way, in some countries and in some sectors a closed caste has been created, often inaccessible on the basis of merit, but increasingly and all too often based solely on the hereditary line.
The European Parliament has been asked to reflect on the issue of services in the internal market, and will vote tomorrow on the report on competition in professional services.
This year as never before, therefore, it is laying the foundations for finding a balance between, on the one hand, opening up to competition and therefore liberalising access, with particular attention to young people at the end of their training, and, on the other hand, safeguarding the quality of service, not least to protect European citizens.
It is also laying the foundations for defining a reference legal framework, identifying critical points to be removed, principles to be respected and procedures to be followed for reference checks; a legal framework within which Member States will be free to make decisions, fully in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, which has also been mentioned earlier.
The text is the result of constructive work by the various political groups.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his willingness in practice to discuss and accept the majority of the amendments, many of which were submitted by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament.
Parliament is adopting a clear stand with regard to the services sector: it wants to gradually remove regulatory barriers and obstacles, not because it has an uncritical, sceptical attitude that cannot tolerate red tape and wants to dismantle the existing system, but rather so that it can encourage that positive competition and openness to transparency and innovation that is a fundamental part of sustainable economic growth and consumer protection.
Regulation and self-regulation in the professional services sector must be in line with the Lisbon Strategy, in particular with the protection of the general interest, and must not result in discrimination, particularly discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, nationality or gender.
The proposals contained in the report are a move in that direction, and include: the promotion of codes of conduct, with a decisive role assigned to all stakeholders, not least through representative organisations; importance given to removing bans on advertising, which is seen as a genuine information service for consumers, in particular regarding the nature and cost of services; support for establishing inter-professional and multidisciplinary services to encourage innovation and competitiveness in an ever more complex world; and focus on creating conditions to ease the transition from university education to professional practice.
I hope that there will be support for the amendment we are submitting to Parliament asking Member States to abolish the system of fixed or minimum fees and the ban on negotiating payment linked to the outcome achieved, where they act as obstacles to the quality of services and to competition.
I believe that there is still a long way to go, and that the Member States must look within themselves to find the best possible combination of respect for tradition and innovative development of professional services, a key factor in developing the productive system and the social market economy that characterises Europe in a globalised world.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the desirability of reforming the professions in Europe has been discussed since time immemorial.
There are contrasting opinions on this.
Some people, including the former Commissioner for competition, Mario Monti, have always come out in favour of what they describe as necessary liberalisation, within a general framework of reform geared towards revitalising the European economy.
Others, however, maintain that the current system guarantees citizens a certain level of quality of service and should therefore be retained.
I personally recognise the importance of professional services as drivers of European economic growth, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to begin a process of reform of the sector, aimed at liberalising professional services.
Excessive regulation, rigid fees, few professional organisations, and even fewer multidisciplinary organisations, as well as advertising restrictions, act as an obstacle to revitalising competitiveness in Europe and often do not allow a high level of quality of services to be ensured.
All of that must also be seen from the point of view of paying greater attention to protecting citizens.
It is citizens that we as MEPs are called on to represent, and citizens that benefit from professional services.
In many regions, the interest of users is often sacrificed to the rewards of position.
Situations of oligopoly, where sometimes it would not be strictly true to speak of monopoly, result in higher prices for professional services and cause an added cost that is invariably passed on to consumers.
Furthermore, I agree with the rapporteur that it is appropriate to dispense with special regulations in the field of advertising, in order to allow professionals to inform users of the services offered and the relevant prices.
On the other hand, I do of course believe that a regulatory effort is needed to strengthen the bans on misleading advertising and to provide instruments for the practical protection of consumers/users.
In conclusion, from the point of view of reconciling the need for greater competitiveness in professional services, through liberalisation, with consumer protection, I support the rapporteur's worthwhile proposal on the adoption of codes of conduct and self-regulation.
I would therefore like to congratulate Mr Ehler once again on his excellent work.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, it is not self-evident that competition in the liberal professions should be unlimited, and that is once again demonstrated by the Ehler report, and also by practical experience.
In the Netherlands, for example, fixed prices for notarial services have been abolished, while many other rules have remained intact.
Those rules are needed to guarantee quality.
I was approached very recently, for example, with the question by a remedial educationalist who wanted to establish himself freely without going through the usual registration procedure with the Ministry of Public Health.
The government was right to prescribe additional requirements in terms of training for registration and compensation, something that is, of course, vitally important for public health services.
The registration requirements for different professional groups still form an obstacle to establishing oneself in a liberal profession, and there are, to some extent, good reasons for this.
The guarantee for professional services cannot be made if people can set up in a liberal profession without any restrictions.
The rapporteur's amendment aimed at drawing this subtle distinction in the report is therefore necessary.
(DE) Mr President, it is certainly to be welcomed if partly antiquated professional codes of conduct are reviewed in terms of their necessity in the case of independent professions.
In my opinion, however, it is not a question of deregulating all the sectors affected in the same way, irrespective of their different nature.
It is known that independent professions provide high-quality services which are in the public interest.
In my view, we should not undertake any experiments in this area.
The fact that in Argentina and France, for instance, second thoughts are being given to the reintroduction of statutory tariffs for notaries shows that deregulation is not perfect.
A sharp increase in the number of lawyers with a simultaneous relaxation in the Fees Ordinance has led to a situation in Germany, for instance, whereby highly qualified legal advice is only offered at staggeringly high hourly rates while at the lower end of the market, a great many lawyers work for rock bottom prices.
It is paradoxical if the Commission intends, on the one hand, to limit occupational rights but, on the other, is calling for codes of conduct to be drawn up and the introduction of new quality controls following the abolition of regulatory measures.
Thank you, Mr President, for a stimulating debate.
I would like to respond to a couple of the most important issues that have been raised.
Mr Ehler called for better economic analysis of the impact of changes on jobs and growth - and rightly so.
On assessing the economic impact of reforms: as I mentioned, the fact there are no plans to harmonise professional regulation across the EU means it would be very difficult to predict impact accurately.
We favour comparative assessment of what differences real changes have actually made on the ground in the Member States that have already introduced them.
That is why we see a strong role for the national authorities, which are well placed when they undertake these analyses, but we will also further reflect on what more we might do to facilitate the building of the economic evidence base at EU level.
Talking about liberal professions, such as lawyer, requires tough ethical rules and qualities.
The Commission fully accepts that genuine ethical rules are essential to ensure good governance and practice in professions such as lawyer.
In this respect, one standard should apply no matter to whom the services are provided: fixing prices or banning advertising do not deliver high ethical standards and good quality services.
Quality and observance of ethical standards are better ensured and controlled by adequate training requirements and by effective supervision by the States and/or by professional bodies, including effective complaints procedures for clients.
Codes of conduct, as mentioned here, also represent a positive step.
The Commission supports the removal of fixed and minimum prices and the use of result-based fees.
There is no evidence to suggest that in the Member States where fixed and minimum prices have been removed there has been a deterioration in the quality or ethical standards of legal services.
Though quality has a price, a fixed price does not in itself guarantee quality.
Price competition with the possibility of undercutting fixed minimum fees and the use of success fees will, rather, enhance access to justice.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
EU economic and trade relations with Mercosur (debate)
The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an Interregional Association Agreement.
rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by informing you that Commissioner Mandelson has contacted me to explain why he is not attending this debate, and I am grateful to him for that.
The reason is the Summit on India in Finland; this led to an interesting conversation with the Commissioner on the agreement with Mercosur, in which I explained to him that, as well as India or China, Brazil and the Mercosur group are also emerging powers, a view that the Commissioner certainly, and fortunately, shares.
Let us hope that, when the bleak scenes of the Doha Round have faded away, when the elections in Brazil have taken place and when the political, economic and commercial foundations for the European Union's relations with Mercosur have been laid, which is this Parliament's intention in the report we are presenting today, we will take the definitive steps to guide the final phase of the negotiation of an ambitious European Union-Mercosur Association Agreement.
That is the intention of our report: to restore a political, economic and commercial priority, to establish a collection of principles, rules and guidelines that give form to a strategic political priority, and to strengthen the framework for relations between two trading blocs.
If we can bring them together by means of an Association Agreement which, together with the political aspects of cooperation, involves an agreement on the creation of a free trade area, we will have taken the historic step of creating the world's largest such free trade area.
At a time when new powers are emerging in the East, this would be a way to enhance the mutual interests of two blocs that are united by history and culture, with all the benefits that that would bring to our citizens on both continents.
We are talking about a combined population of more than 700 million inhabitants.
Our report therefore calls for a full, ambitious and balanced agreement based on three pillars: a political and institutional chapter reinforcing democratic dialogue and political cooperation; a cooperation chapter promoting sustainable economic and social development; and a trade chapter establishing an advanced free-trade area with a broad agenda including, as well as reciprocal liberalisation of trade in goods and services, investment, public procurement, the protection of intellectual property rights, cooperation regarding competition and trade protection instruments, trade facilitation, and a binding dispute settlement mechanism.
Mexico and Chile are good examples of how our relations can be intensified by means of an association instrument.
With Mercosur representing 45% of the population of Latin America and the region's largest market, as well as 45% of its GDP, the great potential for growth on both sides is clear.
Furthermore, unlike what is happening in Latin America as a whole, where US imports are three times higher than those from the EU, in Mercosur the EU quota is about 25% compared with 20% from the United States.
According to the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, the costs of not reaching an agreement are estimated to be some EUR 3.7 billion per annum in trade and goods, rising to over EUR 5 billion if one includes investment and services.
The trade agreement must be wide-ranging and cover all sectors, though the specific sensitivity of certain products must of course be taken into account, as the report indicates.
We did not wish to look into the details of the agreement's impact on the different sub-sectors, but rather we thought it appropriate to analyse the issue as a whole, to analyse the mutual interests at stake in the negotiation altogether.
Our report therefore refers both to the EU's interests in Mercosur and to Mercosur's interests in the EU, and specific sections are dedicated to such important aspects as agriculture, with references to subsidies, geographical designations, bioethanol, etc.; NAMAs, where we include a special reference to fisheries and the sensitivity of certain processed products, such as canned tuna; services, where it is essential to achieve real improvements and clear and stable regulatory frameworks; investments, which are fundamental for sustainable economic development and generating employment and prosperity; public procurement and intellectual property, as well as the clear identification of possible barriers to trade and the approximation of rules on certification, accreditation, standardisation, etc., to promote fair trade and competition; and the establishment of an agreed dispute settlement instrument.
As well as the strictly technical and commercial aspects, the report also covers the mechanisms necessary for the industrial, employment and social cooperation of small and medium-sized businesses and aspects relating to technology, science, environmental measures, energy and communication, as well as European Union aid and solidarity mechanisms.
Finally, we include the necessary inter-parliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Mercosur Parliament in order to make the agreement more democratically representative and bring the sometimes excessively technical aspects of the agreement more into line with the feelings of the citizens we represent, thereby giving the agreement a greater popular dimension.
We believe that, by means of this report, the European Parliament is making clear its support for a far-reaching and ambitious Association Agreement between the old continent and a large part of the new continent, which we want to be integrated, and we call upon the Commission to speed up the negotiations so that the agreement can become a reality as soon as possible, for the benefit of the citizens of both continents.
I would like to end, Mr President, by thanking all of the parliamentary groups for their invaluable understanding and support.
I have received much understanding and support and I needed as much of it as possible in order to achieve the broad consensus that we wanted.
Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Peter Mandelson, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade on the report on economic and trade relations between the EU and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an Interregional Association Agreement.
This report gives a very comprehensive picture of the current relations between the EU and Mercosur in the economic as well as the political field, and the European Commission shares most of the analysis presented in this report.
The European Commission very much concurs with the Committee on International Trade in its view that a conclusion of an ambitious and balanced Association Agreement between the EU and Mercosur is a strategic objective.
The Commission remains firmly committed to concluding the Agreement with Mercosur as soon as it is technically and politically feasible.
Such an agreement would be the platform for promoting the relationship between the two regions and for promoting the common values and objectives that unite us.
An EU-Mercosur agreement would establish the first ever region-to-region association and the largest free-trade area in the world, covering almost 700 million people.
As the INTA report points out, such an Association Agreement would enable both regions to respond more effectively to the challenges of globalisation.
It would enhance the competitiveness of our economies, increase growth and thereby contribute to economic and social cohesion.
Creating the world's largest market place would give an enormous boost to job creation, economic reform and productivity levels.
A free-trade agreement with Mercosur is a very good example of how EU trade policy can contribute to the EU's wider approach to economic reform and competitiveness.
A region-to-region agreement with Mercosur would also serve as an instrument to support an integration effort within Mercosur and Latin America.
The accession of Venezuela to Mercosur this year implies an enlargement of the region and the European Commission also hopes that the process of broadening and deepening regional integration will continue.
We know from our own European experience that the reforms and adjustments necessary for integration are not easy.
But we also know that the rewards make the effort worthwhile.
An Agreement would also create a more transparent and stable business environment for the EU and Mercosur companies.
This would contribute to attracting more investment flows.
Investment - and future investment - could possibly have the biggest impact on the shape of our future economic partnership with Mercosur.
Although foreign direct investment to Mercosur increased in 2004 and 2005, the relative share of the region in relation to global EU investments has been sliding ever since the 1990s.
This is a source of concern, as investment means transfer of know-how, of industrialisation and jobs.
This relative downward trend of the Mercosur region in relation to the rest of the world, especially Asia, is one of the challenges of the future agreement and, possibly, its main potential economic benefit.
Let me just say a few words on the timing.
In the report by the International Trade Committee, you request the establishment of a negotiating calendar which would allow us to conclude the EU-Mercosur negotiations as soon as possible.
The European Commission is fully committed to concluding these negotiations as soon as is technically and politically feasible, but we have always been of the opinion that substance prevails over timing.
What we want to achieve is an ambitious, comprehensive and balanced agreement which goes beyond our WTO commitments.
As the INTA report points out, there is a cost to not having an Agreement.
But there is also a long-term cost in missed opportunities from having a bad agreement.
Related to the issue of timing is the link between these biregional negotiations, the progress of the WTO Doha Development Agenda and the sequence of the two negotiations.
In this respect, the European Commission fully agrees with the analysis of the report by INTA; both these processes can realise substantial synergies.
They are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary.
To conclude, let me convey to you the following message, which I am sure that you share with me: for strategic and political reasons, the European Commission remains committed to negotiating and concluding an ambitious and balanced agreement with Mercosur.
Trade is an important element of this agreement but not the only one.
Beyond the trade negotiations, we should not lose sight of the strategic, political and economic rationale of this agreement.
Let us not forget the strategic dimension of a future Association Agreement, which is to promote a relationship between regional blocs which enhances peace, stability, prosperity, social progress and democracy.
Mr President, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Varela, for his extremely successful report on economic and trade relations between the European Union and Mercosur with a view to the conclusion of an interregional association agreement.
The report is an important one, and it has come out at an appropriate moment.
As we know, negotiations regarding the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement have a long and rather troubled history.
In the current situation - the failure of the Doha talks - we need to put out a strong and clear signal that an association agreement is necessary and favourable both to Mercosur members and to European Union members.
There is also a need for greater political involvement in and support for the final success of the EU-Mercosur negotiations.
I believe that the rapporteur has been very successful here.
The report sends out a positive signal and can play an important and positive role in mapping out the next stages of the negotiations.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur for taking into account many submissions and comments from the report of the Committee on Development, which I represented as a draftsman.
I would like to thank you for emphasising the importance of maintaining balance between trade and development in the final text of the agreement so that the sections relating to trade do not conflict with the sections on development, and for underlining the need to establish guarantees that the provisions on cooperation are effective in combating poverty and are in accordance with the EU's negotiating policy.
The Committee on Development drew attention to various aspects of development cooperation.
It is clear that better economic and trade conditions can contribute towards resolving some of the social problems that exist in the Mercosur countries.
The Committee on Development underlines the need to increase support for social development, education, reducing social inequalities, more equal distribution of income, and reduction of poverty.
We also believe that we should support small and medium-sized enterprises and balance farming, tourism and infrastructure investment with protection for the natural environment.
An important advantage of this report is that it provides institutional reinforcement of Mercosur.
One of the ways it proposes to do this is by strengthening cooperation at parliamentary level, which would have a very positive effect.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on the excellent work that he has done on behalf of the Committee on International Trade.
I would also like to express my regret at the absence of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Mandelson, although at least he has had the courtesy to call the rapporteur to explain, which does not happen very often in these cases.
In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr President, I would like to say that I would have liked to have obtained a firmer commitment from the Commission with regard to the timetable called for by the rapporteur in his report because ten years is a long time to be negotiating an agreement which, as the rapporteur and the Commissioner have pointed out, is an agreement on political association, economic coordination and cooperation.
It is clear that the European Union has not shown any lack of will; I believe that one of the Member States of Mercosur has shown clear and decisive support for the multilateral round, and the Chilean and Mexican experiences - Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna reminded us of this - demonstrate clearly that it is possible to go much further than the expectations established by the multilateral round.
I therefore believe, Mr President, that where there is a will there is a way.
Although this kind of agreement is characterised by commercial aspects, when it comes to third-generation agreements, which have contained the democratic clause, it is clear that following the Vienna Summit, following the failure of the multilateral round, we must go the whole hog.
I believe that the European Commission must give its clear and decisive support to these association agreements, since Latin America does not need hand-outs, but opportunities, and this European Union-Mercosur Association Agreement offers an excellent opportunity for all of us to pursue our shared objectives of greater democracy, greater integration and, of course, more fluid and efficient trade, which mean peace, progress and prosperity for everybody.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on his excellent report and, as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to thank him for cooperating so closely since the initial exchange of views in the Committee on International Trade.
That cooperation has helped to produce a balanced report containing the clear message that this House wants to address to the Commission: Commissioner, we want an association agreement to be reached between the European Union and Mercosur as soon as possible for several reasons.
Firstly, this agreement will be much more than merely a trade instrument: it will be an instrument at the service of peace, multilateralism and dialogue that will enable both blocs to adopt policies that promote shared economic, social and geopolitical values and interests.
It will enshrine the first North-South intercontinental association, offering an alternative to other attempts at integration, such as the FTAA, which had more to do with a desire for trade domination.
Furthermore, the European Union-Mercosur association will lead to the largest region of shared prosperity in the world, benefiting more than 700 million citizens, as previous speakers have said.
Strengthening cooperation will make it possible to implement policies aimed at economic and social cohesion with a view to promoting development, as well as the equality and prosperity of citizens in both regions.
For the final report, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament considers it necessary to involve social actors more in the process of integration and to have a genuine interparliamentary dimension between the European Union and Mercosur.
We hope that the other groups will support our amendments to this effect.
Commissioner, although efforts that come to nothing may be dispiriting, the Commission must do everything it possibly can to enable the agreement to be concluded and to put an end to the sense of stagnation and pessimism recently surrounding the multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations.
I shall end with a question, Commissioner: could you provide us with any information regarding Venezuela's process of accession to Mercosur and tell us what effect this process is having on the negotiations underway?
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I consider it right that the European Union is striving for beneficial and close relations with the most diverse regions of the globe and, of course, with Mercosur as well.
However, it is wrong in my view if the Commission, by means of such agreements, tries to implement through the back door that which was rejected by the majority of countries during the WTO negotiations, namely, the liberalisation of international trade between partner countries with very different economic and social conditions, without taking the different situations in these countries into account.
The EU - Latin America summit which took place in Vienna, as well as the alternative 'Enlazando alternativas' summit of last May afforded the opportunity of being better able to understand the wishes of the new voices in Latin America and of shaping relations in the interests of the populations of both regions in a more balanced manner, and not just for the benefit of industry and commerce.
A few days ago, the Commission published a communication on its trade policy strategy which focussed more strongly on economic liberalisation than had previously been the case.
In yesterday's debate, Commissioner Mandelson again emphasised that he shares the same fundamental position.
I would not like to advocate such a fundamental position.
The report contains references which I deem to be extremely important, such as emphasising the principles of 'less than full reciprocity' and 'special and differential treatment depending on the levels of development'.
All in all, however, the report puts forward the known liberalisation demands and even goes beyond them by approving, for instance, the area of investment as the subject of a chapter in the EU-Mercosur agreement.
As a result of international protests, however, this has been deleted in its entirety from the Doha development round negotiations.
My group supports a fair association agreement but not the route taken to a free trade area between the European Union and Mercosur.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Varela's report quite rightly reminds us, and he is to be congratulated for it, that Europe and Mercosur would be well advised to strengthen their cooperation.
In recent months negotiations with Mercosur have rather come to a standstill, with most of the controversial questions waiting to be sorted out at the WTO.
With the recent suspension of the Doha Round, we must henceforth show an unwavering political will to relaunch these discussions.
Bilateral negotiations between regions assume a high level of economic and political integration from the two partners.
Mercosur, however, seems weakened by the asymmetry of its members and by their sometimes divergent interests.
Its institutions, therefore, need to be consolidated, in particular by setting up a regional parliament and a binding instrument for settling disputes.
Furthermore, consideration needs to be given in view of Venezuela's membership which will give, without any doubt, a more political nature to the bloc and will alter the economic balance of power.
Since it is very much in the interest of the European Union to negotiate with a strong partner, it has to support politically and financially the emergence of Mercosur as an integrated regional bloc.
This area has the authority to reinforce alongside us the multilateral structure and the economic and social model that we hope and pray for.
(ES) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating my fellow countryman, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on his report and on his open and positive approach, which I hope will lead to a significant consensus in this House.
Mercosur has more than 230 million inhabitants, it is one of the five largest economic areas in the world and it is the largest in terms of food production.
Relations between the European Union and Mercosur have deep historical roots and shared cultural foundations.
The association agreement is therefore the best formula for extending our links and stimulating exchanges between us.
I am pleased that our amendments have been incorporated into the report, stressing the democratic component of our relations, based on shared values, the parliamentary dimension and the active participation of civil society, aspects in connection with which I still believe we should be making additional efforts, as Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez has pointed out.
I am also pleased with the inclusion of our proposals on extending fisheries and tourism relations, creating appropriate regulatory frameworks, intensifying exchanges and increasing investments - with accounting and auditing standards duly harmonised - and dealing with the obstacles to rationalisation in the public sector.
Finally, I would call upon the Commission to treat this Agreement as an objective of the highest political priority.
Mr President, I should like to thank the House for its comments.
I have taken careful note of them and I will convey them to my colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, for his consideration.
For strategic and political reasons, the European Commission is totally committed to negotiating and concluding an ambitious and balanced agreement with Mercosur.
Therefore, such an agreement remains a priority.
Engaging in negotiations with other partners does not mean, by the way, that we are giving less priority to an agreement with Mercosur.
The Treaty on Venezuela's accession has been signed by the Mercosur members.
However, in order for Venezuela to be a full member, that Treaty has to be ratified by the parliaments.
We, the Commission, do not foresee any major obstacles to the negotiation process as a result of the accession of Venezuela.
A lot has been said here about development.
The EU is by far the biggest donor.
We plan to pay out about EUR 50 million for the period between 2007 and 2013.
I believe that, for economic, cultural and political reasons, both the European Parliament and the Commission share the same view in respect of concluding an ambitious and balanced association agreement between the EU and Mercosur.
It is a strategic objective.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Sector of berries and cherries intended for processing (debate)
The next item is the oral question by Mr Daul and Mr Janusz Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on the situation of the sector of soft fruits and cherries intended for processing - B6-0435/2006).
Mr President, we can see the growing importance of the market for fruit and vegetables.
This is partly a result of increasing consumption, and of the interest farmers have in growing such products to improve their income.
During the accession talks, despite the good examples of solutions for the markets for tomatoes, peaches or citrus fruit, there was lack of will on the part of the EU to positively resolve the problem of the berries market.
2004 was a difficult year for berry growers in Poland.
I sent my first letter about this to the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Fischler, in July 2004.
At the same time, the European Commission started work on simplifying the common market in fruit and vegetables in the EU, on which it reported in August 2004.
In March 2005 the European Parliament adopted a position on this matter.
As a result of numerous interventions and speeches by Polish MEPs to the Committee on Agriculture, we succeeded in convincing our chairman Joseph Daul to speak on this matter.
As a result, in April and July 2005 Poland received experts' visits by representatives of the European Commission who looked into the issue of the berry and cherry market in Poland and drew up a report.
In 2005 Polish berry growers had to deal with negative returns on produce in that market.
In 2006 the Agricultural Commission of the European Parliament included in its programme a session in Poland, enabling MEPs to see for themselves the hardships that their Polish colleagues had been talking about.
The Commissioner, who is not present here today, was probably already well acquainted with the problem.
By the way, I am curious to know whether anyone in the Commission has counted how many speeches Members have made in this matter.
During the visit to Poland, the European Commission for the first time presented a report on the situation in the berry, cherry and cherries for processing sector.
The report is incomplete as it does not take into account the lack of horizontal integration, that is to say relations between the farmer and the processor.
Also, it does not mention that growers are absent from the ownership structure of this industry, and that foreign capital is dominant.
Nor does it present scenarios for the likely development of the situation on the berries market in the future.
It is stated that all the problems of this particular Polish market have to resolve themselves.
2006, like the two previous years, has again proved extremely difficult for soft fruit growers, and has been a crisis year.
The Committee on Agriculture has therefore requested that action on this be speeded up and intensified, the result being today's debate and the resolution which this House will adopt in tomorrow's vote.
We now have the final version, so let us go through it.
MEPs appeal to the European Commission firstly to take action to improve the competitiveness of berries in the EU.
Secondly, it should take immediate action to limit the excessive import of berries from third countries at dumping prices.
As we know, the Anti-Dumping Committee yesterday decided to impose immediate duties on frozen strawberries exported by Chinese firms.
The additional duties will be 0%, 12.6% or 32.4% depending on the situation.
Thirdly, a support mechanism for grower groups should be introduced, which would give growers greater encouragement to form groups, for example, by doubling the rate of aid for groups that are formed and then recognised.
Fourthly, other instruments should be introduced, such as a special safeguard clause, entry price mechanisms or inclusion of berries on the list of sensitive products.
A fifth recommendation is to implement a system to support the processing of berries such as strawberries or raspberries similar to that currently used for tomatoes, peaches or citrus fruits, to stabilise the market.
As regards the final point, I know that Commissioner Fischer-Boel, who is not present today, was rather sceptical about this, which is why it may be worth considering the introduction of a regional system of payments for growing berries for processing.
This would be in addition to the current subsidies within the SAPS system.
A similar solution is proposed for reforming the banana market, where there is a change in the rules for granting subsidies for products expressed in tonnes in favour of subsidies calculated by land area.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the sector, these payments must be tied in with an obligation to join producer groups or organisations, and an obligation to sell produce within a contracting framework.
The resolution also contains a number of other interesting measures and proposals.
Berry growers have lost three years, and at the rate things are going with the reform of the market, it seems they will lose two more.
It is only in April 2007 that legislative proposals for solutions in the fruit and vegetable sectors are planned to be tabled.
Thank you for your question.
As far as I understood, it contains six points, and I will address them one by one.
Point one: yesterday, the Commission services presented to the Member States at the Anti-Dumping Committee a draft regulation to impose provisional additional duties on imports of frozen strawberries from China.
The written procedure for adoption by the Commission is under way.
Regarding the second point, the issue of the low level of organisation in new Member States will be considered in the framework of preparations for the proposal on reforming the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables.
On point three, the Commission proposed recently to simplify state aid rules so as to facilitate crisis support.
In particular, it is proposed that, under certain conditions, aid to compensate for bad weather would be exempted from prior authorisation by the Commission.
Point four concerns crisis management.
The issue of crisis management will be considered in Commission reform proposals for fruit and vegetables.
Concerning point five, the Commission is not in favour of setting up EU subsidised grubbing-up programmes.
However, Member States have the possibility to implement national programmes provided that they meet state aid rules.
Finally, point six: promotion is indeed an important aspect.
EU funds are available for promotion of programmes, and let me remind you that most of the above-mentioned aspects are being examined in the preparation process for the common market organisation reform proposals that the Commission will table in the near future.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) The action plan prepared by the European Commission is a good foundation, and the anti-dumping decision regarding Chinese strawberries is positive, although this is not a lasting solution.
The only reassuring, long-term solution would be for these types of produce - cherries, sour cherries, berries, mushrooms and corn - to be included among the produce intended for processing, and therefore among those that benefit from processing subsidies within the framework of the reform of the fruit and vegetable sector.
This would be very important especially for the new Member States, particularly since this year the producers in the new Member States are receiving only 35% of the direct payments.
If produce in this sector is not included among those intended for processing, there will be no significant help for the new Member States.
I have fought for this over a year and a half and will continue to do so.
on behalf of the UEN Group - (PL) Mr President, although we have been discussing soft fruit, we have had hard-fought battles over them since the beginning of this term.
I am very pleased that the difficult situation of soft fruit growers has met with the understanding of this House.
As a Polish MEP I would like to thank all my colleagues for this.
I thank you for your sympathetic approach to the issue, which above all affects farmers in my country.
I thank you for your solidarity, particularly our colleague from the Agriculture Commission who personally came to Poland to meet farmers and see their situation on the ground.
The draft resolution contains actions that will satisfy our farmers and bring about stabilisation of the soft fruit market, which is very important for the future of this important sector.
Protection against excessive imports, inclusion of soft fruits on the list of sensitive items, increased aid to groups of producers and compensation for fruit not sold during the crisis are all solutions that are badly needed.
I believe that the statements in this resolution will not remain on paper only, and that the European Commission will promptly put forward specific draft legislation.
As co-author of the draft resolution, I ask you to vote in support of it.
(PL) Mr President, today's debate on the situation in the berries and cherries for processing sector is the culmination of over two years of discussions of this key issue for European growers and processors.
The lack of protection for the internal market, dumping, natural disasters, low prices, and greed and unfairness among many buyers have resulted in huge losses for fruit farmers, particularly in new Member States such as Poland, which accounts for two-thirds of the output of such produce in the EU.
The difficult situation on the berry market has had the biggest impact on farmers in the poorest region in Europe, LubelszczyÅºna, which produces one sixth of total output.
In my parliamentary activities I have frequently raised this issue in various forms.
I am therefore happy that today our debate will end with a concrete resolution which will allow us to repair the negotiating errors we made in Copenhagen and provide a basis for the decision which thousands of farmers are waiting for.
I therefore thank all the Members for their cooperation and look forward to their positive support for the resolution in the vote.
(PL) Mr President, we are debating the soft fruit sector in a situation where the European Commission has, after nearly two years of efforts on the part of many Members, decided to impose anti-dumping duties on frozen strawberries imported from China.
This is a long-awaited decision which, one hopes, will limit the threat of growing exports of frozen strawberries from China at dumping prices.
I would like to express the hope that the European Commission will soon also put into effect other proposals contained in the draft resolutions prepared by Mr Daul and Mr Wojciechowski such as protective clauses, entry prices, compensation for losses due to unfavourable weather conditions or a crisis on the market, and a strong support mechanism for producer groups and organisations.
Thank you for your contributions to this debate.
I will inform my colleague, Commissioner Fischer Boel, about the concerns you have raised.
All these points are being considered and discussed at length in the framework of the preparation of the forthcoming fruit and vegetables reform that is just around the corner.
I shall do my utmost to respond to some of the issues you raised.
Mr Tabajdi's question centred around the idea that the Commission should introduce support for producer organisations that sell soft fruit to the processing industry.
Another point he made concerned support for producer organisations that sell soft fruit to the processing industry at a time when existing schemes are being reviewed in the context of the reform of the sector.
The Commission considers that the introduction of such a support scheme would be inadequate from a technical point of view.
It would also be untimely and would not be in line with the principles behind CAP reform.
'The Commission should devise and implement measures restricting excessive imports of soft fruit, in particular those which apply dumping prices'.
It is true that some of the difficulties faced in the sector of strawberries for processing originate from low-priced imports of frozen strawberries from third countries.
Yesterday, the Commission presented to the Member States and the Anti-Dumping and Anti-Subsidy Committee a proposal to impose provisional anti-dumping measures on imports of frozen strawberries from China.
The procedure for adoption by the Commission is under way.
In the other subsectors, imports from third countries either play a marginal role - for example as regards blackcurrants and sour cherries - or have decreased in the last years - as is the case with raspberries, for example.
In the case of frozen raspberries, Poland has increased its market share in the last few years, at the expense of imports from third countries.
Mr Siekierski, you were asking about support schemes for grouping producers: these exist both in the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables and in rural development legislation.
In its report on the situation in the sector of soft fruits and cherries, the Commission has indicated that, in the framework of the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, the Commission may propose specific additional support for Member States with low levels of organisation, and this is being looked at in the context of the preparation of the reform.
Mr Siekierski, Mr Wojciechowski and others want to include soft fruits on the list of sensitive goods and bring them under the special safeguards clause and the entry price system.
The special safeguards clause was introduced in the Uruguay Round for products that had tariffs.
In the case of fruit and vegetables, this concerned products under the reference price system.
It is no longer possible to increase the list of products covered by the special safeguards.
Similarly, the entry price system applies to products that were previously covered by the reference price system.
There is no possibility of including soft fruits under the entry price system.
Thank you, Commissioner, for your information.
Cherries are my favourite fruit also, so I can sleep more easily.
I hope that that goes for other Members also.
I have received a motion for a resolution) tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.

European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - Fundamental Rights Agency: activities under Title VI of the EU Treaty (debate)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
by Mrs Kinga GÃ¡l, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights - C6-0288/2005 -
and
by Mrs Magda KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision empowering the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights to pursue its activities in areas referred to in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union - C6-0289/2005 -.
Mr President, I believe that today marks an important stage in the assessment of a provision that is highly important both for the Commission and for Parliament.
The initiative in question, which, first of all, was adopted in accordance with the formal rules of a procedure that excludes codecision, has subsequently been carried forward politically through an extremely close collaboration with Parliament.
The trialogue method, which has enabled us to come to an agreement on many occasions, is, in fact, a political solution: even though, from an institutional and legal point of view, we are sadly not in the presence of a formal codecision procedure, this political solution has enabled us thus far to develop an excellent working relationship.
I should like to thank the rapporteurs, Mrs GÃ¡l and Mrs KÃ³sÃ¡nÃ© KovÃ¡cs, for their useful collaboration.
We have come to an agreement on many points, and I hope, too, that the few outstanding points can also be resolved by the end of the year so that, in 2007 - as has often been repeated by the European Council and Parliament, and as the Commission itself hopes - the Fundamental Rights Agency will at last become operational.
What points still need to be considered and developed further, even after the last trialogue, which was nonetheless extremely useful?
There are three basic issues, which were among the items I recently addressed with the Ministers of Home Affairs at the Council meeting held last week in Luxembourg, and recently in a meeting with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.
The first issue specifically concerns the relations between the future agency and the Council of Europe.
The Commission, myself and - I am sure - the European Parliament itself intend to prevent any overlapping of powers between the future agency and the Council of Europe, which already does a fine job of protecting and promoting fundamental rights.
I believe that it is possible to pursue the common objective of establishing a working relationship between the agency, on the one hand, and the Council of Europe, on the other, with each one working within its own areas of responsibility.
The agency's primary task is to oversee, monitor and gather together material regarding compliance with Community legislation, without going beyond this remit.
The first point is therefore one of ensuring that the Council of Europe's powers are respected in full and that there is a willingness to cooperate.
The second point relates to the geographical scope of the Agency's powers and responsibilities.
You will all recall that the original position limited the geographical scope solely to the EU Member States.
Obviously, the need soon arose to extend the scope of the responsibilities to candidate countries, countries that are already, albeit to varying degrees, on course to join the European Union.
There was also the serious problem of countries at the pre-accession stage, which we call potential candidate countries.
This is an extremely important concept, because it refers to a key geographical area for Europe: the Western Balkans.
These are countries that are negotiating, in some cases, or applying, in others, stabilisation and association agreements with the European Union, which involve among other things extremely sensitive material relating to the protection of fundamental rights.
