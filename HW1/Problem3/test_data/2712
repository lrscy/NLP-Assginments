With regard to that I would refer to paragraph 8 of the motion for resolution, suggesting excluding Zimbabwe from the 2010 World Cup.
I would suggest, unlike my colleagues, that it is a good idea.
I would be grateful to hear the Commissionâs views on that.
We saw this week the fraternity and friendship that emanates from international football.
My team â Scotland â was in Lithuania recently and I have no doubt a number of friendships were made.
However, participation is a privilege, not a right.
Exclusion from the 2010 World Cup would underline international disgust with Mr Mugabeâs regime without hurting the people of Zimbabwe, and yet it would be noticed throughout that football-mad country.
It strikes me as a positive and useful idea.
I would be grateful to hear the Commissionerâs view on it.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the harrowing state of human rights in Zimbabwe has been, as we all are aware, for some time an issue of pressing concern and this is not the first time that it has been on this Houseâs agenda.
For how many years now has the Marxist dictator Mugabe been carrying on with his racist policies against his countryâs white farmers?
He is getting away with a policy of ethnic cleansing, the principal victims of which are the overwhelming majority of Zimbabweâs black population.
Zimbabwe was, after all, an agricultural country at one stage, and one that was among the few south of the Sahara capable of exporting its agricultural produce.
Mugabe, in his madness, has reduced his people to a state of misery.
Agriculture is collapsing and famine is becoming widespread.
It is high time for effective action to be taken against him.
In the same way as was Liberiaâs Charles Taylor, Mugabe must be treated by the international community as one who has committed crimes against humanity and must be called to account for them.
Africa is another place where policy must not be carried on with double standards.
Â Â  Mr President, it appears that, as time goes by, the European Union is becoming more and more ineffectual where certain dictatorships are concerned.
It is a great pity that a wonderful country like Zimbabwe has been allowed to deteriorate into its current state while, except for the few measures we have taken to combat the dictatorship of Mr Mugabe, we look on.
We talk about what is happening and perhaps restrict the travel arrangements of the perpetrators and their immediate families, and then think we are doing something to help those who are feeling the brunt: not only the whites but also a sizeable faction of native black Zimbabweans.
It is about time we stood up and really started to act rather than just talk.
Â Â  Mr President, our Austrian colleague is right in saying this is not the first time we are discussing Zimbabwe in this House.
It has become something of a never-ending story, and in many respects Zimbabwe is a world record-beater with 70% unemployment, the highest rate of inflation in the world, 3Â 200 deaths from AIDS each week, and the lowest voter turnout in the world, namely 15%.
Four million people in that country are threatened with starvation.
The situation is a challenge for the whole world, including the European Union.
I hope that this time we will go beyond mere words, and I agree with what MrÂ Rueda, our Spanish colleague, said recently about not applying double standards.
By all means refer to Zimbabwe, but go further than that because fundamental human rights are also being violated in other countries and we have to constantly avoid such double standards.
It is a good thing that the House is debating this issue again, but let us hope it is for the last time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is following events in Zimbabwe very closely and we are increasingly concerned at the deterioration of the political situation and, above all, the economic and social situation, which affects the people: civilians, citizens.
Based on the situation that we see today, since the Zimbabwe Government has taken no suitable measures â no measures at all â to seriously address the democratic crisis, the protection of rights and the tragic economic crisis, any possible easing or lifting of the measures adopted by the EU in relation to Zimbabwe is out of the question.
In other words, we will not discuss it at all.
The European Union is not changing its attitude towards Zimbabwe, and its firm stance has recently been reasserted by my colleague Louis Michel in his contacts with the government authorities in Zimbabwe.
He emphasised that the Commission remains absolutely committed to playing an active role in trying to break the stalemate.
At the same time, we cannot waive any of the conditions that we have imposed, especially the resumption of democratic rules for the citizensâ daily lives.
What was said confirms our concerns.
I listened carefully and with great interest to the idea of excluding Zimbabwe from the football World Cup in 2010.
You all know that a similar decision is being adopted by FIFA but, having said that, I personally think it is an idea worth taking seriously and discussing with the Member States and the International Federation.
I cannot say today whether the outcome will be what certain Members here are hoping, but I can say that I shall inform my fellow Commissioners Louis Michel and MrsÂ Ferrero-Waldner of this idea: the matter deserves to be taken very seriously.
There is certainly another aspect: as I said earlier, Europe hopes that Zimbabwe will return to a path of restoring the conditions for democratic life and economic progress.
We are of course ready to point out certain routes to follow, in the context of the priorities of the 10th European Development Fund programme, for instance, within which there are specific possibilities, but we must not fail at this point to impose a very clear condition on Zimbabwe: unless it seriously embarks on the road to democracy, we cannot alter our firm stance.
At the same time, the Commission is maintaining a very close dialogue with Zimbabweâs neighbours, particularly the members of the Southern African Development Community and the South African Government.
I agree with what I have heard: we shall be increasingly active in calling on these neighbouring countries to do even more.
We support the United Nations initiatives and, in my view, it is very important for respected African Heads of State or Government to put pressure on the Zimbabwe Government to improve the political and humanitarian situation at last and to pave the way for national reconciliation.
In the meantime, we are worried about the people.
Obviously, while our attitude towards the Zimbabwe Government is one of absolute firmness, we need to worry about providing direct assistance to the people, who are not to blame for a regime that deprives them of their freedom and also of their livelihoods.
I can confirm that Louis Michel intends to continue supporting and also funding projects concerning socio-economic sectors, medical assistance and the role of organisations on the ground.
I would point out that the role of the Red Cross must certainly be facilitated and encouraged, as must projects promoting governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law.
In our opinion, direct assistance to the people of Zimbabwe needs to continue in all these areas.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place immediately.
Â Â  â The next item is voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to move a substitute wording, namely:
To replace âcommission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductionsâ by the correct wording âindependent group of eminent persons as observers of investigations into abductions, disappearances and extrajudicial killingsâ.
I believe that is the correct technical term that should be used at this point.
Â Â  â I believe that the text expresses it wrongly when it says: âdelete two times the words â.
This is actually no more than an editorial amendment.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to change the last phrase of our amendment to read as follows: 'Consideration can be given to lifting proscription if there is an effective cease-fire, an end to terrorism and resumption of serious negotiations on a constructive basis.' That would replace the last phrase that appears in the amendment at the moment.
Â Â  Mr President, this is a technical amendment.
I am advised that the final part of Amendment 5, which refers to the fact that ââŠ Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this concernâ would read better as ââŠ this is a view shared by many international bodiesâ.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, it has just come to my notice that, although the Chairman of the Executive Council of the African Union â in other words, the executive or governmental side â is listed among those to whom the resolution on Zimbabwe is addressed, we have omitted to include the Pan-African Parliament among them.
Since we are currently seeking to establish contact with them, I would like to move an oral amendment to the effect that the Pan-African Parliament be added to the list.
Â Â  â That concludes voting time.
Â Â  â I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7Â September 2006.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the current part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 21Â September 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed.
The following proposed amendments to that agenda have been submitted:
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has asked for the addition of a Commission statement on the implementation of food safety legislation (meat in poor condition).
Mr Cohn-Bendit has the floor in order to explain this request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we have taken on board one idea from among your proposed reforms, that being that this House should be more up-to-date, and should not wait to discuss certain events as late as four years after they happen.
Two crucial things have happened in Europe over the last few weeks.
One of them is summed up in Germany by the term âold meatâ, referring to the fact that meat no longer fit for consumption was found in various German regions and now in other countries too, and we would very much like to hear, from both the Commission and the Council, what is actually being done to check that the same thing is not going on all over Europe.
This appears to be something that becomes so widespread so fast that the authorities responsible for dealing with it cannot even begin to get to the bottom of it.
Secondly, we have to deal with the very disturbing fact that genetically modified rice has been found all over Europe, even though it is prohibited.
We would like to hear from the Commission what it is doing about this, too, and not have to wait a few months before being able to debate what it is going to do in three or four yearsâ time.
We want to know what is being done right now to deal with these two disgraceful occurrences, and that is why we have tabled a written question and want a statement from the Commission and the Council that we can discuss â here in this House, during this part-session here in Strasbourg.
Â Â  Mr President, we share MrÂ Cohn-Benditâs concern about what I understand is called It is a serious issue.
It occurred in Bavaria; there was clearly a breach of the regulations in Germany, and we clearly need to hear from Germany what has been done.
The reason it becomes a European issue is because a little bit of that crossed the border into Austria and Switzerland.
That is something that should be looked at.
I suggest we look at it in the Environment Committee and then take the matter further from there, rather than taking up time in the plenary during what is an exceptionally busy week here in Strasbourg.
Â Â  The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have requested that the debate following the Commission statement on the ASEM Summit end without a vote on a resolution.
MrÂ Swoboda has the floor in order to explain this request by the PPE-DE and PSE Groups.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, as we know, the ASEM meeting has already taken place, and the fact that it was preceded by a meeting of parliamentarians means that they have already had a chance to say what they think about this process.
All that is needed now is for us to be informed about the results, so there is little point in drafting an additional resolution, and I move that we refrain from doing so.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I do not always agree with MrÂ Swoboda, but, on this occasion, he has got it right, and so we should agree to what he suggests.
Â Â  Mr President, I oppose this proposal for two reasons.
Firstly, why would we not say something about ASEM?
For the first time in years, there has been a successful ASEM Summit.
We used to complain about things going wrong but, finally, we have done something well.
Let us speak out about the improvement in economic ties with Asia.
It is an important issue and it gives us the opportunity to discuss the promotion of democracy and speak out against the continued use of capital punishment in Asian countries.
There is another reason. This is our only opportunity this week to speak out about the military coup in Thailand.
That event should be on all our minds.
A military coup is the wrong way to get rid of even such an unsavoury character as Prime Minister Thaksin: it is not the way to go about it, and this Parliament cannot remain silent.
We have to speak out on this issue, whether it is you as President, the Conference of Presidents or, preferably, this House as a whole.
I therefore oppose having the debate without a resolution.
Â Â  The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
I shall remind you that I shall give priority to those Members who have not spoken during the last two sittings.
Â Â  With regard to the long-term solution of the border issue between Croatia and Slovenia, I welcome the latest news from Brussels to the effect that MrÂ Solana, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Commissioner Rehn will intervene to help resolve outstanding border disputes between the two countries.
My view is that the European framework will make possible an easier and more efficient resolution because of the participation of the two countries in the European integration process.
Slovenia supports the integration of our neighbour Croatia into the European Union, but, at the same time, the people of Slovenia expect the Government of Croatia, as well as its citizens, to adhere more closely to the agreements entered into by the two countries.
It is unacceptable that Croatia should be building bridges and roads in a region where the international border has not yet been settled with finality, without such arrangements being subject to a prior agreement between the countries.
Likewise, it is unacceptable that Croatia should encroach on land owned by Slovene nationals without obtaining any permission whatsoever from the owners.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the EU Presidencyâs Health in all Policies conference took place a week ago.
Its main theme was that public health can be promoted through political decision-making in all areas of life, and not just in the health sector.
This is all the more true given that it is hard for national economies to postpone addressing health problems until they involve diseases for which they need to start finding cures.
This week, we are voting on reports on improving the ambient air quality.
This is just the sort of preventive health work that needs to be undertaken in all policy areas.
Our decisions in matters of transport, trade and industry policy, the environment, social planning and social policy always have an impact on public health.
It is always best to invest in areas where health hazards can be averted.
The European Union has a mandate under the Treaty to work towards this objective in all policy areas.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, this Saturday Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a member of our faction and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, was elected President of the Republic of Estonia by the electoral body.
According to public opinion, Ilves was the overwhelming favourite of the Estonian population in the contest with the sitting president, but nevertheless the elections were close, due to the regulations of the electoral body.
Both the media and the Estonian people feared that political manipulation, and not the popular will, would prevail.
On Saturday, thousands of Estonians, myself included, gathered in the centre of the capital, Tallinn.
Just as we did during the period of the restoration of Estonian independence at the end of the 1980s, we used music to express our support for Toomas Ilves as the representative of democracy.
I am very glad to be able to congratulate both Estonia and Europe.
The electoral bodyâs decision corresponded to the expectations of the democratic majority of our society, and after the Estonian presidential elections that took place on 23Â September, I can confirm that European democracy is alive and well in Estonia.
I would also like to wish my good colleague and friend Toomas Ilves luck in his new position and in promoting more of Europe in Estonia and more Estonian ideas here.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is only right that this community of states should set itself the lofty goal of having the same environmental legislation and standards right across Europe, but are we seeking to achieve it by offloading our problems on Africa or Asia wherever possible?
There are media reports of how a Dutch firmâs inappropriate disposal of toxic mud off the Ivory Coast has put lives at risk, and that I regard as a scandal.
The Netherlands has been an EU Member State for many years, and I wonder whether it knew this stuff was being exported, whether approval for this was given, and, if it was, then subject to what conditions?
What action has been taken as a consequence of this?
Have the victims been compensated and long-term damage prevented?
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, exactly two weeks ago I had the opportunity of visiting South Ossetia as part of a European Parliament delegation.
It appears that in this troubled area of the South Caucasus there are at least 10Â confrontations every day involving the use of firearms.
The peace-keeping forces deployed there by Russia were supposed to guarantee peace for the local people and indeed for the whole of that area of the South Caucasus.
According to the information provided to us by the Finnish head of the OSCE detachment, MajorÂ Lehtonen, the Russian peace-keeping forces are not, however, taking any steps to identify the underlying causes of these confrontations and if necessary pursue the individuals who are provoking them.
I would therefore like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that it is unacceptable to allow such an important part of our continent to remain under the sole control of a single military peace-keeping force.
We should strive to ensure that in future the European Union has greater influence over how the situation in South Ossetia is controlled.
Â Â  () Speaking before the European Parliament, IÂ would also like to voice my criticism concerning the announcement that the deadline for new Member States to join the Schengen area has been put back to 2009.
At aÂ time when technological advances occur at break-neck speed, the general public has reacted with surprise and great disappointment to the European Commissionâs statement that the delay is due to technical problems related to the development and deployment of the SIS II database.
The Schengen Treaty is aÂ visible and tangible embodiment of the freedom of movement of persons and goods across the entire European Union; unfortunately, we are only paying lip service to this freedom.
Therefore, I regard as unfair a situation where citizens of new EU Member States will have to wait beyond the end of the 2007 in order to travel without border checks.
I call on the European Commission to consider any and all options that would enable the original deadline to be met or, alternatively, pending the deployment of the new system, to allow the new Member States to be temporarily linked to the current system, SIS I plus.
Positive steps taken by the European Commission to meet the original deadline would help to strengthen the publicâs faith in the European project as a whole.
Â Â  â I wish to speak on a similar matter.
As has already been mentioned, some disturbing news has emerged from the Commission in recent days.
A spokesperson for the Internal Affairs Commissioner has suggested that, for a number of technical and legal reasons, the second phase of the Schengen System is not ready.
This is a system that should be, or should have been, launched in the autumn of next year.
This is disturbing news for the whole of Europe, and also for the new Member States, which have invested a great deal of effort and money in order to be ready for next autumn.
I should therefore like to call on the Commission to inform this House as to the technical and legal difficulties that have arisen, and who is responsible for this situation, because the preparations have thus far gone according to plan.
Once I know what the problem is, I should also like to know who is responsible for the situation.
Â Â  â ) Mr President, I should like to relate an event that happened on 7Â September.
Last week I was in Romania in connection with an attack by police and hooded commandos against members of the local Roma community in Reghin (SzÃ¡szrÃ©gen), which is in the district of Apalina.
Thirty-seven people were shot and injured by plastic bullets.
The county chief of police reported that only six people were injured in the incident, and that they suffered wounds that would heal within eight days.
I personally witnessed that these statements were false.
I met a man who had been hit by seventeen bullets, five of which had been successfully removed within eight days, while the other twelve are, to this date, embedded in him.
Since January, this has been the fourth such highly worrisome incident in Romania.
I bring this fact to the attention of Parliament, because, on 26Â September we will have the last country report on the table.
I should like to call upon Commissioner Olli Rehn to do everything possible in order to change the situation.
Â Â  Mr President, last week a tape was leaked, on which the Hungarian Prime Minister said: âWe lied to the people for 18 months â in the morning, in the evening and at night, about the economy, and we lied to win the elections.â
It was followed by street demonstrations with tens of thousands of people all over Hungary calling for him to resign.
The PPE-DE Group also called upon the Prime Minister to resign.
However, European socialist and liberal parties backed their discredited friend.
Dear colleagues, that was a shame!
Fortunately several socialists took an opposite stand, also demanding his resignation, among them SÃ©golÃšne Royal.
Here I call on our socialist and liberal colleagues to change their position.
Systematic lying to citizens cannot be the European way in politics.
I hope we all agree on that.
The leaked tape included a reference by the Minister for Finance saying that the European Commissioner, MrÂ Almunia, helped his socialist comrades in Budapest to delay the issuance of the real data.
I call on the Commissioner to make clear his responsibility in the matter.
I also call for the resignation of the anti-democratic Prime Minister of Hungary. I express our solidarity with the demonstrators all over Hungary.
I am wearing a white shirt to express my solidarity with and protest against lies and violence.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, in some European Union countries we are witnessing new forms of right-wing extremism that are of great concern to all democrats.
Ideological fanaticism, intolerance and hatred are not new, but what is new is that they are finding shelter within broad-based, moderate parties.
So long as the far right has remained outside our parliaments or has been poorly represented, we have been able to fight it, but now it is more difficult.
It affects both parties in power and opposition parties.
We are seeing the re-emergence of forms of racism, xenophobia, machismo and homophobia, which suggests that the democratic gains made by the European Union are in retreat.
Rather than talk about other countries, I shall refer just to my own, where the situation is not as serious as it is elsewhere.
The main opposition party in Spain has been unable to accept its defeat in the 2004 election and has embarked on a dangerous journey towards extremism.
Manipulative and mendacious, it is attacking not just the Government but, more seriously, the institutions of the rule of law, as well as the courts and the state security agencies and forces.
Â Â  Mr President, the partition of Ireland has been a complete and abject failure, socially, economically and politically.
The European Union, it is said, is based on peace, reconciliation and the removal of borders.
In order to further the stated objective, the EU has a responsibility to assist in the development of an all-Ireland economy as a step towards Irish reunification.
My party, Sinn FÃ©in, is launching a comprehensive document entitled âEU support for Irish reunificationâ, outlining the practical measures we believe the Union can take to help bring about Irish unity.
Over the coming weeks and months, Sinn FÃ©in will be promoting this policy throughout Ireland and across the EU, beginning with the conference at the European Parliament in Brussels on 18 October.
Â Â  Mr President, the separatist formation of Transnistria recently conducted a self-styled referendum to approve the idea of of this part of Moldova into the Russian Federation.
Described as a bandit land, Transnistria continues to be a dangerous hub of arms smuggling and black-marketeering.
It is also known as a living Soviet museum, with the continued cult of Lenin and Stalin.
All this is possible because of the continued presence there of Russian troops in gross violation of Moscowâs ten-year-old commitment to pull them out.
Sadly, this is but one example of Russiaâs attempts to retain its military presence beyond its borders.
I call on the Commission not to limit itself to expressions of concern but to make the evacuation of Russian troops and Moscowâs respect for the integrity of neighbouring states a credibility test for the new PCA.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SzÃ¡jer has called on the Socialist Group in this House to take a position on what has been going on in Budapest and on the statements made by the Hungarian Prime Minister, MrÂ GyurcsÃ¡ny.
It is for each and every member of the Hungarian Parliament and of this House to decide for himself or herself whether or not MrÂ GyurcsÃ¡ny did the right thing.
Speaking personally, I prefer politicians who summon up the courage to utter unpopular truths to those who want to carry on papering over things that need to be brought out into the open, so I think one can think what one will about MrÂ GyurcsÃ¡ny, but it nevertheless has to be said that he had the courage to say things that others â including you, MrÂ SzÃ¡jer â evidently do not want to say.
You can wear a white shirt if you like; it looks good on you, too, but perhaps you should also tell us whether you are a friend of those who burned a European flag in front of the Hungarian Parliament building.
If you are, then this House is not the place for you.
Â Â  â Mr President, this September sees the 250th anniversary of the Douro wine region in Portugal, Europe's first wine region to be created and regulated.
This anniversary is particularly relevant at a time when the Commission is preparing further reform of the common organisation of the market in wine, with a view to gradually dismantling it.
Wine production in the United States, South Africa and wherever else must not be called port wine.
It is appalling to destroy a regulation that has been in existence for 250 years.
The quality of port wine is the result of all of the know-how accumulated by the people of the Douro, who, with the aid of a particular climate and sunshine, have, over the course of 250 years on the banks of the River Douro, where this ancient regulated wine region is located, built up a rich heritage that has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we therefore ask for your help to preserve and promote this important cultural heritage of winemaking.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too would like to refer to the environmental disaster that took place on the night of 19 to 20 August of this year, when a Greek vessel chartered by Dutch nationals discharged 400Â tons of refinery waste.
As a result, 11Â areas of the region concerned have been polluted, hundreds of thousands of people are in hospital and 7 have died.
According to the UN, no firm registered in Europe should export toxic material to Africa, yet this does often happen.
The incident in question is particularly dramatic, and utterly scandalous, as it took place in a densely-populated area.
The European Parliament donates a great deal of money to Africa.
We send it billions of euro, on top of which we now have to provide humanitarian aid.
Every human being has the right to clean water and clean air, and that is why more immigrants will be arriving.
Â Â  I must set the record straight concerning the rumours and misrepresentations circulated here on 5Â September by Hungarian MEPs as part of an anti-Slovak campaign.
They alleged that a woman had been mugged in Slovakia for speaking Hungarian while making a phone call.
However, an inquiry has concluded that no such thing happened.
The allegations about derogatory slogans being chanted at sports events were also built on shaky ground, as the slogan âDeath to Hungariansâ had been put up as a provocation by an individual of ethnic Hungarian origin.
The accusations about losses sustained by 800Â 000 Roma were not true either, and the number quoted was overstated tenfold.
I resolutely deny the allegations that the government of the Slovak Republic supports the suppression of ethnic minority rights, as the facts show the very opposite.
To put it bluntly, this is a typical case of setting a thief to catch a thief.
Sadly, the anti-Czechoslovak exhibition staged in Brussels by Hungarian MEPs also misrepresented the facts.
This is a shame.
Â Â  Mr President, in its Europe 2006 report the Federal Government of Switzerland published a cost-benefit analysis of possible membership of the European Union.
It examined three alternatives: to continue the current set of bilateral sector-specific arrangements, to join the European Economic Area, or to become a full member of the EU.
The Swiss calculated that full EU membership would cost between six and nine times as much as the current system of bilateral trading arrangements.
They decided that the resulting loss of sovereignty and freedom of action and the negative economic effects would far outweigh any supposed benefits.
The report concludes that Switzerlandâs interests are best served by staying out of the EU and continuing with its existing sector-specific trading arrangements.
It is good to know that there is still at least one European government that understands the meaning of the words âin the national interestâ, even if it is not the British Government.
Â Â  I had intended to talk about Schengen but my colleagues have already raised this matter.
I should, however, like to comment on the question of just who it is that has shown courage in the crisis in Hungary.
The Hungarian Prime Minister did not personally address the public about the extent of the lies, but he has admitted that he discussed the issue within his most immediate circles.
It is the person who blew the whistle on the problem that showed courage, and I think that we, as Members of the European Parliament, have to be very clear about that.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I believe that the European Parliament should urgently call on the Commission and the Council to readjust our immigration policy in the light of the humanitarian disaster that is being caused by the arrival of immigrants from Africa.
The problem must not be simplified or trivialised, as it was by the German representative last week at the Council of Interior Ministers, when he had the audacity to say that Spain was not going to sink because of 20Â 000 or 25Â 000 men arriving in the Canaries.
That is not the problem.
The issue must not be simplified or trivialised; it has to be examined in depth.
The European Union must react by readjusting this immigration policy and dealing with the underlying problem, which is the lack of active cooperation in order to create jobs and stability within Africa, on the continent of Africa.
The example of Switzerland, although it is not part of the European Union, cannot help us, either.
It is not a matter of jeopardising asylum applications; it is not a matter of being like Switzerland and making things much easier for financial transactions or bank deposits than for people.
That is not the right path, either.
I believe the right path is for the European Union to adopt a clear, humanitarian stance and to provide a humanitarian and âcivilisingâ solution to this extremely serious problem of immigration.
Â Â  â Mr President, our petitions to the European Parliament often concern charges, complaints of procedural shortcomings in services, political protests and referrals to topical matters.
Allow me today to refer to a unique act of humanity and sensitivity: I refer to a decision by the renowned Catalonian football team of Barcelona which, from this year for the first time, is sporting the UNICEF emblem on its shirts instead of an official commercial sponsor, thereby losing several million euros.
With the consent of Barcelona's shareholders and the United Nations, UNICEF and its work will be promoted by the Spanish club for five years, with all the money collected over that period used for humanitarian aid for suffering nations, mainly in Africa.
Sport is not therefore just a spectacle, entertainment worth billions of euros; it is at the same time also something which fights racism, hooliganism and xenophobia and develops actions of sensitivity and humanitarian aid.
As demonstrated in practice, sport accompanied by other social or cultural action can unite people, just as we are doing today in the European Parliament.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am charged with handing over to you about 100Â 000 protests by Poles from Poland and across the world.
We are all outraged by the shameful European Parliament resolution vilifying Poland, the Polish people and the much-loved Catholic radio station with millions of listeners, and making allegations of anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism against us.
The resolution was intended to tarnish my countryâs honour, and is already being used for that purpose.
Attempts have been made to exert pressure on the European Union to interfere in Polandâs internal affairs.
Parliamentâs response to these protests will serve as an indicator of the value it places on democracy and tolerance.
It will also reveal whether truth can prevail in this House, or if Parliament will simply become a breeding ground for lies.
We shall appeal against this resolution at the European Court of Justice.
Three hundred and one Members voted in favour of the resolution, yet we are unaware of any facts that would substantiate the claims it makes.
I believe those who supported the resolution base their views on Poland and its people on information drawn from the liberal media, which are hostile to our cause.
The Members concerned have never listened to , nonetheless they voted in favour of a document bearing no relation to truth or reality.
These signatures therefore constitute a protest.
Â Â  MrÂ President, it is unfortunate that MrÂ Schulz is no longer here, but you can tell him that he has been misinformed.
For a start, as MrÂ Peterle has already said, MrÂ GyurcsÃ¡ny does not have the courage to stand up in the Hungarian Parliament and admit to the public that he lied day and night for a period of years.
Secondly, no European flags have been burned in Hungary, and I call on MrÂ Tabajdi of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to confirm that.
Here, in this European Parliament, we should tell the truth and nothing but the truth.
Â Â  MrÂ President, when you were in Poland you expressed regret at the lack of contact between the institutions of Europe and its citizens.
You now have a unique opportunity to remedy the situation.
We are today handing over to you the votes of some 100Â 000Â people, concerned about the activities of this House.
The signatories include Solidarity members, private individuals, organisations, local authorities and academic institutions.
Some of them are from outside Europe.
They are all anxious about how Europe is developing and await your response.
They expect the European Parliament to apologise for the unfair and unfounded attack on Poland and the Catholic radio station in the resolution adopted on 15Â June.
This document brought Parliament into disrepute.
The future of Europe cannot be built on a foundation of lies.
The history of the Polish nation and state is a model of coexistence with other nations and religions. is an example of mankindâs commitment to truth.
It teaches us mutual love and respect.
It is a radio station which is concerned with human affairs and brings us closer to God.
It provides the kind of spiritual guidance that Europe so badly needs.
Â Â  () At the previous session, certain Members described Slovakia as a country of extremism and intolerance, which persecutes citizens from the Hungarian ethnic minority.
They were referring to an alleged vicious assault and described Slovakiaâs government as one that promotes the suppression of ethnic minority rights.
Those words were reckless and not based on facts.
A police inquiry has demonstrated that the incidents so broadly publicised by the media and politicians either had not happened at all or had not been driven by nationalistic or ethnic sentiment.
The Slovak Government has reiterated and demonstrated that it will not tolerate manifestations of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, and is prepared to take all necessary steps to prevent any such actions.
I would like to call on everyone to use their words thoughtfully.
Misrepresentations and misunderstanding may cause unnecessary tensions, and I trust this is something that no one wants.
People living in Slovakiaâs ethnically mixed regions are often confused and do not understand what kind of tensions politicians and the media are talking about.
Â Â  MrÂ President, according to information provided by the human rights and democracy centre in Hong Kong, 200Â people are still imprisoned in China because they took part in the demonstration in the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989, seventeen years ago.
Those young people who demonstrated entirely peacefully at the time are now prematurely aged, ground down as a result of the terrible conditions prevailing in Chinese prisons.
I refer of course to those who survived.
We should recall that the Chinese regime applied the death penalty to many of the protesters.
It is estimated that 15Â 000 people were sentenced at the time.
Every now and then we call this fact to mind, but on the whole we tend to ignore it.
I hope my words today will raise awareness of it once again.
We cannot bring back those who laid down their lives for the right to express their opinions, but we can do something for the 200 who are still languishing in Chinese jails.
We must not be indifferent to their plight.
They are pinning their hopes on us because they have nobody else to turn to.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the assumption is that donations to organisations working for the public good will help the needy.
Unfortunately, Community VAT legislation currently in place in Poland is actually serving as an effective deterrent to potential donors.
There has been a steady decline in the number of donors since the act on VAT was amended to bring Polish legislation into line with Community provisions.
In the past, a taxpayer who made goods over to the needy free of charge had to calculate the tax due on their actual value.
Now, however, he or she has to calculate the tax due on the purchase price.
As a result, someone who makes a gift of a computer that is several years old has to pay the same amount of tax as if it were new, even though donated goods are worth much less when they are passed on than the price on the original invoice for their purchase.
Indeed, it is often the case that the market price one could get for these goods is less than the tax that has to be paid when they are gifted.
The decision to tax gifts runs counter to the very notion of helping the needy.
Often absurd situations arise, when people prefer to throw out food or items that are still usable rather than give them to the needy, because it is cheaper and safer to do so, and saves trouble with the Inland Revenue.
If this repressive legislation is not amended and the state continues to penalise donors for their generosity, we shall witness growing indifference towards the most needy.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to highlight what happened last week during the visit of the Agriculture Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, to the constituency I represent in the European Parliament.
I was not aware that the Commissioner was there on Thursday, but I heard of her visit Friday morning on local radio.
Immediately I contacted the Commission Office in Dublin asking for some information about her itinerary.
I thought that a bit of joined-up thinking and working at European level would be beneficial, naive as I was.
The Commission Office in Dublin said that it could give me no information.
After five phone calls to the Commissionerâs own office, I was told on Friday afternoon that even though this was a public visit, the information was private and unavailable.
I had to wait until Saturday to read details of her visit in a national newspaper.
So what was private on Friday was public on Saturday.
I was astounded.
I could not believe that the public itinerary of a European Commissioner on a visit to Ireland could be classified as private.
Is that what Plan D is about?
Is that dialogue?
Is this the same Commission that encourages us to inform citizens about the proposed Constitution?
Finally, as a first-time MEP, maybe I have it wrong.
Maybe that is how the EU does its business.
If it is, it is no wonder that citizens say no.
If it is not, I would ask you to use your good offices to find out why a Commissioner has effectively cut the lines of communication with individual MEPs.
Â Â  Mr President, one of the many gifts the British Empire gave to the world was the global abolition of slavery.
It has come to my notice, via my constituents in Yorkshire, that the practice continues in Cyprus, the people of which country never cease to lecture us on the foibles of the Turks when it comes to human rights.
It is called indentured labour.
Philippine and Singhalese female domestic staff are treated appallingly: their passports are basically confiscated by their employers.
I have given full details of the matter in a parliamentary question.
Indentured labour by any other term is a form of slavery.
It exists in the European Union and it is disgraceful.
Let us please hear less humbug from the Cypriot representatives and let us see them put their own house in order.
Enough of this indentured labour!
It is a disgrace!
Â Â  Mr President, Hungary, like the other 24 Member States of Europe, is a democracy.
Pursuant to the rule of law, we changed our Government after the parliamentary elections in April.
On 1 October, we will have municipal elections in which we will elect the mayors in the municipalities.
Therefore, those who have demonstrated on the streets against the Government and in favour of a change of government are working against the Hungarian constitution and against the rule of law.
We are closer today to knowing who these people are who are playing with fire in this way.
Once again, Hungary should abide by the rule of law and follow democratic rules.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I feel bound to raise an issue that ought not to be a concern for the European Union in the 21stÂ century.
I refer to the worrying surge of neo-Nazism and fascism in Germany. This represents a threat to Poland and the Czech Republic.
Future relationships within the European Community are also under threat.
The results of elections in the German states of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania were declared a few days ago.
The German National Democratic Party gained over 7% of the vote.
This means that the NDP will be represented in yet another state.
Members of this group have expressed alarming views.
They dispute the Polish-German border, and call for the creation of a IVth Reich.
They consider Hitler to have been a prodigy, and Hess a pure idealist.
They deny the Holocaust and spread Nazi-inspired prejudices about foreigners.
How can it be possible for parties of this ilk to operate legally in Member States of the Union like Germany, spreading hatred, xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism?
Last year the NPD received a subsidy of more than EURÂ 1Â million from the state coffers.
That is scandalous.
The Union must introduce a clear ban on the activities of such groupings.
I appeal to Members of this House to move a joint resolution condemning the German political system in which there is still scope for neo-Nazism.
Â Â  I apologise to all those Members who have been unable to take the floor, but we have considerably overrun the time allocated to this item.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would just like to make one comment.
What the Members present are saying is of course all very interesting, and the banners they have brought with them are very eye-catching, but I have made five unsuccessful attempts already at getting permission to speak.
Perhaps it might be worth considering the possibility of giving other Members the floor in the right order.
Â Â  I am sorry that I cannot give everybody the floor.
Please accept my apologies.
I have taken good note of your request.
You will be the first to speak in the next sitting.
There are other Members who have systematically spoken in the last two sittings and I have already warned them that I am trying to give priority to those who have not spoken in the previous sittings.
Â Â  Mr President, if a Member makes a vicious attack on a colleagueâs country, then I think a representative of that country should be given the opportunity to answer back.
I am referring to the attack by a British colleague on the Cyprus Government.
I would like to remind him that Britain maintains its colonisation of my country, Cyprus, to this day.
Â Â  Thank you.
You too will have a chance to present your views on this during the next sitting.
I have taken note that you have not been able to do so today.
Thank you, everyone, and please accept my apologies.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
â the report (A6â0234/2006) by MrÂ Krahmer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (COM(2005)0447 â C6â0356/2005 â 2005/0183/(COD)); and
â the report (A6â0235/2006) by MrsÂ Corbey, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the thematic strategy on air pollution (2006/2060 (INI)).
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, MrsÂ Corbey, the rapporteur on the thematic strategy on air pollution, and MrÂ Krahmer, the rapporteur on the proposal for a directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, and congratulating them on their exceptional and diligent work.
I should also like to extend my especial thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its efforts so far.
Air pollution is and will remain one of the most important public health problems.
As a result of air pollution, life expectancy in the European Union today has fallen by 8.5 months.
The quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people is reduced every day and the natural environment is in danger, despite the significant reductions in emissions achieved over recent years.
We need to step up our efforts.
The strategy we propose defines the steps we need to make in this direction.
It lays down new, unprecedented targets for health and the environment.
The measures on small suspended particles will bring about a reduction in forecasts of premature deaths from approximately 350Â 000 today to 160Â 000 in 2020.
That will be the outcome of the combined application of the strategy and other measures already agreed.
As far as the natural environment is concerned, we expect the size of ecosystems at risk of acidification to fall by over 50% and the size of ecosystems at risk due to the presence of excessive nitrogen levels to fall by over 30%. These are ambitious targets, the achievement of which will bring exponential environmental benefits.
The strategy will of course have to be applied effectively.
The Commission has promised to propose measures at European Union level to improve ambient air.
This will also address the problem of cross-border pollution.
The strategy on air describes some of the related Community measures.
The Commission has already tabled a proposal to reduce emissions from passenger cars and vans, often referred to as the Euro V proposal, and the Committee on the Environment recently approved its draft report.
A Euro VI proposal is expected for cars and vans.
Other Euro VI proposals will also be tabled for lorries and buses and the directive on national upper emission limits will also be reviewed, setting new emission limits for the Member States.
Other measures for small-scale combustion and farming will follow when the time is right.
All these measures are currently being prepared and will of course be evaluated in detail in accordance with the principles of better lawmaking.
One of the main elements of the strategy is the proposed review of current legislation on ambient air quality.
The proposal maintains the current limit values for air quality.
The official statistics of the World Health Organisation clearly confirm that these limit values are needed.
The proposal introduces for the first time binding limits for small thin particles known as PM2.5, in other words particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 millionths of a metre.
Scientists unanimously maintain that these particles have serious repercussions on public health.
Maximum permissible concentration limits are proposed for entry into force in 2010.
The proposal will, at the same time, require the Member States to start monitoring these thin particles carefully in all European countries.
Measures will also be taken with a view to reducing the average levels of exposure to micro particles of the population.
Approval of these measures must not be delayed.
The repercussions on health are extremely serious and the data are incontrovertible.
In the United States, PM2.5 targets have applied since 1995.
The statistics included in the study on the repercussions of this proposal prove that the approach we propose of reducing exposure to micro particles will benefit more people at a lower cost that the lower PM2.5 limit proposed by Parliament.
The Commission proposal also gives the Member States greater flexibility as far as their compliance with current limit values for air quality is concerned.
Uncontrolled emissions from natural sources are not included in the figures.
A longer deadline will also be granted in cases where the Member States face acute compliance problems.
These extensions must be as short as possible, in order to protect the health of our fellow citizens and not penalise the Member States which have made serious and credible efforts to comply.
I shall comment very briefly on some of the basic amendments proposed by Parliament: as regards the possibility of extending deadlines, the Commission proposes an additional five years from the date on which the limit values enter into force, in other words no later than the end of 2009, in conjunction with the facility to exclude emissions from natural sources.
With these arrangements, the Member States will clearly be in a position to comply with the directive.
The Committee on the Environment has proposed two five-year periods from the date on which the new directive enters into force.
Under this proposal, compliance will be delayed to 2018 for limit values already agreed in 1999.
This cannot be accepted.
The new amendment tabled before this plenary, AmendmentÂ 81, is a move in the right direction, but again cannot be accepted because, if we accept four plus two years from the entry into force of the new directive, this will delay compliance until 2013 for the limit values for PM10 already agreed in 1999.
In other words, the Member States already recognised these limits back in 1999.
Under the decision by the Council and Parliament on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, the Commission asked experts from the World Health Organisation to advise if the limit values which currently apply for air quality need to be changed.
They replied that they did not.
The Commission cannot, therefore, accept any watering down of the daily limit value for PM10.
Amendments 46 and 81 increase the number of days on which this value may be exceeded from 35 to 55.
If these amendments were to be accepted, then according to the statistics for 2004, there would no longer be any need for measures to combat air pollution in cities such as Vienna, Frankfurt, Bonn, Stuttgart and others.
The basic question is: how can we best serve the health of our citizens?
By watering down the daily limit value or by taking measures to combat the problem of pollution?
The amendment watering down the limit values likewise cannot be accepted, unless it is preceded by new Community measures to reduce pollution.
It conflicts with the right of initiative of the institutions.
It is also impracticable, because it is impossible to predict the results of measures which have not yet been proposed and, in this case, would undermine the right of the citizens to clean air.
I think I must stop here.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the European Peopleâs Party and Socialist Groups, MrsÂ Weisgerber and MrsÂ Corbey, for their cooperation, but I also want to thank the Commission and both the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies of the Council for their openness and willingness to engage in dialogue.
That there is not always complete agreement about everything, whether within this House or between one institution and another, should become the norm in European democracy, for what really matters is that we, although we approach it from different angles and with different priorities, should have one single end in mind, that being that air quality in Europe should be improved.
That many respiratory diseases and the consequences resulting from them are attributable to high levels of air pollution, particularly in densely-populated areas and conurbations in the EU, is not disputed.
Polluted air takes no account of borders, and so improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge.
The problem of air pollution can only be solved in the long term and in a European framework, particularly by stepping up cross-border measures.
In order for the ambitious goals to be achieved, further instruments will be needed in the Community in future: clean air in the Member States can only be achieved if the directives which are in force are transposed consistently and if new EU legislative proposals concentrate on restricting emissions at the point where polluters cause them.
While there is justifiable concern about the state of ambient air in Europe, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that air quality in Europe has, over the past decades, been improved as a result of stringent legal regulation and technical advances.
Prior to the July vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and looking forward to the vote we are about to take in this plenary, all three of the main groups in this House negotiated a package of compromise amendments, which can be summed up as aiming for, on the one hand, ambitious limit and target values, with, on the other, greater flexibility and consideration of the difficulties that individual Member States face with the transposition of the current directive.
Let me briefly sketch out the essential points.
I will start with PM10.
There is a large degree of consensus in this House about the lack of ambition inherent in allowing the 40Â microgram annual average value for PM10 to remain unchanged after 2010.
This value is already adhered to in most European cities.
The Commission had already announced a more stringent annual average value for PM10 with effect from 2010, but, as this present proposal makes no reference to it, the three big groups propose that the threshold value for PM10 be reduced to 33Â micrograms with effect from 2010.
I have to say, Commissioner, that I find it remarkable, in view of the criticism that these compromises attract, that you continually neglect to make this very point.
Where the PM10 annual limit values are concerned, there is a marked downward turn.
I would like to point out that this is not an example of the dilution of limit values that has attracted such strong criticism from the environmental organisations.
The daily limit value for PM10, according to which 50Â micrograms may be exceeded on at most 35 days in the year, has come in for forthright criticism from many Members, but the fact is that there is no correlation between the current daily and annual threshold values, and, moreover, the figure of 35 days is arbitrary.
Nobody in this House would doubt the importance of carrying out daily measurements and informing at-risk groups of increased concentrations of pollutants.
On the other hand, no credible scientist has as yet claimed that the daily limit value is more relevant to health policy than the annual one.
The problems cities have with compliance with the daily limit value are no secret, and we abandon municipalities to a sort of organised helplessness.
It has now been demonstrated that compliance with daily limit values is completely unrelated to any clean air measures, but rather largely dependent on chance meteorological phenomena.
The Committee on the Environment and the three main groups in this House endorse the compromise proposal according to which the cities and municipalities affected would, in tandem with a reduction in the annual limit value of approximately 20%, be allowed â albeit only subject to certain conditions â rather more flexibility and permitted to comply with a limit value on a maximum of 55 rather than 35 days.
There may be those who will have their doubts about the correlation between the daily and annual limit values proposed by this House, but nobody can claim with any seriousness that we are thereby being any less ambitious than the Commission and the Council.
Let me now turn to PM2.5, the smallest particles, which are, according to all the experts, the source of the greatest hazards to health.
However, the data obtained in Europe on PM2.5 are as yet uncertain, and most Member States have had insufficient experience with measurements of it.
We therefore propose a two-stage regulation for PM2.5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 onwards, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20Â micrograms; this too, is more ambitious than what the Council and the Commission are proposing.
A majority in this House agrees that the 25Â microgram annual average value as proposed by the Commission is lacking in ambition and that we should therefore reduce it.
In its proposal, the Commission opted for an overall reduction of 20% for PM2.5 without undertaking any further impact assessment relating to the practical actions and costs resulting from it for each individual Member State.
Like my fellow members of the committee, I am persuaded that a graduated model, with Member States being treated differently and greater account taken of previous achievements, is in any case preferable to aiming for a reduction across the board.
Let me just say something about ArticleÂ 20.
I could understand the Commissionâs and outside bodies' criticisms of the 5+5 rule â which aims to institute a time delay in order to enable the limit values to be reached.
We have put together a new package called â4+2â, which represents a move towards the position taken by the Commission, which, as we know, is proposing a five-year period.
I would like to reiterate air quality in Europe will be achieved only in the long term and only by means of actions targeting the problem at source, that is, the causes of pollution.
I look to the Commission in expectation of the proposals that it has announced for reducing pollution at its source.
Â Â  Thank you very much, MrÂ Krahmer.
You do, however, present me with a slight problem.
Your speech was very interesting â I believe that Parliament as a whole can testify to that â but you have exceeded your two minutes and ten seconds of speaking time.
Let me make it quite clear that I will be unable to extend the same generosity towards all of the Members here.
I apologise in advance for this and I hope that each Member will try to keep to his or her speaking time.
You were the first parliamentary speaker of the sitting, so we shall just treat this as an act of kindness on the part of the presidency.
Â Â  . Mr President, whilst I assume this generous gesture applies to the second speaker from the floor today, I shall attempt to keep it brief.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start with a brief word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for this topic, MrÂ Krahmer, MrsÂ Weisgerber and MrÂ Wijkman, along with all other shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this positive outcome.
Air quality is a major health problem and when, more than six months ago, I started to look into it in depth, I was shocked by just how great it turned out to be.
Europeans die some nine months prematurely on account of air quality, and 350Â 000 people die ten years prematurely.
Millions of people suffer from asthma and related disorders.
Bad air quality does not affect everyone in the same way.
People who live in large cities, along motorways, children and the elderly are the worst affected.
In addition, air pollution, and the acid rain that results from it, represent a major environmental problem in large swathes of Europe, particularly in Scandinavia.
It is for that reason, Commissioner, that we expect firm policy to curb air pollution and that is why we are disappointed with the proposals you have put forward.
MrÂ Krahmerâs report, and my own, are above all an indictment of the attitude of indifference where air pollution is concerned.
We demand, in fact, three political changes.
First of all stricter standards; secondly, that more attention be given to implementation; and, thirdly, action to address the problem of air pollution at source.
Turning to the standards first, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls, in both reports, for a more ambitious approach, and that is something that is desperately needed.
In the thematic strategy, the level of ambition opted for lies between A, B and C and the Maximum Technically Feasible Reduction scenario.
All impact assessment studies indicate that even the maximum scenario is still cost-effective and that the ideal scenario lies between B and C. Nevertheless, the Commission, incidentally without any further explanation, has chosen level of ambition A+, which, in terms of public health, is an incomprehensible choice.
A higher level of ambition is possible, as the United States has proven, and is also very cost-effective, as is evident from all studies that underpin it.
Whilst the proposals that are tabled in my report may be a few billions more expensive, they yield definite health gains.
They are also a definite incentive for innovation.
In the directive, the Commission proposes a new form for the finer particles, PM2.5.
The finest particles are most harmful to health and the standard is also more precise, because the smallest particles contain fewer natural sources such as sea salt and desert sand.
PM2.5 is therefore a better measure, although the way in which the Commission has fleshed it out is very disappointing.
Parliament has demanded a target and limit value of 20 Âµg/m3 for PM2.5.
This is considerably better than the 25 Âµg which the Commission and Council back, but still worse than the 15 Âµg in the United States and the 10 Âµg recommended by the World Health Organisation.
I am, in fact, very interested to see how the Commission will integrate the level of ambition selected for the strategy by Parliament in future legislation and in the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive.
Would you be in a position to say anything on this matter, Commissioner?
Will you now follow Parliamentâs example and opt for a level of ambition that lies between B and C?
Better standards are needed, as I said before, but that is only one of the three pillars.
Our second pillar is attention for implementation.
To date, efforts on the part of the Member States have not been altogether convincing.
Only four Member States are in full compliance with the limit values as specified in the present directive.
It is up to the Commission to ensure that these are observed, and that is also necessary, because air pollution is a cross-border problem.
Since half of the Netherlandsâ air pollution is imported from abroad, it cannot possibly make the air cleaner on its own, and it must be able to rely on the Belgian, British and German Governments making every effort to tackle air pollution.
Conversely, the Netherlands exports an awful lot of pollution, and that is why the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Belgium must be able to count on the Netherlands pulling out all the stops to make the air cleaner.
So far, the Commission has not reacted very convincingly to Member States that exceed the standards.
By introducing new provisions in the directive, the Committee on the Environment is hoping to galvanise the Commission into taking a more active role.
Member States will be under a clear obligation to make efforts.
Some countries need more time to achieve the limit values than others.
I can go along with that, as long as they make the effort, and no exceptions without efforts.
Only adequate efforts warrant exceptions.
Exceptions are not, as the Commission proposal suggests, a premium for âdoing nothingâ, and AmendmentÂ 66 bears this out.
The third pillar is an ambitious source policy.
Without source policy, without policy to make cars, freight traffic, shipping and industry cleaner, it is extremely difficult for the Member States, and certainly for the densely populated Member States, to make the air cleaner.
That is why air quality can be improved only by bringing traffic and industry to a standstill.
Those are Draconian and, at the same time, not very effective measures.
It will be the lower authorities, rather than anyone else, that will be asked to foot the bill, and that, of course, is unacceptable.
Serious source policy has a positive impact on air, the environment and public health, but ultimately also cuts down on energy and benefits the climate on account of reduced CO2 emissions.
It is also conducive to innovation: cleaner and more economical cars, for example, sell better.
That is why the Committee on the Environment wishes to include in the directive ArticleÂ 30A, which demands source policy by 2010.
That is why the strategy proposes an interinstitutional agreement in which source policy can be enshrined.
Moreover, Member States must, if there is no source policy, be able to take their own source measures outside of the market.
Air pollution is a serious problem, but the good news is that it can be resolved, provided we are willing to display the political will.
The Committee on the Environment has, in my view, laid down a firm basis with these three pillars.
In the new compromise, we have also given teeth to matters as they stand and improved them, and I am once again indebted to everyone who has made a contribution, particularly MrÂ Krahmer, MrsÂ Weisgerber and MrÂ Wijkman.
With stricter standards, more attention for implementation and source policy, we have made a few major policy changes.
This approach stands for a new Europe, close to the people, with a view to implementing legislation by national and local governments, with innovation in mind.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, the constructive negotiations with the rapporteurs have brought about a sustainable compromise.
If we are to achieve our main goal, that of effective and lasting improvement in air quality, it is vital that we establish limit values, but they, on their own, cannot improve the quality of the air; that can be done only through effective action to deal with emissions, such as the EuroÂ 5 emissions standard that has already been proposed and which makes soot particle filters mandatory for new vehicles.
It is primarily from the Commission that we demand further measures, in the shape, for example, of rules on residential combustion sources, EuroÂ 6 for HGVs and Europe-wide limit values for shipsâ engines.
Generally speaking, we want to get away from actions that grab headlines but are no more than short-term and temporary, in favour of long-term measures that, by addressing the problem at its source, protect health more effectively.
That is why our annual limit values, at 33Â milligrams per square metre, are more ambitious than the Commissionâs, and why we want more flexibility at the local level when it comes to daily limit values, which have been demonstrated to be largely subject to meteorological influences, since it is a proven fact that it is long-term exposure that is the most dangerous, and that is what we have to focus on.
By reducing the annual limit values for particulates we seek to create incentives for long-term and sustainable projects such as environmental zones or the introduction of soot filters.
More rigorous annual limit values and the effective reduction of long-term pollution brings people more benefits than closing a road for twenty-four hours.
At national and local level, too, everything proportionate and necessary must be done to improve air quality, and we are creating the right incentives for that as well.
Local authorities will have their deadlines extended to a maximum of six years only if they can produce action programmes that show that they have, within the bounds of proportionality, taken every step in their power to improve air quality; moreover, this concession will not be granted to all of them, but only to those that demonstrably have to contend with particularly unfavourable meteorological conditions brought on, among other things, by being located in basins.
These clear messages are precisely what this compromise is about, and it thereby constitutes an even-handed and effective way of giving public health the protection it needs.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I agree with the rapporteur that this directive will not bring us any closer to the objective of good ambient air quality.
It is a good thing that fine particles, the fine PM2.5 particles in fact, are included in the directive, and that binding limit values are to be set for them.
The limit value proposed by the Commission and supported by the Council is 20Â micrograms, as has been mentioned more than once here.
It has also been mentioned that Parliament is calling for a more stringent value.
This is all very well, but if we compare this proposal to the needs which, for example, the World Health Organisation has proposed and which would get us to a situation where we would no longer be causing harm to human health or having an adverse effect on natureâs levels of tolerance, this limit value is just too high.
The WHO is proposing 10Â micrograms, and, as has been said here, in the United States of America and Canada they have already achieved a value of 15.
Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in Europe, and people are exposed to it.
Here someone mentioned a figure of 360Â 000-400Â 000 premature deaths a year.
Whatever the figure is, it is very large.
The limit value that is set can have a genuine impact on the number of human lives that can be saved.
If this recommendation by the WHO were to come into force, the figure would be several tens of thousands.
With the limit values now being proposed, we would reach a figure of just a few thousand lives.
Parliament, however, is calling for more stringent limit values for these smaller particles, which I endorse.
I do not, however, endorse the fact that the deadline for implementation is to be extended.
I hope that we will be able to improve on that.
I am rapporteur for the last phase of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
It set relatively ambitious aims, and that applies to air quality too.
Its objective was to ensure that we no longer cause harm to human health.
Now it has to be said that with this first legislative thematic strategy, which is meant to fulfil the aims of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, we will not achieve the targets contained in it.
This will also water down the targets we settled on in the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
Â Â  . Mr President, the importance of clean air is, of course, beyond dispute, and it is also clear that its benefits largely outweigh the costs.
The aim of this legislation â and I am mainly focusing on the draft directive â is therefore commendable, and I am particularly supportive of MrÂ Krahmerâs attempts to make it as workable as possible.
We should nevertheless question, though, whether we in the European Union are on the right track and whether the legislation we are drafting is not symbolic.
Why am I saying this?
While we want to impose strict requirements on Member States, they even fail to meet the old air quality standards.
Since the entry into effect of the Air Quality Directive in 2005, which specifies ceilings for PM10 dust particles, ten Member States have failed to meet the requirements.
Even before 2005, it should have been obvious to the Commission that Member States would not meet the limit values without a systematic source policy involving restrictions on exhaust fumes from cars, lorries and ships.
Between 2002 and 2004, approximately 96% of the cities exceeded the daily standards, and the annual standards were exceeded in various regions in southern Europe, the Benelux countries and in Germany, as well as in central and eastern Europe, accounting for some 73% of the cities.
Without source measures, that were often announced years ago by the Commission, stricter or less strict values for PM10 or PM2.5 serve no purpose whatsoever, and I am not even talking about nitrogen.
Without source measures, Member States will be unable to comply with the limit values, and I am of course delighted to hear the Commissioner confirm that they will produce all those source measures, but not just yet.
There is phenomenal opposition to this policy in the Commission, and, in fact, also in this House.
Local short-term measures are ineffective.
Effective policy must focus on long-term measures, and must therefore also include source policy, which this, however, does not.
The object of the legislation is commendable, but the path chosen to reach it is questionable.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said, air pollution kills more than 300Â 000 Europeans prematurely every year.
Experts in environmental health have said that the Commissionâs proposal was bewilderingly inadequate, but will the European Parliament now give cause for even greater bewilderment?
The majority on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are actually proposing that current legislation should be made less stringent.
It postponed entry into force by more than 10 years, and would double the number of days when limit values for pollution can be exceeded, from 30 to 55 a year.
It offered the excuse that in the distant future yearly limit values would come down from 40 to 30 micrograms per cubic metre.
This is only an apparent improvement, however, as the current limit value, if it may be exceeded on more than 35 days, in practice represents an annual average of 30Â micrograms.
It is a falsehood that companies with daily limit values would have a negligible impact on health.
On the contrary, the hospitals always have more heart patients coming in when daily pollution levels have been exceeded.
This scandalous suggestion by the Committee on the Environment was justified by saying that the Member States could not do any better.
The Member States themselves in the Council, however, have provisionally agreed on a tougher line, where postponement would only be for three years.
Following this preliminary display of agreement in the Council, the three largest groups made a more spruced up compromise proposal, which would nevertheless still postpone the entry into force of norms for longer than that in the proposal by the EC Council of Ministers.
It has been awful to witness how the negotiators in certain groups have taken guidance from the automotive industry.
It will be a shame indeed if Parliamentâs largest groups succumb to pressure from lobbies in the car industry.
Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you not to agree to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment or MrsÂ Weisgerber and others to postpone the entry into force of legislation, but to stand up for the rights of our citizens to breathe clean air.
Â Â  Air pollution causes major public health problems within the European Union.
The Commissionâs own calculations show that getting on for 370Â 000 premature deaths per year are caused by emissions into the air.
Particulate emissions are the most important cause of these premature deaths, to which should be added all the health problems that affect people with asthma or allergies of one kind or another, children being an especially vulnerable group.
Air pollution also creates major environmental problems in the form of eutrophication, acidification and ground-level ozone.
There are clear reasons in terms of health and the environment for placing a strict limit on these emissions.
Socio-economic calculations lead to the same conclusion.
Society would benefit significantly by avoiding these costs linked to emissions.
The Commissionâs proposed thematic strategy and proposal for a directive on better air quality are therefore a disappointment.
The level of ambition is very low.
Once again, we have been given sad confirmation that an ambitious environmental policy is not a priority for this European Commission.
Unfortunately, the draft reports produced by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety are also inadequate compromises.
The decisions proposed in them are quite simply not good enough to provide real remedies to the problems.
We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have therefore tabled a number of amendments with a view to making the proposals for directives more stringent.
There are a number of purposes behind these various amendments.
Firstly, we wish to remove the very generous exemptions that Member States would be allowed and as a result of which we should have to wait an unnecessary number of years before seeing the directive implemented in practice.
Where the exposure reduction target is concerned, we believe that this should be binding, and we believe that it can be increased to 25%.
When it comes to the concentration cap for particles, we wish to reduce this to ten micrograms, so putting it at the same level as that recommended for industrialised countries by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
We also believe that the same requirements for low levels of pollution should be imposed everywhere, irrespective of natural sources of emissions.
Otherwise, environments of different quality would be required for different people, dependent on where they happened to live.
That is our position.
Mr President, I want to use the last half-minute to say a personal thank you.
Tomorrow, I am standing down as a Member of the European Parliament, so this is my last speech in the House.
I wish to thank those fellow Members with whom I have worked during the last 11 years.
It has been a pleasure to have been able to work in this House.
I also wish to thank Parliamentâs services and, above all, the interpreters.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, I am very moved that I am here for this moment.
I can assure you â and I am speaking on behalf of all of the Members here â that we are very satisfied with your participation in all of our debates.
You have been a Member of this Parliament for a very long time, and a Member who is well-liked, not just within your group, but far beyond, as I can testify.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should also like to wish Mr SjÃ¶stedt well for the future.
As a Member of the Committee on Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety I support the strategy on air quality that has been set out by the Commission.
That strategy sets out a series of health and environmental objectives and emissions reduction targets for the main pollutants.
It calls on the Commission to bring forward a range of sector-based initiatives, including the following: reducing emissions from shipping; reducing emissions of ammonia from agricultural use; the extension of integrated pollution prevention and control measures for smaller units; more stringent emissions standards for vehicles, and the implementation of a national emissions ceiling directive.
We all recognise the significant benefits that accrue from reduced air pollution and we support cost-effective integrated approaches to achieving improvements in air quality.
Undoubtedly greater investment in renewable energies and in the biofuel sector will also help to create a cleaner environment.
My report on the future of the biofuels industry was recently strongly approved by the Environment Committee.
Key points that I made in that report included the following: biofuels emit between 40% and 80% fewer greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels; biofuels offer new sources of income for farmers via sustainable and multifunctional agriculture of the kind the common agricultural policy purports to promote.
The European Union should be ambitious in the strategies it pursues to promote the use of biofuels.
We must stimulate a greater demand for biofuels in Europe and we must guarantee that the seventh EU R[amp]D Framework Programme for the period 2007 to 2013 is geared heavily towards the promotion of the biofuels sector within EU Member States.
I believe that we can all recognise the potential of renewable energy as an important means to boost employment and create added value in rural areas.
The decoupling of income support from production introduced by the 2003 common agricultural policy reform will help to facilitate the supply of energy crops.
The advent of biofuels is good news for the agricultural sector in Europe and in Ireland and it is good news for the medium- to long-term protection of our environment.
We need firm action in the European Union to promote the biofuels sector.
We know the importance of that sector.
We know of the environmental benefits, so let us now go and collectively meet that challenge.
Â Â  . Mr President, in no other Member State has air quality been the subject of such a discussion as in my own country.
As I see it, the problems that are current in the Netherlands should also be evident in nearly all other Member States, certainly in the urban areas.
The agreement that has been reached between the political groups throws open the possibility for delay, rightly so, before the limit values for PM10 start taking effect, and I shall be advising my group to vote in favour of it.
I should, in fact, like to draw your particular attention to AmendmentÂ 76, because it is my belief that the agreement â and, I think, wrongly â has taken no account of the position of nitrogen oxide.
I should like to ask the Members to support that amendment.
I should now like to turn to Commissioner Dimas.
So far, Commissioner, you have always claimed that the Commission cannot agree to the idea of a possible delay in combination with new measures from the Commission.
You will notice tomorrow that you have a broad majority facing you.
You also undoubtedly read the report last week compiled by the Institute for European Environmental Policy, which states that combining the two would be a very good thing.
Is there really no chance of you meeting us half-way in this?
Finally, of course, a word of thanks to both rapporteurs.
I know it can be very tricky to negotiate all the difficulties in an issue as sensitive as this, but I think you managed it really well, and that is why we are indebted to you both.
MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, many thanks for the good teamwork; God bless.
Â Â  () I would like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work on this important topic.
Air pollution is known to reduce average life expectancy by as much as nine months.
More than half of Europeans are living in conditions where the daily concentration limit is exceeded more than 35 times a year.
In the European Union the situation is worst in Benelux, northern Italy, and in the new Member States.
Air pollution is the cause of multiple respiratory and other diseases.
Under ArticleÂ 152 of the European Community Treaty, public health falls under the purview of the Member States, and the European Union has only limited powers in this regard; hence it is necessary to look for ways to enable the European Union to act indirectly, that is, by means of other policies, in order to improve health.
Improving air quality is undoubtedly an example of such policies.
If the Member States and, especially, the new Member States for which EU law is still aÂ new legal area and which are facing major economic problems, are required to implement aÂ Framework Directive in their respective legal systems, along with four more pieces of legislation, three daughter directives and a Council Decision, it is clear that implementation will be fraught with difficulties, errors and incompleteness.
The public will find it difficult to identify the binding EU standards of air quality.
I therefore greatly appreciate the fact that the proposed draft will simplify the existing legislation by as much as 50%.
The European Union needs long-term goals, strict controls and checks as to whether the Member States are properly implementing the Directive.
On the other hand, the EU should adopt standards that are transparent and that focus more on limiting emissions by polluters.
The targets set in the legislation, be it PM10 or PM2.5, or the date on which the Directive will come into force, should be ambitious but realistic.
Failing that, we expose ourselves to the risk of non-compliance by the Member States.
In this regard it is important to realise that even the most earnest activities on the part of the European Union will be in vain unless the EU is engaged in global cooperation, since air pollution will then be imported, and we will not be in a position to prevent that.
Â Â  Mr President, if you want to know why we are having this debate, come with me down Oxford Street, in my constituency of London, where you can smell, taste and feel the air pollution that we seek to tackle.
An earlier generation was faced with smog and it tackled that with Clean Air Acts, which stopped coal burning in homes, in industries and on railways.
Now we face the challenge of fine particles and the respiratory and cardiovascular effect that has on our constituents: the extra medication, the millions of lost working days each year and premature deaths.
In my constituency, 1Â 000Â people die prematurely as a result of pollution and another 1Â 000Â are sent to hospital.
It is now estimated that PM2.5 pollution is responsible for reducing our life expectancy by some eight months.
That is the challenge.
That is why we need to tackle pollution at source in relation to cars and heavy vehicles, ships, agricultural feed, energy-using products and so forth. However, we also need to tackle it through this directive, simplifying the previous legal instruments while bringing in this new standard for the smaller particles, the 2.5s, because we know those are the most dangerous to human health.
We need a robust directive and the Commissioner is right to remind us that we must not go back on things already agreed.
My delegation will certainly vote for standards that are challenging, that are effective and that will be implemented sooner rather than later.
I thank the two rapporteurs who brought this through the committee to this plenary and I wish the Commissioner well in his work. May I also wish well Mr SjÃ¶stedt, our friend and colleague from the Environment Committee.
As he takes his environmental credentials across the ocean, may we hope that he influences the Americans too, to ensure they understand the need for environmental measures of this sort.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteurs for the work they have put in and for their capacity for compromise, which is reflected in these compromise amendments.
Air quality is a yardstick for quality of life.
Every year in the European Union, over 300Â 000 people die prematurely as a result of particulates, an intolerable state of affairs that must be brought to an end, and so it is to be welcomed that a strategy is being developed and the directive on air quality and clean air in Europe rolled out.
The main concern where improvement of air quality is concerned has to do with the limit values for PM10 and PM2.5 particles.
On 21Â June, the Committee on the Environment, Public Heath and Food Safety expressed itself in favour of ambitious limit values for these.
What is of significance for the EUâs Member States is that not only the limit values for good air quality are defined, but that the means should also be devised for ensuring compliance with them, and I would give the EuroÂ 5 emissions standard for private motor vehicles as an example of this.
As well as the instruments, the time element also plays a vital part in compliance with the limit values; even if more stringent limit values for private motor vehicles are laid down immediately, it will take some time for the number of environmentally-friendly motor vehicles on European roads to increase.
The compromises on which we are to vote guarantee more stringent limit values and a realistic time frame, making it possible for the instruments to work and the limit values to be complied with.
Laying down ambitious limit values for air quality and developing instruments for ensuring that they are complied with can improve air quality, and hence also quality of life, in Europe for years to come, and that is what we must aim to do.
Finally, I must also extend thanks to Mr Jonas SjÃ¶stedt, who, as a shadow rapporteur, worked with me at the end of the negotiations on the EuroÂ 5 standard.
I have not been here very long â only ten months â but I can tell you, Jonas, that you have in this time become a dear colleague to me.
I wish you much success in your further career, and all the best.
Â Â  Mr President, I am not on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but, like Mr Bowis, I represent London, the city traditionally known as the âBig Smokeâ.
Londonâs air today is still very polluted and is amongst the worst of any city in Europe.
EU air pollution limits are significantly exceeded along Londonâs major road network, in Central London and around Heathrow Airport, where nitrogen dioxide is 50% above the limit, due to a combination of aeroplanes and vehicles.
I welcome much that is positive in the new proposals and the Krahmer report, such as the streamlining of the law, greater public accessibility to monitoring results, new limits for fine particulates and stricter ones for other pollutants.
However, I am very concerned about the effect in my city of postponing the deadlines, perhaps until 2018 instead of 2010, for hot spots.
Londoners would be asked to trust the British Government or the Mayor of London to seek postponement when it is genuinely impossible to meet the 2010 deadlines.
However, surely it comes down to political will to cut road and air traffic.
One barrier between the UK Government and its goal of bulldozing through a third runway at Heathrow is EU air-quality limits, in particular nitrogen dioxide.
I fear a long postponement will allow it to wriggle round those limits.
I am surprised and somewhat disappointed that MEPs are being less progressive than EU governments, at least on the issue of deadlines.
It is the first time in seven years in this House that I have found the Council more progressive than the European Parliament.
I hope, for the sake of Londoners, that we will stick to deadlines that are as tight as possible.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, if we want to combat air pollution effectively and to get results in the area of health, then we have to adopt far more ambitious drafts in this House.
The poor excuse about certain Member States encountering difficulties in implementing environmental legislation is no longer acceptable, because peopleâs health is no longer a matter for negotiation.
The cost of diseases caused by air pollution is rising on a daily basis.
The fact is that it is the authorities that are currently picking up the bill for health care, as the cost of this is not yet integrated into our budgets.
What is more, economists estimate that the price of a gallon of oil, which currently stands at USDÂ 3, will have to be increased to USDÂ 10 in order to integrate the cost of health care and climate change.
That is what would profoundly change the situation.
The Union must not grow weak, Commissioner, on environmental policy, as its cunning game of simplifying and merging the European legal texts would suggest that it has a tendency to do.
That is why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance is calling for more binding approaches, particularly in relation to PMÂ 2.5, and for the abolition of the derogations.
The threat of an environmental disaster that hangs over us, ladies and gentlemen, requires drastic measures, and an example of this comes for once from the United States, where the State of California has provided food for thought by lodging a complaint against the largest car manufacturers for damage to the environment and public health.
Finally, I would like to say a few words to our dear friend, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt.
I believe that we are going to miss your perspective on matters at the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but we wish you well on the other side of the border, on the other side of the European Union.
Take along with you, too, the message about protecting nature.
Thank you.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, although pollutants in the air are difficult to see, they do nonetheless jeopardise our health.
I need only say that the cost to the national health of these illnesses exceeds 10% of the gross national product.
As far as the derogations are concerned, the best solution would be for there to be none.
I should like at this point to emphasise our support for the relevant amendment, AmendmentÂ 73 by Mr Jonas SjÃ¶stedt; if this amendment is rejected, AmendmentÂ 54 by MrsÂ Hassi safeguards the minimum period of time during which derogations will be permitted.
We should emphasise that reducing the upper limit for concentrations of PM2.5 will certainly benefit European citizens.
However, recent studies have shown that a reduction in the order of 25 Âµg/m3 would only reduce premature deaths by 4Â 500 whereas, if the reduction extended to 15 or 10 Âµg/m3, as the World Health Organisation proposes, premature deaths would be reduced by 13Â 000 and 22Â 000 respectively.
It should be noted that one of the strongest points of legislation on air quality is that the limit value of 50 Âµg/m3 for maximum concentrations of PM10 must not be exceeded more than 35 times.
The amendments supporting an increase in the number of days on which the limit may be exceeded from 35 to 55 significantly water down the directive, on the one hand and, on the other hand, do nothing to safeguard protection for public health and on this point I absolutely agree with the Commissioner.
We owe you a debt of gratitude, Jonas, and I personally extend you my especial thanks, because you taught me a great deal as a new MEP here.
Good luck for the future.
Â Â  MrÂ President, in the one minute I have at my disposal, I would like to point out that the Directive on air quality in Europe, together with amendments which significantly tighten up standards, treat the Member States that have only recently joined the Union on an equal footing as the so-called old Fifteen.
The latter, however, have been implementing methods of reducing emissions of pollutants for a considerable time.
According to estimates by the Polish Ministry of the Environment, we need an investment in excess of PLNÂ 50Â billion if we are to comply with the requirements laid down in the Directive.
There would also be a significant increase in social and economic costs.
For the poorer social classes, the increased cost of living could neutralise any benefits gained from better air quality.
Their standard of living would fall as a result of poor diet, inability to access health care, and inability to maintain basic standards of hygiene, along with other environmental factors contributing to good health.
âCleaner air for Europeâ â other approaches will not deal with the issue in the short term.
That is why we are in favour of extending the time period in which the standards are to be met, especially for the new Member States.
It is also the reason why we are opposed to stricter conditions for derogations.
We shall vote against the restrictive amendments.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, my dear Jonas, I think the compromise we have reached here is a good one, with its combination of demanding targets and flexible apparatus.
That is a good decision, combined as it is with a statement to the effect that there will be no free rides for those who â even if perhaps not by their own free choice â take no action on this front.
The transport industry, for example, is set to grow by 60% over the next 20 years.
Everyone who has spoken today has mentioned the importance of a clean environment, and that is why this does not just concern car manufacturers, but also the builders of heating systems; it has to do with power-generating plant and with loading systems â with, indeed, a really big and wide-ranging area that has to be addressed.
The industry must come to understand that standards of this kind are ultimately an opportunity for it to sell modern technology throughout the world, and that is why car industries, and the manufacturers of other industrial equipment as well, must realise that these standards present them, today, with an opportunity to develop new technologies and work at research and innovation.
This directive will also lead us to ask who, in future, will be researching into better fuels, for renewable fuels are not the only crucial issue; the question also arises of what fuels we are actually using now.
If you put that question to the motor industry, the answer you will get is that they are not of high quality, but rather deficient.
Heavy demands have been made of the car industry over recent years, but it has always had to run cars on relatively low-quality fuels, and that is something that must change over the next few years.
In ten or fifteen yearsâ time we will be able to drive, using a litre of fuel, five times as far as we do today, and that is what makes innovation and research so significant; that, too, is why demanding environmental standards are called for.
My dear Jonas, you have been a good colleague and have become a good friend.
I wish you all the best for the future.
Â Â  Mr President, everyone has the right to a clean and healthy environment and nobody should endanger the health and lives of other people.
This principle should be the cornerstone not just of our environmental policy, but of our would-be Constitution as well.
People have the right to clean air, and politicians and industrialists have the responsibility to guarantee that right.
Some decades ago, industry was the main cause of air pollution and the diseases connected with it.
With technological changes, industry became less polluting but, as the number of cars increased, the situation did not improve.
Eighty per cent of our citizens live in cities and for them the main cause of air pollution is traffic. During the PSE Group hearing on air pollution, we had clear evidence of this.
If we want to provide cleaner air for our citizens, we should change our traffic policy in cities.
In cities with polluted air we have to reduce individual car traffic and improve public transport.
The strict pollution reduction targets, as proposed for particulate matter, can only be achieved in that way.
That should be the main target, but we also have to reduce dangerous emissions from cars, with cleaner engines, fuels and filters, as indicated in the Euro 5 and Euro 6 proposals.
When human lives are at stake, wishful thinking and soft recommendations are not enough.
We need binding targets and strict regulations.
Annual and daily limit values are also needed. Limit values must be low and strict but, on the other hand, they should reflect reality.
It is better to lower them step by step than to set up unrealistic measures and allow them to be ignored.
My last words are to Mr SjÃ¶stedt: Jonas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, what the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has come up with is a feeble compromise, nothing more or less than an invitation to inaction, and if it is accepted, Europeâs clean air policy risks becoming a laughing stock.
Many municipalities have already put in place ambitious policy measures for clean air, including such things as modernisation of their car fleets, environmental zones and so on, and so there should be no rewards for inactivity, yet that is precisely what the Committee on the Environmentâs feeble compromise, with its extended deadline, would offer to them and to all those who have failed to do their homework.
Just what do we think European law is for if we reward those who do nothing?
We have been talking about the more stringent standard for PM2.5.
We know that 20 gets us nowhere, and nor does 25, so why not vote for the Greensâ ambitious proposal of 12?
I hope that we manage, tomorrow, to save European clean air policy from being thrown away, for it would be a source of shame if Europe were to cast aside its leadership role and risk denying industry â the motor industry in particular â a future.
Air pollution kills over 350Â 000 people in Europe, 65Â 000 of them in Germany, and so it would be a good thing if we were to do more than just give out hot air.
Â Â  Mr President, I should first of all like to thank MrsÂ Weisgerber, who has shown so much understanding, has listened so much and has also worked out a sound compromise with MrÂ Krahmer and MrsÂ Corbey.
I am indebted to them all.
MrsÂ Corbey, you are in favour of strict and new source policy.
I would like to say to MrsÂ Breyer and MrsÂ Hassi that in order to actually meet the air quality standards, we may be able to lay down strict standards on paper, but if we subsequently do not get the opportunity to achieve those technically speaking, then they are of no value.
Moreover, the Netherlands is being criticised for wishing to speed up the introduction of soot filters.
Well, if all of that is unacceptable, we should not prescribe any strict standards as we cannot meet them.
I also know, and I am once again addressing MrsÂ Hassi when I say this â for MrÂ Blokland and MrÂ Maaten have said many things with which I am in total agreement â I also know why the Netherlands has voted in favour of this legislation.
They did so because it gave them the opportunity of injecting some flexibility into a number of areas.
That is the very reason why they voted in favour.
What can one see, though, when one compares the Councilâs position with that of Parliament?
Whilst the Ministers of the Environment may be able to sleep the sleep of the just for having laid down strict standards, they subsequently get home and are faced with an inquiry by the Environmental Agency which concludes that everything that was laid down on paper cannot be achieved at home at any rate.
We should stop playing politics in that way.
I have run out of excuses back home.
That is also the reason why I endorse every detail of the compromise that was reached here in this House.
âStrictâ it may be, but we, in this House, say âyesâ to that, as long as it remains attainable.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, air quality is one of the keys to the success of sustainable development.
Our fellow citizens know what effects the quality of the air can have on their health.
They are rightly worried when a school is situated near a crossroads with heavy traffic.
Parents are demanding that measures in relation to air quality be implemented because they want to know what kind of air their children are breathing.
The Krahmer report is useful in that it gathers together various texts in just one directive, which should enable us to improve our approach to the problem.
We are therefore trying to be ambitious faced with this issue of air quality.
Yet, in order to know what the quality of the air is, we first have to measure it.
That means relying on organisations that are as close to the area as possible, and that are familiar with the geography of the land being studied: they are the neighbourhood networks.
We know that the displacement of pollution by wind interferes with this.
We also know that mountain ranges have a role to play.
Pollution moves and reaches areas that are not in themselves sources of pollution.
Contrary to what is said in the explanatory statement, high levels of air pollution are not always recorded in densely populated urban areas.
If this European policy is to be clear, however, it must above all be consistent and be part of an integrated approach to combating climate change.
It is not enough to set limit values.
We also need to know what to do with them.
The fight against CO2 emissions is at the heart of the proposed systems.
Allow me to refer to the regulation on motor vehicle emissions, the EuroÂ 5 regulation.
The consequences of applying this regulation are already well known.
If we solve the emissions problem, on the one hand, we increase CO2 emissions, on the other, and, as we know, CO2 emissions are the cause of climate change.
Thus, there are many contradictions in all of that.
We therefore need to be flexible.
There is no use in deciding on strict measures if they cannot be applied in the Member States.
We must therefore take as much time as we need.
I am specifically thinking about a prevention policy that will hinge on urban transport plans and on the development of clean technologies.
Be that as it may, I should like to thank all of the rapporteurs for the compromise they have reached, which seems a good one to me.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the Commission on its proposals and also the rapporteurs on having once again demonstrated their major commitment to the environment.
Of course people want ever cleaner air and a high level of protection.
The very same people say, however â and this has been shown in many surveys â that they are not prepared to foot the bill for such a level of protection, and that means that we have to take a balanced view when adopting measures.
I am surprised at the amount of space that the report devotes to agriculture.
I sincerely believe that it is far too little for a sector that is increasingly beleaguered and which, moreover, fulfils a number of functions that have a positive effect on the environment and social cohesion.
In relation to the maritime transport sector, I agree with the aim of achieving a level playing field, but I also believe it is important to work within the International Maritime Organisation to designate the new sulphur emission control areas; otherwise, we shall drive part of the European fleet to register in non-EU countries where controls are virtually non-existent.
I should also have liked to see rather more ambitious measures regarding vehicles, the prime causes of pollution in cities and of dependence on foreign sources of energy.
I should like to hear the Commissionâs opinion on this, because I believe that cleaner vehicles would dramatically improve air quality in cities.
Lastly, it is important to continue implementing and developing the directive on the integrated prevention and control of pollution.
This directive will allow industries to continue innovating and to control their emissions more effectively, without forcing any plant closures.
To conclude, I would ask the Commission to use flexibility and common sense when implementing all these proposals that have been put to us today.
Â Â  Mr President, as a Hungarian MEP, I am particularly sensitive to the current debate about air pollution.
My place of work, Brussels, as well as my home, Budapest, both figure among the darkest spots on the map of European air pollution.
With regard to suspended particles, for instance, Budapest had already exceeded threshold values within the first four months of the year, and it is not uncommon to see levels rise to 4-5 times the maximum.
This has been going on for many years, without the least sign of improvement.
Yet the harmful effect of fine particles on health is a fact.
A European resident loses on average eight months of his or her life as a result.
In the case of Budapestâs inhabitants, however, this loss is as high as three years.
For this reason, I welcome the new thematic strategy on air pollution, as well as the regulation of fine particles.
However, regulation does not achieve anything if its enforcement is not guaranteed.
We cannot expect local communities to do more than they are really able.
But we must expect them to do at least that much.
It is obvious that air pollution is strongly influenced by numerous external causes, including the weather, for instance.
This does not mean, however, that with proper urban planning and the development of public transport networks, we may not achieve significant improvements.
Thus, it is extremely important that only those communities be given extensions on observing the threshold values which have truly made every possible effort.
We must ensure that not a single European city should experience what is going on in Budapest today; namely that despite the European obligations in this regard for all these years, the municipal government still does not have a strategy for improving air quality.
That is, they do not even have any idea how they might come closer to observing the limits that are so essential for ensuring public health.
It seems to me that we have to offer the citizens of Europe a more attractive alternative than the masks that cyclists in China are compelled to wear.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to thank all the speakers for their important contributions to this discussion.
As a closing remark, I would like to restate the importance of continued action to tackle air pollution.
The adverse health impacts, lost economic productivity and damage to environmental quality are still much too great.
Some have criticised the strategy from one angle, some from another angle.
Some consider that the proposed flexibility goes too far, others think that this flexibility is too little.
We will be reviewing the strategy to see what progress has been made and how much further we can get towards the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme.
I understand the concern expressed by those who want to see more Community pollution abatement measures so that the strategyâs objective and air quality standards can be met.
I think that there is a consensus between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the measures required.
In fact, the Commission has already undertaken much of the preparatory work, the fruits of which will be seen in the months to come.
As a result, I do not believe that there is any need for an interinstitutional agreement in this area.
On Amendments 30 and 81, I understand the concerns of those who call for more flexibility in implementing the existing air quality legislation.
However, one cannot have flexibility without weakening the legislation.
I think the Commissionâs proposal of five years from the entry into force of the limit values strikes the right balance and the Commission cannot support any further weakening beyond that.
By way of explanation, according to the Commission proposal, the time extension will go up to the end of 2009; according to the general approach of the Council it will go up to 2010; and according to the rapporteursâ amendment it will go up to 2013.
So there is a difference on this point.
It is four years plus two from the entry into force of the new directive.
I understand this to be the proposal tabled before this plenary.
On Amendments 46 and 82, I should provide some further clarification about the daily limit value of PM10.
This protects sensitive individuals against the impact from short-term exposure to particles in the air.
It is different from the annual limit value, which provides protection to all from long-term exposure.
One cannot simply substitute a more stringent annual limit value for the daily limit.
This is what the health experts say.
The key to ensuring compliance with both daily and annual limits is to undertake good and timely air quality assessments and to take the necessary steps to reduce emissions.
It is clear that many authorities have not done this and now they have compliance problems.
On Amendments 49 and 50, the proposed concentration cap for PM2.5 is set at a level consistent with the stringency of the annual limit value for PM10, which the Commission is not proposing to change.
It is also useful to remember that the Commission has proposed two ways of tackling PM2.5: the concentration cap of 25 micrograms per cubic metre and the exposure-reduction approach, where average levels in urban areas will be reduced over ten years.
These methods combined will work to deliver health improvements.
Our modelling work, which underpins the thematic strategy and the air quality proposal, shows that greater health improvements can be obtained by allowing the Member States to choose where to reduce pollution levels.
This is the aim of the exposure reduction targets.
This flexibility will be limited if the concentration cap forces Member States to divert resources to ensure compliance in some specific hotspot regions, where few health improvements may be available.
For public health, a general reduction in exposure is preferable.
In summary, on the air quality legislative proposal, I am pleased to say that the Commission can support 32 amendments, in part or in principle.
I shall give Parliamentâs Secretariat a list detailing the Commissionâs position on the amendments(1).
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
The Commission can accept fully, in part, or in principle Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 65 and 80.
The Commission reserves its position on Amendments 54, 56, 58, 61, 62, 63, 66 and 75.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 5, 7, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 43, 46, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 59, 60, 64, 67 to 74, 76 to 79 and 81 to 84.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Hegi on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the thematic strategy on the urban environment. [2006/2061(INI)] (A6-0233/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, some 80 % of our citizens live in urban areas, but their needs and interests are strongly under-represented in Union funds, projects and initiatives.
As regards the level of EU funding, these city dwellers are second-rate citizens of the European Union.
The thematic strategy on the urban environment should be a brave and progressive initiative, not just a lukewarm recommendation of wishful thinking.
Sadly, the Commission document on that subject is rather weak.
The Sixth Environmental Action Plan has set encouraging goals, but this time the Commission failed to propose legally binding measures and deadlines.
The Commission does not attempt to balance European policy between urban and rural areas and does not have any vision for a cleaner urban environment.
I cannot do the job of the whole Commission, but I can at least try to propose some useful measures.
Firstly, I propose that a sustainable urban management plan and a sustainable urban transport plan should be required by Community law for every agglomeration with more than 100Â 000 inhabitants, as proposed by the Commission in 2004.
Representatives of European cities have expressed their satisfaction with my proposal.
Those kinds of binding measures make life easier for environment-conscious city councils, as they have legal bases for action on the environment.
As far as transport is concerned, non-motorised transport should have priority over every other kind of traffic, public transport over private, small and less-polluting cars over other vehicles.
Congestion charging, as used in London and Stockholm, is a success at present.
It is the only possible future for every large European city.
The referendum some days ago in Stockholm showed us that people liked the idea and only a minority of certain lobbyists oppose it.
I am also proposing a 5% shift in passenger kilometre from individual transport â namely cars â to public transport and cycling.
Speed limits in city centres, such as in Graz, Austria, reduce accidents, save lives and reduce air pollution and noise emissions.
Low emission zones are also useful in combating air pollution.
If we really want to do something about climate change, we should act in our cities as well.
As the English say, âcharity begins at homeâ.
That should also apply to sustainable development.
Due to climate change, heatwaves turn many towns and cities into hell during the hot summer days and nights.
Heatwaves kill thousands of European citizens and they die a painful and humiliating death.
Heatwave emergency plans are crucial for most European cities, except in some Nordic communities.
The basic treatment for heatwaves is simple: more water, green roofs and facades, fresh water and natural cooling systems, reducing car traffic.
Hot summers are coming and we should save the lives of city dwellers. We need more green spaces in our cities.
Even some ten square metres of green islands can improve the spirit of a city, together with bigger parks and gardens nearby.
Summertime urban beaches like those in Paris, Brussels and Budapest are also useful projects for those who cannot leave the city on long vacations.
In both old and new Member States, tens of millions of people live in mass-produced, prefabricated housing estates.
In many western cities these have become ethnic and social ghettos.
Complex social, cultural, educational and environmental programmes are needed to rehabilitate those suburbs.
In Central Europe, in Hungary for instance, most of those housing estates have not yet become ghettos. The majority of their dwellers still belong to the lower and middle classes.
In their case, the physical state of the housing is worrying.
In the EU-10 countries the repair and rehabilitation of housing estates is a crucial step forward in preserving social peace and improving city life.
As rapporteur, I accepted many amendments tabled by my colleagues in the PPE-DE Group in the hope of good cooperation.
I was rather surprised that the PPE-DE Group then tried to kill my report by deleting all the important targets and measures in committee.
I call upon all Members to support the importance of binding targets and measures. Without them our work is just words, words, words.
My report can be summed up in one sentence: less cars, more green and water.
That is the only survival strategy for our cities.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate in this evening's debate on the thematic strategy on the urban environment, which the European Parliament has been waiting for from the Commission with particular interest.
I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur, MrÂ Hegyi, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for the full and ambitious report being examined today.
I also welcome the contribution by MrÂ ÃÂ Neachtain and the Committee on Transport and Tourism and by MrsÂ Kallenbach and the Committee on Regional Development.
Before I continue, I should like to share with you the welcome news that the Commissioners approved the seventh and final thematic strategy on soil last Friday.
The preparation of these strategies was difficult and time-consuming.
However, a clear way forward has now been identified for topical environmental issues, which include the policy on the urban environment.
The urban environment is an important issue for us all.
With the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the Commission recognised the role which the urban environment plays in the lives of so many European citizens and undertook to take action in this sector.
The urban environment directly affects the way of life of millions of European citizens and also has important repercussions on the environment in general.
European cities must be viable, sustainable and offer high quality of life, so that citizens will want to live and work there and companies will invest.
Nonetheless, a great deal of effort still needs to be made in this respect.
Clearly urban areas promote economic growth and have high levels of supply of and access to public services, such as education, health and transport.
The reverse side of the coin, however, is the myriad problems relating to life in the city, such as the deterioration in the environment, traffic congestion, economic and social exclusion, crime and alienation.
The purpose of the strategy in question is to promote and facilitate sustainable urban growth, focusing on environmental issues such as air pollution, external noise, high levels of traffic, emissions of greenhouse gases, chaotic building development, water consumption and waste generation.
The problems were easy to identify, but finding solutions to them was very difficult.
This mainly applies when the objective is to find solutions which can be tried and are viable and suitable for the plethora and variety of conditions and problems in the various cities of the European Union.
That is why, despite the fact that the European Commission and the Committee on the Environment agree in substance, they disagree on the way forward.
Some people have called for more legislation and targets which will bring about improvements.
I can understand that from a theoretical point of view and agree in principle.
I wish that it were in fact possible for us to proceed in this manner.
Unfortunately, this is not useful or feasible and there are basic reasons why the strategy is not in favour of introducing new legislation.
To be specific, the reason is that solutions must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and our cities are so different from each other that there is no common solution for them all.
We already have legislative acts which would have positive results on the urban environment if they were properly applied.
We already have legislation which has a positive impact on the environment and the quality of life in cities.
Just think, for example, of all the legislation we have on ambient air quality, noise, waste and water, to mention just a few of the issues covered.
Nonetheless, this legislation must be applied better.
Instead of legislative solutions, the strategy proposes guidance on how to improve the management of urban areas in an integrated manner and increase sustainability in the transport which will be included in the Green Paper on urban transport which is expected to be approved in 2007.
This will lead to better compliance with current environmental legislation and to improved cohesion between the various political and the various administrative levels.
This is the approach which all the interested parties which we consulted clearly and repeatedly stated they preferred.
This approach will be supplemented by other support measures, such as creating suitable structures, exchanging best practices and setting up incentives under the Community Structural Funds.
The Member States should include urban environmental issues in national programmes for funding under the Community cohesion policy, so that regional and local authorities can benefit from the funding opportunities available.
Â Â  . Mr President, as draftsman of this report on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I believe that the policy initiatives in the European Commissionâs Green Paper on energy should be integrated into sustainable urban transport plans, particularly with respect to the promotion of biofuels.
Sufficient support needs to be given to the development of public transport using sustainable energy sources.
In Ireland alone, transport is the third largest contributor to CO2 emissions.
Biofuels should represent 5.75% of our energy supply by 2010.
In real terms, for example, again in my own country, Ireland, 70Â 000 fossil fuel-burning cars will be taken off the roads.
Urban centres running public transport on biofuels have the opportunity to showcase the ease of use of those fuels, which will in turn increase demand from private companies such as taxis, and individual domestic use.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is only through a policy of integration in the areas of energy efficiency and environmental protection that realistic targets can be set and achieved for urban areas.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Hegyi for his very ambitious report and for the very good and fruitful cooperation.
On behalf of the Regional Development Committee, I am particularly glad to see the particular attention given to sustainable town and transport planning.
It is self-evident that future urban planning must combine the ecological with the economic and social dimensions, including within it the creation of job vacancies and the promotion of education, culture and sport for both young and old.
We must, once and for all, reduce land use and re-use brownfield sites.
We call on the Member States and regions to take this into account when drawing up â as they are now doing â their operational programmes, for this will not only benefit the local environment, but will also be an outstanding means of communicating the goals of European policy to men and women on the street, and it is certainly high time they were made aware of them.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur, particularly on his willingness to engage in dialogue.
What I would say to him is that I know that, fundamentally we both want the same thing â an environment worth living in in the big cities and conurbations of the European Union, but it is evident that our opinions diverge completely when it comes to how this goal is to be achieved.
Personally, I think the Commissionâs approach is the right one: a thematic strategy and nothing more, and no legislative proposals, since we are not, in any case, empowered to make any.
We can, of course, publish guidelines referring to existing provisions on such things as air, noise, waste, and so on; we can encourage the sharing of experience and support it, including financially, for we know that not everyone has to keep on reinventing the wheel.
The rapporteur is trying to save Budapest, his home city, and that is an honourable thing to do, but he is also trying to circumvent the subsidiarity principle.
He wants binding legal measures; he wants to tamper with local and regional authoritiesâ powers over planning matters and intervene in that area.
I have to tell him that that is wrong; if you do that, you stir up public disaffection with the European Union.
There are, then, a number of things about this report that my group and I want to see changed.
For example, important though the protection of the environment is, it must not have the end result of making life impossible for businesses; the quality of urban life is dependent on the quality of the environment and on economic vitality.
Nor, as I see it, does a congestion charge solve anything.
Yes, of course there is a need for environmentally-friendly modes of transport, such as buses, trains, bicycles, and so on, but it would be wrong to ban cars, which are a means of transport for individuals, from cities.
All that would do would be to encourage shopping centres on greenfield sites and the depopulation of the countryside, with people leaving the towns, inner cities becoming wastelands, and the quality of urban living declining.
Nor is there any sense in demanding of cities things that they are quite simply incapable of managing â things such as the collection of data, even on the local use of biocides, a category which, let me remind MrÂ Hegyi, includes the flea powder that I use on my dog!
That sort of thing makes us look ridiculous.
We have to ensure that the subsidiarity principle is maintained; that is what I see our role as being, and that is the intention underlying our amendments.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, MrÂ Hegyi, on the work he has done.
We have here a report that asks the right questions and that offers some good answers.
This report highlights the need for consistency and cooperation, something that some Members call the âintegrated approachâ and that the European Commission communication echoes.
We need an overall view so as to better understand the urban environment challenge, particularly in social, cultural and environmental terms.
I approve of the emphasis given in this report to a number of fundamental points: exchanging best practices and promoting the training of local players; controlling the growing volume of traffic and decoupling transport growth and GDP growth; encouraging people to save energy and improving the energy efficiency of buildings; making the implementation of sustainable urban management plans and sustainable urban transport plans compulsory for every urban area with more than 100Â 000 inhabitants; and, finally, proposing a per capita target in relation to green areas in new urban developments.
I believe that we do, however, need to find the right balance between giving instructions to the Member States and giving the power of initiative to local players, because they represent a breeding ground for innovation, having, as they do, first-hand experience of the realities of urban life.
Our aim must in fact be to create a framework that will give rise to local initiatives by leaving the choice of targets and solutions up to local decision-makers.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, many thanks to the rapporteur for this splendid report.
I also appreciate the way he has taken up an idea that matters a great deal to me, that being the idea of a new pact, of a new quality of cooperation between the European level on the one hand and the great cities in Europe on the other.
In Europe, 80% of people live in towns.
If we want to make progress in areas such as the conservation of resources, energy policy, air quality and so on, one thing that is absolutely necessary is closer integration of the policies made in cities and those made at the European level.
What is needed, then, is better use of the European Unionâs financial instruments, including, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The last thing I want to say is addressed to you, MrsÂ Sommer: even Governor Schwarzenegger and his conservatives in California have moved on further than you have.
What he has done with the automobile industry in its present form is to unmask it before all the world for what it is, namely a bunch of crooks who should be up before a judge.
Your self-appointed role as this Houseâs resident lobbyist for the German car industry is something I find almost shameful in someone who claims to want to preserve nature.
Â Â  . Mr President, in former times, countries were preponderantly rural and cities were the exception.
The growth in population and the advent of urban professions have changed this dramatically over the past century to the extent that the large majority of Europeans now live in real cities, in suburbs and in rural areas that have been urbanised to a large extent due to industry, ports or mining.
In the developing world, but also in parts of Europe, we notice that such urban areas can become completely unviable on account of traffic chaos, slums, pollution and land speculation.
Where clean drinking water, a dense network of frequent public transport, sound waste removal and affordable, good housing are absent, or health care, social work and education are inadequate, those cities become hell.
As soon as cities go downhill, well-educated people on high incomes can move away from the area, but labourers and immigrants have no choice but to stay.
To this day, national and European policy is based on the increase in the number of cars and cut-backs in public services.
That is putting the future of our cities at risk.
It is right and proper that the EUâs attention that was originally focused on agricultural production and the countryside should, in recent years, have shifted to the cities.
There was also a downside to this, unfortunately.
If the Commissionâs proposal from 2000 for a contract obligation for urban transport had been adopted without any amendments, this would have prejudiced the extension of tram networks and free public transport, as well as the creation of a dense and frequent transport network.
It is cities and regions themselves that should, as far as possible, be responsible for regulating city transport, physical planning, urban development, open space planning and bicycle paths.
Where the European Union can add value, though, is in areas like research, and in the exchange and transfer of knowledge.
In that way, we can control dangers and abuses, promote initiatives for improvement and reinforce the development of, and compliance with, better environmental standards.
Particularly in the future Member States Romania and Bulgaria, much needs to be done in this area.
I support MrÂ Hegyi in his striving towards non-polluting transport, the protection of historic city centres, the adoption of careful water management, economical energy consumption and protection for areas of natural beauty.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank MrÂ Hegyi for his report and for accepting a number of amendments that I put forward.
I hope that he will likewise accept the amendments that my colleague, Renate Sommer, has put forward, in the sense that Europe is at its best when it is sharing good practice.
It is geared to sharing good practice between Member States and between local authorities.
The amendments are intended to make sure that this is directed to them and that the Commission is not called on to do everything for them.
If we can get that straight, then we will be able to support the very good ideas in the report as a whole.
Our constituents are rightly worried about many aspects of the urban environment.
We have just had a debate on air quality: that is very central to it.
However, it is more than that; it is the noise that we have to put up with in the urban environment, from neighbours as well as from vehicles, from ghetto blasters and so on. This is not territory for European directives, but we can share best practice as to how to tackle it.
Similarly, street cleaning and the sheer dirt of our cities are a public health issue that ought to be on our agenda.
We can learn from each other.
Just as one sees in Paris the gutters running with water at night to clean them, there are ideas all over Europe.
We want to see the phasing-out of crime as part of our strategy for urban areas, with emphasis on designing estates which avoid those traps for citizens where they can be pounced on by wrongdoers, making sure that we have safe routes to railway stations, and so on. We must also ensure that we have sensible development alongside our rivers to avoid building on flood plains and the disasters that can cause.
There are many good ideas in this report with opportunities to share best practice and that is what could come from this.
I hope the Commissioner will take it forward in that spirit.
Â Â  â Mr President, I wish to thank all those colleagues who contributed to this report in the hope that it will be adopted.
Especially those, of course, who agreed with most of my ideas.
As regards subsidiarity, I think my views are somewhat different.
We are not talking about a directive here, but rather about a strategic proposal.
Therefore, we should not water down our demands at this time.
When the time comes to draft directives, we will face a long process of negotiation in any case.
By the way, I have met with representatives of European cities and local authorities and with staff members of Eurocity, who came to see me at the European Parliament building.
What they expected from me was precisely that binding measures be included as much as possible so that they can carry out their environmentally-friendly ideas better with support from the European Union, since there are obviously other interests to be considered in the cities.
It is also very important not to let this strategic proposal get lost in the shuffle.
That is why in one of the paragraphs I have put forward the need for a follow-up on this report within the framework of intra-institutional consultation.
Luckily, this proposal had the support of all the parties in the House.
I am therefore asking Commissioner Dimas to allow me the opportunity next week or at another time to discuss how to proceed with the follow-up of this report, beyond its adoption by the European Parliament.
