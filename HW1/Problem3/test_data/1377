It is absolutely urgent that we establish across the whole of the European Union, using the network of Commission offices, a system whereby we can respond immediately when myths and lies are told about the European Union, and particularly about the content of the Constitution.
There is no point in responding 20Â days or two months later, because then the myth has become stuck in reality.
You need to respond instantly.
Â Â  . We have started a rebuttal service.
I agree with you that this is very important because sometimes pure lies are presented about the text of the Constitution.
We are engaged in a rebuttal service.
Perhaps we should make it more visible that we have started such a service.
It is based very much around responding to statements that come up in the UK media.
You can find it on the UK Representationâs website.
I agree that it is very important.
Â Â  Has the Commission no shame in trying to ride to success in the referendum campaign on the back of emotion and sentiment, such as the Commissioner deployed in her speech at the commemoration ceremony for the liberation of the concentration camp of Terezin at the weekend?
Does the Commission not have any appreciation that the opponents of the Constitution are just as proud of the defeat of Nazism as anyone else and that we take great offence when she tries to hijack and monopolise that sentiment in order to advance the political agenda of seeking to promote this Constitution?
Â Â  . I am sorry, but do the UK media have no shame in publishing such absolutely desperate lies?
I never said such a thing, but it does not help if they have written it.
They have lied; they have made things up.
I just feel sorry for you because you have been misled by pure lies in the British media.
I just want everybody here to know that this is a pure lie.
They have made up some kind of title or headline in the newspapers that is totally wrong.
A lot of people were there, so you will know exactly what I said.
Â Â  Madam President, the greatest challenge for the Commission in terms of communication is to reach out to 450 million people in the EU using limited resources.
According to Eurobarometerâs latest full report, TV is far and away the most popular source of information for people in all 25 Member States when it comes to issues concerning the EU.
Radio follows closely in third place, with higher percentages in the new Member States, making the audio-visual media the most effective channels for spreading information about the European Union.
With a view to giving people factual and other information about the EU, its policy areas and the decisions and measures it adopts, the Commission has, every year since 2003, published an invitation to submit proposals for the cofinancing of high-quality and accessible programmes which appeal to popular taste and which at the same time serve to promote the EUâs ideas and values.
The total budget for 2004 amounted to EURÂ 6.7 million.
Of the project proposals submitted by radio and TV companies or producers, 79 projects were selected.
For 2005, the invitation to submit proposals applies only to radio, and the budget for that activity amounts to EURÂ 3.9 million.
Subsequently, agreements will be drafted, regulating the forms to be taken by this cooperation between radio and TV companies or producers and the Commission.
In devising their projects, applicants are free to choose the type of programmes they prefer to produce and transmit.
The formats can include not only drama series, game shows, films and news reports but also debates.
So far, no candidates have chosen to develop projects for drama series, game shows or films.
This is borne out by the results of the Commissionâs latest quality studies and opinion polls carried out in the EUâs 25 Member States.
The aim was to provide an overview of what Europeans want and expect in terms both of form and content.
TV viewers do not actually regard films, drama series or game shows as the ideal way of supplying information about the EU.
Instead, they turn out to prefer current affairs shows, live coverage, documentaries and, above all, factual and informative news items in more general news programmes.
They may also be interested in historical documentaries, arts programmes and films, but to a significantly lesser degree.
The applicants are always entirely free to choose what type of programme they want to produce, provided that it helps communicate the European message to people.
Â Â  Madam President, I wish to thank you for that extremely informative answer.
I just have one more small question, and that is as to whether the Commission can guarantee that the information is objective.
You say that it is entirely up to those who make the programmes to decide about the content.
Is there no requirement of balance and objectivity?
Â Â  Madam President, we proceed on the basis that the partners we cooperate with each abide by their Member Stateâs laws on balance or, rather, objectivity.
We cannot impose further demands.
All we can do is extend an invitation and solicit offers to make programmes, but programme-makers must of course comply with national laws concerning editorial freedom and, of course, objectivity.
Â Â  Commissioner, will the NGOs that misuse public funds â and I am thinking, in particular, of an NGO in Ireland whose job it is to work in the developing world, which put up âsay no to NATOâ signs during the last Nice Treaty referendum â face any sort of sanctions or censure from the Commission, particularly if they are using public funds when they should be looking after Third World issues and development issues of that kind?
Â Â  . It is very difficult to comment on a specific case when I do not know the detailed circumstances, but I do not think we should be afraid of an open debate with those who disagree with us and we should welcome a lively debate on different issues.
If we work with civil society, with NGOs, we will always also have them criticising us, but that is part of the democratic procedure.
I am used to working, for example, with environmental NGOs and we give a lot of support to NGOs.
I was constantly criticised by them, but this is actually their role.
They should also keep up the pressure on us and they should keep an eye on what we are doing, and we have to accept that there is a debate.
I do not know your specific case and why this is a problem at all.
But if we give money or ask for calls for proposals, then we have to be very specific about what it is that we expect in return; and probably in this case there was something wrong in that respect.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, it seems as if Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m and quite a number of those who have taken part in the debate in this House are of the view that the press in the European Union and perhaps also radio and television have a strong bias against the draft Constitution.
I must ask whether that is Commissioner WallstrÃ¶mâs view, because my distinct impression is exactly the opposite, namely that there is a huge bias throughout Europe in favour of the âyesâ camp, which dominates the press.
What is curious is that the opposite is presented as being the case.
Â Â  Madam President, MrÂ Lundgren, I do not think I stated anything at all about a bias towards one side or the other.
We have of course talked about trying to extract facts and information about the Constitution and helping journalists understand better and obtain all the information they need to be able, as I see it, to conduct a debate that addresses both the âyesâ and ânoâ arguments.
The fact is that it is extremely important to have independent media and a lively debate on the issue.
I have no view, then, as to whether there is bias in one direction or the other.
What we are trying to help ensure is that there is access to information, as well as educational material if needed, for journalists too so that they can learn, for example, how the European institutions operate.
I do not wish to express an opinion as to whether there is bias one way or the other.
I just want to ensure I contribute to a well-informed debate.
Â Â  . Under the third Community support framework for Greece, there are two operational programmes â âEnvironmentâ and âAtticaâ â that include actions relating to the habitation of urban sites as well as support for leisure parks and green areas.
According to the information currently available to the Commission, the Greek authorities have not proposed the cofinancing of a metropolitan park on the site of the old Hellinikon Airport, nor has such a project been approved under the two above-mentioned operational programmes.
As you will know, the choice of project proposals is the responsibility of the Greek authorities.
It is still possible, under the current financial perspective, for the Greek authorities to propose the above-mentioned projects if they considered that appropriate.
With regard to the last part of the question: yes, there are metropolitan parks in many major cities of the European Union.
Â Â  â Commissioner, in our country you are known as the 'iron lady' who takes decisions on programmes and on suspending payments.
Therefore you, the 'iron lady' should uphold your reputation by helping the Greek Government to see things as they really are.
Athens, with the Parthenon, once the most beautiful city in the world, is today an endless concrete jungle.
If you go up to the Parthenon, all you see is concrete.
You should make the Greek Government understand that the area must not be developed.
Apartment blocks must not be built; there is not a strip of green in the whole of Athens.
Help Athens, help the mayors, you will be setting an example for Greece.
We need that park.
Â Â  . It was more a comment than a suggestion.
Tomorrow, we are meeting with the representative of the Greek Government.
On other occasions also, I will share your views with the Greek authorities.
Â Â  â Madam President, the project of the biggest metropolitan park in any city in Europe, bigger even than Hyde Park, is being implemented in agreement and cooperation with the mayors of the Hellenikon area in general.
This is a sign of democratic morals, a participative perception and respect for local authorities on the part of the Greek minister with material jurisdiction, Mr Souflias.
I have no wish to believe that Mr Karatzaferis would want, as far as the financing of the project is concerned, to transfer resources from the Greek regions to this specific area of Athens.
Â Â  . That was not a question, but a comment, and I listened carefully to it.
I want to say that one of the features of the structural funds is partnership.
Certainly, any parks or any urban sites open to the general public usually require a lot of partnership, not only at the planning stage of such an investment but also on completion, in terms of the management and maintenance of such parks.
I hope that this idea is an example of an opportunity for many representatives of different institutions in Greece to get together and really to think about whether this is entirely necessary.
I listened carefully to your comments.
Â Â  . In the structural funds, in the regulations and also in practice, there are mechanisms in place that discourage the relocation of firms that have benefited from structural funds.
Under current regulations there is a provision which clearly states that a firm which relocates within five years of using the funds must reimburse the aid it received.
This mechanism will be maintained after 2006; however, we are proposing to lengthen that period from five to seven years.
We are also adding a provision that any firm required to reimburse money will not be entitled to receive support from the funds in the future.
This proposal is currently under negotiation and discussion in the Council.
The regulation envisages the situation that when major project â above EURÂ 25Â million in the case of the environment and EURÂ 50 million in the case of transport and substructure â are adopted, the Commission also asks the Member State, under cost-benefit analysis, to provide information about any jobs being created or lost in the regions concerned in the context of a given project.
So we are taking this issue into account as well.
With future regulations, the Commission intends to play a more active role in monitoring, which would mean we can gather information on any on-going relocation processes and deliver it to Member States.
The latest information on this mechanism currently under consultation with the Member States involves the state aid rules for competition.
DG Competition at the Commission has also sought comments from Member States on the issue of relocation.
The Commission is currently analysing the Member Statesâ positions.
Â Â  Madam Commissioner, the mechanism you have described has to do with the permanence of the investment rather than with any relocation that may already have taken place.
Decisions on where to base a business are always taken in response to market considerations â infrastructure, the market to which the firm intends to sell, the tax position in different places and the state of the labour market, but subsidies do not enter into it.
This is something that European regional policy must take into account, as these subsidies are primarily windfall gains.
In terms of getting the European ideal accepted, they are absolute poison, particularly in the regions affected by site closures, and their end product is in fact nothing whatever; they produce neither additional jobs nor added economic potential.
Nevertheless, let me again ask the Commissioner: what additional mechanisms can we bolt on to exclude the possibility of subsidies being given to firms that have already relocated?
Â Â  . My responsibility covers the structural funds.
I understood your question in terms of the contribution of structural funds, which implies investment with the use of funds.
To the extent that we have authority over the use of funds, we include the challenge of relocation.
However, I cannot act in the broader context of relocation processes in general.
That is why I limited my answer to the link between the structural funds and potential relocation processes.
Â Â  . As you know, the phasing-in regions are regions that would normally have benefited from the highest Community support, over many years, allowing them to finance all those investments which are necessary to enable them to participate fully in the single market and to create conditions in which companies can operate smoothly.
Once those conditions are in place, priority should be given to other competitiveness factors, such as knowledge, innovation, research and development, and also the quality of human capital.
These are in fact the key areas where we propose concentrating Community assistance, in line with the integrated guidelines on jobs and growth which the Commission proposed and the presidency concluded at the Spring European Council.
So the natural logic is that we should move to different priorities.
The second issue is, of course, limited resources.
Under Objective 2 and the phasing-in transitional scheme, we will have very limited resources, requiring strong targeting of support.
The critical mass for growth and competitiveness must be reached as soon as possible.
But I must point out that the menu of priorities the Commission proposes under the regulations does not prevent regions from investing in infrastructure to strengthen the secondary networks.
This could include improving links to trans-European networks â to regional railways, airports, ports and also multimodal platforms providing radial links to main railway lines â and promoting regional and local inland waterways.
The Commission is, therefore, ready to examine the possibility of introducing a degree of flexibly in the definition of the scope of use of the funds in the phasing-in regions.
Consequently, the compromise text of the presidency has already been modified on this point and would allow for a derogation.
Such a derogation will have to be duly justified and could concern some priorities financed under the convergence objective.
But that could also mean social infrastructure, such as education, health and, possibly, some missing links in the transeuropean networks.
So this is all possible.
It will have to be justified â most likely on a case-by-case basis â but we are opening up this possibility.
Â Â  Thank you for your answer, Commissioner.
The natural effect regions will see some hope in the reply you have just given.
It is important to stress that these regions, despite the progress, are still structurally and infrastructurally handicapped.
It is illogical to use different strands of the cohesion policy to tackle their socio-economic problems.
They are looking for exactly the same conditions as those regions that left Objective 1 in 2000.
That is a just case, so I thank you for your answer and I see some flexibility there for the regions.
Â Â  . In my travels through the regions of Europe I also visited regions that are victims of their own success.
It would be natural to phase them in to Objective 2.
I know that many of them continue to have problems.
That is why we have tried to open up the possibility of broadening the scope of the type of investment.
When it comes to eligibility for Objective 1 or Objective 2, I do not see any possibility at this stage of a shift from one group to the other.
We discussed this many times.
We also had many talks with many Member States. We consulted on those issues.
I do not see the possibility of doing more for these regions today.
However, there is still potential for Parliament; there are still ongoing negotiations in the Council.
I cannot say that nothing is possible, but I am not very optimistic in this respect.
Â Â  . It is much broader than just a review of the Third Community Support Framework.
I should like to tell Mr Papadimoulis what stage we are at.
As you know, the Greek authorities provided at the due time a description of the entire management and control systems of the ERDF established in Greece.
As a follow-up, in October 2003 an audit â carried out by the services of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy â confirmed the existence of serious deficiencies in the systems and the management process.
We agreed an action plan with the Greek authorities; the final deadline for the implementation of the actions under the plan was the end of September 2004.
The deliverables of the action plan have been analysed.
The conclusion was that certain types of operations that were cofinanced and certain operations that were carried over from the Second to the Third Community Support Framework do not justify the contribution from the ERDF.
We also confirmed the existence of serious failings in the management and control systems.
As the Greek authorities did not investigate the irregularities and did not make the necessary financial corrections, the Directorate-General informed them of the possible suspension by the Commission of interim ERDF payments for specific measures of the operational programmes that were affected by the above-mentioned irregularities.
Many meetings took place between January and May 2005 and, throughout this process, the Commission stressed the urgency of arriving at an overall solution that would allow payments to continue on a sound basis in the future.
In response to your question, the amount of any correction will have to take full account of the audit findings, but the consequences in terms of loss of Community funds cannot be quantified at this stage.
I can say that flat-rate corrections will be applied, in compliance with the regulations.
Also, given that the discussions that have taken place have not led to an agreement so far, the Commission is currently proceeding with measures that may lead to suspension decisions.
Nevertheless, we shall keep open the possibility of continued dialogue to find a solution.
The next meeting with the Greek authorities will take place tomorrow.
When the debate with the Greek authorities is closed I will be able to inform you in writing what programmes have been affected and to what extent.
As far as the modification of the Third Community Support Framework is concerned, the Commission has been informed that the Greek Ministry of Finance intends to submit an application in the course of the year.
So far, however, the Commission has received no proposals for transfers of funds between programmes.
Â Â  â Commissioner, I understand that negotiations are under way on the size of the cuts but have not been completed.
Nonetheless, can the Commission give us an order of size based on its calculations â not a precise forecast â of the cuts under discussion, together with your forecast of when the talks in question with the Greek authorities will be completed?
Â Â  . I am sorry, but at this stage I am unable, in terms of the information available to me before tomorrowâs meeting, to say anything more concrete.
However, I can repeat the promise that if we manage to find a solution by tomorrow - which is my dream - then I would inform you immediately.
If not, you would of course be informed as to the size of the suspension, but at this stage I am unable to provide you with any data.
Â Â  â I should like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs HÃŒbner, for remembering the informal agreement reached in the autumn of 2003 with the then Greek government on a legislative arrangement which would cover the problems presented by the law on public works.
I also wish to thank her for the agreement, at the beginning of 2004, with the then Greek government, on the action plan to improve the Community Support Framework management system.
However, I should like, with my thanks, to ask her a question: what happened next as regards the question of implementing the action plan with the new government after March 2004?
Can the Commissioner give me this information?
Â Â  . Perhaps I was not clear enough.
There are two issues that were the subject of the audit and which were also presented as an outcome of the audit.
There was not only the issue already mentioned; there were also serious failings in the management and control system, which led to the irregularities.
Under the law on public works certain types of operations were cofinanced, and certain operations were carried from one Community support framework to another.
These were not justified in terms of the eligibility to the contribution of the funds.
The second issue was the failures in the management and control system which led to those systemic irregularities, particularly with regard to the ERDF.
So we are moving on the change of the system of the loss so that we can have a sound system for the future.
But we are also facing the challenge of what has happened so far under the existing system with failures.
The past and the future are two different issues.
Â Â  . The question is very short but does not permit a very short answer.
I think we should look at the issue from the short-term, medium-term and long-term perspective.
In the short-term, as soon as the closure was announced, Commission officials reacted, and we were in close and frequent contact with our counterparts in the West Midlands.
Our first priority was to identify the range of actions needed to alleviate the consequences of the closure.
These actions are undertaken with a view to securing long-term growth prospects for the region.
Let me stress very strongly that we have worked very closely over the last weeks with national and regional authorities, and this case demonstrates that we can cooperate if we want to help overcome this kind of tragic economic event.
Working together, we can assist the regional efforts to regain economic strength.
Then, in the medium term, the Commission decided to work with the European vehicle manufacturers and other stakeholders with a view to improving the competitiveness of the sector.
To this end my colleague, Commissioner Verheugen, has set up a high-level group called âCARS 21â.
The group is expected to present proposals on a competitive automotive regulatory system for the next ten years.
In this group, we have industry representatives and also experts.
For the long term, as you know, the issue of corporate restructuring and industrial policies is high on the European agenda these days, in line with the renewed Lisbon agenda.
The Commission adopted, a few weeks ago, a communication on restructuring and employment, setting out measures to be developed or strengthened.
It means that the European Union can mobilise as regards anticipating and managing corporate restructuring.
Europeâs ministers for labour and employment and the European social partners have also met recently, again underlining the need to anticipate and work in partnership for successful corporate restructuring.
I think it is important that they have concluded that successful restructuring requires a climate of trust. It requires good communication.
By definition, this involves commitment from employers and employees in anticipating and managing change, seeking alternatives to lay-offs and exploring opportunities for training, out-placement and the creation of new activities.
I think that the Rover case has also been a factor in demonstrating that we have to think seriously about restructuring in Europe.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your very comprehensive answer, particularly as I must confess that the question â I do not know if it was my officeâs fault or that of someone else â was intended for Mr Verheugen and was aimed more at the industrial policy side of things.
However, you very kindly covered a lot of these issues.
In your own field, Commissioner, are you convinced that there is enough flexibility in the existing structural funds to provide regional aid, if appropriate, social fund monies for retraining and â slightly outside your area â research and development money, if a viable use can be found for the plant?
Â Â  . Frankly, we are not flexible enough.
We have proposed in the future regulation, for example, setting up a kind of special reserve.
I cannot remember how big it was supposed to be, but it would be a certain percentage of the funds.
Then every Member State would have a reserve for cases like this and there would be no need to shift money between programmes or projects and become involved in a very complicated and bureaucratic process.
Unfortunately, in spite of the Rover case, there is no support among the Member States for such a reserve.
So we will be deprived of this kind of flexibility in the future.
At the same time, not only through the funds but also in general, we have embarked on a process that would allow us to contribute to the European structure in such a way as to ensure that future structures, based on new factors of production and growth, would be more flexible.
This would allow the industries to adjust in time and in an evolutionary manner, rather than leading to the kind of restructuring we are facing in the case of Rover.
This is a question of flexible structures, which we can usually achieve if we base industrial development on modern factors, such as research and development, and modern technology.
These structures are much more flexible than the old industry.
Â Â  Commissioner, I represent the West Midlands.
I started my working life in the Longbridge plant that you have been talking about.
I should first like to take the opportunity to thank you and your services very much for the prompt response that you referred to.
It has been much appreciated by my region and the support that we have given to the people immediately affected.
I should like to draw to your attention two points for you to reflect on.
First, I am also privileged to be a member of the âCARS 21â Group, to which you referred earlier.
It is important that your services are also involved with Mr Verheugen in that.
Important regional issues are involved.
Secondly â and this is a lesson that I want to feed back to you from our experience in the West Midlands â restructuring the supply chain for industries, and particularly the SMEs, was something we started on.
We did not necessarily get a lot of support from you in the beginning, but it is a lesson I hope you will take for other major industries later.
Â Â  . I thank you very much for the âCARS 21â Group.
I understand I can go to Commissioner Verheugen and say that there is a request from the West Midlands that we should be there.
I agree with you that we should be there to contribute and be aware of where we are going and to be able to contribute funds.
Nobody is perfect, as we know.
We all make mistakes.
However, for the future, with the revitalised Lisbon approach, clearly we want to help, be innovative and contribute to the restructuring.
I can tell you, using a Polish example, that restructuring in Poland came through SMEs, and the whole structural change in exports and imports also came through them.
It is a good sector to support.
Â Â  Questions Nos 42 to 46 will be answered in writing.
Â Â  . The Commission considers the objective of providing patients with better information on medicinal products a high priority and is, therefore, working in different areas with a view to improving the situation.
First of all, ArticleÂ 88a of Directive 2001/83 calls upon the Commission to present to Parliament and the Council a report on current practice with regard to information provision â particularly on the Internet â and its risks and benefits for patients.
The report will be prepared following consultations with patients' and consumers' organisations, doctors' and pharmacists' organisations, Member States and interested parties.
It is due within three years of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 2004/726/EC â which means by 2007 â but the Commission will do its best to present this report in advance of that deadline.
In accordance with the results of the report, the Commission is to table proposals setting out an information strategy to ensure good-quality, objective, reliable and non-promotional information on medicinal products and other treatments and address the question of the information source's liability.
Secondly, the G10 process: the report will also take into account experience from related activities in this area, such as the work of the European Medicines Agency with patient organisations, the public-private partnership under the G10 initiative and other relevant activities, such as the new European database on medicinal products.
The Regulation I already mentioned calls upon the European Medicines Agency to set up a publicly accessible database, which will cover medicines authorised by the Community and by Member States.
The database will facilitate the search for information already authorised for package leaflets and will contain a section on paediatric medicines.
The final report will then need to address the question of whether, beyond the stocktaking of current practice, with its risks and benefits, an improved information strategy is needed and what elements could be included.
The third matter is the European Union Public Health Programme running from 2003 until 2008, which has as its objective the creation of a comprehensive and reliable information and knowledge system.
That is being created on the basis of a shortlist of agreed indicators for which data is collected mainly through Eurostat and ad hoc services and projects.
Analysis of data is supported through the programme, leading to regular reporting on public health issues.
All project reports are published on the Commission public health website.
In addition, in order to improve the presentation and availability of information to the public, to specialised audiences and to patients, the Commission is at an advanced stage of preparing an EU public health portal, drawing together information at EU level, national and regional levels, and with resources from civil society.
It is planned to launch this initiative before the end of this year.
Â Â  Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is always welcome to the stage, but she may understand that we are a little disappointed that the Commissioner designated â to whom we tabled this question â is not here to answer it.
Perhaps she could take a gentle message back asking him to turn up in future.
I am grateful for the off-the-cuff response she has given me today: it is voluminous and helpful.
However, she will understand â it is partly in the question â that patients feel the urgent need for more information about their condition, drugs and treatments.
Too often they go to the Internet and get information that may be misleading or may be dangerous.
Therefore, it is urgent that we have authorised and authenticated systems of information for patients.
Perhaps the Commissioner could take back the message that the penalty for Commissioner Verheugen is to speed up the process even more.
Â Â  . Mr Bowis, I will tell Mr Verheugen that you missed him.
I can say also that I understand the question very well, because once upon a time I was a minister for health and social affairs; so I know that this issue is very important.
I have only tried to put together the things that are now being prepared and in the pipeline.
I understand that there will also be a continuous dialogue between Parliament and the Commission to ensure that we get a good and reliable information system in place.
Â Â  . As key drivers of innovation, job creation and competitiveness, small- and medium-sized enterprises have been firmly put centre stage in the recently adopted Growth and Employment Strategy.
The Commission intends to present a new framework for SME policy in the second half of this year.
Since the presentation of the Growth and Employment Strategy on 2 February, three initiatives of significant relevance to SMEs have already been taken.
The first is better regulation.
The Commission adopted, on 16Â March, a communication on better regulation for growth and jobs in the European Union, one of its goals being to further reduce red tape. That is particularly relevant for SMEs because they have limited resources and suffer disproportionately from red tape.
The Commission will refine the impact assessment tool, an important tool for considering the effect of EU legislation on SMEs.
The economic analysis of these assessments will be improved, which will strengthen their quality and make a significant contribution to competitiveness.
The Commission will also address regulatory excess in existing legislation.
To get the best possible input to legislative simplification, we need to involve all stakeholders including SMEs.
Based on their input we will draw up action plans for simplifying regulations per industrial sector.
The Commission is initiating a test phase for a common approach to measuring administrative costs in the EU, an issue of particular importance to SMEs.
Secondly, this is all about access to EU programmes for SMEs.
On 6 April, the Commission adopted its remaining proposals for the new financial perspectives.
They included two instruments of significance to SMEs: the EUR 4.2 billion Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP), and the EUR 70 billion Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.
The CIP is aimed fairly and squarely at SMEs.
They will be the sole beneficiaries of the EUR 1 billion earmarked for the Community financial instruments and of the business and innovation support services, which will be provided through the European Union networks.
SMEs will also be the primary beneficiaries of the entrepreneurial innovation activities.
On the basis of experience of existing instruments, the Commission estimates that well over 70% of this competitiveness and innovation programme budget will be targeted to SMEs.
To step up the involvement of SMEs in research and technological development, we will strive for increased SME participation also in the Seventh Framework Programme.
Efforts are under way to simplify the programme's management, diminish the costs for submitting applications, reduce the delay to contract and secure more certainty for applicants.
The proposed funds available for the programme, dedicated to SMEs, will be more than doubled in this framework programme, in comparison with the previous one. That will help SMEs with no or little research capacity to get input from research providers.
Collaborative research remains the core and bulk of the framework programme.
The choice of the nine themes will favour SME participation.
On 16 April a new SME Envoy, Mrs Maive Ruth, was appointed.
She is an official of the European Commission and will act as a contact point for SMEs, maintain a dialogue with SMEs and ensure that their interests are properly considered within all EU policies and programmes.
Â Â  â Thank you, Commissioner, for that exhaustive answer.
The phenomenon against which we have to contend is the discrepancy between what happens, and what is felt by those to whom it happens, and so I would like you to tell us what measures are going to be taken as part of the information campaign in order to get the projects you have just described across to small and medium-sized businesses as quickly as possible, enabling them to prepare themselves for these projects?
Secondly, what, in practical terms, is going to be done about a timetable and a plan for implementing what is described under the headings âReducing bureaucracyâ, âImpact assessmentâ and âGetting rid of over-regulationâ?
We have heard the promise that there will be a new framework for SMEs, and I believe that there will be one; the only thing is that we are constantly being asked what is now actually happening in practical terms over and above what was decided on in the past, what the new framework that Commissioner Verheugen wants to bring in will be like, and what its actual priorities will be.
Â Â  . I am sure Commissioner Verheugen would be better placed to give you exact dates.
All this work has started.
Recently I was in Prague and met with business representatives, who were really impressed.
They said that for the first time they had heard some of the messages they wanted to hear about cutting red tape and understanding the conditions of small- and medium-sized enterprises.
So at least they felt happy about what is coming out of the Commission so far.
I know work on this has already started, for example, the inventory to look at access regulation that exists.
Within the framework programme there are given dates for what you can apply, etc. The whole approach and the whole message on SMEs has really been absorbed by the Commission and the way we work.
This is extremely important.
This is where new jobs should be created in the future: in the small- and medium-sized enterprises.
I can give you only a general answer.
I will inform my colleague of your views.
Â Â  I was pleased that the Commissioner put emphasis on the whole question of better regulation because we know that regulation bears much more on small businesses than on larger ones.
In connection with the SME envoy, could the Commissioner tell us whether the Commission plans to give the SME envoy a much more explicit remit within the better regulation programme, enabling the envoy to scrutinise legislative projects, specifically from the perspective of small enterprise, and publish a report that this Parliament can see, so that we know that the concerns of SMEs are being fully and properly reflected in the better regulation programme?
Â Â  . I am not sure that I can give a very precise answer to that question.
I can tell you how this envoyâs tasks have been defined, and I guess that she will also see her role as a watchdog for SMEs.
This will, no doubt, be a proper task on which to consider legislation.
But there always has to be a balance between different interests.
I know from discussing REACH, for example, how difficult this can be.
But from the very beginning, when it came to regulating chemicals, we said that this should not hit small and medium-sized enterprises in an unbalanced way.
We should make sure that it is not disproportionate for small and medium-sized enterprises, and do everything in a cost-effective way.
I assume that the envoy will see and define her role as a watchdog also.
As regards the concrete tasks and exactly how she might report and so on, I will have to refer back to Commissioner Verheugen for the details, and maybe come back and give you a specific answer.
Â Â  Thank you for creating such a friendly atmosphere, Madam President.
Since being elected, this House has set up an Intergroup on SMEs, and I would like to invite the Commission to appoint the representative with responsibility for SMEs as a permanent member of it, in order to keep them up to date with what is going on.
We meet in Strasbourg on a Wednesday every other month.
I ask you to pass on this invitation to Commissioner Verheugen and to ask him, at the July part-session, to give us more concrete examples of what you have been saying today.
He may then be able to put things rather more in context.
Â Â  Questions Nos 49 to 85 will be answered in writing.
That concludes Question Time.
Â Â  Â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0119/2005), on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the recognition of professional qualifications (13781/2/2004 â C6-0008/2005 â 2002/0061(COD)) (Rapporteur: Stefano ZappalÃ ).
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to summarise very briefly the content of a directive that is of particular importance to many tens of millions of European professionals, and above all to all EU citizens, who have to deal with professionals every day.
This extremely important directive relates to a fundamental theme, namely the completion of the internal market.
National autonomy means that each Member State lays down rules and procedures for the practice of the professions, whereas under the Treaties every EU citizen should be able to enjoy the right to work in any other Member State of the Union, either temporarily or permanently, on a par with any citizen of the host country.
National autonomy means that each government decides on the minimum standards of education and training required for access to the individual professions and also establishes who shall authorise and control the practice of the professions.
Within this context of respect for the Treaties, respect for national autonomy and the principle of subsidiarity, we need to harmonise the system.
Countless directives have regulated this area over the past decades, but with this directive Parliament is unifying them into a single provision within the framework of an overall macrosystem â while respecting certain special features and certain professions.
The points contained in the directive are fundamental.
For the sake of brevity I shall highlight just a few of them.
The Treaties mention liberal professionals but never define them.
In this directive we define liberal professions for the first time, albeit within a recital.
This is a remarkable step forwards, partly because, by referring to certain specific articles in the Treaty, Parliament is laying down a definitive framework to form the legal basis for future provisions.
The directive introduces a fundamental definition â that of competent authority â meaning those national bodies and soon, we hope, according to the preamble to the directive, European ones too.
Such a definition should put an end to the debate that dragged on during the last legislative term about orders, colleges and associations.
All those bodies can at last be included either in the context of national legislations or within the framework of European law.
The directive covers a raft of other fundamental new ideas: âqualifications shoppingâ is avoided; those exercising public authority â notaries in particular â are excluded from the area of free movement; and the possibility of acting according to the country of origin principle is precluded â we shall try to delimit this point in another directive.
In addition, it establishes that representatives of the individual professions shall be consulted in future at a European level in relation to any other innovation that concerns them.
I still have two more points to mention.
Some European professionals â German craftsmen and Italian engineers, for instance â feel that there is no room for them in this directive, but that is not the case.
In conjunction with the Commission, we shall try in future to solve specific problems through common platforms and other instruments.
MrÂ President, I shall conclude by thanking Parliament as a whole.
Parliament is in perfect agreement on this directive, and I am also very pleased at the exceptionally good relationship that we have had with the Presidency and the Commission.
That understanding has enabled us to reach a compromise on which everyone agrees, one that ennobles the work of the European Union, puts an end to daily bureaucracy and opens the door to a more certain and less bureaucratic future.
The directive we shall be adopting tomorrow is certainly a major innovation for our Europe, for the Europe that we all want.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , for his draft recommendation, which usefully completes the Council common position in some aspects and fully supports the essential objectives of the Commissionâs proposal.
I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Weiler, Mrs RÃŒhle and Mr Lambsdorff for their cooperation and constructive attitude in working towards an agreement with the Council on this vital piece of single market legislation.
As you all know, this directive is an important practical contribution to skills mobility.
It covers a large variety of issues of great interest to the professions and also to their clients.
A reasonable compromise on the text provides us with a major success story in the field of the internal market.
The final result strikes a balance between the right to free movement of fully qualified professionals and the need to protect consumers.
In particular, I welcome the maintenance of the five levels of qualification, which have played a central role in the operation of professional recognition at EU level over the last 15 years.
This solution ensures the transparency necessary for the application of the system and keeps existing guarantees for migrants.
The directive improves conditions of free movement for professionals through simpler and clearer rules, in particular for the temporary provision of cross-border services.
I am happy to acknowledge that Parliament has played a constructive role in achieving the right degree of flexibility for the provider of a professional service who wishes to exercise his activity elsewhere in the Union.
In an enlarged Europe, more effective systems for managing our legislation have become an absolute necessity.
The mechanisms and procedures provided for in the directive update the existing ones and should ensure its efficient implementation in the years to come.
In particular, the new regime for the automatic recognition of medical specialities reconciles the need for simplification with the legitimate demands of the profession.
For its part, the consultation of professional associations will provide the Commission with the technical advice necessary for the proper running of the system.
Toine Mandersâ suggestion, in this respect, at last weekâs trialogue was particularly welcome.
It enables us to ensure a proper and effective consultation of professional organisations and feed in the results of that consultation in the decisions to be taken through comitology.
Professional associations will thus be closely involved in the implementation of the directive.
Last, but not least, I appreciate the additions to the common position suggested by Parliament, such as those regarding: firstly, the possibility for professional associations to create professional cards; secondly, the possibility of further harmonisation for additional professions in the future; and, thirdly, the anti-abuse clause which will preclude so-called âqualifications shoppingâ.
To conclude, I wish to pay tribute to the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for their constructive approach that has enabled an agreement with the Council without the need for conciliation.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I may be stating the obvious when I say that this report is one of the most important to have been discussed in this House.
I would thus very much like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative it has taken, and Mr ZappalÃ  and the other groupsâ shadow rapporteurs on the work they have done.
Virtually on a daily basis, we have to explain to the people in our Member States that the free movement of goods has a concrete, positive benefit for many people.
It takes even greater effort to emphasise to them the importance of a good services directive, but people come to us to complain about the excessive barriers to mobility that they â whether as students, workers, self-employed, or in some other category â have to negotiate if they wish to work or move across borders.
It is therefore high time that we consolidate the fifteen directives on the recognition of professional qualifications which we have approved one by one over the years, and that we give this a cohesive legal framework with five levels, which moreover, should be easy to adapt.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats fully supports the result presented by the rapporteur today.
We cannot address all its aspects, but are pleased with the content nevertheless.
We are particularly pleased that an agreement has now been reached with the other institutions, at least that is what we hope, and that this issue can therefore be brought to a speedy conclusion.
Our group has responded favourably to the recognition of the specificity of professions and the individual character of the notaryâs office, of the role of professional organisations and to the way in which we are finally being allowed to know the content of this important directive and, on the basis of this, to deduce which areas are left over for the other important directive â that on the services market â with which we have yet to deal.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this compromise is, in part, the work of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and we will be voting in favour of it tomorrow.
This new directive covers employed persons and self-employed professionals in what are termed the regulated professions, that is to say, those in which skills are attested by qualifications, ranging from architects to heating engineers by way of nurses and pharmacists.
While incorporating ECJ rulings and making them permanent, it will also simplify matters, and that is precisely what we wanted â a balance between the right to free movement and settlement in Europe on the one hand and secured standards for professional qualifications and in consumersâ interests on the other.
As the Commissioner has just said, this directive can be seen as one of the services directives, and it is indeed meant to make the internal market simpler.
In terms of European internal market policy, then, it is the positive side of the coin, and my description of it as âpositiveâ is meant by way of comparison with the notorious services directive.
For the benefit of those who do not yet believe me, let me quote: âMigrant professionals shall be made subject to the same conditions for exercising a profession as the nationals of the host Member Stateâ, or, even more specifically: âThe qualification requirements of the host country must continue to be metâ.
That shows how important it is to us that the rules and regulations of the destination country or host country should be taken seriously and should not be allowed to be devalued in other areas.
We have achieved a great deal; among other things, we have managed, together with all our fellow Members, to get it stipulated that checks are carried out in the destination country, which may, if necessary, require guarantees, liability insurance, or even further training.
The polemics of various newspapers provided for a regrettable interlude and resulted in some people being unsettled.
Between first and second readings, there was division within the Council, which â and I stress that I am talking about the Council as a whole rather than about Luxembourg â showed itself somewhat hesitant.
It is not true to say that three months of evening classes are enough to equip heating engineers to do the job.
Nevertheless, despite the polemics of certain newspapers and certainly of certain trade associations, we have the result we wanted.
It is practicable; it has a significant effect on our chances in the internal market and on the publicâs opportunities.
We should now do everything we can to make good use of them and to enable the members of the public to experience Europe as we always intended it to be.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by highlighting the laudable and tangible determination of everyone concerned to reach agreement in this problematic matter.
Let me, then, take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , and the Members from the various groups â Mrs Weiler, Mr Wuermeling, and also Mr Manders from my own group.
There really has been very constructive cooperation, including, in the final stage, on the part of the Commission and the Council.
I think it should be stressed that this directive now enables us to achieve three essential things.
The first is that we are closer to completing the internal market.
Secondly, we are doing something to protect the consumer.
Thirdly, we are helping to reduce bureaucracy.
Let me start with the completion of the internal market.
The directive on professional qualifications is a vital step towards overcoming the barriers that exist in practice to freedom of movement and the freedom to provide services on our common internal market, and, in consequence, quite crucial in terms of making the EUâs citizens more mobile.
It must also be borne in mind, in connection with the freedom to provide services, that EU citizens will in future be acquiring a kind of driving licence, with which they can set off, with no fear of hindrance or discrimination, into the countries of the European Union, whether to settle down in one of them or to offer their services on a temporary basis.
At the same time, everything that is subject to the special provisions of this directive is removed from the scope of the services directive, about which there has been much discussion.
This leads me to hope that our agreement today will serve to objectify the debate on this important project.
If I may turn, secondly, to consumer protection, let me say that, whereas the services directive will govern the conditions under which service providers may operate, this directive is intended to ensure the necessary standard of professional qualifications.
This is in itself a significant achievement in terms of the protection of European consumers, in that they are given a guarantee that service providers do only those things that they are recognised as qualified to do.
We have therefore managed, by doing away with âqualification shoppingâ, to build in a safety mechanism to obviate the obtaining of entitlements by false pretences and this, too, is important in terms of consumer protection.
I might add that I am very pleased that it has been possible to bring the professional associations on board for the comitology procedure.
Their expertise will be very valuable.
It will, however, also be very important to include most of the artisanal crafts and trades in Annex II, enabling their particular qualifications to be given the recognition they deserve.
My third point has to do with the cutting back of red tape.
Over the past years, the existing rules on professional recognition became a rag rug of multifarious parallel regulations in different versions, all of which the public found complicated, baffling and, quite simply, scarcely manageable.
What we see happening with this directive, the objective of which is to bring together these various pieces of legislation, is a necessary paradigm shift from a bewildering multiplicity of approaches to regulation to one single general approach, finally subjecting various professions to a single legal regime that, being anchored to certain standards of qualification, helps to promote deregulation.
The adoption of the proposal for a directive, scheduled for tomorrow, is therefore a crucial step towards the completion of the European internal market, and one in favour of which my group will be voting.
I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is thanks to our rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , that the directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications will, tomorrow, by a large majority, pass through its second reading.
The new directive replaces a hotch-potch of 15 old ones, thus ensuring greater transparency and legal security.
This directive will make it easier for EU citizens to seize the opportunities they have to work in other European countries, something that the problematic state of the labour market in many Member States is making ever more important.
Although it removes unjustified restrictions on mobility imposed by an excess of bureaucratic regulation in Member States, there is no reason to fear that there will be a rush to âdumb-downâ qualifications.
Those who settle in a Member State on a permanent basis may be required to have passed an aptitude test or to have completed further training.
They register in their new country, rather than â as originally planned â in the one that they left.
This directive also stipulates that the right to monitor them remains with the country in which they have settled, and establishes minimum standards applicable across Europe for professions with which certain risks are associated, such as doctors, pharmacists, midwives and architects; the level of qualification is guaranteed by five levels dependent upon the length and standard of training.
It also imposes the obligation on professionals of informing clients or consumers about their qualifications.
We believe that this directive does a good job of striking a balance between the freedom of movement and quality protection, and I hope that the planned services directive will do nothing to interfere with this.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Freedom of movement for workers is one of the fundamental principles upon which the functioning of the common market is based.
Unfortunately, however, this principle is not always adhered to, as can be seen from the huge number of complaints received by both Parliamentâs Committee on Petitions and the SOLVIT system.
Many European countries have put in place various types of restrictions and deliberate obstacles that inhibit competition, hold back the development of the common market, prevent prices from falling and contribute to a reduction in the quality of labour.
I am in favour of introducing the simplest and quickest possible system for recognising professional qualifications, in order to ensure that the citizens of our countries can move about as freely as possible.
I am in no doubt that the compromise reached by the Council and Parliament will make it possible for this directive to be adopted, but it is a shame that Parliament appears once again to be putting the brakes on much-needed and courageous reforms proposed by the Commission.
Amongst other things, I refer to Parliamentâs proposals regarding the five levels of professional qualifications and the division into various professions that was mooted during the Commissionâs deliberations.
A system should be introduced for cases in which different rules are in force regarding the length of time it takes to gain a qualification in the country of origin and the country where the individual in question is working, so that either qualifications can be verified or any necessary and additional qualifications gained.
I should like to emphasise that the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications dovetails with the proposal for a directive on services, and in my opinion it would be in the best interests of the European Community as a whole if these directives were to be adopted as quickly as possible.
I find it regrettable that the Commissionâs initial proposal to allow experts to provide services on a temporary basis without completing the necessary formalities, pursuant to the country of origin principle, did not find favour.
I hope that the report that Parliament will adopt tomorrow will be another step on the road towards simplifying the provision of labour and services in different Member States, and that it will make it easier to move from one country to another.
It is my belief that this directive, along with the services directive, will bring us another step closer to the completion of the common market and to creating economic growth and new jobs throughout Europe, provided that the country of origin rules are observed.
Â Â  Mr President, as coordinator for the PPE-DE Group on the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I wish to pay special tribute to our rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , for piloting this very complex legislation safely through to a final conclusion.
There are a number of colleagues here who worked in the last Parliament; I see many familiar faces.
Many colleagues have worked together on this and it is a tribute to Mr ZappalÃ âs persistence that we now have a very good result.
I am delighted that we have managed to reach agreement without a need for conciliation.
It is sometimes easy to forget that mutual recognition of professional qualifications within the European single market has been one of the foundation stones of the whole of the internal market project.
This is a much-needed reform of the whole package.
It has been necessary to deal with the frustrations that have been felt by many professionals about some of the difficulties in accessing their rights under internal market legislation.
It is important we deal with those issues now, as part of our overall strategy to open up the internal market for services.
These are part of the same proposals.
There is no question, Mrs RÃŒhle, of one frustrating another.
They are all parts of a clearly integrated approach.
If you look at the Danish economic study on the opening-up of the internal market for services, it identifies professional qualifications as the area with the most potential for growth.
In terms of timing and linking these proposals together, I am really pleased that we now have this major reform, because it will be an indispensable building block of our overall approach.
I am sure that by the end of this year, or early next year, we will also have agreed a substantive proposal to open up the market for services.
This will allow qualified professionals to take advantage of the single market and use their skills to drive home the advantages for growth and jobs that an internal market for services must deliver.
Â Â  Mr President, many thanks are due to Mr ZappalÃ  for the good work he has done, but, in my capacity as the senior representative of the German Social Democrats in this House, I extend particular thanks to Mrs Weiler, who has made a decisive contribution to the debate and played her part in helping us to conclude this important piece of legislative work at second reading stage, without having to take things further, to the Conciliation Committee.
That is very important, and I am very glad of it.
I am also very glad that both this House and the Council have managed â and who would have thought this possible? â by means of this legislative document, and with such overwhelming consensus, to bring to nought the Commissionâs original approach, which relied on the country-of-origin principle.
I have heard a lot of people today expressing approval of the way we did this, with this law making a very clear statement that it was not the country-of-origin principle that would apply, for it is un-European, but that we were working on the basis of mutual recognition and wanted to continue to do so.
If we are to legislate with any consistency â just as the Commission was consistent in twice proposing the country-of-origin principle â it is now time for this House to be consistent and do the same thing with the services directive too.
That would be a good job of work, and we should do it.
I also saw it as significant that the new Commission, this time, accepted the proposal I had put forward at first reading for the adoption of European professional identity cards.
That is the right way to really drive forward mobility, the opening-up of markets, the opening-up of the borders that still, alas, exist in the European Union and to ensure that this works.
I wish us every success in the vote, which is to be held tomorrow.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications could open up new opportunities.
The purpose of the directive is to remove the factors restricting the free movement of people and services between the countries of the European Union.
In practice, the aim is to make it possible for people to practise their profession in a country other than the one in which their professional qualifications were obtained.
It is perfectly reasonable that the qualifications criteria that apply to a professional in the host country should be the same as those that apply to the nationals of that country.
The professional needs to show that he or she has the adequate level of education.
The host Member State, for its part, must be able to insist that the professional should have adequate language skills.
Language proficiency is of particular importance in the healthcare professions, where serious health and safety problems can result if patients cannot communicate in their own language.
We cannot promote the liberalisation of markets and free movement at the expense of patient safety and consumer protection.
We have to focus attention on the quality of the education received, and not merely the length of time taken, when we are determining the levels of professional qualifications.
The recognition of professional qualifications in another EU country cannot be allowed to hang on a matter of a few months if the education systems and quality of education are otherwise equivalent.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are very many examples â to be found not least in my own country â of the ways in which complicated and long drawn-out procedures are used to hinder the recognition of professional qualifications and hence to keep out competing outsiders, to the benefit of oneâs own people.
In Europe, it is often easier to get an American qualification recognised than one acquired in a neighbouring country.
The compromise we now have is well thought-out and a significant success, introducing as it does minimum standards for vocational and professional qualifications at five different levels, while, at the same time, preventing any devaluation of standards.
I will repeat what has already been said by previous speakers, that it is the host country principle rather than the country-of-origin principle that has been laid down as a minimum requirement for the various professions.
It is intended to be the basis for unambiguous rules intended to facilitate, if at all possible, the automatic recognition, in all Member States, of the professional qualifications of all EU citizens, whether they be employed or self-employed.
What has come out of the trialogue sessions is a comprehensive and good compromise, one that we Greens, too, are happy to recommend.
Â Â  Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the question we must ask ourselves today is one that we should in fact never cease to ask ourselves, namely whether the European Union is a union of institutions, states, governments and parliaments, or whether it is a union of citizens, people and Europeans.
Every time a qualification is not recognised, it is an individual who is left facing a problem and who suffers unfair treatment.
Of course, each and every one of us suffers whenever this happens, as the assistance we give the trade associations, guilds, trade unions and institutions in protecting their selfish interests makes the EU institutions less competitive.
It is the people whose qualifications are not recognised who suffer most, however, and who are prevented from taking up jobs for which they are qualified.
As Chairman of the Committee on Petitions, I am well aware of the extent of this problem in Europe.
We only see the tip of the iceberg, but it is the tip of a very large iceberg.
A great many people out there have been treated unfairly, including doctors, veterinarians, nurses and even lawyers and butchers, as the interests of these professions are being protected by professional associations.
The aim of the Commission directive was to remedy this state of affairs, and it did in fact largely succeed in doing so.
I should like to congratulate CommissionerÂ McCreevy on this score.
It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this directive has been ruined by Parliament.
Although we will vote in favour of it, as it is still better than nothing, we regard it as a failure.
I must add that I found the comments by MrsÂ Weiler, who said that the directive does not lay down European standards for recognising qualifications gained in the country of origin, quite unacceptable.
I have absolutely no idea how she came up with her ideas of what is and what is not European.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of Europe, and in order to ensure that Europe can really compete with the United States and the Far East, we must make it possible for people and institutions to be competitive.
There is an urgent need for this directive, and I find it regrettable that the version with which we have been left has so many shortcomings.
I should like to thank CommissionerÂ McCreevy for all he has done.
Â Â  Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the elimination of obstacles to the free movement of persons and services between Member States is one of the objectives of the Community.
Following the Lisbon European Council of 23-24 March 2000 the Commission presented its Internal Market Strategy for Services, aimed mainly at making the free provision of services within the Community as simple as it is in the individual Member States.
One of the key directives, closely linked to the Service Directive, is the directive on mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
It was drafted by means of a complicated inter-institutional legislative procedure that the Commission launched as early as the beginning of 2002.
It is encouraging to note that after sustained efforts of Member States extending over several years, this directive will finally establish a system of mutual recognition of professional qualifications that will enable the citizens of one Member State to look for employment in another Member State under the same conditions as the nationals of the host state.
The directive will establish rules for the performance of all professions, except for civil service positions in Member States and the positions of public notaries, that will be as broad as possible and that will facilitate the use of oneâs qualifications in a much broader space in the European labour market.
At present, the Union applies uniform rules to diploma recognition of only eight professions, including medical doctors, nurses, lawyers and architects.
There has been a notable omission of the profession of civil engineers, which has not been recognised with the relevant status at the European level.
This directive should remedy the situation.
As a result of adjustments introduced by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, five reference levels have been established, corresponding to a certain level of education and enabling comparisons between qualification requirements of individual Member States; they are welcome by such professional associations as the Chamber of Civil Engineers and the Chamber of Architects.
The procedure also should be simplified by the committee composed of the representatives of various professions that will deal with the recognition of professional qualifications.
To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zappala, for his dedication and endurance in writing this report, and to congratulate him on its unanimous adoption by the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Â Â  Mr President, we are all grateful to Mr ZappalÃ  who has been our very own service provider on this important measure.
It has made more progress in the last three months than in the previous three years.
That is, I believe, a happy augury.
The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is now seeing the fourth successful conclusion, at second reading, of an important piece of consumer protection.
I hope our fellow Members will recognise that.
The free movement of professionals is an important step in achieving the Lisbon Agenda.
It opens up opportunities in other Member States for dentists, doctors, construction workers and gas engineers that were often closed as a result of an effective âclosed shopâ among the professions.
I am very grateful that our three German colleagues directly address the reservations in their own Member State on this issue. This is in unmistakable terms in the light of the progress we should make.
This is an advance to balance free movement and competition, and ensure health and safety and consumer protection at one and the same time.
I commend it, and I hope the Commissioner will give it speedy effect.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that you called my name, but an entire party was involved in the trilogue which reached agreement.
The Commission listened carefully to what the options were and eventually adopted a few elements, without holding onto the rigid principles on which the Commission usually insists, for which I am grateful.
Mr Whitehead, our chairman, has already indicated that Mr ZappalÃ  has been a true strategist.
At times, I saw a likeness to Caesar who was equally capable of delaying battles.
I was convinced that this directive would never see the light of day, but we have only worked on it for the past three years and have already finished it.
I would therefore like to congratulate Mr ZappalÃ  for the strategic approach which I had failed to see in the first three years.
My apologies for this.
I have nothing but congratulations and praise.
The definition is clear.
I think that the professional card proposed in the first round by Mrs Gebhardt is an excellent addition to clarify qualifications using modern technology.
What I considered crucial, and that has also been adopted by the Commission and the Council, is that a liability scheme will in any case be put in place, particularly for the medical professions, because it is unacceptable for people employed in that sector on a temporary basis to be able to escape all disciplinary provisions and liability because of the temporary nature of the job.
I would therefore like to congratulate all those who have worked on what is â to my mind â a fantastic directive.
It is a cornerstone of the internal market which offers young people, in particular, scope for the future and by means of which, something which I also consider to be important, particularly women are still given the chance, even if they have started a family, to cash in on their professional training on the market by finding a good job.
I am pleased that mutual recognition has been mentioned, and in connection with the principle of the country of origin, I think that, if we do not stipulate any criteria, we are talking about the same definition.
After all, no conditions are prescribed in this directive, because training is provided in the country of origin.
Call it a licence: people with certain qualifications can work in other countries.
I consider this worth a debate.
It is very important to my mind that the Commission has adopted this and that there is now a duty to justify oneâs actions.
It is essential to obtain a legally sound Europe, but above all in order to obtain a democratically strengthened Europe.
I hope that with this directive today, we have demonstrated, and have given a very clear message, that we are all prepared to work on a stronger and prosperous Europe.
I should also like to thank our chairmen, MrÂ Gargani, the previous chairman, and Mr Whitehead, for their patience in this connection, and extend special thanks also to Mr ZappalÃ .
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, Mr ZappalÃ , ladies and gentlemen, this debate is very clear evidence of the good work done by everyone concerned.
Achieving a result like this in such a problematic subject area is something to which one must draw attention.
Our task is to make the four freedoms a reality in the European Union; our objective, to build the internal market, making it a domestic market for all â employers, workers and consumers alike.
This is a directive in the service of the Lisbon strategy, in the service of the internal market and in the service of the Constitution, and it is a directive in the service of âunity in diversityâ.
The directive also testifies to the European Unionâs desire that quality standards should be maintained rather than downgraded, and to our recognition of specific professional criteria.
For the first time, this directive modernises the Communityâs system for recognising professional qualifications.
It demonstrates the respect we have for what the liberal professions do for the common good; by it, we are visibly simplifying regulations and making them more transparent rather than adopting new ones, and demonstrably promoting the free movement of skilled workers, while affirming the bodies â such as professional associations â that represent their interests, rather than simply suffocating them in European red tape.
This directive is also, of course, evidence that, even now, the services directiveâs country-of-origin principle applies to none of the provisions of the directive on professional qualifications that apply in the destination country.
This means that this directive complements the services directive.
As they complement each other, I believe that the work we have done on this directive should be a good example for future work on the services directive.
Let us hope that our success will be just as evident when this debate is over.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted that we managed to approve this important directive this week, after a period of 40 years during which the situation was made very much more complex by the general sectoral directives, to the extent that one could, as the saying goes no longer see the wood for the trees.
I consider this to be an important step in terms of simplification and an important step forward.
You yourself, Commissioner, stressed that it is an honourable compromise in which we have struck a balance between the operation of the internal market with the highest possible level of free movement of professionals on the one hand, and quality training and respect for consumer interests on the other.
I think that with this debate, we have shown that these can be reconciled.
An example of this is in paragraph 3 of Article 5, where we replaced disciplinary provisions with rules of conduct.
The fact that a destination Member State can continue to impose national rules in this respect is not a protectionist measure at all, but no more and no less than proof of this balance.
I should like to echo the hope Mrs Gebhardt expressed, that we may follow the same path for the services directive where we also need to find this desperately needed balance.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank the honourable Members for their contributions.
This debate has shown that it is possible to find a broad consensus on an issue that provoked a good deal of controversy at first reading.
This makes me optimistic for other initiatives before this Parliament.
Some Members raised the question of the craftsmen or .
Let me clarify that.
The new directive in no way affects the national regulations on qualifications in the craft sector, nor does it entail any levelling down of national quality standards.
Two existing regimes for the recognition of professional qualifications in this sector are maintained: fully qualified craftsmen can apply either for recognition of their professional experience or for recognition of their formal qualifications, where appropriate, subject to an aptitude test or a supervised traineeship.
Moreover, the special structure of certain courses, amongst them the German qualification, is fully acknowledged.
I confirm that this special status can be extended to further courses through the adoption of implementing measures within the framework of the committee set up by this directive.
I wish to underline again that the valuable efforts made by the European Parliament and in particular by the rapporteur, Mr ZappalÃ , and the shadow rapporteurs have been essential for the successful outcome of this negotiation and the final adoption of this important proposal.
The Commission will hand over a detailed overview of the amendments that the Commission can accept for inclusion in the record of this part-session(1).
This overview confirms that the Commission fully endorses the agreement reached by the co-legislators.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
34 amendments can be accepted in their entirety.
These are Amendments 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54 and 55.
21 amendments must be rejected.
These are Amendments 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30 and 32.
Â Â  Â The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0121/2005) by MrsÂ HerranzÂ GarcÃ­a on the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (2004/2193(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am extremely pleased with the draft report to be put to the vote tomorrow in this Parliament, because it takes up â with some amendments, it is true â each and every measure I proposed in the initial draft.
In view of the broad support achieved in the Committee on Agricultural and Rural Development, I hope that this report will now receive the support of the immense majority of Members of this Parliament.
Nevertheless, the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has presented an amendment to the report urging the European Commission to present a legislative proposal as soon as possible.
The announcement by Commissioner Fischer Boel, who is here with us, that the reform of the sector would be postponed has caused great malaise amongst producers, a malaise which I would like this European Parliament to reflect.
The Commissionerâs announcement is a symptom of the lack of importance attached to such a significant sector as fruits and vegetables, and I would remind you once again that the fruit and vegetables sector represents 17% of the European Union's final agricultural production, a fact that the Commission has apparently not taken into account at this crucial time when the financial perspectives are being negotiated for a period of seven years.
I believe that the Commission's attitude leaves much to be desired and if I have understood the messages communicated recently by the Commissioner properly, the Community executive may include the reform as a section of a general proposal for the implementation of a single common organisation of the market for all agricultural products.
I believe that, if we do this, we will not be mixing like with like, since, until now, the fruit and vegetables sector has been given special treatment, which generally speaking has been positive, although it is occasionally necessary to introduce important changes.
Producers of fruits and vegetables originally experienced a degree of frustration as a result of being considered as a separate sector, with no right to direct aid.
Today, however, the special system, based on the existence of operational funds, co-funded by the growers, has provided them with a means for better adapting their production to the needs of the market.
Although the system has certain failings â which system does not? â and although it needs certain modifications aimed, in particular, at increasing the competitiveness of producers, it would be a mistake to include fruits and vegetables amongst all the other agricultural sectors.
This would mean dismantling the whole philosophy upon which the progress made so far in the sector has been based.
I would insist that I wish to reflect the discontent communicated to me by certain professional organisations at the postponement of these legislative proposals.
It is urgent that we carry out a reform in order to introduce new mechanisms, mechanisms for managing the market in order to deal with the difficulties being faced by certain parts of the sector and which will be accentuated following the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation.
A swift system for dealing with crises, controlled by the producersâ organisations, would enhance their role as managers of the market, which furthermore should serve as a draw for individual producers which have not so far found it beneficial to join these groupings. 60% of these producers do not belong to these groupings.
The draft report that I have presented to the European Parliament in fact proposes an alternative to the crisis management system in force, which would consist of the introduction of so-called âsafety fundsâ, managed by the groupings themselves, intended to finance withdrawals at times of serious crisis, reductions of production in the event of market saturation, and also the implementation of a system of insurance for incomes.
If properly organised, this âboxâ should become the instrument that the producersâ organisations currently lack for dealing with the ups and downs of the market.
The report also contains certain measures which are urgently required in order to respond to certain problematic situations, such as, for example, low membership of associations in the new Member States, and it also provides responses to the particular problem of soft fruits, for which a whole series of measures are proposed with a view to improving both a system for fresh fruits and vegetables and the system for processed fruits and vegetables, without forgetting the need to extend the campaigns promoting production, placing emphasis on Community origin.
Â Â  . I should like to start by thanking Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have done on this report.
The Commission communication on the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables had three aims.
The first was to describe how the Commission had started the simplification process; the second, to present a Commission working document analysing the principal figures of the sector, the implementation of the producer organisations and the related operational funds and budgetary aspects; and the third, to stimulate a debate in the Council, the European Parliament and within the sector.
Turning to the content of your report, let me begin with the role of the producer organisations.
They are and will continue to be the key element in the common market organisation.
I welcome your suggestions aimed at strengthening their role in the management of markets and the concentration of supply, notably concerning mergers, transnational producer organisations and specific measures focusing on the new Member States.
We should also consider the possibility of introducing new products and new categories of producer organisations.
Turning to crisis management, I should like to draw your attention to the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture of February 2005.
In addition to the horizontal measures for crisis management proposed in this context, we will evaluate the need to provide specific tools in the fruit and vegetable sector.
We will specially consider the proposal for creating mutual funds.
Concerning processed products, the Dutch presidency conclusions stated that the Commission should carry out an impact analysis.
That was to include a possible shift from the current regimes to an approach based on objectives and instruments already used in the CAP reform.
The Commission will, therefore, wait for the outcome of the impact analysis before proposing any alternative for processed products.
Following enlargement of the European Union, the Community is studying the situation concerning red fruits.
Once the studies are finished, we will consider the appropriate measures, both in the framework of the common market organisation and vis-Ã -vis imports from third countries.
I fully agree with you about the necessity of promoting fruit and vegetable consumption, taking into account the positive effects on public health.
I would also like to mention our horizontal instruments in the CAP for promoting these products.
The fruit and vegetable sector is one which has benefited from this.
As regards the increase in imports of fruit and vegetables from third countries, as WTO members, we cannot adopt measures inconsistent with our international obligations.
The most effective way to respond to market signals is to focus on quality.
We will carefully consider the possibility of introducing special labels of origin for processed products made exclusively from European raw materials.
With regard the compatibility of rural development instruments and the CMO operational funds, I can assure you that we will provide for measures which allow producers to benefit from both instruments, but avoid the possibility of double financing.
Â Â  . Mr President, whatever else I have to say, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a, for her clear position, and I should also like to congratulate our Commissioner for Agriculture, because in all the discussions about what we want, I have to say that she remains steadfast in the discussion about the financial perspectives and the question of cofinancing agricultural policy, which is in itself worthy of congratulation, as well as meaning that she, in any event, is standing up for a sector in Europe, and wants to maintain it.
I also welcome her remarks with regard to good impact studies into the fruit and vegetable sector in order to be able to choose a sound approach which will enable us to work in a more market-oriented manner, and also her remarks with regard to the requirement that it should be possible to label products from Europe effectively so that there is no doubt as to their origin.
That, in itself, is a sound approach.
I should also add a small critical note, because impact studies lead me to the conclusion that, in Europe, certainly after the EUâs enlargement, it has become more difficult for European fruit and vegetable growers â who generally work without subsides and in a market-oriented manner â to keep their heads above water.
The extensive concentration on the demand side in the form of supermarkets is not backed by reinforced producer organisations in the sector itself.
If the sector wishes to survive in Europe, it has to be able to work under the conditions that apply to import products.
Labelling is crucial in this respect, and the Commission should devote more attention to this aspect in future plans.
Secondly, there is no denying that a huge number of growers in the ten new Member States have problems integrating in the European market.
It is vital that this problem be addressed more forcefully by setting up producer organisations and by ensuring that the growers in the new countries are also able to gain a foothold in the market compared to huge supermarket chains.
Thirdly, if there is less bureaucracy, it is more likely that the money for these funds will be spent wisely.
It is unacceptable that, as is at present the case, 25% of the money should go unspent.
It is crucial that the Commission should look into this without delay in order to ensure that the money can be spent as yet.
If it cannot be channelled directly to producer organisations, then the budget that is left over, in the light of major frost damage in large parts of Europe and other natural disasters, including drought, can still be spent in the sector in order to ensure that it survives these difficult times.
In any event, I should like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for a reasonably constructive attitude.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, we all agree on the need expressed here to make certain adjustments to the current COM with a view to confronting the new challenges facing the sector, but nobody wants a reform that goes any further than those needs, and this is expressed in the report.
The initiative report we are debating today has broad support, majority support in fact, not just in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but also, I hope, in this Parliament and, above all, in the sector itself â which is not easy â and it takes up many of the points that my group, the Socialist Group, advocates and has introduced in the form of amendments: greater flexibility for the OPCHs, the need to clarify access to operative funds and to make it less bureaucratic, to promote associations and to work on the concentration of supply and the need to protect our producers from third countries, management of crisis situations, etc.
The Commission asked this Parliament for its opinion on the form the coming reform of the fruit and vegetables sector should take.
Here are our responses, the responses agreed by Parliament and by the parties in question.
We now hope that they will be taken into account both in terms of time and in terms of substance.
I would like to remind the Commission that the report calls clearly for a legislative proposal to be presented before this summer with a view to enhancing and improving the role of producersâ organisations fundamentally in the management of the market; the future of this sector lies in the market, and the market is the future.
We must not forget that the fruit and vegetables sector is dynamic, but at the same time very fragile, and there is great instability in the markets.
For these reasons, we want a reform that takes account both of Parliament's report and of the demands of farmers themselves and, above all, that it be maintained and serve to improve agricultural income.
Finally, we are following the Doha Round negotiations very closely, with a view to introducing these agricultural products as sensitive products.
Furthermore, it appears that the Commissioner has put forward the idea of replacing numerous COMs with a single COM or a single legal text.
It goes without saying that we disagree with this, given the risk this decision poses to the sector, and given the insecurity that this announcement alone has created right away.
I would like to end by thanking the rapporteur for her willingness to reach this consensus, not just in the committee, but also here in Parliament, and I hope that the Commission will show goodwill in terms of the future, since that is what the sector is impatiently awaiting.
Â Â  . â Mr President, the fruit and vegetable sector is one of the most dynamic and that is why it is rightly being debated.
It accounts for 17% of agricultural products and only receives 4% of agricultural resources.
At the same time, it employs a sizeable section of the agricultural and manual workforce.
We already have the draft proposal to revise the common market organisation from the Commission which, I think, benefits processors, but not small and medium-sized farms.
However, I think that today's proposals do not help either; they do not improve the situation, given that the assessments contradict what is being proposed.
For example, the decoupling of aid from production for fruit and vegetables is being proposed, while agreement is being expressed with the mid-term review of the CAP, the core of which is the decoupling of aid from production.
Furthermore, agreement is being expressed with the WTO and, at the same time, it is being proposed that fruit and vegetables be kept out of WTO negotiations.
Producer groups are being extolled but, at the same time, it is estimated that they do not function well, it having been found that only 40% of production passes through them and that they only take up 25% of resources.
Basically, I would say, the fact is being concealed that producer groups function as intermediaries between farmers and wholesalers and industry, giving the latter benefits such as cheap raw materials.
Nor is the proposal for a cofinanced fund a solution, given that farmers will be left to pick up the bill for the various crises and the repercussions from the WTO.
On balance, we believe that both the review of the CAP and the negotiations with the WTO will be at the expense of the income of small and medium-sized fruit and vegetable farms, while wholesalers and industry will benefit, securing fruit and vegetables at even lower prices and reaping huge profits.
That is why it is unfair and we cannot vote for it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to voice my immense concern about possible imports of red fruit from Asia in 2005.
Poland has 450Â 000 farms producing red fruit.
Last year, red fruit imports from Asia caused a disaster.
Prices fell to a point where fruit was no longer even picked.
Another year like that will spell the end for 200Â 000Â farms.
At five persons a family, that will mean a million people with no income this autumn: an unjustifiable social disaster.
A farmer who loses his land and therefore his work also loses his home because he sells the land on which his house is built.
He also loses his roots because he has to move far away to the town to look for work.
However, there are no jobs to be had in the towns in Poland.
Officially, 20% of the population are unemployed.
Driven from their homes by an irresponsible economic policy, the sad truth is that farmers are highly likely to turn to crime.
Another consequence will be massive emigration to the west and a realisation that the idea that the European Union was based on the principle of Community preference was a colossal lie.
If you want the Poles to reject the European Constitution, carry on importing red fruit from Asia, but have the honesty to tell the Polish farmers that no one is interested in their fate.
At least that will be clear.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, MrsÂ HerranzÂ GarcÃ­a, I very much welcome this motion for a resolution, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for having ensured that it also covers the situation in the new Member States.
Polish farmers have voiced objections to production quotas, and complained that they are finding it difficult to sell their products.
In the limited time available to me, I should like to touch upon an issue which may be minor, but is nevertheless of great importance.
Fruit and vegetables in the EU are over-priced.
In addition, fruit is overripe and tasteless.
We should improve the quality of our products and ensure that there continues to be a rich diversity of varieties, especially as far as seasonal fruit is concerned.
In Poland it is still possible to buy extremely flavoursome varieties of apple that I have never seen, and undoubtedly never will see, in Brussels.
I only ever eat tomatoes and cucumbers in Poland, because they lack any taste in the old EU.
We should offer cheaper and fresher fruit and vegetables to our citizens, whilst ensuring that fruit and vegetable growers are paid a decent wage.
We should not allow the abundance of local fruit varieties to be diminished.
Â Â  Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the major EU enlargement in 2004 presented us with new challenges and new problems.
Although we have already spent a year working together, we have unfortunately not succeeded in putting right the mistakes made during the negotiations on the accession of the new Member States.
We all appreciate that decisions require time and thought, but we are also aware of a great many urgent matters that will brook no delay.
One such matter is the much-needed regulation of the fruit and vegetable market.
It is a matter of great importance to the new Member States that protective measures are put in place on the markets for soft fruit and apples.
European producers are facing enormous problems and suffering tragic consequences as a result of the influx of soft fruit such as strawberries, currants, raspberries and cherries, from China, Morocco and Serbia.
Polish producers and processors have been particularly hard hit, as Poland produces around 50% of all soft fruit in the European Union, as well as being a major apple producer.
Following a number of interventions on the matter by myself and other Members, I am delighted that the President of Parliament and Parliamentâs Committee on Agriculture have turned their attention to this issue, with the latter having taken a very professional approach to the problem.
The end result of this has been that the Commission has also taken the matter seriously, and has sent a delegation to Poland to carry out on-the-spot investigations.
I hope this delegation will complete its work before the fruit-buying season starts, and that we will manage to provide the necessary assistance and take the necessary measures before it is too late.
Ladies and gentlemen, the report MrsÂ HerranzÂ GarcÃ­a has presented to the House merits particular attention, and the Commission should therefore draw the right conclusions from it and get down to work without delay.
If we were to put off dealing with this problem, we would merely be running away from much-needed solutions and making matters even worse for many farmers and European producers, as well as giving rise to misunderstanding and disquiet among the public.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I was concerned and troubled to learn that you will be postponing the submission of legislative proposals for fruit and vegetables over the next two years.
If this statement or intention of yours is true, then I believe that you are consciously leaving the CMO in fruit and vegetables out of the revised common agricultural policy and exposing these products and producers to numerous financial and international risks.
The report by Mrs Garcia, whom I have to congratulate, constitutes a correct basis for you to submit your proposals by the autumn at the latest.
I should also emphasise certain particularly important issues, such as:
Firstly, the Commission must immediately propose realistic proposals for producer groups within the framework of a simplified system and regime, so that they include the characteristics of each region and there is balanced use of the resources available in the sector.
Secondly, there is room to improve the threshold system for processed products, although any changes here must not affect the existing balances between the Member States.
I believe, Commissioner, that your proposals for fruit and vegetables will not be confined solely to making arrangements for or changes to processed products.
Thirdly, special attention must be paid within the framework of your international negotiations.
Low outside protection for fruit and vegetables already needs to be taken into account under the special arrangements for which provision is made for sensitive products and when regulating a methodology for equivalents for duties.
The CMO in fruit and vegetables, with the operational programmes, the existence of a fund and the mandatory formation of producer groups, constitutes an operating standard for the markets in agricultural products.
Do not disappoint the producers who have made sacrifices in order to adjust and adapt to this model.
You should wipe out unfair competition, help them to win new markets and help them to improve the production of quality products.
You can do it.
Â Â  Mr President, I must congratulate the rapporteur for producing what, even by general standards of EU documentation, is 19 pages of the most unreadable, bureaucratic gobbledy-gook, all of which comes under the laughable heading of âsimplificationâ of the market in fruit and vegetables!
Never in the field of vegetable and fruit cultivation has so much been said to so little purpose.
However, I would draw Membersâ attention to paragraph 46, which reminds the Commission that imports from third countries do not always provide the levels of safety and quality that the European consumer has grown accustomed to: hence the need to guarantee that third country products meet the same safety and quality requirements as European Union products.
Roughly translated that means that non-EU countries can produce their goods cheaper, and this must be stopped at all costs.
That is crude protectionism and seeks to preserve the EU fruit and vegetable market as a cocooned environment, controlled by suffocating bureaucracy which outside competition must never be allowed to penetrate.
However, it is regulations that Mrs Herranz GarcÃ­a wants, even on pot herbs and parsley!
Rhubarb gets a mention as well, but I shall resist the obvious joke, except to say that unlike the EU, the industry does not want to talk rhubarb, it only wants to grow it!
I urge Members to reject this report or, at the very least, require it to be translated from the original bureaucracy into plain language, so that we can all understand.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for being here with us this evening.
I hope that you will communicate to the Commission the clear and firm message that this Parliament is against the postponement of the reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, announced by yourself a short time ago.
The fruit and vegetables sector is active in practically every country of the European Union and it suffers from the same problems everywhere.
The current COM has proven to be effective, but it needs to be improved and a new system must be introduced that is more effective at managing crises and specific measures must be implemented for products that are subject to strong import pressures.
That is not protectionism.
I am from Castilla-La Mancha, which is a great garlic-producing region.
Garlic is an example of a product that has to deal with ferocious imports, mainly from China, which threaten the survival of many farms.
I am delighted that the report takes up measures in favour of this category of products and at the same time advocates a simplification of the import system in force, in order to prevent the irregularities we are witnessing as a result of the existence of three different formulae that operators may employ, as they wish, thus promoting fraudulent practices about which the sector has on occasions complained to the European Commission.
I also agree with the raft of proposals included in the report to improve the competitiveness of the sector and to take the best possible advantage of the budget available, which is underused year after year as a result of the lack of flexibility of the current COM.
The failings of the system, such as a large amount of bureaucracy, the legal insecurity of the producersâ associations and the Community's lack of generosity in terms of incentivising the concentration of supply, are the main reasons why the system implemented in 1996 has become inefficient.
This means that funds are not being used properly, and I hope that this problem will be resolved by means of the new proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, fruit and vegetable cultivation carry significant weight within agriculture.
In this sector, it is especially important that producers act jointly, as it is an essential condition for market success, but it requires the development of organised cooperation.
However, the degree of organisation is very low in the ten new Member States, and forming producer organisations (hereafter POâs) is a long and tedious process.
It is therefore vital to support PO subsidy, and especially to encourage the formation of POâs and provide additional support for newly-formed POâs.
For this reason it would be necessary to increase the current ceiling of contributions in proportion to sales revenue from 4.1% to 6%.
It is of crucial importance to coordinate market measures (first pillar) with rural development (second pillar).
The European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund allocations would not sufficiently finance infrastructure and investment development, therefore, rural development funding should be made available to POâs.
The fruit and vegetable sector in the new Member States requires restructuring.
There are many old orchards, especially apple orchards, which have an impact on the EU market by driving the prices down as a result of poor quality produce, creating a crisis situation on the European fruit and vegetable market.
Therefore, it is important that the EU gives support to clear and restructure old plantations.
Just like the case of the school milk programme, subsidised by EU funds, a scheme promoting fruit consumption in schools should be introduced in order to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market.
There are many strategically important products that are not able to receive market support within todayâs framework.
In the case of berries, sour cherry and mushrooms, stronger crisis management measures are warranted.
They need to be included among processed products, and we must also appeal for the protection of sweet corn against Chinese imports.
I thank Commissioner Boel for her letter, and I hope a solution has been found.
Â Â  Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the EUâs most recent enlargement brought a number of changes to the fruit and vegetable market.
The EU studies of the candidate countries in its annual reports.
Yet although the Commission noted in its studies that the EU would gain as many as 19Â new varieties of fruit and vegetables with the accession of the new Member States, and that this would increase the EUâs self-sufficiency in food and please consumers, no changes were made to the organisation of the market on the basis of these facts.
This means that we are faced with a bizarre situation whereby a special support mechanism exists for a variety of plum, whilst nothing of the sort exists for apples, despite the fact that the latter account for 32% of all fruit picked, which makes them the most popular type of fruit.
Support mechanisms are in place for nuts and bananas, but there is not a single one for any of the huge variety of soft fruits, which by their very nature have an extremely short shelf life, and are therefore subject to price fluctuations.
I should like to remind the Commissioner that yet another season is passing us by without any sensible solutions having been found.
The policy applied to the 15Â old Member States remains more advantageous than that applied to the 10Â new Member States, and it would appear that the Commission is merely pretending to take action, rather than coming up with practical solutions.
In a bid to win time, a special team of inspectors has been sent to Poland.
This is an unfortunate game to play in view of the urgent need to stabilise the fruit and vegetable market and to secure the existence of thousands of producers and their families, in particular in the new Member States.
What is more, it is a risky game to play in view of the fact that consumers are the ones who have to suffer the effects of price fluctuations, and put up with poor-quality fruit that has had to be imported from third countries and poses a health risk.
There is, however, a very simple solution.
The new Member States can provide a guaranteed supply of high-quality soft fruit and apples.
Supporting the former should therefore be made a matter of priority, by placing restrictions on imports, unless, of course, people wish to take an entirely different approach to European solidarity, and use the common agricultural policy to cover additional quotas.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, MrsÂ Fischer Boel, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament resolution on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables addresses a serious situation in European agriculture, which calls for rapid and effective responses.
I congratulate the rapporteur on having confronted the difficulties in this sector and for having put forward some suitable solutions.
I am sure that the Commissioner will take the concerns expressed by Parliament into consideration.
The fact that the amendment that I tabled for introducing labels of origin for processed products has been accepted is a step forwards.
Indeed, it is not only the textile industry that is suffering from Asian competition: the origin of processed agricultural products needs to be made transparent so that consumers can find out from the label where the products they buy come from.
This proposal is particularly important for the processed tomato sector, which is a leading sector of the Italian economy in terms of both domestic production and exports.
In 2004, a large proportion of the tomatoes in our fields were left unharvested: the huge amounts of processed tomatoes arriving from China at rock-bottom prices and without any health guarantees have thrown the sector into crisis.
Chinese preserves are reprocessed in Italy, often mixed with Italian products and then resold as if made in Italy, so that the consumer cannot recognise their true origin.
Labelling will be an essential guarantee of quality and transparency.
Secondly, the Committee on Agriculture adopted the proposal on the need for immediate reform to address the recurrent market crises in the fresh fruit sector.
Several parties are calling for reform to strike a balance between supply and demand and to manage surpluses.
I hope the Commissioner will consider the need to shorten the time frame: the two-year period she has mentioned is too long.
I should like to conclude by recalling that the fruit and vegetable sector is heavily penalised compared with other areas of agriculture: it receives only 4% of Community resources and requires cofinancing contributions that are too onerous for producers.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on the quality of her work.
I would also like to stress the importance of revising the common market organisation (CMO) in fruit and vegetables as soon as possible, as the European Commission promised to do in its communication of 10Â August last.
There is in fact a consensus for keeping the common market organisation in its present form.
It is not therefore necessary to overhaul it completely.
However, the crises that occurred during the last marketing years, in south-west France for example, showed the urgent need to adapt the CMO mechanisms.
In the matter of crisis management, first of all, we need to be able to respond quickly and effectively to overproduction crises.
A surplus of 5 to 10% in supply brings a 30 to 50% slump in prices.
It seems to me, therefore, that the ceiling for authorised withdrawals should be raised to 20% of production.
So far as the budget is concerned, I would point out that producers are making great efforts.
They produce 15% of the value of European agricultural output but receive only 3.5% of aids.
For my part, I believe the budget made available to producer organisations must be increased from 4.1% to 6% of the value of production marketed.
The quality of local produce is essential and it must be respected.
Finally, regarding the relationship between producers and the distribution sector, I propose that the European Union should encourage the joint trade organisations recognised in each Member State to devise codes of good conduct to avoid sudden collapses in prices paid to producers.
I will close on the external dimension of this matter, which is crucial.
It is essential that the level of market opening should be controlled and regulated: Community preference must be maintained, fruit and vegetables must be included in the list of sensitive products and there must be reciprocity in the opening of agricultural trade, including plant health aspects; these, finally, must be the European Unionâs demands at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting in December 2005 and in bilateral trade agreements.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the market in fruit and vegetables has been subject to wide fluctuations in price since time began; it is something to which producers have â more or less â grown accustomed.
In the past, intervention by way of market withdrawals failed to improve the sectorâs stability, and so, in 1996, the reform of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables introduced a new instrument in the shape of what was termed the operational funds, thus transferring resources from intervention to a modern and forward-looking instrument.
It is now for us to come up with progressive instruments for the fruit and vegetables sector.
We cannot work on the basis of a âreturn to old-style interventionâ, still less to developing and extending it, or of a crisis management system existing to deal only with crises in the market.
As I understand it, a modern crisis management system should also bear the brunt of crises brought on by the weather, for example, by supporting multi-risk insurance.
This is something we should think about.
It is not enough, where processed products are concerned, simply to plead the cause of production thresholds, which are antiquated and obsolete, and of processing aid.
Why do we not also give thought to decoupling aid in the fruit and vegetable processing sector?
Now that decoupling characterises the whole of the reform of the common agricultural policy, it ought also, for the sake of consistency, to apply here.
The Commission has decided to proceed with the simplification of the common organisation of the market in fresh fruit and vegetables and with the revision of the COM in processed fruit and vegetables, both in 2006.
As regards fresh fruit and vegetables, the requirements of a modern market organisation are, today, largely met.
I am persuaded that the common organisation of the market in processed fruit and vegetables is in need of fundamental reform.
More good approaches are required.
Here in Europe, there is a need for a fundamental debate on this, and a market-oriented sector needs indications as to the way it should go in future.
Â Â  Â Â Â The accession of 10Â new Member States to the European Union meant that changes had to be made to the instruments establishing the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables, in order both to speed up the rate at which producer groups and organisations were set up and began to function effectively, and to prevent a disaster occurring on the market.
There are very few producer organisations in the new Member States, with the figure in Poland currently standing at around 1.5% of the market.
The new Member States should receive more assistance to ensure producer groups that have been provisionally recognised remain in existence and are properly managed.
There is also a need for specific financial support instruments.
Furthermore, permission should be granted for the setting up of organisations of various groups of producers, such as producers of fruit for processing or of vegetables for processing.
At this point, it should also be pointed outÂ that a characteristic feature of the soft fruit market is its high price sensitivity, due to fluctuations in production and the growing volume of imports from non-EU third countries.
Uncontrolled imports mean that European farmers, including Polish soft fruit producers, are currently facing disaster.
What are needed are measures to ensure long-term stability in this market.
These should include an increase in the number of checks carried out on imported goods, which would also prevent any influx of low-quality products into the EU.
The issuing of certificates of origin should form a mandatory part of these inspections, and the Commission should consider introducing import quotas for these sensitive products.
All that the Commission is proposing, however, is to carry out studies and to take other measures that it has not explained in any detail.
In other words, it is proposing to sit back and wait.
Â Â  Â Â Â Todayâs debate on measures to simplify the fruit and vegetable market has prompted me to voice more general considerations on the nature of changes to the common agricultural policy.
As an MEP from Poland, a new Member State, both I and many of my colleagues have been taken aback by the sudden change that has become apparent in the EUâs overall approach to the economy, and in particular to agriculture.
Before we joined the EU, we regarded it as a closed structure and a closed market, to which we could only gain access with great difficulty.
Now that we are in the EU, we hear of nothing but liberalisation.
We are supposed to liberalise our markets in fruit and vegetables, sugar and milk and everything else under the sun, and open them up to the rest of the world.
We joined a different EU to the one we are in now.
Poland produces half of all soft fruit in the EU, including cherries, currants and raspberries, and Polish Members of this House have called on the Commission on several occasions and via a number of channels to put protective measures in place for the soft fruit market.
Each and every time we were told that this would not happen, because the market needed to be liberalised, and that we must open up our market in order to show solidarity with poor countries wishing to export goods onto our markets.
Solidarity is a fine word, and we Poles are particularly aware of its value.
Yet solidarity must not mean inflicting other peopleâs poverty upon us.
We cannot allow our farmers to go bankrupt and fall into poverty so that other people can sell their products in the EU.
A particularly good reason why this must not be allowed is that there are serious concerns that liberalisation is of greater benefit to speculators than to farmers from poor countries.
I continue to believe that it would be a good idea to put protective measures in place and to impose restrictions on imports of fruit onto the EU market.
I support MrsÂ HerranzÂ GarcÃ­aâs report in full, and I very much appreciate the work she has put into drafting it.
Â Â  . Once again I should like to thank the committee for its own-initiative report on the simplification of the common market organisation for fruit and vegetables.
I have listened carefully and I can assure you that the Commission will analyse this final report very closely before presenting proposals for the fruit and vegetable sector.
The presidencyâs conclusions of November 2004 recognised that the path undertaken with the 1996 reform should be continued in the fresh fruit sector also.
However, the Commission was also asked to carry out an impact analysis on all aspects of processed fruit and citrus.
That analysis will be available at the beginning of 2006.
For the sake of coherence, the Commission decided to present a global proposal covering both fresh and processed fruits.
On crisis management, in the framework of the communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture, as well as the horizontal options identified in this context, the Commission considers that specific needs should be looked at on a case-by-case basis in the context of the CMO reviews, even for the fruit and vegetable sector.
Accordingly, the Commission will consider carefully the creation of a mutual stabilisation fund based on public and private co-financing.
With regard to soft fruit, the Council has also requested that the Commission carry out the appropriate analysis of the new situation in the European market resulting from enlargement and, if necessary, bring forward proposals specifically to address these issues.
The Commission has already started the analysis of the soft fruit sector in the new Member States.
Officials from the agriculture and trade directorates have just come back from a visit to Poland.
When this study is finished, we will analyse the results and, if necessary, appropriate measures will be taken in due course.
As a member of the WTO, we cannot adopt protectionist measures considered obstacles to imports.
The most effective and efficient way to respond to market signals is to focus on the quality of our products and improve the competitiveness of our sector.
We could do that using two different tools.
As I have already said, one involves strengthening producersâ organisations, so that we prevent producers from competing against one another; and the second, the possibility of strengthening our promotional initiatives, which could be helpful.
Some of you raised the issue of the import of fruit and vegetables from third countries, in particular red fruits.
Third country imports have to meet the standards that we apply in the Community.
Member States must check products entering into the Community and should notify the interception of non-compliant products to the Commission through our rapid alert system.
Based on the information that we have, provided by that system, only three interceptions of fresh and frozen fruit, which did not meet our standards, took place in the period from January 2002 to April 2005.
Given the large quantity that is imported, it is my opinion that this is a very small amount.
As regards the introduction of special labelling of origin, I can assure you that I will be positive in my approach to that.
I can only stress the great importance of this specific sector to the Member States, both from an economic and a job-creation point of view.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0096/2005) by MrÂ Wojciechowski, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch (COM(2004) 772 â C6-0014/2005 â 2004/0269(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall start by thanking MrÂ Wojciechowski and the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for all the work they have carried out on this report.
I would like to place this proposal in its context.
On 26 June 2003, the Council adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy which significantly changes the way that the European Union supports the agricultural sector.
As far as potato starch is concerned, 40% of the aid paid to the producer has been decoupled and included in the single farm payment scheme.
After enlargement, six of the ten new Member States have been involved in the potato starch quota system for the first time in 2004-2005 marketing year.
Since the potato starch production quotas were introduced in 1995, we have been trying to define a strategy to secure, enhance and promote the development of this very important sector.
I return to the proposal discussed today.
It is of vital importance to preserve the stability of this fragile sector, while at the same time taking into account the fundamental changes due to the reform of the CAP and enlargement.
Firstly, to roll over the quotas for two years instead of the three years foreseen in Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1868/94.
This time-frame should allow us to analyse the initial effects of the CAP reform and enlargement on the potato starch sector and enable us to act quickly should the need arise.
Secondly, to roll over the existing quotas which have provided a stable market in the eight old Member States taking part in this regime.
I am well aware of the fears in certain new Member States that their quotas negotiated in their accession treaties and based on a historical reference period might be too small.
As usual, the development of the potato starch sector in all Member States will be closely monitored in the years to come.
The Commission appreciates the contribution of the Agriculture Committee to the development of this area.
Several of the proposed amendments, however, go beyond the scope of the Commissionâs proposal, especially as far as the time-frame for the proposal is concerned.
Because a prolongation of four years would not allow us to react quickly to possible imbalances in the European starch market, the Commission cannot accept this amendment in the context of the proposal at hand.
The amendment concerning the transfer of quotas to new Member States certainly raises issues of great importance to the countries concerned.
However, experience has shown that the starch potato yield fluctuates a lot, depending on climatic conditions.
Allowing for the possibility of transnational balancing-out, with priority given to the new Member States, might incite starch producers in these Member States to increase the areas under contract, hoping for a transfer of unused quotas from other Member States, which could lead to a significant overshoot of their quotas in years when the climatic conditions in the European Union are favourable for potato growing, thus aggravating their situation.
In conclusion, the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report.
Â Â  .Â Â Â Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Agriculture was confronted with two problems whilst drafting this report.
The first was the question of how long, or in other words how much longer the present quota system should remain in force, and the second was the question of how much, or in other words whether the quota levels should be changed.
With regard to the first of these questions, the Committee on Agriculture decided that the quota system should remain in place for the next four marketing years, rather than for the two proposed by the Commission.
The Committee was swayed by the argument that this should be a long enough period to enable potato and starch producers to prepare production plans well in advance.
The two years suggested in the proposal would be too short a period for such plans, and it was for this reason that the Committee on Agriculture adopted an amendment proposing a longer period of four years.
A heated debate ensued on the second question, however, regarding whether or not changes should be made to quota levels.
Much of the debate focused on the question of whether the new Member State had been treated unfairly, since the quotas they were allocated during the accession negotiations did not correspond to their production potential.
Whilst the quotas for the 15Â old Member States account for 89% of the total EU quota of 1Â 947Â 000Â tonnes, those for the 10Â new Member States amount to only 11% of this figure.
I would remind the Commissioner and the House that the figures show clearly that the 10Â new Member States produced more potatoes that the 15Â old Member States as recently as 1999, with around 1Â 400Â 000Â hectares of potatoes grown in the old Member States as opposed to 1Â 600Â 000Â hectares in the new Member States.
The situation has altered somewhat in the meantime, as a result of a sudden drop in the quantity of potatoes grown in the 10Â new Member States, but production levels remain very high.
Poland, the EUâs largest potato producer, was given as an example during the debate.
Although large swathes of Polandâs potato-growing areas have been abandoned, the country remains the leading potato producer.
In spite of this, however, its production quotas are several times lower than those allocated to Germany, The Netherlands, or France.
This reduced quota means that Poland, a potato giant, does not produce enough starch to meet domestic demand, and has to import large quantities of this product.
The other new Member States, in particular Lithuania, are facing similar problems.
Conversely, it was pointed out that although the 15Â old Member States have been allocated high starch production quotas, these quotas have not been filled for many years.
Over the course of the past six years, for example, the quotas were only filled in 2001, and the shortfall in the remaining years ranged from 3% to 17%.
As was noted, it is extremely unfair that certain countries fail to fill their quotas whilst others are struggling to survive because their quotas are too low.
The Committee on Agriculture decided that both an increase in the overall quota and changes to the quotas allocated to individual countries would be out of the question.
This decision was mainly motivated by a concern that the market would collapse if production increased.
A broad compromise was reached within the Committee, however, which led to an alternative idea of a âbalancing-outâ, whereby countries would be provided with the opportunity to transfer any unfilled quotas.
In view of the problems faced by the new Member States, the Committee on Agriculture has proposed a solution that will allow any quotas that have not been filled, as has frequently been the case in recent years, to be transferred.
The new Member States would be the first to benefit.
I should point out to the Commissioner and the House that this is an extremely good solution, as it does not involve increasing the total production quota, placing the market at risk or disrupting the delicate balance of the system.
It would, however, provide us with an opportunity to redress the unfair allocation of quotas, at least in instances where quotas are not filled by certain countries.
I should like to extend my very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Agriculture, whatever their political persuasion, for having unanimously adopted this compromise proposal.
I commend this compromise to the House and to the Commission, in the sincere hope that the proposal for a balancing-out will find its way into the new proposal for a regulation.
I would also reiterate that this is an extremely ingenious and much-needed compromise, and one that demonstrates the solidarity between the old and the new Member States that we must aspire to.
Â Â  , . â The issue of the production quotas of potato starch is very important for some of the new Member States of the EU, primarily for Lithuania and Poland.
The problem is that the Agreement on the Accession to the European Union has established a very small quota for Lithuania for the production of the potato starch â 1 211 tonnes per year, which constitutes only 0.06% of the quota of the European Union.
The quota for Lithuania, as you know, was established according to the reference period of the years 1998-2000, the period of the lowest production of potato starch in Lithuania, and it does not comply at all with the present requirements.
I would like to draw the attention of colleagues and members of the European Commission to the fact that this quota does not even ensure the minimal economically justified utilisation of the capacity of the factories of this industry in Lithuania.
The industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania is composed of only two factories.
The total technological capacity of those two factories is 13 000 tonnes of potato starch per year.
Thus at present the Lithuanian factories operate using only 9% of their capacity.
If todayâs quota remains the same for the next several years, that will mean the disruption of the industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania.
The minimal, economically justified utilisation of the capacities of the factories would only be 4-5 thousand tonnes of potato starch per year; therefore, Lithuania requests increasing its quota to at least 4Â 855 tonnes per year, and that would comprise 0.25% of the quota for the European Union.
In this context I would like to emphasise that during recent years the potato starch production quota for the European Union has not been exhausted, and therefore Lithuaniaâs request to increase the quota from 0.06 to 0.25% of the general level of the potato starch production quota for the European Union definitely will not have an essential effect on the indicators of the internal market of the European Union.
However, the most important thing is that if the potato starch production quota for Lithuania is increased, that would secure social stability, workplaces and the infrastructure of two regions of the country that are closely related with the operation of those factories.
Of course, to destroy something is much easier than to build it, and the problem is that, upon disrupting this sector of industry in Lithuania, the after-effects would have to be compensated, including the financial ones, and all this is happening at a time when the forecast says that the consumption and demand of potato starch in Lithuania is growing and will continue to grow, and that within the cellulose and food industries it will increase up to 8 000 tonnes per year.
Hence, there is no doubt that the potato starch production quota for Lithuania should be increased.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, the reform of the market in starch is only a very small part of the reform of the common agricultural policy.
Even though they are concerned with such a minor aspect of this policy, however, the report and its explanatory statement serve as an excellent example of the way in which individual countries are treated differently and incorrectly.
Unfortunately, the candidate countries agreed to such treatment in their accession treaties.
Poland was a leading European potato producer for many years, taking second place only to Germany and France, and indeed this continues to be the case today.
This is due both to agricultural traditions and consumer habits that go back many generations, and to Polandâs poor and sandy soil, in which farmers can grow only rye and potatoes.
Polandâs starch production quota of 144Â 000Â tonnes bears absolutely no relation to either the production potential of its 13Â potato-processing plants, which is currently estimated at 220Â 000Â tonnes, or to the amount of potatoes it grows.
After all, more land is given over to growing potatoes in Poland than in any other country in Europe.
This figure also bears no relation to the number of people either living in rural areas or working in agriculture.
Even though Poland is the third largest producer of potatoes, the limits imposed on it have meant that it has become a starch importer.
The Polish Government therefore regarded it as only natural to submit justified proposals anticipating that the quotas, which had been underestimated and poorly negotiated, would be increased.
In my opinion, noÂ one should be ashamed of admitting a mistake.
What is shameful, however, is to refuse to correct the mistake.
The changes proposed amounted to a quota increase of only 40Â 000 for Lithuania and Poland together, even though 20% of the EUâs total quota, or in other words 200Â 000Â tonnes, has not been filled in recent years.
Although the amendments originally tabled by the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture reiterated the changes that had previously been proposed by the Lithuanian and Polish governments, however, they caused quite a stir.
The Commission protested violently, and a long and heated debate was held in the Committee on Agriculture.
At times I felt as though I was at a football match in which Poland and Lithuania, who have made the proposal, were on one side, along with the other new Member States, and the rest of Europe on the other.
Today we are debating the final version of this new report, which is the result of an ingenious compromise.
My reason for dwelling on its history was to alert the House to an underlying problem that has now blown up in our faces, revealing the unequal treatment meted out to individual countries under the common agricultural policy.
This inequality is a result of the mistakes made by those who negotiated the accession treaties, but it is also due to the changing face of agriculture and rural areas in Europe following enlargement and CAP reform.
My comments were also motivated by a desire to emphasise that theÂ Wojciechowski report is both well thought-out and a good compromise, and that the rapporteur has managed to reconcile all the parties in this unnecessary conflict.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which I am representing, also lent its support to this compromise, which involves extending quotas for a further two years, or in other words until 2009, and sharing out the four-year quotas between Member States on the basis of the 2004-2005 quotas.
In common with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I do not believe that two years is long enough to allow us to assess the developments that have taken place in the market for starch following enlargement, and it is my opinion that unfilled quotas, which currently stand at 19% of the total, should be shared out between the new Member States.
I must also thank the rapporteur, and emphasise that this is an example of a good compromise and an excellently drafted report.
Â Â  . Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of quotas for the production of potato starch seems at first glance a simple and straightforward one.
It seems that we are discussing here only numbers, percentage or ratios.
However, behind those numbers there are real people, members of their families and their lives.
I will try to give a short explanation.
Lithuania, the country where I have been elected, has a quota that is ten times less than the country is capable of producing.
As has been mentioned, there are two factories producing potato starch in Lithuania â both in rural areas.
I would emphasise â in rural areas.
Lithuania has an old tradition in the cultivation of potatoes; this culture yields well in our country.
The capacity of the factories amounts to 13Â 000 tonnes per year.
The economy of Lithuania, the fastest growing economy in the European Union, demands more and more of this product, that is, this product is necessary for Lithuania for its own needs; however, the production quota, which is only 1 200 tonnes per year, does not allow for Lithuanian factories to employ their capacity in at least a minimal, economically justified regime.
Perhaps you fully understand what effectiveness of production this means, when factories are forced to use only 9% of their capacity.
The present situation, that is, the production quota, forces businessmen to close those factories in rural areas.
The people working and living there will lose their jobs.
Moreover, the infrastructure of those two towns is related to the aforementioned factories â heating, water supply, etc. Thus, the closure of the factories will have very serious social consequences.
The situation is even more irregular, since other Member States have much larger production quotas than they are capable of producing or consuming.
So we get to the point that Lithuania is capable of producing, capable of consuming its own production, but the country is not allowed to produce; it is forced to close the factories.
I think this is not fair and not in any way relevant to the main principles of the European Union.
I understand that the issue of quotas is a very sensitive one; however, I am talking not about additional benefit, but only about the possibility to survive.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Lithuania presented its arguments in detail to the Commission, but the Commission did not see the necessity to take them into account.
Well, perhaps one can understand the Commission â the issue of quotas is really awkward.
Maybe the Commission can behave that way since it is more distant from the people.
But the European Parliament and the Members of the European Parliament must treat the peoplesÂŽ problems in a more sensitive and deep way, and not turn away from them, but take real decisions.
One may say that these quotas have been agreed to.
Yes, but this is bad, and they are not a âsacred cowâ that cannot be touched.
If we see the problem, we have to take responsibility to solve it.
We talk a lot and seriously about rural development and support to rural areas.
We accommodate large funds for that; therefore, it will look unjustifiable if we destroy something that can effectively work, but then create something that would require more funds.
Is this an effective and rational way?
So, I think that the suggested compromise to allow redestribution of the unused quotas is a positive step, and it will enable the Member States and the Commission to find the solution concerning this matter.
I would like to thank the speaker, MrÂ Wojciechowski, for his determination and the work done.
I hope that the colleagues will support the report prepared by Mr Wojciechowski and approved and revised by the Committee on Agriculture.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, I want to recommend and urge your support in the vote for the proposal of the Committee on Agriculture submitted by the rapporteur, Mr JÃ¡nusz Wojciechowski.
I would also like to thank him for his qualified and hard work in preparing this document.
Ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this compromise proposal would demonstrate our readiness to at least partly eliminate the unjust redistribution of land for the production of potato starch between old and new Member States of the EU.
This is clearly evident from the example of Poland.
When the Committee on Agriculture discussed this issue, it also addressed a broader problem of the discrimination of farmers from new Member States of the EU.
After all, it has already been said in this meeting room that European Union farmers from an old Member State on the left bank of a river, farming under identical climatic and soil conditions, receive direct payments at the level of 400 euro, compared with only 50 euro received by farmers in a new Member State on the opposite bank of the same river.
In an open discussion about this topic, the Committee on Agriculture pointed to an urgent need to exchange opinions concerning the implementation of common agricultural policy and to speak about the problem without prejudice.
I am very pleased to use this opportunity to note that the discussions that took place in the Committee on Agriculture clearly demonstrated the readiness â and not only the readiness, also the interest â to organise such an open exchange of opinions.
Farmers in my country, the Slovak Republic, also hope that such discussions could lead to eliminating the tensions arising from the unequal implementation of agricultural policy in different parts of the united European Union.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, for many years Poland shared the distinction of being a leading producer of starch, with countries such as Germany, The Netherlands, France and Denmark.
At present, however, starch-production facilities in Poland operate at only around 60% of their production capacity, because the production quota for the country is set at 145Â 000Â tonnes.
This means that starch is one of the products we have to import, because we do not produce enough of it, even though we do not lack raw materials or processing capacity.
Poland needs a production quota of at least 180Â 000Â tonnes, and this was the figure it proposed during negotiations.
Powerful producer organisations have been in existence in Western Europe for over 30Â years.
Such organisations have only recently come into being in Poland, and they have suffered severe teething problems.
In contrast, the starch-production facilities have adapted well.
Producers invested a great deal of money in 2003 in order to meet EU environmental standards, and this is a further argument for increasing Polandâs quota.
It should be added that the businesses concerned employ several thousand people, and they are mainly located in the areas of the country that have been particularly hard hit by structural unemployment.
I do not believe that the amendments tabled will solve all our problems, but they are a step in the right direction.
Even though half of all potatoes grown in Europe come from Poland, we will still be forced to import starch.
How are we supposed to explain this to those involved in potato production and processing, and to consumers?
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw the attention of the House to three issues I believe to be important with regard to the quota system for the production of potato starch.
Firstly, debates on agriculture frequently leave one with the impression that by accident or by design, Commission representatives have large gaps in their knowledge of the new Member Statesâ production potential.
The new Member States account for 30% of the EUâs total production potential for potato starch, which is the subject of our debate today.
At the same time, however, the starch production quotas set for these countries amount to only around 10% of the production quota for the European Union as a whole.
There is therefore no denying that the way in which these quotas have been shared out between the old and the new Member States is blatantly unfair.
Secondly, it is frequently stated during debates that it would be impossible to change anything agreed on during the accession negotiations.
The justification for this is that if a country were to benefit from a change of this kind, the other countries would also want things to be changed to their advantage.
This kind of attitude is unacceptable.
Thirdly and finally, the Commission takes an extremely long time to respond to speeches and motions by Members of this House.
We often have to wait weeks for a response, and the actual implementation of measures can take months.
This state of affairs is also intolerable.
These reservations notwithstanding, I hope that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will succeed in reaching a compromise, if only on the issue of starch production quotas.
MrÂ Wojciechowski has proposed such a compromise, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture, and he deserves every credit for having done so.
Admittedly, this solution does not provide the new Member States with any guarantee that their starch production quotas will be increased, but it does at least make it an option.
This is particularly true in view of the fact that starch production in the European Union has fallen short of current production limits by an average of 7% for each of the past six years. The same is therefore likely to be the case in future.
The new regulation will make it possible for unused quotas to be transferred to the new Member States, and this will provide farmers growing starch potatoes in these countries, and in particular in Poland, with an opportunity to earn more money from their holdings.
It will also enable the starch industry to improve its utilisation of production capacity.
Â Â  . Thank you for your contributions to this important debate.
One of the points raised by several Members concerned the question as to why the new Member States did not get a higher quota from the very beginning.
The potato starch quotas for the new Member States were negotiated in Copenhagen in 2002 and agreed by the candidate countries and the EU-25.
They were calculated in exactly the same way as quotas for other Member States, taking an average of the production during a three-year reference period.
As regards the example of Poland that was mentioned, let me offer a few figures.
Average production in Poland from 1999 until 2001 was 107 317 tonnes; nevertheless, a quota of 144 985 tonnes was granted to Poland.
Therefore, to talk of unjust quota does not seem entirely justified.
I fully recognise the importance of Poland as a producer of potatoes, but let me remind you that starch quotas are based on historical production and not on the potential of the different Member States.
The other issues concern the extension of the time frame to four years and the possibility of quota transfer to the new Member States.
In my opening statement I made it clear that I cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  Â The next item is the oral question to the Commission (O-0045/2005 â B6-0231/2005) by MrÂ Pistelli, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the situation in Sudan.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I am frankly unhappy about beginning my speech, as we would have preferred to have Commissioner Michel answer, because he is an attentive observer who has a thorough understanding of the situation.
I am not detracting in any way from the presence of Commissioner Fischer Boel, however.
The last time that Parliament addressed this issue was last September, at the time of the visit by the delegation headed by MrsÂ Morgantini.
Much has happened in Sudan since then, however: above all, there has been a successful conclusion to the negotiations which led to the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement on 25Â January, putting an end to 21 years of civil war between the north and the south of the country, even though the set of protocols included in the agreement is very demanding and requires good will on both sides.
At the same time, international attention has mounted over the ongoing tragedy in Darfur.
It is a complex tragedy with many implications, and one that is difficult to summarise in a few minutes.
Apart from the considerable attention it has received from the international community, it has also seen a remarkable humanitarian effort, particularly from the European Union, and recently also some significant pronouncements from the United Nations Security Council.
What in our opinion lies at the heart of the problem, and therefore needs to be examined by this House, is understanding whether the positive agreement between the north and the south of the country, between Ali Osman Taha and John Garang, can be a good omen and thus have a positive influence on the Darfur conflict, or whether in fact the international community is running the risk that the unresolved problem in Darfur may instead destabilise the north-south peace agreement.
The two issues are thus separate but closely connected, because they are occurring in the same country.
The European Union is deeply committed because, on the one hand, it has contributed about EURÂ 400 million in humanitarian aid and, on the other, it is directly paying part of the costs of the AMIS mission, which is aimed at somehow maintaining relative stability in Darfur.
In addition, there have been strong calls for the missionâs mandate to be considerably expanded and its strength greatly increased.
It is worth remembering that Darfur covers a vast area about the size of France: it is particularly difficult to imagine that a military mission can carry out the important tasks assigned to it with a little under 3Â 000 men until recently, and now with 7Â 000 to 8Â 000 men.
Even so, we are aware that the situation in Darfur remains complex; there is not the violence of a year and a half ago, but abuses are still happening.
If we cannot stop the violence, we cannot return the displaced people and refugees to their villages.
