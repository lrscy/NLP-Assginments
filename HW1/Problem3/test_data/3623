The observation that the key to development lies in liberalising trade should, rather than earning enthusiastic applause or violent condemnation (both of which lead only to ideological squabbles with short-term effects), be nothing more than a point of departure and a frame of reference.
Given this inescapable truth, therefore, the best approach is to link certain obligations into trading relationships maintained with developing countries.
In other words, it is better to impose conditions on aid offered by the EU and/or its Member States to those economic agents who, by acquiring raw materials or by selling goods and services, establish trading relationships with developing countries.
These conditions would involve providing instant attendant benefits, which might consist, in practical terms, of obligatory technology transfers, building local capacity, providing medicines, building basic infrastructure, providing services to help reduce the costs of managing debts, and the like.
History tells us that attempting to change the 'economic' climate by imposing legislative restrictions has little effect.
. (PT) The figures on the situation as regards health in developing countries are tragically eloquent.
This emergency situation requires rapid, robust, supportive and effective European action.
This should ensure, firstly, that the most highly-developed countries increase their contributions in order to comply fully with the commitments made at the Monterrey Summit (the Millennium Summit) and the Johannesburg Summit (the Sustainable Development Summit).
Secondly, it should raise standards of effectiveness and transparency of aid through a strategy which respects precise goals and timetables; is monitored and evaluated; ensures that the programmes and goods made available are comprehensively and continuously distributed; promotes the use of local human resources, thus avoiding heavy reliance on foreign technical assistance and developing local capacity.
Thirdly, it should send clear messages to the markets, both by means of European legislation and through strategies implemented within the World Trade Organisation, to the effect that, in the long term, ever-increasing quantities of medicines must urgently be made available at affordable prices in developing countries.
Fourthly, it is time to extend the debt relief initiative to more countries.
.
(PT) This report makes clear the relationship between poverty and disease, disease and poverty.
The health statistics for developing countries are horrifying: 28 000 children under five die every day, 2 million people die of tuberculosis each year, a million die of malaria, and so on. The spread of AIDS has also reached tragic proportions: 25 million Africans live with the disease, a quarter of that number have died, and 10% of people between the ages of 15 and 50 suffer from AIDS.
I support the proposal for greater health investment in developing countries and effective monitoring of the results.
The effectiveness of that investment should be maximised through a simultaneous strategy of good resource distribution.
I would also highlight the pressing need for a more productive debate on the question of access to medicines for communities in developing countries, since the scale of the disaster demands more creative, bold and determined responses.
I therefore agreed with most of this report.
I abstained from the overall final vote, however, as I deplored the rapporteur's failure to resist the temptation to include in the final resolution a paragraph written in that coded, ideological language which, like that of other reports produced by this Parliament, aims simply to enlist EU development policy in the international pro-abortion movement.
.
(PT) I voted for this report, which advocates, in general terms, a 'reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue' with Non-State Actors (NSAs) as a means of increasing the effectiveness of European Union development policy.
Interaction between the different actors - local, institutional and others, such as civil society - is indeed increasingly important, at national and international levels.
It is one way of obtaining the answer which is still urgently needed if we are to help the world's least-favoured regions.
Having made this general observation, I must nevertheless point out, in relation to the rapporteur's comments on the ever-greater cuts in Community assistance to various NGOs, that the participation of non-state actors is not in itself a guarantee that development policies will be effective.
We must encourage greater participation and involvement on the part of actors who neither support ideological or programmatic campaigns nor promote their own agendas, but rather are truly generous, disinterested and altruistic in their aims, and whose actions consequently bear the most real and tangible fruit on the ground.
It behoves us, then, to put a premium on the 'quality' rather than on the quantity of participation.
.
(PT) I share the rapporteur's conviction that the goals set out at the Lisbon Summit will not be attained without granting due importance to the role played by audiovisual communications media.
Care must also be taken to consider the state of today's technology, since it allows television content to be disseminated using different technological platforms, and therefore requires the relevant legislation to be adapted and updated.
The decision to adopt a flexible approach to regulation and set minimum regulatory standards for the sector is equally pertinent and correct, in my opinion.
I share the rapporteur's concerns about the concentration of ownership and control of television broadcasting, since I see these developments as a challenge to pluralism and cultural diversity.
I take particular exception, however, to the establishment of a Pan-European Children's Network.
I feel that the task of 'welcoming' our youngest viewers into the audiovisual world should be left to national channels.
I do not believe that a 'European consciousness' can be created by suppressing national languages and identities and indoctrinating babes-in-arms with artificial 'European' values.
The European Union should resist the temptation to 'mould' the loyalties and characters of the citizens of the Member States.
Despite this, I feel that this report as a whole is positive.
I voted in favour.
. (FR) We have not voted in favour of this report, because we do not want to support capital investors, whether in the cultural sector or in other sectors.
Besides, they are often the same: a good many capitalists, who are profiting from investing in private television, in the cinema or in publishing, profit the most from public works, the monopoly of water distribution, even from manufacturing weapons.
What we want, on the contrary, is to protect those, thanks to whom this 'cultural industry' works.
As a result we give our complete support to those employed in the entertainment industry without steady employment who have been fighting for many months to defend their living conditions.
The French Government, which makes such a big case of the 'cultural exception', is not making an exception for workers in the entertainment sector: on the direct recommendations of the major employers, it has just launched an attack on their social protection, as it prepares to launch further attacks on the social security of all employees.
. (PT) This report contains positive elements which deserve to be supported, such as the proposal to reinforce Community initiatives in support of culture, the concern to promote cultural diversity, reading, publishing and protection of copyright, and support for those SMEs active in the field of culture.
It also, however, has negative aspects.
Most importantly, it should be said that the report subordinates culture to the market in general, and to the rules of the European Union internal market in particular.
It privileges the commercial dimension of culture, and competition in the context of so-called 'globalisation'.
It thus participates in the logic of commercialisation of culture.
This report is characterised by various ambiguities, and does not clearly indicate or suggest any actual proposals or measures, such as defending or promoting public national systems to fund and support the production and dissemination of culture, aimed at protecting our cultural heritage and cultural production from subordination to the laws of the market, to the logic of commercial gain and to the promotion of mass- and consumer-orientated cultural models.
. (FR) Great prudence should always be shown each time that the EU intends to vest itself with a new area of competence.
This is precisely the case with this report, which aims to strengthen cooperation between European cultural industries.
In principle, this objective does not raise any major objections.
It is worth, however, expressing strong reservations on certain points contained in this document.
In a document in which everything or almost everything could be considered 'cultural', there is no clear definition of the idea of cultural works, something that opens the door to much abuse.
It is also necessary to emphasise the danger of exploiting culture for European propaganda purposes and, in fine, the possible challenge to national cultural identity (which means exactly the definition of culture as an 'essential and unifying element (?) of the citizens of Europe'?).
Finally, what about the risk of misappropriation of public funds for projects with no real cultural or popular interest - money from European taxpayers cannot be used to subsidise elitist productions, destined for a 'privileged' minority.
For all of these reasons, I will not vote in favour of this report.
.
(PT) I agree with the rapporteur's observations that 'Europe's cultural industries reflect its national diversity and thus represent an added value to European identity' and that 'culture is an essential element of European integration', contributing to mutual understanding between Member States and their people, which is essential and desirable.
I agree with the contention that SMEs are privileged media for disseminating culture, deserving the support of both Member States and European institutions.
Given the very great number of cultural agents, I doubt whether the existence of an overall EU strategy, or of any policy deriving from such a strategy and all-embracing enough to implement it, would be beneficial or feasible in this field.
In the same way, I feel it is acceptable to protect and promote some aspects of a country's cultural production at national level, to avoid the risk of concentration, criticised in other areas of economic and social life, from spreading to the sphere of culture.
This may confront us, under the pretext of challenging US hegemony in this area, with the prospect of cultural industries in countries possessing greater means and larger markets wielding an undesirable degree of control.
That would jeopardise the very diversity we want to maintain and encourage.
While I understand the rapporteur's intentions and support many of the proposals she suggests, I was unable to vote in favour of this report, and therefore abstained.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)
The next item is the Commission's statement on the application of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
. Mr President, the European Union policy towards Israel lies in partnership and cooperation.
It aims to contribute to a resolution of the ongoing conflict, along with other international partners, and in close collaboration with the parties involved.
The Commission is aware of the difficult circumstances in which the business communities are currently working in the Middle East region.
At the same time, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaty, is responsible for guaranteeing the full and correct application of Community law, including international agreements concluded by the Community and therefore the implementation of the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
I can confirm then that in applying the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the EU relies on international law for the territorial definition of the State of Israel, thus excluding the territories under Israeli administration since 1967 in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
Therefore, products originating in these areas are not entitled to benefit from preferential treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
Following confirmation from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal of the European Union in November 2001, in order to inform them of the situation.
According to the provisions of the bilateral agreement, it is the responsibility of the customs administrations of the EU Member States to check the origin of goods with the Israeli authorities through the post-verification procedure.
It is also their responsibility to take the necessary precautions where a customs debt is due.
It is in this context that the recovery of duties is now undertaken by the customs administrations of the Member States.
These measures, initiated by the Commission, aim to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community.
At the same time, I can only reiterate that the Commission has always declared its willingness to cooperate and examine any technical proposal from the Israeli authorities to find a solution for this issue which would respect the terms of the Association Agreement.
In other words, one can conclude that the Commission has taken the necessary measures to ensure correct application of Community law.
As a result, Member States are imposing duties on products from the settlements.
We keep this regularly under review with Member States' customs authorities and we are also continuing to talk to Israel about technical issues related to customs certificates.
Mr President, it is a very sensitive time to be discussing an issue like this.
Firstly, let me put on record my total abhorrence of the terrorist incidents that have happened all too often in the Middle East.
Not only do I condemn the actions of suicide bombers, I also condemn the actions of the security services of the Israeli state when they act outside international law, making the resolution of that problem even more intractable.
However, some people may feel that this issue should not have been raised because it could complicate the peace process.
Those of us who have taken the initiative on this particular issue believe that, unfortunately, such an approach has resulted in insufficient action on the part of the Commission and Member States.
The Commissioner himself has already outlined the important issues at stake.
No one summed up the implications better than Commissioner Patten himself in a debate in this House in May 2001.
It is important to put it on record again, and I quote him: 'The European Union's position on settlements is clear: all settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace.
The Commission communication (of 1998) made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights 'contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law'.'
That says it in a nutshell.
I listened very carefully to what the Commissioner said.
The impression we get is very different from what he said in this House today.
One does not get the impression that this issue has been pursued vigorously enough by the Commission as a whole nor, indeed, by Member States.
It must be said with regard to Israel that at the moment at best it is not being as cooperative as it could be in providing full details on the origin of all products and their component parts to customs authorities.
At worst, it could be said that Israel is defying its trade agreement with the EU.
Given the clarity of the comments initially made by Commissioner Patten, to some extent echoed today, we need to have more assurances that Member States are taking sufficient action.
Therefore, while I welcome what the Commissioner has said, I remain unconvinced that this issue has been enforced at a Member-State level in the way that it should be.
Mr President, the cavalier attitude the Israeli authorities display towards their obligations to comply with international law with regard to their trade relations with European Union is an indicative example of its attitude to international law in general.
The fact that the European Union is so weak in exerting its pressure on Israel to comply with international law is reflected in the fact that new agreements have been made with Israel in recent times.
I would like to touch on those.
I have enormous respect for the efforts of Mr Solana, on behalf of the European Union, to reduce tension and to encourage a process of peace negotiations, but the European Union is undermining his efforts, in my view, by failing to demonstrate its determination to Israel that agreements made to Israel's commercial and trade advantage must be fully complied with or will be terminated.
I have no doubt that the current EU-Israel Association Agreement should be suspended.
The actions of the Israeli Government that deny the Palestinians their human rights are in breach of that Association Agreement.
Despite repeated calls by myself and others to have a full review of Israel's compliance with human rights provisions, nothing tangible has been done, to my knowledge.
Several months ago the Community agreed with Israel to expand its preferential import quotas on a number of agricultural products that are largely or mainly produced in its illegal settlements, and these are for export to Community markets.
The Community took this measure without requiring that Israel stop violating its agreement by issuing proofs of origin for settlement products.
This is not the way to defend or preserve the Community's legal right to require the correct implementation of the agreement by Israel.
The Commission is now saying that it will not be possible to include Israel in the pan-European cumulation agreement, while Israel continues to misapply the origin rules protocol in its existing agreement.
The Community's political will to maintain this position is not convincing to Israel and certainly not convincing to me and many others in this House, while it fails to ensure the correct implementation of the existing agreement.
It is my view that the current crisis in the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is such that the European Union has to exert the greatest possible pressure on the Israeli Government.
In the economic sphere two things need to happen: steps to suspend the Association Agreement need to be initiated on the basis of breaches of human rights obligations contained in the Association Agreement; and legal steps should be initiated to recover duties due because Israel has misrepresented the origin of its exports.
Both these steps require the political will of a united Commission.
I am not convinced that the Commission is united on this matter and the consent of the Member States is needed.
I call upon the Irish Government to make this a priority for its presidency of the European Union.
I should like to emphasise that in making these comments I acknowledge that the responsibility to make peace is shared with the Palestinian leadership.
It must ensure that all possible steps are taken to end the vicious suicide bombings that have caused so much Israeli anguish and hardship and have hardened attitudes behind an irresponsible Israeli Government.
Likewise the United States must exercise its enormous influence on Israel to cease its assassinations and abuses of human rights in the occupied territories.
I should like to address two points made by the Commissioner.
He said that Member States are applying duties on settlement goods.
My understanding is that only happens in a small number of cases where Israel has actually declared these goods to be settlement goods, and it does so only to relieve the pressure of the Commission and this House on them in relation to this matter.
Regarding the post-delivery verification system, once Israel declares where the goods come from, there is no way that a Member State can legally challenge that verification.
I would like the Commissioner to address those two issues.
Mr President, the Liberal Group suspects that the government of Israel is applying the origin rules of the Association Agreement in a way that derives from its settlement policies.
No other explanation can justify the proofs of origin being issued to both manufactured and agricultural products - produced in settlements - which we consider illegal and therefore not covered by the agreement.
These include chives, non-woven textiles, wine, snack foods and so on.
Although they are given customs access by the EU, they are actually produced in West Bank settlements such as Barkan, the Golan Heights settlement of Katzrin and the Gaza Strip settlement of Gush Katif.
This is not a new issue.
We know that the Member States are unable to reliably distinguish which consignments are eligible and which are not.
We know that the Commission has compiled a list of settlement products and exporters, and is trying to expand the list.
We know the list is incomplete and that Member States have not found it possible to identify, when shipments are presented for clearance, what products they contain.
The situation cannot continue for two reasons.
Firstly, Liberals attach great importance to rules; here we are seeing a consistent, persistent breaking of the rules.
We recognise there are difficulties.
The Commission and the Member States bear separate and full responsibility for this, since they both have obligations to act to solve the problem.
It may be that those in the Commission who want to discharge their guardianship responsibility have insufficient political support within the Commission.
The Member States that want to help have insufficient support in the Council.
That is why this Parliament and the Member State parliaments need to act.
Above all, it is the duty of the government of Israel not to play tricks with a signed agreement.
Israel should understand that this is not the time to do that.
Unless they respect the clauses of the Association Agreement, the Israelis will have difficulty in convincing the rest of the world that they are acting in good faith in issues such as the peace process as a whole.
Mr President, my colleagues have already made many of the points that I wanted to raise in an extremely clear and precise way, and so I will not repeat them.
I would, therefore, just like to ask myself - and you - some questions.
I wonder, firstly, whether the European Union's efforts to pursue political dialogue and the participation of the quartet will be strengthened or weakened by the genuine reluctance on the part of the Commission to ensure that the protocol on origin rules and the territorial clause in the EU-Israel Association Agreement are enforced correctly.
I am raising this point as I believe that it is fundamental.
We have been debating this issue for years and there is no doubt that progress has been made, yet we are, once again, facing a blatant violation of this agreement.
There are enormous obstacles to the peace process which, in my opinion, are due, firstly, to the policy of the Israeli Government, which is continuing with its settlements, following a policy of annexation and erecting walls.
These obstacles are also, however, the result of the increasing violations of fundamental principles and the rules of international humanitarian law in Israel and Palestine.
I believe that we should not give aid that allows agreements concluded not to be enforced.
I would also like to consider the reasons why Israel is violating the agreement, Article 2 of which calls upon Israel, and us, to respect it.
We are responsible for ensuring that, on the basis of the agreement, our relations are founded on the respect for human rights and not on the violation of international humanitarian law.
I believe that a politically appropriate, measured response from the Union to Israel's persistence in issuing certificates of origin for products from the settlements should ensure that no product can continue to be given preferential treatment as an import into the European Union.
If we give due weight to the statements of the Commission regarding preferential treatment of products imported from the settlements, then we see that Israel's practice of issuing certificates of origin for these products is considered by the Commission to be a violation of the agreement.
Nevertheless, this practice still continues.
The agreement - the Commission has said so too - is not being enforced resolutely.
I would like this issue of relations and legality to be addressed, because we need to end the situation of 'anything goes' that exists in Palestine and Israel.
Israel needs to learn to enforce the agreements that it signs.
Mr President, as deputy chairman of the delegation to Israel, I set great store by the European Union's desire to remain on good terms with that country, but if the friendship is put at risk by non-compliance with important international rules, I wonder what will become of the trust between us.
In the past, the Commission has communicated on a number of occasions that the European Union does not accept Israel's illegal occupation policy.
The Commission has also taken every opportunity to denounce the illegal application of the Association Agreement.
A number of weeks ago, we received a response from Commissioner Patten to the effect that 'the Member States have informed the Commission that in a number of cases, import duties have been levied on goods that originated from the settlements and were imported with Israeli proofs of origin.'
This illegal and incorrect practice nevertheless remains in place.
This is unacceptable.
The Association Agreement with Israel has been drafted and must be observed with due regard to international law and to fundamental values.
If you make sound agreements, you make your friends, provided these agreements are observed correctly.
Mr President, at the beginning of this week, Monday in fact, the Dutch Foreign Minister gave his response to nine parliamentary questions about the possible irregular application of the trade agreements between the EC and Israel.
In his balanced and lucid reaction, I read that for most of the products that carry Israeli proof of origin, the Netherlands can assume that the conclusions by Israeli customs regarding their origin have been reached in a lawful manner.
This means that they meet all the conditions of the origin rules protocol.
Commissioner, do you subscribe to this conclusion for the other EU Member States too?
Also, Mr President, Article 79 of the Association Agreement between the EC and Israel stipulates that in the event of possible non-compliance with this Agreement by one of the parties involved, both are required, via the Association Council, to reach a mutually acceptable solution.
I trust that the Commission will make every effort to reach a compromise with regard to the interpretation of the origin rules protocol.
Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must firstly explain that I am one of the signatories of this question; I did so as a democratic service for Mrs Sandbaek who asked me to do so.
I do not agree with the opinion of the majority of the speakers but this question has been around for a long time in this House and it was important to clear the air and see clearly in this history of enforcement.
Indeed, it is the question of the application of the Agreement and not of challenging it that is in the question from Mrs Morgantini and others.
The response from the Commissioner was very precise, completed further by the important clarifications given by Mr Belder.
The Commissioner indicated that the application came from the customs authorities of the Member States.
Mr Belder gave a very precise example of a Member State, which considers that this Agreement is being applied.
Furthermore, there are appeal proceedings, which is the association council.
If you have accurate details, Mrs Morgantini, you can communicate them to the Commission, who will not fail, I am sure, to mention them for the next Association Agreement.
The rest are words and threats, which are founded on nothing.
I am slightly worried, Mr de Rossa, that you are using this occasion to challenge the Association Agreement with Israel, because that is not the aim of this debate at all.
I am also astonished that you want the US to put pressure on Israel to respect human rights more, whilst you do not mention the pressure that the European Union could and should exert on the Palestinian Authority to stop the terrorist attacks.
We all heard Mr Arafat lamenting the current situation and transferring all the blame onto Israel, forgetting once again the fatal attacks of recent weeks.
Now we all know the role that Hamas plays.
The European Union, just like the European Parliament, could give its support to Mr Mazen through budgetary aids or parliamentary incentives.
Mr Mazen seems to show a genuine desire to reach a peace agreement.
We can back him instead of continuing to back those who, like Mr Arafat, think that the terrorist attacks are part of normal policy in Palestine on its romantic road to freedom.
What freedom? That, I will leave you to imagine.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will quite openly admit that this issue rather tends to pull me in two directions at once.
From the legal point of view, on the one hand, it is quite clear that pacta sunt servanda - treaties under international law are to be adhered to.
We know which territory is internationally recognised as being Israel's, we know which areas are occupied; we also know that products from Israel can be imported and that produce from the areas occupied by it cannot be.
In practice, gathering evidence is very difficult; so, in practice, is knowing where to draw the line.
The Commission's answer has this to say on the subject: 'These principles do not apply to products which have been sufficiently processed within Israel's internationally recognized borders.'
Does that, then, mean in practice that oranges harvested on the West Bank are processed in Israel, the juice bottled and exported to the EU?
Is that what is meant by 'sufficiently processed'?
Or is it 'sufficiently processed' only if the juice is blended with that of apples and bananas in a mixed fruit cordial with the orange juice making up less than 50%?
I think this shows us how difficult it is in practice to draw a distinction, even where the proportions are concerned.
That is why, in this context, we should ask ourselves the important question as to whom this is meant to benefit.
Does it do the Palestinians any good when an Israeli orchard, or a factory on the West Bank, is closed down?
The workers there are laid off, and then the same production operation restarts in the Israeli heartland with immigrants from Russia.
This, of course, does the Palestinians no good at all, but at least the position is clear-cut in legal terms.
We have then maintained the legal position, but we have not necessarily helped the Palestinians.
We should ensure that the actions of the Commission or of the European Union do not make overall relations between Israel and the Palestinians worse than they already are.
I am therefore in favour of the Commission continuing to act in these matters with the same caution and conscientiousness that it has demonstrated so far, never losing sight of the overall framework within which relations between Israel and the Palestinians are developing.
Mr President, last July I tabled an oral question to the Commission on renewing the scientific and technical cooperation agreement with Israel. In substance the reply said that the Commission believed that the development of relations with Israel would make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process.
You have said more or less the same thing to us today, Mr Nielson.
Although I share the idea that knowledge and an exchange of knowledge help build a better world, in the same ways as economic cooperation, I am particularly stupefied by this answer.
Indeed, this position completely disregards the Parliament's Resolution of April 2002, of which it is obviously right to remind you here given the general title of the debate.
We all know that in paragraph 8 of the Resolution, Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to urgently convene the association council to give its position to the Israeli Government, by asking the latter to respect the UN resolutions, and, in this context, called for the suspension of the Association Agreement.
Where are we, a year and a half after this demand was worded?
When the Agreement began in 1995, just after the process in Oslo, some regarded it as helping to build peace.
The situation now, however, is radically different.
What type of cooperation is the Commission talking about?
Partnerships can only be devised on the basis of mutual trust, and of shared rights and obligations.
Now, the criminal attitude of the Israeli Government shows every day that it not only flouts the concerns of the Union, but also that it outbids the other in this fatal situation.
More than a year ago now, Israel erected a wall in the West Bank allegedly for reasons of safety.
In actual fact, it is an iron curtain that massacres the Palestinian territories and drives tens of thousands of inhabitants in their homes.
In this way, new territories are being annexed.
It is time to give Parliaments' Resolution tangible form.
There are precedents.
In 1990 the Commission enforced Parliament's recommendation that scientific cooperation be partially frozen until the Palestinian schools and universities that had been closed unilaterally by the Israeli authorities were completely reopened and remained so.
It was at least a few months before it was possible for them to reopen.
Today, given that the clause on the respect of fundamental rights has been brutally violated, and in the sight of the whole world, in what way is this demand for suspension excessive?
In what way is it excessive to ask that this law is applied and respected?
Finally, and I conclude Mr President, I am aware that the responsibility of the Council, shamefully absent today, is enormous.
As, in theory, a member of the quartet, the Union has the means to carry weight.
What it lacks is the political will to do so.
Mr President, the Commissioner is right; it is up to the customs offices of Member States to check whether products come from Israel or from Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
However, the Commissioner also knows that once Israel has said that a product hails from Israel, there is very little customs offices can do about this, even when we know that we are being led up the garden path.
Member States are not individually capable of enforcing what, in my view, is to be done, namely for Israel to stop labelling products which we know originate from settlements, but which are still given the label 'from Israel'.
How difficult this is was once again demonstrated in this very Parliament when the Israeli Ambassador stated quite clearly that he challenges the EU's right to draw a distinction between products from Israel and those from the settlements.
As long as this situation persists, I do not think it is up to the Member States, but up to the Commission, to do battle with the Israeli Government in order to force the latter into action, which Member States are not capable of doing.
It is also up to the Commission to draw the necessary conclusions if Israel does not appear prepared to do what it is required according to EU legislation.
Mr President, it is a fact that the definition of territoriality applied by Israel to determine the origin of its exports to the European Union is not legal.
The Commission has publicly announced that Israel improperly issues proofs of origin to settlement products, but why has the Commission done nothing effective about it?
The legal settlements are the main obstacle to peace.
At present, Member States which do not want to violate the trade agreement in giving preferential treatment to exports from such illegal settlements have only been able to recover some limited duties, mainly relying on Israel to refrain from answering verification questions.
Why has the Commission not explicitly notified the Member States that Israel's definition of territoriality is illegal?
Only when that has happened can the Member States draw the logical conclusion that they have to ask for verification for all Israeli products exported to the European Union.
Mr President, the first EC-Israel Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1975 and for 20 years the location of exported products was never questioned.
However, now it is being used as a political instrument to bash Israel and the settlements.
The author of the oral question has gone as far as calling for the suspension of the more recent 1995 agreement, even though the Commission has controversially agreed with her and imposed tariffs on goods allegedly exported by the settlements in the Occupied Territories.
This is a technical dispute on trade and, although I am a friend of Israel, I support an eventual two-state solution and a dismantling of most of the settlements.
Palestine is not yet a state competent to have its own trade agreements, which, controversially, the EU ratified in 1994.
The Commission did this in spite of the fact that Israel had the signed agreement of the Palestinian Authority that Israel was responsible for customs matters for goods exported from the settlements.
Nevertheless, there is also an EU-Palestine Free Trade Agreement.
Therefore, whichever way you look at it, these goods should have EU tariff-free access as they come from territories covered by one or other free trade agreement.
All trade agreements refer to the territory where the goods are produced, not the nationality or the religion of the producers.
This whole dispute is now subject to a technical resolution under Article 79 of the Association Agreement, which is where it rightfully belongs.
It should not be the subject of political manipulation within this House.
The debate is engendering further hostility to trade with Israel and undermines Israel's faith in the impartiality of the EU as a vital component of the quartet in the quest for the Roadmap for Peace and the end of terrorism.
I am sure that all sides of the House desire that outcome strongly.
Mr Nielson, let me take this opportunity to remind you that on 10 April our Parliament voted on a Resolution to freeze the Association Agreement.
Now, eighteen months later, this Resolution is still being ignored.
Could we see this as unwavering support for the Israeli state's policy despite its violations of human rights and international law?
We could, for we are talking about economic, commercial agreements, about financial interests, but we also about the right to life.
This colonial war claims more and more victims.
Even though the roadmap made provision to colonisation to be put on ice, the Jewish colonies continue to grow and roads around them are still being built.
In Israel the situation is tragic.
The discrimination against some Israeli citizens is increasing; they are persecuted, denied certain rights because they are Arab Israelis.
The Knesset enacted a law to prevent Palestinians from obtaining Israeli citizenship by marriage.
This is a discriminatory and racist law.
A recent report by FIDH, the International Federation for Human Rights, has revealed to us a modern form of slavery of migrant workers.
Even Mr Abraham Burg, a former President of the Knesset, raised the alarm.
He said that Israel is a framework of corruption, based on foundations of oppression and injustice, which reduces itself to a colonist state, headed by a clique of individuals who are without morals, are above the law and corrupt.
In the occupied territories the situation is tragic.
A wall of shame embodies the apartheid and injustice, and the Palestinian society is living a tragedy.
We are not, of course, going to count the deaths.
Who are the victims of terrorism though, of this State terrorism that assassinates refugees on a daily basis?
To conclude, Mr President, I will say that we cannot remain silent.
Is it not our duty to put pressure on the Israeli Government, with all the means that we have at our disposal including economic and commercial ones?
Why not paralyse the Association Agreement as we courageously did before in South Africa against the apartheid?
Mr President, my position is rather different from some of those expressed here.
In my opinion, this Parliamentary question is inappropriate and imprudent.
We are in the midst of a peace process, the European Union is a member of the Quartet, and I believe that if we in the European Parliament and in the other institutions really feel solidarity with the Executive and with the figure of Mr Solana in his capacity as 'Mr Common Foreign and Security Policy', our representative, then we should support a rapprochement between the countries and not seek conflict between the parties.
Let us not forget, furthermore, that this question implies a direct condemnation of the occupied territories.
All of us in Parliament have done this before now: it is a commonly-accepted practice, and we also know that, in accordance with the Taba agreements on the devolution of the territories, many of those territories, which were once desert and will now be habitable, will pass into Palestinian hands.
What worries me most is that this speech goes against the Palestinian Authority.
Since Arafat and Abu Mazen are making constant demands for Europe to take a firmer stance in the peace process, and for that process not to remain in the hands of the United States, and if, as Mr Solana says, Europe really is one of the biggest contributors to Abu Mazen's profile, why do we not, instead of creating divisions between the parties, devote ourselves to upholding Abu Mazen and his policies, to upholding the prestige of the European Union against the other side?
In my opinion, it does the peace process no favours for one of the parties involved to pick a fight with one of the other negotiators.
Why are we not asking Mr Solana and the Palestinian Authority to strengthen the administration of the latter, and helping them both to achieve that aim?
Why are we not demanding, and why is Europe not showing greater support for, public health and education services?
That would prevent education from remaining to a large extent in the hands of a group like Hamas, which has been condemned for acts of terrorism.
Why are we not making a real contribution to strengthening the Palestinian Authority?
That would be the answer.
I would like to know what impact this question will have, since it will probably go against many Palestinian workers in the occupied territories.
Mr President, the Commission's declaration is a confirmation of the European Union's aim to maintain peaceful and stable relations with the countries in the Middle East region.
This is the only possible approach and does not prevent the EU from presenting its own opinions and objectives within the framework of global partnership.
In practice these are complex situations.
What is more important is to understand the ordinary basic mechanisms which either hamper or encourage stability, just as Mr Schuman did when he put forward his brilliant genesis of an idea for the Communities that served as a basis for the EU.
I would in this connection like to highlight one basic mechanism that has an effect on stability and peace: a clean environment.
Clean water, as was shown in Jordan recently, is a vital necessity, and to attain it all the countries in the West Bank region must find a solution both separately and together.
Unfortunately, the international community is still not even aware of the environmental destruction which is a reality in the West Bank.
Excessive water extraction, conducting untreated waste water to Jordan, and the uncontrolled dumping of community waste have led to unthinkable health risks and a shortage of water.
The West Bank environment project is a multicultural and multilateral project which aims to solve major problems threatening the health and welfare of the inhabitants of the region.
The project is not, however, making adequate progress.
The reason is not low levels of finance or a lack of know-how and technology.
The reason is chiefly that, for a project which is under way in a region occupied by three countries, there exists no political forum to agree on practical matters that are essential for its implementation, even though all the parties involved are agreed in principle on the needs and the measures to be taken.
One may without exaggeration say that the EU is at present the only player in the world that could offer a political forum for attempts like the West Bank environment project to build stability and peace through action on the part of the inhabitants of the region.
A neutral mediator is needed to initiate decision-making that overrides political controversies.
If it were not for examples of voluntary action like the West Bank environment project, all the other work the EU does to implement the Middle East peace plans would be in vain.
Mr President, I was interested to hear Mr Tannock remind us that these agreements between the European Community and Israel have been in operation since 1975.
I have been in Parliament for 19 years and this issue has regularly come up as a political flashpoint.
In fact it was one of the first major flashpoints when I joined Parliament in 1984, yet we still have not reached a satisfactory conclusion.
But, as several speakers have already said, we are not really here today to start arguing about the whole question of who is most at fault in this sad and extremely tragic country.
I have visited Gaza, because my daughter worked there for several years with the UN, and I know that when the kind of trouble that everyone in Israel is suffering from occurs now, when the borders are closed, Palestinian produce cannot move out of the Gaza Strip.
I have spoken before in this House about the dramatic sights I have seen on the streets of Gaza city, where animals were eating the flowers and strawberries that were part of the Palestinian exports from Gaza to Europe.
There is a wonderful climate.
It is potentially a great source of economic value to the Palestinian people, but every time there was trouble the borders were shut down and the produce was simply left to rot on the streets of Gaza.
That makes it different from produce coming out of Israeli settlements - and that is a very real difference.
Only the Israeli authorities have the means to eliminate the substantial distortions of the origin rules involving settlement products without causing further inconvenience to the EU, the Member States, Community operators and Israeli exporters.
Perhaps without Israel's cooperation the only lawful and effective solution for the EU, short of suspending the agreement, is for the Member States to hold in doubt the origin of virtually all Israeli exports.
. Mr President, firstly, a general remark: as I see it, in the way we are conducting this debate we are behaving like generals fighting a war that has already been fought.
Personally, I share the view that it was quite some time before the EU got to the point where these rules were being clearly applied.
But we have been doing this for some time now and this fact needs to be clarified.
I would also add that the political need for discussion and energy to be injected into the subject has more to do with what to do now than with the starting-point of the discussion which related to the actual administration of the customs regime.
As a member of the Commission I do not recognise anything in our discussions or handling of this in the Commission that resembles what some have said here about questioning the unity of the Commission in relation to this issue.
This has never been a divisive issue inside the Commission.
Others have mentioned that Member States have to agree.
That is absolutely correct.
Mrs SandbÃŠk asked why the Commission has not officially informed Member States about this and what it is going to do.
I will repeat what I said in my first contribution to this debate, namely that following the confirmation received from Israel that its customs authorities certified goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, the Commission published a notice to the importers in the Official Journal in November 2001 in order to inform them of the situation.
So almost two years ago the Commission did what Mrs SandbÃŠk asked.
This is one element on which I based my first remarks.
It sounds as if this debate is about a war that was waged some time ago.
In February this year - which was the time that the last internal Member States customs authorities met on this issue - about EUR 100 000 had been collected as permanent duties on these product categories from the beginning of 2003.
We expect new figures to be available at the end of this month when the next meeting takes place.
The amount of guarantees taken on these products by EU customs authorities at that time was as much as EUR 1.7 million.
When we are certain that the goods are coming from settlements, duties are applied immediately by Member States.
Where there is any doubt, or where there is unclear or insufficient information about this from the Israeli authorities, we also apply duties after having checked as far as we can.
This is being regularly reviewed within our Member States through the Customs Committee, which will meet again at the end of this month.
This is something which is not just handled by putting a notice in the Official Journal; it is an active, ongoing process.
Finally, Mr Gahler asked about the modalities and principles of assessing the accumulation, and how much processing is necessary before it becomes an Israeli product.
This is not the only place in the world where we have to decide on these matters.
We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided.
There is no special rule for Israel on this point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
WRITTEN DECLARATION (RULE 120)
The continuing occupation of territories by Israel, the repeated murderous operations by the Israeli army, its terrorist presence in Palestine and the arbitrary arrests, in conjunction with rough conditions of detention, the denial of the existence of a Palestinian state and the constant violation of the right of self-determination of a nation have created an explosive situation in the Middle East and a generalised climate of instability and insecurity, which is being maintained and incited by US and EU imperialism, causing the justified reaction of the Palestinians and intensifying the suicide attacks.
The proclamation of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital is the sine qua non to any real effort to bring about peace and restore a climate of security for Palestinians and Israelis.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece take side unreservedly with the fighting Palestinian people and condemn efforts to maintain the current situation and perpetuate the problem, as contained in the Quartet's road map, which has obviously collapsed.
The peoples of Europe are fighting for peace against imperialist military intervention, as in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, and against cooperation with and support for Israel in its bellicose strategy of violation of the rights of the Palestinians, and they will overturn with their fight the militarisation of Europe which will strengthen imperialism against the peoples even more.
The next item is the report (A5-0164/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the Special Framework of Assistance for Traditional ACP Suppliers of Bananas (Council Regulation No 856/1999) - Biennial Report from the Commission 2002 (COM(2002) 763 - 2003/2091(INI)).
Mr President, this Commission communication comes in response to the provisions of the Council Regulation on the Special Framework of Assistance for traditional ACP banana producers, whose objectives are to improve the competitiveness and support the diversification of agricultural production in those countries.
I would like to emphasise that significant sums, about EUR 44 million, were allocated to this aid project in both 2001 and 2002, and that the Commission has told us the results of the programme for those two years.
It gives me particular pleasure to say, firstly, that efforts to diversify production increased during that period, and, secondly, that those efforts were based on incentives for agricultural and rural development projects.
Both of these achievements fulfil or express desires noted as objectives by both the Commission and Parliament when this programme was approved.
I ought to mention, however, that some problems have been encountered. The Commission is undoubtedly aware of them, but they should be solved through the prompt adoption of certain corrective measures.
Firstly, there have in some cases been significant and repeated delays, not attributable to any individual's deliberate wishes, in mobilising and implementing appropriations over the last few years.
These delays, however, have as a rule created significant difficulties for farmers in the producing countries, some of which are among the 40 poorest countries on the planet.
Some of these farmers have told us of their doubts and, particularly in the case of West African farmers, of their disagreement with the methods used by the Commission to assess farmers' competitiveness, on which the Commission's criteria for allocating appropriations are based.
This assessment method takes into account average production costs, insurance and transport fleets as detailed by Eurostat.
These figures, though, do not constitute a single definition. That causes mistakes of more than minimal significance in some cases.
They are sometimes very significant mistakes, to the detriment of some of these countries.
Commissioner, I am concerned at the decline in the amount of assistance allocated in the 2003 budget, especially as we approach the changeover from the current system to a tariff only system. That changeover may have very negative effects, not only on production in traditional ACP countries, but also on European banana-producing regions, if, when the moment comes for us to move from the current system to the tariff only system, we are unable to adopt the right measures.
I will conclude by appealing for two concrete changes which are very important to Parliament and also, I hope, to the Commission: greater efforts to avoid any delays in payment from now on; and assessments of growing and production methods, with the aim of withholding funding from those projects having a negative effect not only on the environment but also on the health of banana workers in producing countries. The use of biodegradable substances in the banana-growing process should become a priority here.
.
Let me start by say something about the evolution of payments.
I agree that this has been quite a problem in the start-up phase, but I can also inform you that the amount invoiced in 2002 was nearly EUR 41.5 million.
This represents nearly seven times more than the amounts invoice in 1999 and more than three times the amount invoiced in 2001.
Although we cannot draw clear conclusions yet for the current year, the overall trend is quite positive and a similar disbursements of some EUR 40 million is expected for this year, taken as a whole.
We are now at a level of activity that corresponds reasonably well to expectations.
All this is quite complex, there are so many different interests deserving protection, many historical, social and political factors in everything that relates to bananas.
The Commission is well aware of the difficulties in combining the principle of equitable market access with consideration for the structural problems faced by small vulnerable economies.
The Special Framework of Assistance stems from those concerns and addresses them in a tangible manner.
Also it should be noted that this was not something imposed on our partners in this area but reflects thorough negotiations.
After the undeniable difficulties of the start-up phase, substantial progress can now be observed in the implementation of the scheme: I have just given these figures.
Now we have reached a satisfactory rate in terms of payment.
In response to the repeated suggestions by the Commission, several ACP banana suppliers are changing their strategies and seeking more financial support to fund diversification where the banana industry is no longer sustainable.
It is expected that this process will continue, with the least competitive banana suppliers using the available funds exclusively for diversification and social compensation.
As far as the possible increase in imports following enlargement, which is an important discussion, is concerned, it was agreed at the Copenhagen summit that appropriate arrangements would be made in order to ensure a sufficient supply of bananas to EU consumers in conformity with WTO rules.
Any increase in the banana quotas, which would be subject to negotiations in the WTO framework, would take account of the interests of these producers.
The Commission is well aware of its obligations resulting from the Cotonou Agreement including those relating to ensuring the continuing outlet for ACP bananas on the European market and we are of course committed to do anything we can to respect this.
Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to thank Mr FernÃ¡ndez for producing this report, which is an assessment rather than a legislative report. I also thank Commissioner Nielson for his statement.
As the rapporteur says, we have reached the final stages of a regime for protecting banana imports, which will come to an end on 31 December 2005. The European Union has managed to maintain special privileges for 12 small countries, as Mr FernÃ¡ndez has told us.
Some of those countries, such as Somalia, Jamaica and Dominica, are among the world's poorest, which is why they need our help.
That date, 31 December 2005, is very close.
A guarantee and a tariff preference are laid down in the Cotonou Agreement; they will have to be honoured.
Clearly, though, these banana producers will find themselves in trouble as the date approaches.
What I mean to say is that there is every chance of the Community market becoming flooded with bananas marketed by multinational companies.
Most importantly, the rapporteur has pointed out another danger, namely that enlargement will be used to justify granting even more preferential treatment to those multinational companies, opening up our markets to the detriment of both Community and traditional ACP producers.
I believe that Commissioner Nielson is at present aware of those problems.
He mentioned that the amount of aid has remained at approximately the same level, about EUR 40 million, in recent years, and I do not know to what extent that amount could be altered to accommodate the needs arising as an inevitable consequence of the transition from a protective banana regime to an open regime subject only to the tariff restriction.
I therefore reiterate my group's support for Mr FernÃ¡ndez's report, and hope that the Commission will continue to protect this small group of impoverished countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, bananas are extremely important products for the economy and for the land use of several European regions, particularly in the Atlantic archipelagos of Macronesia, but are also crucial to some less developed countries towards which we have binding legal and political obligations.
I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, and offer my support for his conclusions and ideas on the matter now under our consideration.
I also offer my support to my friend and colleague, Mr Medina Ortega, who is also a fellow countryman of the rapporteur.
In particular, I share his concern at the scantiness of the financial means available under this regulation.
I wish, however, to take this opportunity to raise a few basic points about the transparency and clarity of procedures in the way current legislation is implemented.
It is unacceptable that the funds we are looking at should be allocated by Commission decisions that are not made public and which are based on an unnecessarily complex system of calculation, on the basis of somewhat erroneously defined concepts, using data of dubious rigour and comparability that are spread across two regulations and several articles and annexes.
The aims of Community legislation must be clear, as simple as possible to enact and transparently implemented.
As the Ivory Coast Banana and Pineapple Producers' Association has rightly stated, however, this regulation does not fulfil these criteria.
I therefore hope that the Commission will inform Parliament of the decisions it has taken on funding organisations in the beneficiary countries, as well as the calculations informing these and the data it has used and even the legal basis and what it has done with the unused appropriations from budget line B7-8710.
A simple and transparent legal framework is a crucial instrument, in this and in other fields, for developing a positive and lasting relationship between the European institutions and their partners.
.
Mr President, in reply to the last remarks by Mr Casaca, this does not correspond to the way in which we are doing these things.
None of the beneficiaries has ever disputed the correctness of the calculations of the individual yearly amounts.
This is also being discussed at meetings with representatives of these countries.
I would add that the representatives of the producers from the CÃŽte d'Ivoire stated at one of these meetings that in their view the Commission has always applied the method prescribed by the Commission regulation in a correct and fair manner.
If these criteria are complex it only reflects the fact that we are where we are as a result of negotiations where contradictory and many different special interests had to be reconciled.
That is the source of the complication.
For once it is something we in the Commission are not guilty of.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at the end of the debates today.
The next item is the report (A5-0190/2003) by Fernando FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Commission communication to the Council and to the European Parliament on Untying: Enhancing the effectiveness of aid (COM(2002) 639 - 2002/2284(INI)).
Mr President, the world today is more interdependent than ever before.
Problems are shared problems: poverty, hunger, military conflict, immigration, transmissible diseases, ecological disasters and the like. Efforts to solve them must be coordinated and shared by all.
Here the question of development aid has become more important than ever.
Now is exactly the right moment, to my mind, for the Commission to have produced its communication to the Council and to Parliament, which we are debating today.
The report I am presenting today, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , is the fruit of work and contributions from political groups and from my fellow Members, for which I am particularly grateful and appreciative.
As we know, the European Union and its Member States constitute the world's leading donors of government development aid.
The traditional mechanisms of the European model have not, however, allowed the desired aims of cooperation to be achieved with complete success.
It is difficult for us to ensure that the results are monitored or to assess them accurately, because the implementation of the programmes and projects is dispersed among both national cooperation agencies and fixed procedures which tie the receipt of aid in different ways to the acquisition of goods and services obtained by means of that aid in the donor countries.
According the World Bank's figures, released here in this Chamber during a speech by the bank's President, Mr Wolfensohn, the untying of aid would result in a reduction of transaction costs by up to 25%.
We therefore welcome the Commission's initiative, which may help to enliven the debate on this issue.
That debate is currently being conducted among Member States and multilateral organisations.
They are far from reaching an agreement which would be binding on all parties, and on the main donors in particular.
I am convinced of the need, in this debate, to uphold the idea that aid priorities should suit the interests of recipient countries.
That idea would seem almost too obvious to any observer, but it is not currently being put into practice.
As a result, some European countries play a significant part in cooperation as official aid donors, but the money they make in return for delivering that aid exceeds their own contributions to the aid programmes, sometimes by a long way.
This practice is known to all of us, I believe, and it is clear proof of a degree of cynicism among the donor countries - in other words, our own countries.
We must make an effort, therefore, to try and remedy this state of affairs.
Of course, events do not take this kind of turn through a deliberate and evil desire for them to turn out badly, but for a whole range of reasons which cannot be gone into here.
The main thing is that we use the experience we have acquired to push for these ideas to be implemented, bearing in mind certain considerations, such as those mentioned in paragraph 4 of our report, in order to ensure that our objectives are achieved and certain undesirable effects avoided.
In other words, for example, it would be helpful if the Commission were to bear in mind the need for horizontal and geographical or regional budget lines to be treated equally, so as to introduce and guarantee open, transparent calls for tender, which do not always come about.
These calls for tender will apply to all Member States and candidate countries, all developing countries and all developed countries, on condition that they are reciprocated by third countries and approved by the recipient countries.
I will conclude by making express mention of a request made by many developing countries and NGOs.
That request is that priority be given to the award of contracts to local suppliers or service providers in both the recipient country and neighbouring countries in the same region, on condition that provision is made for sufficient training to ensure that the projects are brought to a satisfactory conclusion rather than left frustratingly unfinished.
The reasons for this are many and plain to see; it would be almost too obvious to list them, but they can be summed up by evoking the desirability of contributing to the development of local markets in those countries.
. The communication about the untying of aid dates back to 18 November 2002 and we still have quite some work to do, even though we have made good political progress on the issue since last year.
This issue may appear to be very technical and difficult to address, but it can have quite an impact in the field concerning the effectiveness, the value for money of our aid and also the dynamics of the cooperation with our partner countries - exactly in the way Mr FernÃ¡ndez Martin has made clear.
I am grateful for the work he has done on this subject.
His report reflects broad agreement between us.
We have achieved consensus in Council on the untying of Community aid, and with the resolution on the table now in Parliament we can start working on implementation.
We will focus on concrete proposals to change the different relevant legal instruments.
The proposal to implement changes in the existing regulations will fall under the co-decision procedure and therefore Parliament's role in moving this forward will be fundamental.
I look forward to discussing it with Parliament during the course of this coming year.
We will continue our work on establishing the facts relating to untying.
One of the problems is that it is very difficult to find concrete, reliable data on the impact of untying.
We will begin a study on this before the end of the year.
We will try to convince other donors who are still reluctant to join us, particularly through the work of the OECD 's Development Assistance Committee and its new Working Group on Aid Effectiveness.
While welcoming the Council's agreement on the untying of Community aid, I would like to express disappointment at the reluctance of some Member States - and especially that of one Member State - to commit themselves to untying bilateral aid.
This has two dimensions; one is the well-established discussion as to whether or not official development assistance and the procurement there is part of the Single Market.
This is an internal EU discussion.
In the Commission's view the answer is clearly 'yes', the public procurement directive does indeed cover development aid.
Some countries that have been doubting this over the years, including my own, clearly no longer doubt this.
However, one Member State still maintains a different view.
My reply would be 'okay, we will meet in Court'.
The other element where a discussion is more open and more legitimate is what Member States do in the broader global discussion in the framework of OECD about the untying of aid.
There we have an agreement to untie aid to the group of least developed countries.
The volume of what has been agreed on corresponds to about 2% of global ODA - not a big deal.
The Commission is complying, and in fact over-achieving, in relation to what it has to do in order to carry out this agreement. But we take a different view: one reason being that we do not want to discriminate between least developed countries and the rest.
We are ready to untie all aid and we have legal obligations vis-Ã -vis the ACP countries, for instance, which means that as a group, they have access to bid on everything relating to all seventy-eight countries.
In preparation for the Monterrey Conference on Financing for Development, the Member States committed themselves to continue discussions on the further untying of bilateral aid.
The Commission recognises that we need both to increase the volume of aid and its effectiveness through measures like those we are discussing today.
I am really pleased to have the signal from Parliament and I look forward to moving this forward.
It is true that we have to insist on some reciprocity, because this issue is also about taking care of trade interests opening up on our part, if, for instance, the United States is not doing the same thing.
It is clearly not something we have a mandate to do.
Our policy is now clear we want to go for the big solution on this issue.
. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent and timely report.
As he said, we now live in a world that is totally interdependent, and the problems of one country are problems for all of us, problems such as poverty, hunger, disease, ecological disasters and crime.
It is our joint responsibility to resolve these problems and to work towards a consistent and coherent strategy.
Development aid can play a pivotal role in working towards solutions, but only if it is free of trade commitments.
The proposals we have in front of us are a positive step towards achieving greater effectiveness of development aid.
Untying aid is a direct way of increasing that effectiveness, but we need to acknowledge and recognise, as the Commissioner has made clear, that among certain Member States tying aid is still common practice.
We must therefore take immediate action to address the inadequacy of our current practices.
Commissioner, may I say 'more power to your elbow!' when you see the recalcitrant Member State in court, because we cannot have one Member State playing a different game from the others.
We have, as you say, a single market.
I support the need for reform. It will lead to increasing transparency and accountability.
It is a complex process, and we welcome the intention of the Commission to bring forward the legislative proposals and the changes to existing legislation, hoping that this will not result in more bureaucracy.
I should like to stress that this untying of aid from trade is not a final step, but it is one means of increasing the effectiveness of granting aid.
The main purpose of granting aid is poverty reduction.
So it is not an isolated concept, but part of an ongoing debate which will be pursued to some extent in Cancun next week.
Mr President, I wish to express my sincere thanks to my colleague, Fernando FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, for the pithy though balanced report he has drafted.
I would also ask Commissioner Nielson to convey my thanks to those involved in drafting the Commission communication.
The text is clearly written and big-hearted in its tone.
The practice of tying aid may in theory even turn development aid completely on its head, with the donor benefiting and the country intended as the recipient becoming poorer than ever.
Although this extreme paradox, which is well-known in economic theories, is not necessarily very easily possible in reality, it is nevertheless a reminder of the sort of reduced effectiveness and perversions of aid which still occur and are furthermore permitted in real life.
Estimates by the World Bank and the OECD of savings made through increased effectiveness are of the order of 25%. Our rapporteur estimates that the net benefit of untying could be the equivalent of as much as USD 5 billion in terms of cash.
As we know how even small sums of money can work wonders in development cooperation, an increase of several billion euros of that sort is staggering.
The European Union's willingness to take the initiative in this matter is significant as the EU and the Member States are responsible together for half the world's development aid.
Reduced effectiveness in development cooperation is therefore by no means a trivial matter when measured in real terms.
It is important to implement the conclusions arrived at in Barcelona swiftly.
It should be self-evident that simple market economy principles dictate that the EU Member States should untie donor aid.
The key competition principles agreed in the EU will work to the advantage of the developing countries in this.
Then local sourcing and sourcing from other developing countries will also be possible, as we have already seen, resulting in a multiplier effect on the effectiveness of aid.
In addition to the benefit in terms of welfare achieved in the developing countries, the liberalisation of procurement will also be important within the EU, because the practice of tying aid which still goes on in many Member States also distorts competition among the Member States themselves and is against the rules on competition in the EC Treaty.
Mr President, aid which is conditional on the acquisition of goods or services originating in the donor country has repeatedly been condemned as an immoral and inefficient practice by recipient countries and the worst-affected NGOs on the one hand, and on the other by the majority of agencies involved in development issues.
Among the latter are many intergovernmental organisations.
In 1996, the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published a strategy document entitled 'Shaping the 21st Century: The Contribution of Development Cooperation'.
This publication discredited the practice of imposing conditions on development assistance, showing it to be incompatible with the new guiding philosophy for initiatives in this field.
Since then, that philosophy has gradually taken on a definite, solid form through a series of important declarations and resolutions, such as the DAC's recommendation, approved in May 2001, demanding that aid to the least-developed countries should be untied.
More importantly, the international community adopted the Monterrey Consensus at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002, committing itself to supporting initiatives designed to phase out conditional aid.
In its communication of November 2002, entitled 'Untying: Enhancing the Effectiveness of Aid', the Commission responds to just those promises made at Monterrey.
It goes even further than the DAC's resolution, since it extends the need to untie aid to all developing countries, not just to least-developed countries.
It also extends the untying of aid to all aid sectors, including food aid.
All these recommendations are still gaining ground, under pressure from lobbying by the general public and by NGOs.
They have not, however, made a great impression on a large number of countries, which are continuing to grant tied aid, either openly or covertly.
This is unfortunately also true of various EU Member States.
The result is a significant discrepancy between the policy advocated by Parliament and implemented by the Commission on the one hand, and the policy put into practice by some Member States, such as Spain under JosÃ© MarÃ­a Aznar, on the other.
It comes as no surprise that the report presented by Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n, a Partido Popular deputy in my country, should list a series of initial misgivings about the progressive approach urged by the Commission, an approach favourable to the untying of development cooperation policy.
In the rapporteur's favour, however, it should be said that he showed understanding and flexibility by accepting the amendments tabled to his first proposal, which have yielded substantial improvements in his final text.
That text includes a motion for a resolution approved by the Parliamentary Committee on Development and Cooperation.
We will be reasonably happy to vote for it, since it favours the complete untying of development aid, both European Union aid and aid granted by each and every one of the Member States.
. Mr President, I should like to make just a few points.
With regard to Mrs Korhola's comments, it is true that many years ago the World Bank and UN stated that up to 25% of development assistance was wasted from the point of view of the recipient countries because of tying to the donor countries.
This figure is not acceptable to the Commission because we have open competition between the 15 Member States, and adding a sixteenth does not really change the name of the game in terms of ensuring competitiveness when we are tendering.
Therefore, the dynamics of this mainly revolves around a classical case of a single bilateral donor country tying or not tying.
For the Commission, the dynamics of this, economically speaking, are not fantastic.
I would add that as a result of access to ACP countries, these countries have the right to bid on anything we tender relating to them.
About 25% of all tenders are now being won by ACP bidders.
This is good and is part of what Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n talked about as being important to attain.
Finally, it is true that food aid and the transport of food aid has - at the insistence of the US and via the decision in the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD - been excluded from what should be covered by untying of aid.
This is very sad and this is why we specifically refer to that problem as one of the elements in the broader topic of the untying of aid.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be at the end of the debates today.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on the bomb attacks in Mumbai:
B5-0371/2003 tabled by Gerard Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0376/2003 tabled by Bob van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0379/2003 tabled by Jean Lambert and Reinhold Messner, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0381/2003 tabled by Margrietus J. van den Berg and Maria Carrilho, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0386/2003 tabled by Giuseppe Di Lello Finuoli and Esko Olavi SeppÃ€nen, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and
B5-0387/2003 tabled by Charles Tannock and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
Mr President, I am surprised that for once my political group is the first to be called in the debate.
I recently had a long and interesting conversation in Scotland with the Consul General for India and we were reflecting upon the problems in trying to constitute a polity which is continental in scale and multilingual in character, with citizens of many faiths and of none, with memories of historical antagonism between religious communities and which tries to sustain a working democratic constitution and to live at peace with its neighbours.
We were thinking both of Europe and of India and it is humbling to us in the European Union, as we work towards improving our constitution, to think that India has achieved this continent-wide polyglot democracy in a secular polity for more than 50 years now.
We have a lot to learn from India and we should approach today's debate with a certain sense of humility in that regard.
However, evidently, as the horrifying events in Mumbai show us, all is not well in India.
The issue of the capability to sustain a secular state with religious tolerance is now before us, as is the question of whether the tension with Pakistan will be cooled and whether intercommunal relations in India will become peaceful.
That sets the background to this admirable resolution which is before us today.
Some of it in a sense merely states the obvious: of course we condemn the bomb attacks in Mumbai; of course we deplore the targeting of civilians; of course we feel great sympathy with the victims.
We support the Indian Government in its fight against terrorism, but there is more to be said than that and some of it is said in my group's amendment to the resolution where we call for further steps to be taken to enforce Indian constitutional law properly and to prevent communal violence inside India.
We are particularly aware, for example, of recent Amnesty International reports on problems in Gujarat and the responses to the 2002 massacre there.
The Indian National Human Rights Commission has itself called for improved vigilance by the Indian authorities and for effective protection of constitutional rights.
At the same time we welcome the Pakistani Government's assurance that it also deplores and has no time for the terrorist act in Mumbai.
Times are critical, but we must also be critically sympathetic to the Indian state.
Things are going wrong which will call for resolve in India to make them better.
We should carry this resolution and the amendments to it tabled in the name of my group and of the ELDR Group.
For a long time, India was a stable country with Hindus and Muslims coexisting peacefully alongside one another.
Last week's terrorist attacks in Mumbai might well spell the beginning of increasing violence between representatives of the religious communities.
I certainly hope it will not.
One of the suspects has already indicated that with this act, he wanted to take revenge for last year's anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which claimed the lives of 2 000 Muslims.
Developments in India over the past fifty years had been typified by cultural diversity and a heterogeneous society.
Over the past ten years, however, we have witnessed increasing alienation between Muslims and Hindus.
The immediate cause is the issue involving the temple of the god Ram.
The root cause, however, is to be sought more in the area of looming Hindu nationalism, where faith and national identity coincide.
Hindus fear Muslims and Christians, particularly demographically speaking.
Finally, needless to say, friction with Pakistan is continually placing a heavy strain on relations between them, including in India.
The Indian Government should take the problems seriously, and it appears now to be doing so.
An escalation must be avoided at all costs.
I have tabled an amendment in which the Indian Government is urged to draw up a plan of action in this respect.
India is not the only country that is facing tension between religions.
Almost half of the recent violent conflicts in the world have a religious dimension.
Consequently, I have expressly asked for this issue to be highlighted in my human rights report.
An institutionalised dialogue should be set up between the most important world religions.
The European Union should also look into this issue.
For a long time, India was a good example of the peaceful co-existence of religions.
It should pull out all the stops in order to again become the peaceful, stable country which it had been for such a long time.
Mr President, I wish to start, as other speakers have done, by conveying my condolences and those of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to the Indian authorities and to all the relatives of the victims, for the appalling attack perpetrated in Bombay.
I should also like to take this opportunity to say - as Mr MacCormick said - that there is indeed more to be said on the matter, although it is crucial to start saying exactly what he said, but not, I believe, if this means raising further problems, albeit very real ones, concerning human rights in India.
I do not believe that this is the appropriate time, place, or way to raise such issues, because what we do not need is an attempt to justify any form of terrorism against civilians, which is what has occurred in this case: we must condemn all such terrorist activities, whether the attack in Bombay or those that have placed Israel in a continual state of mourning, or, for example, the attack that took place in Buenos Aires, which the British judicial authorities are only now beginning to deal with, and are doing so extremely well, in a way that should be noted by all and which should, in fact, be the standard for all European political authorities.
This is not, unfortunately, always the case.
We must not hesitate to condemn terrorist attacks of this type and not attempt to justify them.
Our condemnation of fanaticism must be clear, unequivocal and resolute.
This is the message that I would like to make extremely clear, and this is why I do not believe that the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are appropriate.
Mr President, as the founder of the European Parliament Friends of India group, this resolution is intended as a gesture of solidarity with the people and government of India against the mindless violence perpetrated by a small number of fanatics drawn from Islamic extremists.
They believe the killing in Bombay with the bombing of innocents, including children and members of their own Muslim faith, to be justified and a way of destabilising the largest multicultural, democratic success story in the world.
I also salute the professionalism of the authorities, not only in their early success in apprehending the suspects and hopefully eventually securing convictions, but, most of all, preventing an escalation of further inter-communal violence.
I also welcome the response of the government of Pakistan, but it must crack down seriously if any evidence emerges of connections to Lashkar-e-Toiba and if any of its operations are shown to have been launched from Pakistani territory.
However, I particularly welcome their condemnation of the bomb attack.
It is essential that the political stability of India as a nuclear, regional superpower is upheld by all EU Member States and all other democratic nations of the world.
India is a country in which all groups have reached the highest offices, as illustrated by its current President and Head of State, who is a Muslim.
Within 20 years it will in terms of population be the largest country in the world, overtaking China.
Terrorism is a negation of all the values of those who seek to build rather than destroy.
This House condemns it everywhere, all over the world.
Mr President, the bombings at the Gateway of India and the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 killed and injured scores of innocent civilians.
These devastating and cowardly terrorist attacks remind us all that the scourge of terrorism is a threat faced by all democracies.
It is a challenge that we must face together by intensifying security cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral basis.
The United Kingdom in particular has strong historical ties with India.
I trust that the British Government will offer India all the support that it can in combating terrorism.
The Indian authorities and people have shown commendable restraint in the face of these latest outrages.
That, of course, is the right response.
The terrorists seek to stir wider hatred and animosity and undermine not only the secular democracy, which has been part of our legacy to India and India's great strength and example, but also the hopeful signs of rapprochement, which have been seen recently between India and Pakistan.
Pakistan should now clearly demonstrate its willingness to take effective action against terrorists on its borders with Afghanistan and now, even more urgently, on its borders with India - in cooperation with the Indian security authorities - before there is another conflagration.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group.
We support the joint resolution, but, at the same time, I would endorse Mr Casaca's comments that we should not be widening this resolution outside of its original terms.
Therefore, we will not support the two amendments by the Liberals and the Greens.
Of course the PSE Group condemns the cowardly 'twin towers' bombings of the Gateway of India and of the Zaveri Bazaar in Mumbai on 25 August 2003 that killed and injured so many people.
Under no circumstances can any terrorist attack that targets civilians, resulting in the loss of innocent lives, be accepted by the international community.
These terrorist bombs were clearly designed to cause maximum civilian causalities, to destabilise Indian society and weaken the Indian economy.
Yet members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities in India died in the attack and worked together in the rescue efforts.
We have seen a degree of restraint that we have to welcome.
At the same time, we welcome the statement by the Pakistani Foreign Minister expressing sympathy with the victims and their families.
We urge the Commission, the Council and this Parliament to do all they can to ensure that the current rapprochement between India and Pakistan is not damaged by these incidents.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the European Union must not pass over in silence the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.
Not only did these bombings, which hit India's financial centre, claim the lives of 52 people, they also threatened to jeopardise the peace process in the region.
It is regrettable that this should happen precisely at this moment in time, jeopardising the peace negotiations between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, a much-wanted region by both countries.
India has been making major efforts for some time to bring this conflict to an end.
After all, the Indian Government's policies are geared to the peaceful co-existence of the different nations, as illustrated by the number of Muslims occupying high government positions.
India is, moreover, the only country in southern Asia that has opted in favour of a secular and pluralist state model.
A choice of this kind is a clear expression of tolerance with regard to the various population groups.
It goes without saying that this raises very important issues, which must be viewed in terms of India's importance, not only in Asia but also in the world.
After all, we should not overlook the fact that India is a superpower boasting great economic potential and is also one of the European Union's important trading partners.
The objective of the violence was to destabilise society and deliver a blow to the Indian economy.
The international community should concern itself more with increasing Muslim fundamentalism in the world.
The recent attack against the UN headquarters in Iraq is a dramatic example of this.
This incident underlines once more the enormous threat that is emanating from ever increasing fundamentalism.
I take the view that the European Union and its Parliament have every reason to continue to support India as a constitutional state, where Hindus and Muslims are treated equally, in a bid to ensure respect for the principles of democracy.
.
The Commission agrees with Parliament's concerns and shares its view on the gravity of the recent bomb attacks in Mumbai.
These attacks are proof that terrorism can strike in any part of the world and have disastrous consequences.
The Commission condemned in the strongest possible terms the bomb attacks that caused much loss of life and many causalities in Mumbai on 25 August 2003.
President Prodi reacted immediately by sending a message to the Indian Prime Minister, Mr Vajpayee.
He condemned the attack, offered his condolences and assured India of EU support in the fight against terrorism.
The EU and India have stood and stand side by side in their fight against terrorism, as spelled out in a Joint Declaration issued at the 2001 Summit in Delhi.
Cooperation in this matter is part of our regular political dialogue at all levels, and we have set up a working group that has already met four times since May 2001.
A strong signal from the European Parliament is thus a very welcome contribution to the EU's expression of solidarity with India.
It will emphasise our common resolve to fight terrorism, wherever it occurs and whatever its motives.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at the end of the debates today.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on the situation in Liberia:
B5-0372/2003 tabled by Niall Andrews, on behalf of the UEN Group;
B5-0375/2003 tabled by Bob van den Bos and Anne AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0380/2003 tabled by Nelly Maes, Didier Rod and Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0382/2003 tabled by Margrietus J. van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group;
B5-0385/2003 tabled by Luisa Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and
B5-0388/2003 tabled by John Alexander Corrie and Bernd Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists welcomes the peace agreement signed a Accra on 18 August 2003 under the authority of ECOWAS, the Economic Community of West African States.
We are concerned that while this is holding in the capital, there are still problems in the rural areas, with reports even today of tens of thousands of people fleeing into Monrovia from Totota in Central Liberia.
That is hardly surprising, with the alleged massacres of hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians perpetuated in Nimba County since the signing of the agreement.
Fourteen years of violence and misrule in Liberia resulted in immense human suffering amongst civilians, as well as gross human rights violations, a breakdown in social and economic structures, and now 85% of the population is living below the poverty line.
The arrival of the peacekeeping force has enabled the peacekeeping process to start, but there is still a long way to go.
We look forward and call upon all the parties to the agreement to implement it in good faith and to establish a transitional government as promised on 14 October 2003, that will hopefully lead to free and fair elections.
We welcome the fact that the European Union has provided aid to that process, amounting to EUR 15 million to date.
We recognise that more may be necessary.
The problem is that at the moment the peace agreement is holding in Monrovia, but less well outside.
Part of that problem is that there is still a shortage of troops on the ground.
There are only 1 500 out of a promised 3 500.
Those troops are required as soon as possible.
We equally ask that all the states in the region refrain from any actions that might contribute to instability in Liberia and on the borders between Guinea, Sierra Leone and the CÃŽte d'Ivoire.
We ask that these neighbouring states act with discretion.
Mr President, corrupt and ruthless dictators continue to exploit and impoverish many countries in Africa.
Decades of international aid, especially EU aid, have been undone and destroyed.
Consequently millions suffer from avoidable diseases or are maimed and shot.
The EU must condemn these dictators and it must be ready to act promptly.
In cases like Liberia, where ECOWAS and Nigeria have taken the initiative. I hope the EU will do more than just provide the EUR 15 million that it is has pledged.
I am pleased, of course, that the EU is involved and I want to ensure that this Parliament is aware of the continuing problems in Africa, because it is European taxpayers who in the end become impatient if we are seen not to take appropriate action.
I hope Commissioner Nielson will do his best and keep Parliament informed, because we need to show that Liberia can recover and can perhaps be a model for other African countries.
We need to build it anew and ensure there is prosperity and peace.
Mr President, West Africa provides examples of the extent to which this region is rent asunder.
On the one hand, it is where there are the best opportunities for a regional market to grow and develop, and some states have done well by African standards in making progress in recent years.
On the other hand, there are states - of which Sierra Leone is one example, and Liberia is another - where not only is the state in crisis, but where every vestige of the rule of law threatens to disappear.
We have to consider how we are going to respond in the face of this situation.
We have to be clear in our own minds that Liberia started out with a congenital defect, as the descendants of black African returnees from America were in violent conflict with the indigenous inhabitants from the word go and the state has never been internally united.
Today there are also violent conflicts, organised criminality, powerful raw materials interests, and the danger, despite all current efforts and even though some period of time without war can be achieved, that the real problem, the establishment of a constitutional state that functions to some degree, will not actually be tackled.
Important though troops are, they cannot do it on their own.
What the country needs is the establishment of a state, the building of institutions, and the truth that a state does not come into being automatically is demonstrated in Somalia, where there has been no rule of law whatever for the past ten years.
It is a characteristically European conception that well-ordered states must always and everywhere be in place, even though, in the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War, it took us decades to re-establish a functioning state order.
For a start, then, we should not take an arrogant approach to these matters; secondly, we need to apply a certain healthy realism.
We must first put a stop to the violence and must alleviate the direst need; then, though, will begin a process, which will last decades, of re-establishing political institutions that work to at least some degree.
That will not happen without massive help from us, but nor can it be successful unless the people want to help themselves.
It cannot happen without support from the country's neighbours, without regional cooperation, without the establishment of a regional community in West Africa.
There are however two sides to this, as the state borders and ethnic boundaries do not coincide, resulting in the danger of aid to neighbourhoods being misused - as it was in the Congo - in order to strengthen the hand of related peoples in internal politics on the other side of the border and to upset the balance of nationalities.
A healthy combination of external help, help aimed at enabling people to help themselves, and regional cooperation offers the only chance for this region, racked by crises, to get back on its feet, at least in the medium term.
. Mr President, the Commission welcomes the peace agreement signed by the belligerent parties, civil society and political parties of the country on 18 August 2003.
We are still concerned about the ongoing fighting.
It is very important that ECOWAS fully deploys its peacekeeping troops to ensure that the peace agreement is respected on the ground.
The figure available to me as to how many troops have actually been deployed is 2127.
ECOWAS is doing what it is expected to do.
We hope that the presence of this force will permit a rapid resumption of humanitarian assistance and an end to the atrocities that, especially for women and children, have been terrible in Liberia.
We have been informed by ECOWAS that deployment should be completed by 9 September 2003.
It has appointed a special representative for Liberia to oversee the conduct of the peacekeeping force and monitor the implementation of the peace agreement.
ECOWAS is not in a position to carry the financial burden of these operations alone, and following the proposal from the Commission the Council decided to make EUR 50 million available to support the peace process broadly defined in Liberia.
This money comes from allocated funds for Liberia that were never used: because of the situation we could not work there normally.
For both the 7th and the 8th EDF, Liberia was more or less out of the circuit.
Some things were possible, but only very little.
About EUR 8 million of the EUR 50 million are earmarked to support the ECOWAS peace-keeping operation and for the creation of the office of the special representative.
The remaining funds should be used for a demobilisation and reintegration programme as well as for institution-building and the restoration of democratic structures.
In this regard, I was pleased to listen to Mr Posselt's contribution.
These were wise words warning against the arrogant approach of taking it for granted that a rapid process of elections does it.
This, unfortunately, is not the case.
We need to be pragmatic and rediscover the practical value of the notion of governance.
First stability or peace, then governance, then democratisation and then democracy itself.
We have to be pragmatic and not allow ourselves to surrender to the temptation of prescribing those nice things that we take for granted here in our environment.
We have to show confidence and be a more realistic partner.
Liberia has been going through the most terrible, traumatic times.
We also welcome the UN Security Council decision to establish a stabilisation force for Liberia to take over responsibility from ECOWAS as from 1 October 2003.
Also, the contributions from Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom for the peacekeeping force in Liberia are very welcome and we see a strong case for mobilising what I would now call 'partnership stamina'.
We tried, over the years, to do something meaningful in Liberia, but with Mr Taylor around this was almost impossible.
Regionally, it is extremely important that the opportunity now at hand is not missed.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will be at the end of the debates today.
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on Burma:
B5-0374/2003 tabled by Bob van den Bos and Anne AndrÃ©-LÃ©onard, on behalf of the ELDR Group;
B5-0378/2003 tabled by Patricia McKenna and Marie Anne Isler BÃ©guin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;
B5-0383/2003 tabled by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo and others, on behalf of the PSE Group
B5-0384/2003 tabled by Marianne Eriksson and Fausto Bertinotti on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group and
B5-0389/2003 tabled by Geoffrey Van Orden and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
In Burma, generals have for years been keeping their own people in their gunsights, and the opposition in captivity.
If the new Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, is really serious about his roadmap to democracy, he will immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues and give them an important role in this process.
He presented this roadmap a few days ago behind closed doors, without the presence of the media or foreign diplomats.
The plan is supposedly to set up a convention for a new constitution, which should lead to fair and free elections.
As no information was given as to the how and when of this plan, the only conclusion I can draw is that the military regime is trying to sidetrack the West and is hoping to break out of its isolation.
As it must not, of course, be allowed to succeed in this, I support the Council's decision to tighten the sanctions.
Any remaining business contacts should be completely severed.
The Commission and the Council, in cooperation with the United Nations, should continue to appeal for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues.
She has been held illegally for more than three months, during which time she has gone on hunger strike.
The international community must make the Burmese authorities responsible for her well-being and the Red Cross must gain access to her.
Pressure from the neighbouring countries in the ASEAN - China, India and Japan - must be stepped up.
Fortunately, the United States has also been very forthright in its opinion about the current situation and has expressly pledged its support to Aung San Suu Kyi.
Burma is still the pariah of the international community.
The military junta sees the enforcement of its own power as more important than the suffering of the Burmese people.
The generals' roadmap to democracy has so far only led to prison.
This is not only about the liberation of Aung San Suu Kyi, but also about the liberation of the Burmese people as a whole.
Mr President, I have had two opportunities to visit Burma since I became a Member of this House.
On the first occasion I carried a letter from President Klaus HÃ€nsch informing Aung San Suu Kyi of the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to her.
Khin Nyunt, the current Prime Minister, played a central role in ensuring I did not have the opportunity to deliver that letter in person.
On the second occasion I was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely.
On that occasion my colleagues and I were able to obtain her clear support for sanctions against the military regime in Burma.
I hope the Council and the Commission recognise that is the view of the National League for Democracy.
30 August marked three months of detention at the end of 13 years of open prison for Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy.
The State Peace and Development Council - the former SLORC - has harassed the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy and Aung San Suu Kyi.
The last time she was visited was in July.
On 31 August the United States reported she was on hunger strike.
The regime denies that.
If that is the case, the absolute minimum the authorities can do is to enable the international community to reassure itself of her wellbeing.
As for free and fair elections, the problem in Burma is not free and fair elections - those took place 13 years ago - but that the military regime is not prepared to accept the will of the Burmese people.
We welcome the fact that ASEAN started to get involved in this process at its ministerial meeting in June.
We welcome the pressure they put on Burma and note that the current military regime has refused to allow them to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi.
We demand her immediate release and that of all political prisoners, which would be a major step towards the restoration of democracy.
We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness, in collaboration with the United States, to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma.
In the meantime, we ask the Council to introduce tough further measures targeted against the regime, its members and their interests.
They should be imposing smart sanctions that hurt those people in power.
We call on the Council and Member States to ask the United Nations Security Council to urgently address the situation in Burma.
It is now more than three months since Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner and Sakharov Prize winner, was - to put it purely and simply - kidnapped by the Burmese junta, who have been holding her in detention ever since.
The UN emissaries and the representatives of the Red Cross have not been able to visit her regularly.
Last July a delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross was probably the last contact that Aung San Suu Kyi had with the outside world.
No one has seen her since.
Today, in the same way that the dictator denied secretly holding the young woman, the Burmese authorities are denying her hunger strike, made public on 31 August by the US State Department.
The imprisonment and arrest of militants of the National League for Democracy in May quite rightly gave rise to much feeling in the world.
The US took the opportunity to reinforce their economic sanctions on the Rangoon regime.
Today, the - no doubt demagogic - use of this announcement by the US cannot, however, hide the severity of the regime nor its hypocrisy in promising an official roadmap destined to restore democracy.
This programme, which includes, and I quote, 'free and fair elections and a new Constitution', still does not fix a timetable and remains silent on the release of the leader of the opposition.
It happened after the junta showed its desire to not respect any of the democratic demands of its people, and this is a bad omen.
The results of the 1990 elections which, let us remember, were a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi's party, were not recognised by the armed forces.
The Association of South-East Asian Nations now threatens to exclude Burma from its members.
It had hoped for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi before its next summit in Bali in October.
As for the European Union, it should do everything possible to compel the military junta to free the Nobel Prize winner.
In collaboration with the United Nations, the Council and the Commission should now show their determination, through strict sanctions, to do something practical in the process of democratisation in Burma.
Political pressure should increase.
Under the rule of one of the fiercest dictators, in the hands of a head of government who has held the duties of head of services of the military information for forty years, the Burmese people need all our solidarity.
The worry such as that for the lady of Rangoon is a genuine one.
Let us listen to the opposition, which has just declared that this hunger strike is a declaration that the Burmese generals are slowly but surely poisoning her.
Mr President, before the House today is a resolution on Burma, drafted with the support of all major political groups in this Parliament and therefore backed by representatives of all fifteen countries within the European Union.
It is absolutely unequivocal in its demand: the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi.
I hope this message is now being heard by the Burmese regime.
Aung San Suu Kyi is a symbol of resistance to tyranny and personifies the hopes of the people of Burma for freedom.
She has spent eight of the last thirteen years under some form of detention or restriction and on 30 May 2003 she was seized again and has been held virtually incommunicado, to all intents kidnapped by the regime in a military barracks in the Ye Mon district of Rangoon.
Four days ago it was reported that she was on hunger strike and that she was in a serious condition.
The International Committee of the Red Cross must be given immediate access to her in order to assist in the provision of emergency assistance.
Given the policy of the ICRC not to reveal the detention conditions of those that it visits, Aung San Suu Kyi should also be seen by Italian Ambassador Miniero, on behalf of the European Union, or by Her Majesty's Ambassador to Burma, Vicky Bowman.
These should be just the preliminaries to her release and to the release of scores of other National League for Democracy members and organisers, elected Members of Parliament, senior Party officials and students detained following the violent attack on opposition elements on 30 May 2003.
Each member of the State Peace and Development Council that runs Burma must be held personally responsible for the health, safety and wellbeing of Aung San Suu Kyi.
They must be put on notice that action will be taken against them.
General Khin Nyunt, the newly-appointed Prime Minister, has talked about a roadmap to democracy.
Let him show that he is serious, lift the barrier on that road, respond to our calls for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners and recognise the results of the 1990 elections which gave a landslide victory to the National League for Democracy.
To encourage him, much more needs to be done to increase the pressure on his military dictatorship in Burma.
Action should now be taken to strengthen the EU sanctions with moves to deny Burmese dictatorship the hard currency it uses to fund its repression.
As we have seen in other countries such as Zimbabwe, quiet diplomacy does not work.
Neighbouring ASEAN countries need to do more to bring about change in Burma.
I call on the Council presidency and the Commission to take urgent action, to visit Aung San Suu Kyi, to bring about her immediate release and, in case the SPDC does not respond in a positive way, to draw up new measures that can quickly be taken against the Burmese regime.
Mr President, what is achieved by this House's resolutions on human rights and debates on matters of urgent and topical importance?
In the case of Burma, not very much.
In June, we called for the speedy introduction of democracy and for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained in what was at the time a secret location.
She has, since 1988, been campaigning for more democracy, and was awarded our Sakharov Prize in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
It was partly through our pressure that representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross were able to visit her.
There is, however, no prospect of democracy being introduced with any sort of urgency.
Although the new Burmese Prime Minister, General Khin Nyunt, published, on 30 August, a roadmap for free elections by secret ballot, no firm date has been set for them.
My fellow Members are right not to set too much store by promises of democracy and such things as the summoning of a constitutional convention, for it is the armed forces who take decisions on all important matters, and the convention will have no influence on them whatever.
Aung San Suu Kyi has been on hunger strike since 31 August in order to make a forceful protest against her detention.
Let us, too, have done with half measures!
The EU's imposition of a visa ban and its freezing of the overseas assets of Burmese associates of the regime are nothing like enough.
As a community of values, one that exalts the maintenance of democracy and human rights as its supreme principle, the EU must take a hard line with the junta in Rangoon.
Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters must be released from detention at last.
The results of the free elections in 1990 must be accepted, power must be handed over to the forces of democracy, and the roadmap must be implemented, but under international supervision.
Commissioner Nielson, I urge you to press for tougher action to be taken and for further sanctions to be imposed.
These should, I believe, include an embargo on goods imported from Burma and a boycott of tourism in that country.
That, perhaps, will be the sort of language they will understand.
Mr President, as we are all deeply concerned for the personal safety of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi we have to remember her own words: 'investment that only goes to enrich an already wealthy elite bent on monopolising both economic and political power cannot contribute towards egality and justice, the foundation stones for a sound democracy'.
The SPCD's announcement to restart the National Convention that would lead to free and fair elections has to be taken with caution.
In the 15 years the regime has ruled Burma there has not been a single democratic reform.
In fact the human rights situation in Burma has become worse.
There has to be a very clear message from the European Union that relentless pressure will be applied to the Burmese regime.
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and the other political prisoners must be released immediately.
We should be prepared to strengthen our sanctions to encourage the SPDC to relinquish its grip on power and fully respect the results of the last elections.
Exports of oil, gas, gems, minerals and timber which provide the majority of the regime's income, could be targeted. as could the refusal of visas and freezing of assets.
Dictators and their regimes and families should not be allowed to leave their country or to acquire any assets abroad.
As well as increasing the sanctions against the regime, it is vital the EU should try to secure the cooperation and support of Asian countries, in particular Burma's neighbouring countries.
International pressure is necessary to force the regime to respond positively.
With Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi reported to be on hunger strike, the EU should intensify its actions to secure her release and the release of other detained NLD members and to support democratic change in Burma.
We should use our liberty to promote theirs.
Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I support what Mr Van Orden said.
He has set the problem out very well.
There is clearly a very serious problem, and Aung San Suu Kyi should be released immediately.
It is unacceptable that a delegation from this Parliament is not allowed, and has been refused, permission to visit her.
There is a real need for the other states in the region to maximise the pressure for her immediate release and to ensure that free elections concur with that.
I have to ask how long will the European Union and the United Nations drag their feet and stand back before they increase the pressure for the early release of those held in prison?
There is an urgent need for immediate action.
Words are easy, what we need now is for the roadmap to be implemented.
. Mr President, the Commission is deeply concerned by reports that Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, may be on hunger strike.
A statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rangoon dismisses this information as 'groundless'.
Other sources indicate, however, that the pro-Democracy leader is indeed on hunger strike.
Therefore it is of the utmost importance that an independent body be given the opportunity to immediately visit Aung San Suu Kyi.
The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is completely unacceptable.
The regime's argument that her detention was 'temporary' and 'protective' lacks all credibility.
The EU has repeatedly demanded immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other leading representatives of the Burmese National League for Democracy and will continue to do so.
The junta has to understand that her release will serve the interests of the regime, as it has declared its desire to move on in the process of national reconciliation.
The EU has declared itself ready to actively support the process of national reconciliation in Burma/Myanmar.
But as long as Aung San Suu Kyi and other activists of the National League for Democracy remain in prison, the basic preconditions for this process do not exist.
Any serious plan to bring about political change in Burma will need to incorporate a timeframe which gives a clear perspective for the process of national reconciliation.
We fully agree with the honourable Members of Parliament that this process will also need the support of the international community.
In this context we would like to reiterate our support for the efforts undertaken by UN Special Envoy Ambassador Razali.
It is high time for the regime in Rangoon to act.
If the new government under Prime Minister Khin Nyunt truly has intentions to work towards democracy and political reform, the first step would be to release Aung San Suu Kyi now and to immediately start a dialogue between the various parties concerned.
The joint debate is closed.
The next item is the vote.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of this report because I believe that, in order to increase the effectiveness, transparency and coherence of aid grants, we must endeavour to give all developing countries the option of allocating the aid they receive as they see fit, providing they fulfil the criteria of transparency, adequacy and proportionality.
Given the lack of definitive conclusions on the effects of such a process, what is needed first of all is a vote of confidence in the ability of the beneficiary states to act responsibly.
Such a move could enable these countries, if they see fit, to promote competition between suppliers of goods or services, thereby potentially reducing additional costs and the risks of corruption inherent in tied aid.
Despite adopting this principled stance, I would recommend caution, a gradual approach and the phasing in of the measure, because to do otherwise could lead to some States refusing to grant aid to developing countries, despite having the desire to do so, on the grounds that they cannot simply donate funds without receiving any form of compensation in return.
I suppose that, given the ambiguous nature of some political powers and public administrations, the corruption that we are attempting to prevent through the proposed untying could be perpetrated in other ways.
I would, therefore, recommend that that the Union monitors and keeps a close eye on the way in which this measure is implemented, in order effectively to assess the good that it does and to deter any potential distortion of it.
.
(PT) I have voted in favour of the report currently before us because I believe it is important to uphold preferential access to EU markets for bananas from the ACP countries, as is the need to reduce, by means of diversifying production, the economic dependency of these countries on the profits made from the sale this fruit.
I note and share the rapporteur's concern about the environment, and I would suggest a gradual and appropriate approach to withdrawing support from farms that are not 'environmentally friendly'.
I endorse his call for the Commission to pay particular attention to the needs of those countries such as Cape Verde and banana producers in Member State territory that, in this regard, do not even make use of the appropriations to which they are entitled.
We must continue to give them our support.
in writing. (FR) The reason why we abstained in this vote is twofold.
Firstly, under the terms 'protect ACP bananas' or 'the supplier countries', protection really goes to the capital invested in this sector, often though large financial groups in Great Britain or metropolitan France.
Nothing, on the other hand, protects the real producers, the banana workers, against low salaries imposed on the pretext of competition, or against lay-offs carried out by both the winners and losers of the trade war.
Secondly, this vote is destined in the end to be biased in favour of one or other of the players in the global competition of this sector.
We refuse to support one or other of the camps in this rivalry, the winner of which will be one of the multinational groups and certainly not the workers in this sector, nor consumers or taxpayers.
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.
. The British Conservative delegation is strongly supportive of human rights, properly defined, and welcomed much of the content of the report, in particular the call for more effective and consistent action in respect of countries such as Zimbabwe.
However, we abstained in the face of omissions and many unhelpful elements, for example:
Â· the report (with the exception of the explanatory statement) makes no mention of the need for good governance or of the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse;
Â· while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers, we cannot support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers aged under 18 in our own countries (paragraph 183);
Â· many of our members support the death penalty in certain circumstances and in any case regard the issue as a matter of conscience (paragraphs 164-170);
Â· we do not agree with the report's criticism of US policy towards the International Criminal Court, neither do we share the report's enthusiasm for the Court which might so easily become a political instrument, render our own government and military personnel vulnerable to mischievous action, and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers such as terrorists is unclear (paragraphs 155-160);
(Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 4 September 2003.
Just ten days ago, on the morning of 11 September 2003, Members heard the news of the tragic death of Anna Lindh, the Foreign Minister of Sweden.
As a former President of the Council and as a friend to so many, she was well-known in this House.
On behalf of the European Parliament and in my own name I sent our most deeply-felt condolences to Anna Lindh's family, her friends and colleagues and to the Swedish people, for an insupportable attack on her person and on freedom and democracy in Sweden.
All who met Anna Lindh came to know and appreciate her exceptional qualities of warmth, intelligence and openness of spirit: she was the exemplary face of modern European politics.
Today many will recall moments spent in her vivacious and always stimulating company.
Many, I expect will recall her direct and unpretentious personality and style.
She was one of the very best.
Our hearts and thoughts go out to her family, friends and loved ones.
She will be greatly missed.
I would ask you to observe a minute's silence to mark our respect.
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
Before we move to the order of business I should like to mark and welcome the positive vote this weekend in Latvia, which showed an overwhelming majority in favour of EU accession, with a very high turnout of voters.
This brings to a close a round of successful referenda in nine of the ten Accession States.
The Cypriot Parliament ratified EU membership unanimously on 14 July 2003.
I am sure colleagues will wish to join me in marking this milestone towards the target of an EU of 25 Member States on 1 May 2004.
We look forward now to the completion of the process of ratification in the parliaments of the Member States.
The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 18 September 2003 has been distributed.
The following changes have been proposed:
Tuesday:
I have received from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left a request to include a statement by the Commission on the situation of the ALSTOM Group after the general budget debate.
Mr President, the Commission is to give its opinion on the Alstom rescue plan by this evening.
This is a group which has 118 000 employees and whose activity encompasses industries which are of great importance for the European Union.
Far from seeing only the European aspect of the issue, I would point out that the group's previous board of directors and the French state are also greatly to blame.
That said, the European Union is implicated, with regard to competition rules, state aid and also the inordinate power wielded by the Commission in these matters.
That is why I feel that the Alstom affair points, in some way, to the strategic choices that we have to make for the future of Europe, particularly in terms of adopting a Constitution.
My group therefore proposes that, if possible, the issue be included in tomorrow's agenda in the form of a Commission statement followed by a debate.
Mr President, I believe that Mr Schulz's reference to the need for preliminary investigations, as well as his serious approach to the problems, indicate that a debate on them would be premature.
At the moment, I do not see that the conditions he has enumerated for a serious debate have been fulfilled, and it is for that reason that we oppose the motion.
The fact is that we should not have a debate if it is to be conducted only on the basis of an emotional response to day-to-day politics, in the absence of the necessary conditions for a debate, and without us being able to complete it with a resolution.
Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of this request.
This is a highly contentious issue.
I quite rightly asked DG I to look at the report as it was voted in committee to see if it was legally admissible in the way it set up and called for a committee of inquiry.
Subsequently, changes were introduced to satisfy DG I.
However, it came to my notice that other changes were introduced into paragraph 4, which bring about a profound change which is not in compliance with the request made by DG I. There is a very lengthy legal opinion.
Even with the changes that Mr Perry wishes to make, recitals N and V, according to paragraph 26 of the legal opinion, are still not legally admissible.
Therefore, rather than open up a debate here, and given the technical nature of this report, I recommend that your services look at the report as it is tabled - which brings in Mr Perry's explanatory statement, explicitly referred to in paragraph 5 - so that you can rule whether, as it currently stands, it is legally admissible.
Furthermore, and in conclusion, it is vital that the report that comes to the House accurately reflects what we voted on in committee.
I am afraid as it stands this report does not do so.
Mr Cashman, I want to be clear on this.
My information is that you are requesting, on behalf of your group, referral back to committee.
You have in addition requested that I should rule as regards admissibility.
Which is the request that you wish to stand?
Mr President, I will accept the House's wisdom on behalf of my group, as I think it would be a long, drawn-out process to refer the report back to the legal services.
Mr President, I regret that the PSE Group made no attempt to contact me or my office about this proposal they were going to make.
The Committee on Petitions would very keenly wish to respect and observe the Rules of the House and that is why our Chairman, Mr Gemelli, took careful legal advice.
The legal advice we have received from the Parliament's Legal Service is that we can most certainly proceed with the report on Thursday.
I myself have submitted an amendment which I will commend to the House on Thursday.
It simply says that this House reserves its right, if it does not receive information from the Commission, to carry out further parliamentary inquiries.
I regret that Mr Cashman is seeking to make this so contentious.
The first petition came to us in 1997.
There is no good reason why this House should delay debating that report.
We need to vote on this.
There may be legal issues here but allow me to come to those in a moment.
The basic political question is whether or not to refer this report back to committee.
(Parliament rejected the request)
So the report is then on the agenda.
Regarding the legal issue, I shall invite the services to prepare a note for whoever is in the chair at the sitting on Thursday when the debate takes place, so that they are able to deal with the questions which have been raised as to whether or not there is a legal question of admissibility.
Mr Perry tells us there is no problem in this regard, and Mr Cashman disagrees.
I would ask the services to ensure that the Presidency of Parliament is able to deal with this matter in a satisfactory manner at the outset of the debate on Thursday.
As regards the oral question on the difficulties facing beekeepers, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has asked to wind up this debate with a motion for a resolution which could be voted in Brussels on 9 October 2003.
Mr President, the Conference of Presidents has very kindly decided to include the oral question on the difficulties encountered by European beekeeping in the agenda for this Thursday's plenary sitting. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted the oral question on 12 June in accordance with Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure.
The committee appointed Mr Souchet and myself to draw up a motion for a resolution to conclude the debate and we wanted to adopt the motion for a resolution on 30 September.
Now, since you have brought the timetable forward - something which does not happen often but which we greatly welcome - I would like to ask, if the debate on the question is to be included in Thursday's agenda, to include the vote on the motion for a resolution which the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is to adopt on 30 September in the first October part-session.
Thus, if the vote on the resolution can be taken during the first October part-session, we agree to the oral question with debate being included in this Thursday's agenda.
If the vote cannot take place during the first October part-session, we do not.
Mr President, like you I welcome the final referendum which took place in Latvia this weekend and resulted in a strong 'yes' vote for joining the European Union.
I look forward to seeing full ratification by all 10 accession countries.
One issue raised is the need to ensure that the citizens of all 25 states who are resident in Member States other than their own are entitled to vote.
Would the President's office undertake a review of the 25 Member States to see which arrangements are in place allowing these European citizens to vote in states which are not their own?
It is important that they are not only entitled but also encouraged to do so.
Mr President, I wish to inform the House about the situation regarding the number of subscriptions to the magazine Focus on Europe, published by the European Parliament.
The last issue appeared in May 2003.
It was published in the 11 working languages of the European Parliament and, for the first time, there was a special edition in the Catalan language as well.
I thought it would be interesting to find out how many Catalan-speaking citizens have requested a subscription for this magazine in its Catalan version.
According to information obtained from an office of the European Parliament last week, 31 000 have taken out a subscription to the Catalan version.
If we compare this figure with the subscriptions taken out in other languages - for instance, 63 000 in French and 51 000 in Italian - and analyse the ratio between the subscriptions and the number of speakers of a given language, the conclusion is that there is a very high ratio in the case of Catalan speakers.
This is a clear demonstration that it was a positive decision to publish the Focus on Europe magazine also in the Catalan language.
Thank you, Mr VallvÃ©, you clearly have a very active interest in this matter.
Mr President, for two years, the so-called International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia has been trying to find support for accusations against Slobodan Milosevic.
Despite hundreds of false testimonies and the plethora of fabricated evidence, the indictment is turning into a fiasco.
The only thing those conducting the prosecution and those hiding behind them have managed to do is to destroy the health of President Milosevic in a bid, perhaps, to exterminate him physically.
The new element is that, on completion of the indictment, Milosevic was given a mere three months in which to prepare the presentation of his side, at a time when everyone knows both the state of his health and the fact that he has no outside help and refuses to legitimise the entire procedure.
At the same time, he has been refused visits by members of his party and the committees supporting him.
The Communist Party of Greece roundly condemns the cumulative violations of fundamental rights at Mr Milosevic's expense and calls for the trial to be adjourned for two years, for him to be released so that he can return to Belgrade in order to recover and prepare himself.
We are convinced that, however much the imperialists try to justify their crimes in Yugoslavia by distorting the truth, they will not succeed.
Mr President, I wish to express my concerns about recent developments in Zimbabwe, in particular the closure of the only remaining independent newspaper in the country, the Daily News, in spite of a High Court decision to the contrary.
As you know, over the past two years this House has repeatedly stated in very clear terms its anxiety about the appalling situation in Zimbabwe caused by the Mugabe regime.
We have called for tougher measures to be introduced by the Council and for the other countries of Southern Africa, in particular the Republic of South Africa, to play a stronger role in bringing about change for the better in Zimbabwe.
While welcoming the statement by the Council presidency on 18 September 2003, words are not enough.
I am disappointed not to have received replies to my letters to the Greek and Italian Foreign Ministers on this subject.
I would like to ask the President to insist that Council respond to the concerns of Parliament and take seriously the need for effective action against the Mugabe regime.
Thank you, Mr Van Orden.
We shall communicate that to the Council on behalf of the House.
Mr President, I will be very brief.
I would just like to bring up a matter which has already come to the attention of this House several times.
I am referring to the drama in which the Nigerian citizen Amina Lawal is embroiled.
Amnesty International recently circulated an appeal suggesting that her sentence had been confirmed.
The latest reports, however, also from Amnesty International, suggest that that is not the case and that her appeal will be heard at a hearing on 25 September.
I therefore call on my fellow Members to use this week to make further demands for the Nigerian authorities to bring this absurd persecution to an end.
I would also ask you, Mr President, to pass on the feelings of outrage (which have been expressed several times by this House) awoken in us by the persecution, on perfectly absurd grounds, of this Nigerian citizen.
Mr President, on this European Car Free Day we discover that the direct train between Brussels and Strasbourg has been abolished.
This means that once again hundreds of people have had to use their cars to get here.
It is an absolute disgrace - dangerous for the environment and for the image of Parliament.
It is our job to set an example.
I therefore call upon you to start negotiations immediately with the French and Belgian railways to solve this problem soon.
Every session there are complaints about the accessibility of Strasbourg.
We are tired of it!
We must cut the Gordian knot with regard to the seat of this Parliament once and for all.
I regret to welcome you on board the already long queue of complaints regarding some of these issues.
We will see what we can do.
Mr President, I should like to denounce the fact that, last week, another two workers died in Greece and two others were seriously injured in the mines belonging to the president of the Association of Hellenic Industries, Mr Kyriakopoulos.
These two deaths come in the wake of another six deaths as the result of similar accidents at work, together with dozens of injuries in September alone.
It would appear that workers in the countries of the European Union - and I am speaking of Greece in particular - are indeed considered to be expendable resources and their health and their lives are being sacrificed by big business to the quest for maximum profit.
It is my impression that this intolerable situation is not manifesting itself in Greece alone.
The evidence proves it, perhaps more intensely in Greece.
Hundreds lose their lives and thousands are injured every year in my country alone.
Imagine what is happening in the European Union as a whole.
If you think this is in keeping with generous proclamations about employment, about securing health and safety in the workplace, then we really are mistaken.
That is why we believe that this is yet another sign of the system under which we live and the barbarity of that system towards people trying to earn an honest living.
Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to a serious matter.
The Preparatory Committee for the World Summit on the Information Society is sitting in Geneva.
Firstly, two non-governmental organisations - the organisations Reporters Sans FrontiÃšres and Human Rights in China - have been denied access to this committee.
Secondly, the second phase of the World Summit on the Information Society is to take place in Tunis.
Now, the World Organisation Against Torture informs us that Tunisia has appointed as president of the Summit none other than General Habib Ammar, a former Commander of Habib Bourguiba's National Guard and former Minister for Internal Affairs, the creator of the national headquarters of the Special Services in Tunisia, famed for its use of torture in the country.
Mr President, I would like to ask you to intervene to prevent responsibility for the UN World Summit on the Information Society being given to a person whose hands are stained with blood from torture, which would thus, as a result, penetrate the Internet and the information society.
Mr Cappato, I shall look into that and return to you and the House in due course.
Mr President, this morning in the Irish press there was a very interesting report by the European Research Institute in Ispra.
In the light of concerns expressed in the past about air quality within the institutions, I propose to email to colleagues this article which once and for all scotches any feeling that smoking within an enclosed area is anything but harmful.
The research is quite alarming and I hope that colleagues who like to smoke will respect the health of everybody else by refraining from doing so within Parliament, except in the very limited areas where smoking is permitted.
The report, which is considered to be one of the best ever on air quality, raises very many serious concerns which I have proposed, as Quaestor, to bring to the attention of the services in the building.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I have not had the chance to engage in a proper political debate on the Commission's actions, I will use this one meagre minute to express my disappointment with the Commission's actions, which should be criticised in three areas, to my mind.
The first area is budgetary policy and the Commission's ongoing inflexibility in interpreting the criteria of the Stability Pact.
This runs counter to the interests of the European economy and stands in the way of economic recovery.
The second cause for complaint is linked to the inflexibility of this Commission's actions with regard to competition policy, an inflexibility which is impervious to industrial logic and the interests of European industry.
The third reason is linked to the Commission's behaviour regarding the Intergovernmental Conference: while all those who champion the draft Constitution are closing ranks to defend it, the Commission has proposed a renegotiation of that draft Constitution at the Intergovernmental Conference.
I am disappointed with the Commission, which has ceased to be the driving force behind Europe and become a burden, but I will now stop criticising it!
You are unanimous in that.
Mr President, last week, on Wednesday, to be precise, the new office of the Church of Scientology was inaugurated in Brussels with great pomp.
I must express my surprise, Mr President, that such an event could take place right in the middle of the European quarter. I must also condemn the misrepresentation which may have occurred, for this office is called the 'European Office for Public Affairs and Human Rights'.
As Members of Parliament, we all received invitations to this inauguration ceremony, which we found in our personal letter boxes in Parliament with a label indicating the numbers and floors of our offices.
The invitations were not stamped, which means they were distributed.
I would like to know how it is possible for these invitations to have been distributed and who brought them to the European Parliament.
I feel, Mr President, that we should be more careful where a sect such as this is concerned, which is to be tried in Belgium in a few days' time for swindling, misrepresentations of all kinds, the unlawful practising of medicine and a great many other offences of which it is accused.
