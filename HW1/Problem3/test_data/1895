Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to add two words to Amendment 2, namely âand SMEsâ, so that the first line would read âAgrees that State aid should be allocated on the basis of criteria favouring innovative start-ups and SMEsâ, etc.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to say that we are about to vote on a fantastic resolution on the promotion of multilingualism in Europe, which will undoubtedly be approved by a large majority of this Parliament.
At times, unfortunately, contradictions arise between what Parliament does and what Parliament says: yesterday, the Bureau rejected the possibility of European citizens addressing our institution in a language with equal official status, contrary to the positions taken in the Council and the Commission.
I believe that that is completely at odds with what we are about to vote on, and we, as a group, will appeal.
Â Â  â Mrs Frassoni, that is the second time today and I think it is not on the agenda.
In all events, we have listened to you with great sympathy.
â That concludes Voting Time.
Â Â  . I voted against the change of name for the Iranian delegation not in order to make our relations with Iran any more difficult (on the contrary I hope we can have good and positive relations with this country) but simply because I believe Parliament should be consistent.
If we were to change the name of this delegation we should do the same for all those countries that have complex names.
It is established practice that we use the geographic names of counterparts.
I am not against revisiting this practice but we should do it for all countries.
Â Â  . Any decision to change the name of this Parliamentâs exchange delegation with the Iranian Parliament is far too fundamental not to be preceded by proper preparatory discussion.
If that name reflects the fact that Iran currently refers to itself as an Islamic Republic, this could mean that this House might not be interested in contacts with Iran under a different regime, although a change in regime is both likely and desirable.
The current regime threatens its own people with capital punishment and restricts their freedoms, and the outside world with the development of nuclear weapons and the denial of Israelâs right to exist.
The regime believes in everything to which the pursuit of democracy and human rights is opposed.
Adapting to that regime is not the solution, nor is waging war with it.
The only way to improve this situation is if the Iranian opposition, which is partly living in exile in Europe, is given the opportunity of running their country in a normal manner.
Anticipating this, there is no reason whatsoever to pander to the wishes of the current regime in its belief that the current state structure is eternal and God-given.
Â Â  . I am totally opposed to the proposal by the Conference of Presidents to change the name of the delegation for relations with Iran.
More than anything, the timing is poor.
At a time when Iran needs to be made aware that the international community is not prepared to ignore the threat posed by the regime, this gesture makes no sense.
Furthermore, any analysis of this proposal would have to be done on an across-the-board basis, addressing all of the countries with which Parliament has delegations and which also have different official names from those used in the parliamentary name.
This not being the case â and I am not advocating that this is what we should be doing â there is even less justification for making an exception for Iran.
The only exceptional thing about Iran at present is the fact that it is posing a challenge and a threat to the international Community.
Now is the time to stand firm.
It is the time to negotiate, of course, but to do so resolutely.
To change the name of the parliamentary delegation is not a sign of resoluteness.
Â Â  . Given that Bulgaria, Romania and Austria submitted requests for aid due to the damage caused by the floods between April and August 2005 and that on other occasions, I have supported the use of the Solidarity Fund to respond to such disasters, I must add my voice to the calls for solidarity with these countries.
The idea of solidarity, risk-sharing and mutual help lies at the heart of cases such as these, and deserves my support.
Â Â  â Mr President, on the subject of the Prets report, I believe it to be a platitude to say that cultural diversity has to be promoted.
We have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity, especially among the Muslim immigrant population, albeit without, on the other hand, ensuring that our own culture is recognised in the countries of the Islamic world.
Things have come to such a pass that their culture is attempting to force ours, even in our own countries, to yield place to it.
It is not just a case of Western culture being put under pressure by demands for such things as headscarves for schoolteachers, but also of Muslim immigrants becoming ever more hostile to Christian symbols and traditions.
In the meantime, a misconceived tolerance and ideological multiculturalism are resulting in the building of more and more minarets, and our own linguistic culture, too, is being undermined by school classes in which over half the pupils are foreigners.
These are disturbing developments, and I do not believe that the Unesco convention takes such things into account.
Â Â  . Parliament has shown its commitment to recognising cultural diversity within the field of international law, by adopting a Convention within UNESCO on Cultural Diversity on 20Â OctoberÂ 2005 in Paris.
The purpose of this Convention is to promote and protect the diversity of cultural content and artistic expressions.
Furthermore, it aims to facilitate the development and adoption of cultural policies and appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions and also to encourage wider international cultural exchanges.
The Convention establishes, at international level, the recognition of the sovereign right for states and governments to draw up and adopt cultural policies allowing the development of their own cultural sectors.
The Convention acknowledges that cultural diversity is strengthened by the free flow of ideas and reaffirms the importance of freedom of thought and the diversity of the media.
It recognises the right of States to adopt audiovisual policies and foster their audiovisual industries.
It reaffirms the important role of public service broadcasting for cultural diversity and media pluralism.
Hence our vote in favour.
Â Â  . I welcome this report on the UNESCO Convention.
The new Convention aims to facilitate the development and adoption of cultural policies and appropriate measures for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions and also to encourage wider international cultural exchanges.
The Convention acknowledges that cultural diversity is strengthened by the free flow of ideas and reaffirms the importance of freedom of thought and the diversity of the media.
I welcome the fact that the Convention recognises the distinctive nature of cultural goods and services as transmitters of values and identity and it establishes that they transcend their commercial dimension legitimising thus domestic and international cultural policies.
Â Â  . This report relates to the amendments to Council Decision 90/424/EEC so that EU financial support will be granted for veterinary measures affecting aquatic animals as well as terrestrial animals.
These amendments are vitally important if financial support is to be obtained from the future European fisheries fund, which would enable Member States to combat serious diseases in farmed animals.
The change to the date of entry into force laid down by this report is consistent with another amendment proposed in the report relating to the Directive on the prevention and control of diseases affecting aquaculture.
This is a more workable solution than the one previously put forward by the Commission and as such deserves my support.
Â Â  . The purpose of this report is to update, recast and consolidate the rules on animal health in relation to the trade in aquaculture products, including the prevention and control of certain diseases, and in turn to increase the competitiveness of European aquaculture producers.
The objective of the legislative amendments that have been tabled is to simplify and modernise existing rules and innovation in the sector in readiness for future challenges.
I feel that the amendments to the Kindermann report that have been adopted enhance the Commissionâs original proposal and have brought it up to speed with the actual situation in the Member States in this field.
Â Â  We voted in favour of the report on the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting.
It would, however, be naÃ¯ve to believe that the transition did not involve increased costs for consumers.
The transition does involve certain costs, for example in connection with new equipment.
The Member States should, however, ensure that these costs are kept to an acceptable level.
It is important for piracy to be combated, but we are dubious about continued harmonisation of copyright.
Â Â  We have voted against the report on the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting because we do not believe that decisions on matters such as this should be taken at EU level.
We have definite objections when it comes to the practical issues too.
Cultural diversity cannot be guaranteed by authorities or by protecting so-called public service companies from competition.
We are also opposed to the idea of changing TV technology by decree and through political decisions instead of letting peopleâs own choices prevail.
Â Â  . In spite of the cosmetic amendments brought in at the eleventh hour and the inclusion of points with which we naturally agree, the resolution before us reveals much about the EUâs real intentions as regards its so-called âcooperationâ with Latin American countries.
Among many other aspects that are worthy of criticism and that we reject, I wish to highlight the following:
- the use of so-called âintegrationâ processes â always following a model imposed by the EU â as an instrument for promoting capitalist integration and the liberalisation of trade, to the benefit of the major powers and the large economic and financial groups;
- the creation of the largest possible free trade areas, on the basis of bilateral and multilateral agreements, in order to attain a level of trade liberalisation that has hitherto been impossible to introduce at the WTO;
- the creation of a so-called âbi-regional conflict prevention centreâ as a means of paving the way for EU interference in Latin America (not to be reciprocated);
- lastly, showing lamentable consistency, the total lack of condemnation of the criminal embargo on Cuba and the USAâs extra-territorial laws against the country.
In other words, this is a resolution that runs counter to the declaration made by progressive Members of Parliament from Europe and Latin America at Bregenz.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  This own-initiative report is about the form to be taken in the future by cooperation between the EU and Latin America.
At present there is an interparliamentary conference, but the European Parliament now wants to set up a parliamentary assembly with a permanent secretariat.
The report also contains a host of very bad proposals in areas in which the European Parliament should definitely not express opinions.
For example, it is proposed to set up a solidarity fund, together with a âPlan for Latin Americaâ.
The June List objects to this proposal.
It is certainly true that a very large part of Latin Americaâs population lives in poverty, but it is not the EU that is the solution to the problem.
In relevant cases, aid should be provided by individual Member States or through UN bodies.
It is also proposed that, as soon as possible, the Latin American regional parliamentary assemblies introduce elections by direct universal suffrage to these assemblies in order to create a structure similar to that of the European Parliament.
It is, of course, up to the countries concerned to decide for themselves how their interparliamentary cooperation is to be organised.
I have therefore voted against the report in todayâs vote.
Â Â  .Latin America was heralded as the giant power for the end of the 20thÂ century.
Sixty years later, ultraliberal policies, institutional shortcomings and the difficult relationship with the neighbouring United States have had consequences that can be observed in the Andes or the favelas of Rio.
Yet, Latin America is rich in every respect, starting with its inhabitants, who have a powerful culture.
Europe cannot, therefore, fail to take an interest in it.
We must therefore give âpower to the imaginationâ in European-Latin American relations, because the correct model of relations lies between âChristlike cosmopolitanismâ and âWestphalian cosmopolitanismâ.
This median point between diplomatic Plato and Machiavelli is located in a âfour-square model of humanitarianismâ.
Europe must propose that resources are shared between the two shores of the Latin world: water, food, education and medicines.
An economic security Council must be added to the Euro-Atlantic Assembly, which was proposed by the Bregenz summit on 25Â April 2006.
Funded by a form of VAT on the numerous services provided, from space and geostationary satellites, this Council would make a success of partnerships aimed at supplying water and providing basic medicines, education and food.
This four-square model at the core of humanitarianism would prevent Ecuador from pouring into Spain and children in Latin America from being reduced to donating their organs for the commercial trafficking of insane capitalism.
Â Â  . Europeâs main priority, in my view, should be at regional level.
The EU has a duty towards the citizens of its Member States, and as a member of the international community, to play a unique role in its immediate sphere of influence.
There is a place, and a need, however, for this to be extended to other areas of influence, and that naturally includes Latin America.
For historical, cultural and linguistic reasons, this is an area with huge potential for developing political and economic cooperation and, more importantly, international relations, where collaboration between those on both sides of the Atlantic could be extremely advantageous.
Lastly, I wish to make a point from a Portuguese perspective.
Whilst Portugal has a duty to make Africa one of its priority areas in foreign policy, it must not overlook the importance of transatlantic ties.
It must therefore give full support to initiatives such as the summit to be held in Vienna on 12 and 13Â May.
I therefore hope that this summit will produce a positive outcome, with particular regard to the negotiations with Mercosur, an issue to which I have on a number of occasions displayed my concern and commitment.
Â Â  .
In the year in which we are celebrating 20 years of Portugal and Spainâs membership of the European Communities, it is appropriate to point out that Europe has stood to gain from the special knowledge of life in Latin America that these countries have brought.
It would gain even more besides if it promoted the teaching of Portuguese and Spanish as important world languages.
I agree with the rapporteur that we need closer ties in terms of economic and cultural cooperation with Latin America and I would highlight the vital role in this regard of relations with Brazil, an essential player in this partnership process.
I am alarmed to note that while there has been progress in terms of democracy and freedom in Latin America, this has generally not been matched by progress in combating poverty and social inequality.
The EU should not, in my view, accept flagrant violations of human rights and the scaling back of civil liberties, as we have seen in Cuba and more recently in Hugo ChÃ¡vezâs Venezuela.
I await with interest the outcome of the Vienna summit and hope that it succeeds in genuinely strengthening relations between the EU and Latin America. `
Â Â  . The changes to the fisheries protocol discussed in the Commissionâs proposal and Parliamentâs report will make it possible to bring fishing effort into line with the precarious state of resources in the cephalopod category and to compensate the fleet by means of an increase in the number of licences for the pelagic and tuna categories.
These amendments do not obstruct the integration of fleets flying flags of the new Member States, whilst at the same time guaranteeing continuity of access for Community fishing vessels which traditionally operate under this agreement.
I therefore support this report.
Â Â  . The way in which the Commission handled its finances in 2004 gives me and MrÂ Belder sufficient reason to call for the granting of the discharge to be postponed.
First of all, it must be absolutely clear what the Commission intends to do about the problems surrounding the opening balance sheet.
In addition, it is undesirable that there should be any delay setting up, applying and enforcing the internal control standards.
Thirdly, the Commission must table a plan of approach that includes a target date for working towards a positive Statement of Assurance.
Fourthly, the amount of the advance payments left outstanding is high to an untenable degree.
It is not clear to us how, and when, the Commission would like to see this problem solved.
Finally, it defies belief that Greece, a Member State, still receives maximum agricultural subsidies even though it has not met the requirement of fully introducing the IACS for more than ten years.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to take the floor in order to explain my vote: I voted not to grant discharge to Parliament's budget, because I believe that the decision taken on the issues that have arisen concerning the buildings in Strasbourg underplays matters.
An issue such as this, which is connected precisely to the buildings in which the work of our Parliament in Strasbourg is carried out, can no longer be filed away amongst internal administrative paperwork.
I have heard that the President himself has already duly sent a letter to the City of Strasbourg.
As per the fundamental principle of transparency that underpins the European institutions, I propose that a temporary committee of inquiry be set up immediately in order to shed light on all the circumstances surrounding the leases on the Strasbourg buildings and on who is behind the Erasmo company.
Â Â  . My colleague Mr Blokland and I have voted against discharge being granted to the President of the European Parliament for the implementation of the budget in the year 2004.
The dislocation of Parliament in Strasbourg meets with incomprehension among the electorate, although Parliament itself is dealing with the consequences of a decision that was taken by the European Council.
We think that the rent paid in excess, which amounts to 10% of the annual rent, should be reclaimed from Strasbourg city council.
This is a for granting discharge.
Â Â  . I voted not to grant discharge to Parliamentâs budget, not because of any problem with the administration of Parliament itself, but because of the allegations that Parliament, and therefore the people of Europe, have been ripped off by the City of Strasbourg.
We have the absurdity of John Majorâs deal in 1992 during the then British Presidency that gave Germany the recognition of Croatia and the consequent tens of thousands of deaths in the ensuing civil wars.
That gave Britain an opt-out from the Social Chapter threatening to deny, before the welcome arrival of Tony Blairâs Labour Government coming to the rescue, decent social standards to the people of Britain and condemned, at French insistence, Parliament to travel in perpetuity to Strasbourg, at a cost of EUR 400 million a year and the criminal inefficiencies entailed.
Now we learn on top of all that the City of Strasbourg may well have been using the decision to exploit its monopoly to defraud the people of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ Ferberâs report on the 2004 discharge of the European Parliament is fundamentally dishonest.
Taking advantage of the new anti-Strasbourg offensive launched by the Anglo-Saxon lobby, MrÂ Ferber is going beyond his role of rapporteur in order slyly to set himself up as Strasbourg's critic.
No, the European Parliament cannot decide on the location in which it will be based.
That is a unanimous decision taken by the Heads of State or Government, which has been enshrined in the European Treaties since the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1999.
No, neither Strasbourg nor France are prepared to agree to give up what they have for some uncertain alternative, that is, to agree to the European Parliamentâs being transferred to Brussels in exchange for a European Institute of Technology.
Why not have a European centre of gerontology?
Just as some people want to make France and the Netherlands vote again on the defunct European Constitution, others indulge in wishful thinking and want to do away with the European Parliamentâs base in Strasbourg in flagrant breach of the Treaties.
We will resolutely oppose that, not only on behalf of France, but also on behalf of the general interest of Europe.
Â Â  . I voted against this report in order to give the Committee on Budgetary Control more time to investigate the possible overcharging of the Parliament for its buildings in Strasbourg.
It is vital that a full investigation be held into this highly unsatisfactory situation.
Parliament must do everything possible to safeguard taxpayersâ money.
Â Â  . Since 1999, all Dutch Members have committed not to join the pension fund, because on the one hand, by joining the fund, those taking part are entitled to two pensions and on the other hand, the pension premium is largely, if not wholly in practice, paid by Parliament.
It is extremely vexatious that this House should be landed with the shortages that have already occurred on account of bad management in the Membersâ pension funds.
In that way, the taxpayers end up picking up the tab for irresponsible behaviour on the part of the people who represent them, and whose main interest would appear to be in seeking excessive financial reward.
I consider even more vexing the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has largely deleted the just criticism of the account of what happened in connection with the pension fund, as included in the original version of the Ferber report.
In so doing, this Committee has failed miserably as a monitoring body, and it is for that reason that I shall not be voting in favour of this discharge.
Â Â  . This week, it became public knowledge that in all likelihood, the European Parliament has, for 25 years, been wrongly required to pay an excessive rent for the use of the buildings in Strasbourg.
That was reason enough for putting off approval of the annual accounts until such time as this matter has been fully investigated.
That, to my mind, is only fair.
At the same time, a similar scenario is being played out in the Committee of the Regions.
Here too, there have been financial irregularities and an inquiry is underway.
It is therefore beyond me that a majority now appears prepared to approve these annual accounts, even though inquiry into fraud is still running, and so nothing like all the facts are known.
The fact that a majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control has rejected a planned hearing about the irregularities in the Committee on the Regions strikes me as very worrying.
It now looks like Parliament only objects to financial irregularities if its own money is involved.
This is about funds that all Europeans together have to raise for fulfilling useful tasks, and those funds should not be wasted.
I will therefore vote against approval of the Committee of the Regionsâ annual accounts.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of granting discharge to the Ombudsman.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions I value the work of the Ombudsman and believe he carries out his duties effectively and diligently.
Â Â  . I contribute to this debate as someone who was partly responsible, as Parliamentâs representative on the Council of Ministersâ Consultative Commission on Racism and Xenophobia from 1994 to 1999, for the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
I have no serious quarrel with Mr Guidoniâs report on this Monitoring Centre, but I wish to enter reservations about firstly the underfunding of this Centre compared to the raft of other centres with what I consider less importance to the people of Europe such as Translation or Training.
Secondly the commitment without additional funding to widen its remit to human rights, making its already difficult task virtually impossible.
I do not believe these events are unconnected with the politics of this institution.
Some are fellow travellers with racists and xenophobes, while others take the issue far too lightly.
I do not see how they can with the rising racism in football, whether in Italy, Spain or elsewhere, the electoral successes of the far right in France and Belgium, Italy and Denmark, plus the threatened breakthrough in 4 May local elections in Britain by our own version of Le Penâs , the British National Party.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of granting the European Centre on Racism and Xenophobia discharge.
It is clear from the report that the Centre was diligent in spending its existing resources.
However, with racist political parties on the rise and a reported increase in racist incidents there is a strong argument for increasing the Centre's funding.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of granting discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
However, with the flow of drugs apparently on the increase and the level of addiction rising particularly among some of Europeâs most deprived communities I would like to see the Centre raise its profile and make a more significant contribution to tackling these problems.
Â Â  . I voted to grant discharge to the European Medicines Agency.
I believe the agency has a vital role to play in ensuring that new drugs get to the market safely and with the minimum duplication of effort on the part of individual Member States.
Â Â  . Cape Verde has set an excellent example in terms of democracy, good governance and respect for human rights, and has deep historical, social, political, cultural and geographical ties with the EU.
This puts the country in a unique strategically important position for developing and deepening Euro-African relations.
Cape Verde provides stability and security on one of the outer edges of the European area.
Although it represents Europeâs Southeast Atlantic border, Cape Verde has been included in other programmes, which, in themselves, do not reflect the countryâs actual proximity, nor its identification with common values such as the rule of law, the promotion of good neighbourly relations and the principles of the market economy and sustainable development.
The Cape Verde authorities and the largest opposition party have been developing contacts with a view to obtaining special status or a partnership with the EU.
The countryâs inclusion in the neighbourhood policy could prove an important step in this direction.
It would also set down an important marker in a neighbourhood policy that would be impoverished if it were focused solely on the Unionâs southern and eastern borders.
I welcome the adoption of Amendments 36 and 38.
Â Â  . I voted to grant discharge to the European Food Safety Authority.
With food scares on the increase the Authority has a vital role to play in ensuring both the safety of our food and consumer confidence in the food chain.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have voted against the Parliamentâs reports on the budgetary discharge because, for the eleventh year running, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts.
Conservatives believe that this must be tackled as a matter of urgency by the Commission.
There must be a zero tolerance of all cases of mismanagement and fraud and there are three main areas to focus on:
First, the new accountancy systems put in place in January 2005 must be monitored closely to ensure that they will deliver world class standards of accounts.
Second, whistleblowers must not only have their rights vigorously defended, they must be encouraged to come forward.
Third, the issue that concerned the Auditors most was the 80% of the budget that is spent in Member States.
The Commission is responsible for the expenditure of all EU funds but, in reality, the power is delegated to paying agencies in Member States.
The objective, as the President of the Court has suggested, must be the introduction of the principle of making Member States responsible for this expenditure.
Â Â  . This report is indicative of the increasing domination of the financial sphere over that of the real economy.
The primary objective of the measures put forward to amend the legal structure of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), and the investments thereof, is to increase the cross-border trade in investment funds.
The intention is also to remove all obstacles, including tax obstacles, with the aim of maximising the profitability of these funds, including fund mergers.
In order to facilitate this trade and to increase competition, the plan is to harmonise the prospectuses and rules on consumer protection.
The report also seeks to expand the areas of investment into transferable securities, which will lead to greater risk for investors.
The proposal is to bring the financial markets and the investment funds model in the EU closer to that of the USA, which forms part of the drive towards financial globalisation.
It is no surprise to find that pension funds come top of the list of priorities.
This money-making scheme, which sucks the manufacturing economy dry and tramples over the rights acquired by many workers, maximises the profits of the banking industry and management companies, whilst increasing the risk of financial and economic crises.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  . The EPLP agrees with the general approach of the rapporteur to settle at a balance of regulatory and market needs.
The EPLP could not agree that the directive needs to be included as a âLamfalussyâ type of directive, which was the suggestion of Amendment 6.
Â Â  . The report before us forms part of the neoliberal agenda of the Lisbon Strategy.
It proposes that State aid be considered an exception and calls for more measures to deregulate, to ensure competition, to facilitate access to capital, to encourage entrepreneurial spirit, to remove barriers to the movement of both workers and researchers.
It also calls for a common immigration policy to suit these ends, not least in the area of recruitment in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector.
At the same time it encourages private-public partnerships and deems aid for SMEs ineffective.
All of which in the name of innovation!
On the other hand, it promotes a strategy of horizontal objectives for State aid defined at Community level, especially, once again in the name of so-called innovation.
The purpose of this process, which also forms part of the Bologna education process, is for universities and schools to meet the basic needs of the large multinationals, âeducatingâ a homogenous workforce with linguistic skills in ICT and in languages that facilitate the professional and geographical mobility and the adaptability of work, whilst at the same time commercialising knowledge and the fruits of research.
We therefore voted against.
Â Â  . I abstained on this report, because I believe the distinction implicitly made here between discovery and innovation both misunderstands the nature of scientific discovery and the economic consequences that follow.
If we are to compete in the world of high technology innovation and improve our post-innovative performance from its current lamentable levels compared to our competitors Europe must support innovation with public money where appropriate.
This report by Mrs in 't Veld does not accept that analysis limiting state aids, in my opinion, unreasonably.
I therefore could not support it.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Titley report is a positive step towards enhancing road safety.
The eCall system, which will help save human lives on Europeâs roads and reduce the severity of injuries, will have a very favourable cost-benefit ratio.
Our response to the growing volume of road traffic needs to be enhanced passive and active road safety.
As part of the world-renowned eSafety initiative, the eCall system is a priority item belonging to a programme covering, , advanced driver assistance systems, lane departure warning and the collision mitigation system.
The incorporation of the Galileo system is a further improvement to this state of the art technology which will benefit Europeâs transport.
The eCall system will serve the hundreds of millions of citizens who every year travel abroad by car.
Accordingly, I voted in favour of the report on making eCall available to citizens.
Â Â  . I have voted with enthusiasm in favour of this excellent initiative by my colleague Gary Titley.
It proposes a pan-European automatic emergency call system.
In the event of a road accident, the eCall device in the vehicle will automatically transmit an emergency call directly to the nearest emergency call centre, providing information on the precise location of the accident.
This will result in a dramatic reduction in rescue time and make it possible to treat more injuries in the crucial âgolden hourâ following the accident.
The advantage of this system is not only that it will help save lives but also that it will reduce congestion time and contribute to the efficiency of road transportation in Europe with a reduction of external costs.
It is an excellent example of the advantages of action at EU level, complementing the common emergency telephone number (112) which I was involved in suggesting when I was a junior civil servant many years ago.
Â Â  .I firmly support the recommendations in the Titley report aimed at rolling out âBringing eCall to citizensâ in the 25 Member States.
This arrangement is, in fact, a key element as far as improving road safety is concerned.
In the event of an accident, the response time â in terms both of making the accident scene safe and of helping the victims - is the most important requirement in terms of limiting the most tragic consequences.
There are more than 40Â 000 tragic deaths each year on the roads of the European Union.
This system, which would enable 2Â 500 lives to be saved each year, must quite clearly be promoted by the public authorities of all the countries and demanded by the citizens, who are increasingly calling for safer roads.
It is therefore regrettable that some Member States â such as France, in which road safety has nonetheless been declared an important national cause â should be late in implementing âBringing eCall to citizensâ.
Let us hope that the adoption of the Titley report and the publicity it will receive in the European Union will speed up the implementation by all of the Member States of this essential intelligent car system.
Â Â  It is important to give priority to road safety issues and to work to bring about a reduction in the number of fatalities on our roads.
There are thus good reasons for the Member States to consider introducing the in-vehicle emergency call service, eCall.
I do not, however, see any reason for the European Parliament and the other EU institutions to call on the Member States to sign the Memorandum of Understanding regarding eCall.
The Member States must adopt positions on this matter without political lectures from the EU institutions.
The introduction of eCall entails costs and technical harmonisation.
It must be up to the individual Member States to decide which road safety measures are most important and realistic and to be given priority.
I have thus chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . This report introduces a new system whereby, through the use of digital and satellite technology, emergency services are called directly âon impactâ to a car crash.
The new system should be installed in all new cars from 2009, saving up to 2Â 500 lives a year across Europe.
A sensor in the car is activated by the impact of a collision and sends information on the location, speed and owner of the car through the pan-European emergency number 112 to the nearest police, fire and medical services.
I welcome this report as it will save those hundreds of car crash victims who find themselves trapped in their cars and unable to reach their mobile phones because of their injuries.
Although the smart car system will cost EUR 4 billion it will ultimately save EUR 26 billion across Europe in accident and congestion costs.
According to the Commission, the smart car system could reduce the numbers of fatalities on the roads by as much as 15%.
Â Â  . I voted against the Mavromatis report (A6-0074/2006) on promoting multilingualism and language learning in the EU because in a Europe based on coexistence between communities, it is crucial that the citizens have the necessary skills to be able to communicate effectively with one another, thereby strengthening mobility in the EU.
It is wrong to confer privileged status on certain languages, without other factors being taken into account.
The creation of a âmultilingualâ society, in which every citizen has the opportunity to learn at least two languages other than their mother tongue will help to foster closer ties between citizens of different EU Member States.
It is also important, however, that this is not done at the cost of devaluing national languages.
Â Â  . We voted against because multilingualism is not considered in all of its practical applications.
Steps are being taken that may lead to the creation of a directory to select the languages used.
It is appalling that the proposals to broaden the range of languages, including those of immigrants, were rejected.
To quote the Commission: âthe EU institutions should try to strike a balance between the costs and benefits of being multilingualâ.
This sentence follows a series of repeated examples of discrimination relating to the use, translation and interpretation of the official languages of the EU, and to the dismissal of dozens of teachers who worked in the Commissionâs services.
This serves to increase our concerns as regards the need to promote multilingualism as a cultural value of the EU.
We therefore advocate an interinstitutional agreement relating to a written legal framework for the EUâs language arrangements.
An agreement of this nature should respect the diversity of cultures and languages, given that language is the most direct expression of culture.
It should also guarantee equal treatment of all official languages, thereby putting an end to the proposed distinction between âofficial languagesâ and âworking languagesâ, which has served to discriminate against certain languages like Portuguese.
Â Â  The June List has previously pointed out in this Parliament â and now does so again â that the Member States are exclusively responsible for the organisation of teaching and the content of education systems.
In both resolutions now being dealt with, the European Parliament is shamelessly trying to get involved in language teaching and the adjustment of education systems to, for example, new technology and digitalisation.
I am therefore voting against both resolutions.
I nonetheless appreciate that the Member States may need to discuss among themselves a number of issues such as, for example, the consequences of the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting.
In its proposals, however, the European Parliament is, as usual, going too far in its ambition to develop policy areas at EU level within every possible subject area.
I believe that the Council of Ministers is the best place in which to find out how far there is a need to go in terms of cooperation in the aforesaid area.
Â Â  .Responding to the linguistic standardisation of Europe, whereby English is the popular phonetic soup, with a form of multilingualism that the European Union would do well to practice itself, is all well and good.
The French, who listen to MrÂ Trichet speaking in the European Parliament in English, and the Germans who, despite representing 30% of the people of the Union, see their language's share of the European language market reduced to 14%, can only approve of the sanctioning of multilingualism.
It is not Europeâs job to help destroy linguistic biodiversity.
From that perspective, the Catalans make some sensible observations.
The Catalan language which, with more than 15Â million speakers, is used more widely that Finnish, Danish, Latvian or even Dutch, cannot be overlooked in the European Parliament.
The Catalan, Occitan or Breton languages represent the rootlets of France's cultural tree.
The same could be said of the tree representing Spainâs identity.
Faced with the winds of Anglo-Saxon globalisation, these national trees need all of their deep cultural roots in order to remain standing.
It is true that, if it were not for the fact that multilingualism is a necessity, in a few years time, we, the French MEPs in the European Parliament, would be calling for the right of our minority to speak our regional language.
Â Â  . The Mavromatis report addresses one of the key factors in the success of the teaching and training of EU citizens, namely language skills.
The Europe of the future needs citizens who are ready to respond to the challenges of the knowledge-based society.
Accordingly, it is vitally important that they can communicate in at least two languages other than their mother tongue.
I therefore believe that it is necessary to adopt an Indicator of Language Competence in order to bridge the current gap in verifiable data about the EU citizensâ language skills.
It is unacceptable, however, that certain languages are favoured to the detriment of others, not least Portuguese, which is spoken by 200Â million people and is the EUâs third most widely-spoken language in the world.
Quite apart from this language indicator, there is an alarming political indicator emerging from the report before us, namely that of a Europe that focuses more on itself than on the world around it, and of a Europe that values its languages on the basis of internal demographics, which may work out very well for some, but which is politically unacceptable in terms of the founding principles of the EU.
For these reasons, I voted against the Mavromatis report.
Â Â  . The enlargement of language knowledge brings an added value to individuals, and represents a vital tool for mutual understanding between countries, communities and cultures.
In other words, it is crucial for a Europe seeking unity in diversity.
The lack of data on the citizensâ language skills means that there needs to be a system whereby progress towards attaining the objective laid down by the Barcelona European Council of developing the EUâs education and training systems into a world-renowned centre of excellence can be measured.
The European Indicator of Linguistic Competence could prove a valuable instrument for obtaining reliable data on the language skills of Europeans, facilitating exchange of good practice and giving fresh impetus to language teaching.
I feel it is essential that European language policy should not reflect an idea of an insular Europe.
In this regard, I would like to reiterate the need to bring into this debate the concept of a European language of universal communication.
English, Spanish, Portuguese and French, in that order, along with, to some extent, German and Italian, are special vehicles of communication with the rest of the world and as such deserve preferential support and encouragement from the EU.
Â Â  â I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 27 April 2006.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I regret that I have some sad news to communicate to you: the passing of our fellow Member, Professor Rolandas Pavilionis
Mr Pavilionis was a fervent defender of human rights, he fought actively for Lithuaniaâs independence and then for his countryâs accession to the Union, before being elected a Member of the European Parliament.
Before that accession, Professor Pavilionis had taken part in the work of the Convention on the future of Europe.
He was highly active in the fields of education, science and culture and I would like to stress his position as rector of the University of Vilnius.
We shall all remember him for his work in our Parliament, as a member of the Committee on Culture and Education.
He was vice-chairman of his Group, the Union for Europe of the Nations, in which he was greatly valued by his fellow Members for his intellectual qualities.
I would also like to inform you that tomorrow there will be a book of condolence in front of the Chamber, which will be open for all Members and anybody who wants to record a final remembrance to sign.
I would now ask that we observe a minuteâs silence in his memory.
Â Â  Mr Hans-Peter Martin has the floor for a point of order.
Would you please kindly tell me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure your point of order relates to.
Â Â  â Mr President, I refer to Rules 132 and 142 of the Rules of Procedure.
This European Parliament, here in Strasbourg, reeks of corruption.
I ask you to do something about it, to defend the dignity of this House of ours, to allocate speaking times in such a way that âŠ
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 11 May 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendments have been proposed.
Pursuant to Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, the Confederal Group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left has requested the referral back to committee of the report by MrÂ Speroni on the request for waiver of the immunity of Tobias PflÃŒge, the vote on which is scheduled for tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, my group, on the basis of Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, wishes to move that the Speroni report â which has to do with the lifting of the immunity of MrÂ PflÃŒger, a member of our group â should not be discussed, but should instead be sent back to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I see this as being the appropriate decision to take, since the fact that the decision as to whether or not to lift immunity was taken by a mere eight members of the Committee on Legal Affairs shows us in a poor light, and that is something we should avoid.
Any one of us could end up having our immunity suspended, but it is intolerable that less than a third of the Members who actually work in the relevant committee should actually be present to vote on it, and so I ask that we should send the report back to the Committee rather than having a vote on it.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will start by asking you to reject this motion as inadmissible.
The immunity procedure is subject to Rule 7, which has the last word to say on the subject.
Rule 7 (8) states that: âThe report of the committee shall be placed at the head of the agenda of the first sitting following the day on which it was tabled.â
The Rule goes on to say that: âThe proposal(s) for a decision contained in the report shall be put to the vote at the first voting time following the debate.â
That is a binding rule, the purpose of which is to speed up the immunity procedure, and if this motion were to be permitted, it would be virtually capable of annulling it.
If you do not reject this motion as inadmissible, I would nevertheless ask that it be thrown out altogether on the grounds of irrelevance.
The reason why it is irrelevant is that the resolution we, in the Committee on Legal Affairs, adopted was adopted unanimously, that this resolution is not a matter of dispute between the groups, and also that there is no doubt about the procedure that Rule 7 (8) lays down to deal with it.
If you object to the substance of this motion, then all you have to do is to vote against it.
If it then gets majority support, the result is automatically reversed.
It therefore makes no sense that this matter be either adjourned or deferred, and so I ask that this motion for a resolution be voted on in the plenary tomorrow.
Â Â  â Mr President, like many other Members, I have had to consider this issue in the Conference of Presidents, but, not being a lawyer like MrÂ Lehne, I had imagined it would be rather more straightforward.
Now, though, the lawyers have spoken, and I have to concede that I did not understand what MrÂ Lehne said, but perhaps that is my fault.
I do not, right now, want to weigh up the pros and cons of MrsÂ Kaufmannâs and MrÂ Lehneâs arguments, but I do have a request to make; it is that we should stipulate that immunity matters no longer be dealt with by the Committee of Presidents, since I, as a group chairman, do not feel equal to dealing with such a complex process.
My sense of justice has led me to agree to this matter being referred back, since if, in a committee, only eight people vote and certain groups are not represented at all, I think it would be fairer and better to avoid a formal error and send the matter back.
If, though, sending it back results in one being committed, then that is something we will have to live with.
Having been shown where I was wrong, I think we should do as MrÂ Lehne suggests, but I would, at the same time, ask that immunity cases be in future considered only in the plenary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, this is wrong: you give the floor to someone who was supposed to speak in favour of the proposal, and here he is speaking against it.
That is wrong.
A decision must be made.
The Rules of Procedure are clear; they make provision for one speaker in favour and one speaker against.
I, for my part, wanted to come out in favour, and I am going to do so.
I find that, ifÂ âŠ
Â Â  MrÂ Cohn-Bendit, I am taking the microphone from you because I did not ask you to take the floor.
Please sit down and wait.
I gave MrÂ Schulz the floor in order to speak in favour.
MrÂ Schulz has not in fact used it for that purpose.
I therefore believe that we should start the speeches again and ask whether anybody wants to speak in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a group submitted this request to amend the agenda armed with a very clear supporting argument.
Given that there were not enough Members present at the committee responsible - which implies that what MrÂ Lehne said, namely that all the groups are in agreement, cannot be true, since those who were not there were unable to say whether or not they agreed - it now falls to the plenary to decide to refer the matter back to the committee so that, in a month's time or even at the mini-session, if that were possible, we might vote on this subject.
Therefore, it is only a question of postponing the vote by two weeks.
MrÂ Lehne, you have already spoken.
This is the way things work in a Parliament: the person who speaks last is often right.
I therefore call on Parliament to support the proposal made by MrsÂ Kauffmann.
Â Â  â Mr President, questions of immunity ought to be dealt with either by the immunity committee or by the whole House.
I would like to ask, again, that immunity matters no longer be brought before the Committee of Presidents, since I do not see that as a place in which I am in a position to rule on them.
I said nothing more than that, nor did I wish to do so.
I will, in any case, as the Chairman of a group, no longer take part in such debates in the Conference of Presidents.
Â Â  We have taken note of your concern, MrÂ Schulz.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the vote on the report by Reinhard Rack (A6-0408/2005) on improving the environmental performance of the freight transport system (âMarco Polo IIâ) be moved to Wednesday.
The Council has informed me â and I am passing this information on to you â that it will not be able to stay here beyond 7.00 p.m.
This has been discussed in the Conference of Presidents and the Council has confirmed that it cannot stay here beyond 7.00 p.m.
Questions to the Council will therefore only last one hour.
Â Â  â Mr President, while I cannot at the moment name the rule, I refer to what you have just said about the Council.
I would like to say in this plenary what I said in the Conference of Presidents about the Councilâs announcement of its inability to be present.
I do not regard a statement of that sort on the part of the Council as one that this House should accept.
As I understand it, the Austrian Government is composed of 16 members and has 16 secretaries of state, which adds up to 32 people who ought to be in a position to represent the Council, even after seven in the evening.
I think it is quite improper that a Council Presidency should declare itself unable to be present here after 7Â p.m with no better reason than that Parliament's calendar has changed.
I would like to know just what would happen in a national parliament if an executive were to tell it that it was knocking off for the evening at seven.
That is not acceptable, and you should tell the Council so.
Â Â  Mr President, following what you have just announced, I must draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is an oral question to the Council on Wednesday nightâs agenda regarding the Energy Community Treaty, which we are due to debate that night.
If the Council cannot be there, I suggest we withdraw that item and the discussion of assent to the Treaty from the agenda until the Council can be present.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House have a monitoring role, and so, just as we, as matter of course, expect the Commission to be present, so we also expect the Council to be here.
I am not talking here about the presidency, but about the Council as such.
In particular, I ask the General Secretariat of the Council, to advise the Council in such a way that its presence is assured, and it follows that we endorse what MrÂ Schulz had to say, as he was quite right to do.
Â Â  â Mr President, being an Austrian myself, I would like to make a suggestion of a pragmatic nature.
This is obviously about the Council wanting, come what may, to catch the eight oâclock flight back to Austria.
Perhaps, Mr President, you would inform the Council that there is also a train that runs between Strasbourg and Vienna, which makes it no problem at all to actively participate in the sitting here and be in good time for the Parliament in Vienna the following morning.
All that needs to be done is to fly a bit less and perhaps do without a few luxuries.
Â Â  I shall communicate all of the comments made here to the Council.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that a third debate be added on cases of violations of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, specifically on Taiwan.
Â Â  Mr President, first I should like to add the support of my group for the statements made by Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering in favour of the Austrian Presidency looking again at its availability.
The Conference of Presidents last week agreed on only two subjects for debate in our regular âurgenciesâ slot on Thursday; normally we debate three.
My group put forward a proposal to the Conference of Presidents that we debate the issue of Taiwanâs membership of the World Health Organisation.
That proposal fell because it was not supported by either of the two major groups â the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group.
Health is widely considered these days to be a human right.
It is an issue that needs our discussion and therefore my group wishes to propose to this House that we use the third slot available on Thursday afternoon for consideration of the issue of Taiwanâs participation in the World Health Organisation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my fellow Member, MrÂ Watson, is a very intelligent and very astute person.
I do not believe that he can look us in the eye and seriously say to us that we are talking about a human rights issue here.
We are talking about something altogether different, as everyone knows; we are also talking about something that runs counter to the position held by the international community.
I therefore believe that we should not support this proposal.
Â Â  â Mr President, I think it is a splendid idea on MrÂ Watsonâs part to put this matter on the order of business.
It is a disgrace that Taiwan, the only Chinese state with a democratic system, is not allowed even observer status at the World Health Organisation.
This House would be very well advised to discuss this issue and make it known to the whole world that we believe health to be a human right and that no country in the world should be barred from the deliberations of the World Health Organisation.

Â Â  Mr President of the Republic of Bolivia, I would like to welcome you to the plenary of the European Parliament at a time when Europeâs relations with Latin America and the Caribbean are highly topical and are being debated between us.
Just three days ago, the leaders of our two continents held their fourth Summit in Vienna, in which you played an important role.
It is a pleasure for the European Parliament to receive you as President-elect of Bolivia, the first President of indigenous ethnicity, of the Aymara, whose three fundamental principles are contained in their three wise sayings, : do not steal, : do not be weak, : do not lie.
The President of Bolivia was born in a poor and out-of-the-way town in Bolivia, in Isavalli, in the canton of Orinoca, very close to lake PoopÃ³, in Oruro. These names sound remote to us because they do not fall within our normal geographical references.
From childhood he was a farm worker, he looked after his familyâs herd of llama, he worked as a brickmaker, a bricklayer, a baker and a trumpet player.
Then, when the Bolivian high plateau suffered one of the most serious droughts in its history, his family emigrated to new pastures, to Cochabamba.
There he embarked upon a trade union and political career that has led him to the Presidency of his country, the second poorest country in Latin America, after Haiti, but which has the second largest gas reserves in the whole of Latin America; a country in which two-thirds of the population live in poverty, and which, throughout its history, since it achieved its independence, has had difficult relations with its neighbours, a country which today is seeing the emergence of new political forces, such as that of the President, who has won the elections with 53% of the vote and who, as you know, is proposing political measures relating to the nationalisation of the energy industry and investments made there by many European companies, something which we undoubtedly have an interest in debating.
I would therefore like to thank you for coming here, Mr President, and not just for speaking to plenary, but also for agreeing to take part in a debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the dinner that will follow it.
Please believe me, Mr President, that we very much appreciate your visit, because it was clearly acknowledged in Vienna by many Latin American Heads of State that the return to democracy in the region has unfortunately not led to any improvement in the living conditions of a large proportion of the Latin American population.
Europe and Latin America are determined to try to build a cohesive society and Bolivia is a clear example of the essential need to include a very significant proportion of its population in human development, since they have not benefited from the natural wealth of their country.
We will also have the opportunity to discuss this within the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly, the creation of which was decided upon at the Vienna Summit.
I hope that it will provide us with new opportunities for political dialogue.
Mr President, your visit today is both symbolic and multi-faceted, because it reflects the European Parliamentâs commitment to enhancing relations with Latin America, it reflects the importance of parliamentary diplomacy and it reflects the role that dialogue must play in resolving any conflicts that may arise amongst us.
Thank you once again, Mr President. You have the floor.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, through the Members of this Parliament, I would like to send a special, warm and brotherly greeting to all of the people of Europe.
I am extremely pleased and happy to have been invited to take part in this hugely significant meeting of two continents: America and Europe.
I am honoured, pleased and proud to be here with you and I have come accepting an invitation not just to speak to you, but also to listen to you.
We original indigenous farming peoples of America, and of Bolivia in particular, belong to a culture of dialogue, a culture of life, a culture of balance, justice and equality.
As the President of the European Parliament said, I come from a very humble family, from the Aymara nation.
Historically we have been excluded, but we do not exclude anybody.
Historically we have been enslaved, but we have never enslaved anybody elseâs family; we are inclusive, we fight for unity while respecting the diversity of other peoples and when, thanks to the conscience of my people, we won the Presidency as indigenous people, it was not through a sense of revenge, but through our peoplesâ sense of hope.
The absence of the State in our indigenous farming communities has left much to be desired and we therefore want to resolve the social problems, the cultural problems, the economic problems and the structural problems of my country.
With regard to health, there are farming communities with no resources for resolving health problems; traditional medicine is not recognised and there is no policy for recovering it.
We recognise that some progress has been made through the participation of UNESCO.
The issue of education has been abandoned.
You may be interested to know that my mother â may she rest in peace âwas illiterate and my father could hardly write; he was also illiterate.
My parents had no documentation.
During our short time in government, therefore, during the almost 110 days of the Presidency, we have begun to work on literacy, thanks to unconditional cooperation from certain Latin American, European and Asian countries.
At the end of this month nearly 2Â 000 people will have completed their literacy studies.
We want to eradicate illiteracy in my country.
With regard to the issue of documentation, we are making progress, also thanks to solidarity from other countries.
So far we are told that almost 50Â 000 people have been provided with documents free of charge (indigenous farming families; particularly women) thanks to international cooperation.
And in terms of documentation, there are families that have been entirely abandoned; they have no documents and they therefore do not have certain rights as citizens.
This is an issue of great concern in my country.
I know that here in Europe and in certain continents, manâs best friend, the dog, has a passport in order to be able to travel from one country to another.
Back in my country some of us do not have any documentation at all â no identity cards and no birth certificates â to enable us to take part in elections.
We are therefore going to continue with our campaign for identification: in less than two months we have provided almost 50Â 000 new documents free of charge and we are going to go on to provide one or two million people with documents free of charge.
Also thanks to cooperation from certain Latin American countries, we are carrying out campaigns to help the poorest families with regard to health.
By means of eye operations, in less than two months we have cured 8Â 000 people free of charge.
These are some of the social problems that we are facing in my country.
This political movement, therefore, the Movement for Socialism, originally called the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples, created by the Original Indigenous Farmers Movement, it has not been created by a group of political experts, or professionals or intellectuals, but it was born to fight injustice, to fight for economic and social demands, in 1995 in particular, to change our Bolivia, to put an end to discrimination, and in order to change those policies that have historically been geared towards the extermination of the original indigenous people in our country and our continent.
We indigenous peoples are also human beings, we have the same rights, the same duties and we want to change.
And I am happy to say that this political movement has brought me to the Presidency.
I would like you to know that I did not unfortunately have the opportunity to study at university; the greatest asset that I and our movement have is honesty.
I felt great respect and admiration for the President when he mentioned our ancestorsâ cosmic law, the , which is the law of the original indigenous peoples: not to steal, not to be weak, not to lie.
That principle of a cosmic law has brought us this far and it is my duty to apply our ancestorsâ rule in order to change our history.
I am sure that you have questions about many structural issues, many social issues.
So far we have clearly decided to recover our natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable resources; natural resources that make it possible to resolve the social and economic problems of my country.
I would like to mention the fight to defend the coca leaf, the fight for water, to prevent any privatisation of water resources, and the fight for hydrocarbons, which were also the fights of our ancestors, of indigenous leaders such as Tupac Amaru, Tupac Katari and Bartolina Sisa: it was the fight for territory.
Bolivia has so much wealth, and yet so much poverty.
We are not talking about distributing poverty, but rather about redistributing wealth and, in order to redistribute wealth, we have the obligation to recover it, through nationalisation.
It is true that oil and natural resources were nationalised twice during the last millennium.
And now, in this new millennium, my government and the Bolivian people must nationalise again, together with many social sectors, from both the countryside and from the city.
I want you to understand that nothing will be expropriated and nobody will be expelled.
I would like to be very frank and speak to you with the greatest of respect.
Our families come to Europe because of a need, because of a lack of work, and many are being expelled.
Historically, my country, my region, and indeed the whole of America, which used to be called Abya Ayala, has never expelled anybody.
And with this nationalisation we are not going to expel anybody either.
I understand perfectly well that they must recover their investment and they have the right to profits, but they cannot be owners of the hydrocarbons, and nor can they control them.
The Bolivian State will be in control at the wellheads and inspection centres.
Any company that has invested in the country has every right to recover their investment and has the right to make profits, but not to control, and they will therefore be partners and not owners of our natural resources.
I very much regret that certain sections of the media wish to bring us into conflict with regions, with continents, with countries, with companies.
We belong to a culture of solidarity, a culture of reciprocity and it is therefore important to seek solutions jointly.
It is true that we need cooperation in this process of change in Bolivia, but I am also bringing you proposals to invite you to resolve the problems together, whether they be Americaâs or Europeâs problems.
I understand that immigration is a problem for the Europeans.
As a result of a lack of work, many people are abandoning America and Bolivia and coming to Europe.
The only way to resolve this problem is to create sources of work in Bolivia, to guarantee markets for small-scale producers, for micro-businesspeople, for cooperatives, for associations, for communal companies.
That will surely put an end to the mass invasion of this continent by Bolivians.
The industrialisation of natural resources is important.
You know that historically we have been subjected to the constant plundering of our natural resources.
And while at certain times the State has controlled the natural resources, whether oil or minerals, it has not been able to carry out industrialisation, to give added value to these natural resources.
Following nationalisation, our task will be to industrialise, together with our partners, whether they be States or companies.
There will be no exclusion or marginalisation.
We are convinced that the industrialisation of our natural resources will put an end to the mass abandonment of my country towards other countries.
Before it was the United States or Argentina, but now I very much regret that many of our brothers and sisters are coming to Europe to seek sources of work.
There is a central issue that is a problem for you and also a problem for us: cocaine and drug-trafficking.
I would like to tell you that we original indigenous people do not have a culture of cocaine. We do not have a culture of drug-trafficking.
Cocaine is a new problem that has unfortunately been imported.
There must be a real and effective fight against drug-trafficking. The fight against drug-trafficking cannot be an instrument for domination, for recolonisation or submission.
I regret that certain countries in America use the issue of drug-trafficking as an instrument for submission and subordination.
I believe that we all have a responsibility to combat drug-trafficking effectively and genuinely.
I would also like to say that coca is not cocaine.
I have looked closely at the history of coca in Europe.
European countries were the first to industrialise the coca leaf. We are talking about the 19th century.
Only recently have Latin America and the United States begun to industrialise it.
And the coca leaf cannot be legal for Coca-Cola, but illegal for the Andean region, for the indigenous peoples.
I believe that it is important to revalue the coca leaf, but I would like to say that, while during my government there will never be free cultivation of coca, there will never be zero coca either.
I am pleased to say that we are discussing with our brother producers of coca leaf how we can rationalise its production, and I would like to reassure you that we are talking about a small area of coca growing per family: 40 metres by 40 metres.
We are perfectly well aware that a proportion of the coca leaf is diverted towards an illegal market and we do not find that acceptable.
Policies of eradication with financial compensation and then eradication by military force have left much to be desired in terms of human rights and the only way to put an end to that confrontation is for coca production to be controlled by the farmersâ movement itself, to be rationalised and in that way to make the fight against drug-trafficking effective.
The production of that small quota, of 40Â xÂ 40 metres â many people looking into this must have read about the so-called âcatoâ; the cato is not a question of hectares, it is 40Â xÂ 40 metresâ must be controlled and its production used for legal consumption: what could be better than to industrialise for purposes that benefit Humanity.
The fight against drug-trafficking cannot end with that control, however, but it is also important to control the forerunners, the chemical agents.
And what better way is there than, together with you, to control banking secrecy.
Because the real drug-trafficker is not the person who is currently in prison in Bolivia, but â we have investigated this over a short space of time â the person who is handling thousands of millions of dollars.
They are not walking around or travelling on buses or lorries carrying piles of dollars.
They use private banks.
What could be better than to control private banking, the banks, including State banks, in order to put an end to this aspect of the drug-trafficking business.
I would like to take this opportunity, through you, to tell all of the nations of Europe of my respect and admiration for the European Union.
We in Bolivia also very much want the Andeans, the Latin Americans, the South Americans, to unite.
That will be our responsibility.
In this process it will surely require dialogue and patience in order to bring our countries together.
I say this because we in Bolivia have decided to remodel Bolivia, to put an end to economic models that have not resolved the social problems, in order to change that colonial State.
With the greatest of respect, I would also like to say that what we have at the moment is a colonial State.
But we are not proposing an armed fight or change.
I very much regret the fact that there are armed conflicts in certain countries neighbouring Bolivia.
Thanks to this political movement, which has emerged from the historically most scorned and hated sector, the sector that has suffered most discrimination: the original indigenous people.
Why am I talking about the original indigenous people?
The last census in 2001 showed that 62.2% of the country was made up of indigenous people.
I would say that we original indigenous people make up more than 70% or almost 80%.
Because, when Bolivia was founded in 1825, 90% of the population was made up of indigenous peoples but just 10% founded Bolivia.
Nevertheless, that 90% took part in the fight for independence and now, democratically and peacefully, by remodelling Bolivia, we want to change and we want to carry out a democratic, cultural and peaceful revolution, preventing any confrontation.
I believe that that will lead to a genuine change, which makes it possible to live in peace with social justice.
I perfectly understand the countries and many businesspeople who want legal security.
We are all fighting for legal security, but to that end it is important that we have social security, that we have health, education, housing, employment.
That will happen when we recover our natural resources and when they benefit the whole of the Bolivian population.
That is the transformation we want to see in the economic and political spheres.
I am extremely happy with the support we are receiving from the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
On the occasion of this Summit of Heads of State, of Presidents of Europe, of Latin America and of the Caribbean, I have been invited to a short meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who has promised me his full support for the constitutional assembly, both in terms of advice and in economic terms, in order to guarantee the in-depth democratic transformation of my country.
I would like you, with your great experience, to be involved in this profound change.
I am convinced that Europe is the symbol of democracy, and that it defends democracy and human rights.
And on the subject of human rights, I would like in particular to ask you to help us defend them in Bolivia.
And defending human rights in Bolivia means creating sources of work, health and education, and recovering our natural resources.
I would like to say to you, with the greatest of respect, that there were certain governments in the past, during the dictatorships, that massacred the people.
You are perfectly aware of Boliviaâs history.
But democratic governments too, in order to defend interests other than Boliviaâs interests, massacred Bolivia and some of them escaped to the United States.
Through the Bolivian judicial system, we have called for the extradition of those people who humiliated Bolivia and I would like to ask for your support in order to ensure that those people who have done so much to harm the human and economic rights of the Bolivian people are brought before Bolivian justice, including Gonzalo SÃ¡nchez de Lozada and SÃ¡nchez BerzaÃ­n, who killed many people in my country and we want them to face the Bolivian judicial system.
In this process of change, we are not just seeking political interaction, and understanding amongst countries, but also integration, by providing my country with a road structure.
Bolivia, the heart of South America, has no access to the sea as a result of an historical injustice.
My government can resolve this road structure problem with all of our neighbouring countries.
We only have a section with Peru, but we do not have a hard road with Chile, or with Argentina via PotosÃ­, or via Tarija, or via Brazil.
I have great affection and respect for my friend the President of Brazil.
It is not true that there is conflict between us, as some sections of the media would have you believe.
We have a strategic alliance with the government of Brazil.
I see Lula, a former trade union leader, as an older brother who gives me real guidance.
I would also like some guidance from you here in Europe.
I told you a moment ago that we are not exclusive, but rather inclusive.
I want to learn from you, but essentially I want to learn how to seek solutions within a context of balance, justice and equality.
That is my great wish and that is what we are fighting for.
We in our government, a popular and indigenous government, now have the opportunity, with the support of many intellectual sectors and even business sectors in Bolivia â the middle class.
My experience to date has been of certain of my fellow citizens saying two things to me: âI am not indigenous, but now I am an indigenistâ.
They say: âthe governments used to make us cry with depression, now our governments make us cry with emotion, with dignity, a sense of sovereignty, respect amongst us and above all a sense that we are recovering our natural resourcesâ.
I would therefore like to say to you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, that, through you, I would like to maintain a strategic alliance in favour of life, in favour of humanity.
The way of life of the indigenous people does not involve exclusion or marginalisation, but rather â I would insist â it is solidarity, reciprocity, and not just amongst human beings, but it is also harmony with mother earth.
We are extremely worried that the western model of industrialisation is affecting planet Earth, the mother earth: the .
If we do not revise this form of industrialisation, surely within a short space of time, not just you, or us, but everybody, is going to have a problem of life.
I believe that it is important to take up initiatives and proposals that come from the people in order to defend and save Humanity, and that will be done essentially by respecting the mother earth, living in harmony with her.
These are important contributions that we can make, on the basis of our way of life.
Based on our native organisations, whether they be unions, communities, councils of the elderly, those authorities that hold continuous debates and propose solutions.
I have learnt that it is not a question of imposing programmes or policies, but of taking up these proposals and programmes for the good of humanity.
It is also the case that, in this process of change, how to participate in Bolivia is an important issue, and does not mean either subordination or submission â some have described us as âpuppetsâ â but rather we must share our principles and our experiences, in a horizontal fashion.
We hope that this brief visit to the European Parliament can serve a purpose.
We no longer want to be a beggar State.
Bolivian Governments have generally looked outside of the country to seek aid, they begged for the countryâs General Budget.
We want to put an end to that.
I am sure that by increasing export volumes and by improving prices â a rational price, not blackmailing or imposing prices â and by recovering our natural resources, we will put an end to that beggar State.
I very much regret that we have a beggar State and together with you, by reviewing our history, we would like now in this new millennium to resolve those social and cultural problems.
On behalf of the Bolivian people, particularly on behalf of the original indigenous movement, I would like to say that we want strategic allies in our defence of life.
We want to put an end to that hate, that racism, that contempt.
We are from an inclusive culture, not an exclusive one, despite the fact that we have been subjected to exclusion, and when I heard that the European Parliament had invited me here, I genuinely felt very happy and very proud to come.
I want you too to feel proud of the original indigenous peoples, who defend life.
It is an honour for me, and a new experience, although we are always nervous at the outset â forgive me â but I would like to say, from the heart and with the greatest of respect, that I would like your support in our work of saving the life and improving the social and cultural situation of my country.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  Mr President of the Republic of Bolivia, thank you very much for your words, spoken from the heart, and which the Members of this Parliament have applauded in the manner you have just witnessed.
Mr President, you are the democratically elected representative of your people, you have presented an electoral programme that your citizens have supported and you are inspired by the best of intentions to achieve prosperity for all of them.
I hope that Bolivia and Europe can maintain a relationship of cooperation which will enable us to contribute to building a shared future of progress, on the basis of respect for the rule of law.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance.
Â Â  Mr President, with countries that have energy sources â such as Russia, Bolivia, etc. â aiming to get consumer societies to agree to their requests or obey their dictates, we are facing a new stage in present-day tensions.
If Europe wants to preserve energy and political independence from Russia, and not fall for deceptive words such as interdependence, the EU must plan the diversification of alternative sources rapidly and defend its various alternatives.
Europe to be transferred into a department of an energy heartland â that is the Kremlinâs dream.
Do we agree with that?
An even sweeter dream would be a new union replacing the old European one.
The gas union of Russia and Europe is to be built around the Moscow-Berlin core axis.
Such a vision was presented only slightly covertly in the Russian Presidentâs recent state-of-the-nation address.
Do we agree with this?
Â Â  Mr President, a few days ago, this Parliamentâs Bureau rejected the use of Catalan and the other co-official languages of the Spanish State between the citizens and this institution, which should be the institution closest to and most representative of their interests.
The Spanish Governmentâs proposal is already a reality in other European institutions: in the Council of Ministers, in the Commission and in the Committee of the Regions, where it already operates quite normally.
The proposal implies no cost for Parliament and it is clearly not at the expense of the implementation of the other official languages of the new member countries.
In fact, this initiative would help to bring the citizens closer to the European institutions.
The General Union of Workers, one of Spainâs largest unions, has therefore embarked upon a campaign calling for support for this initiative, because it believes that it would promote social cohesion.
As a defender of cultural diversity, the European Parliament cannot and must not be the only institution not to implement this right of more than twelve million citizens.
Incidentally, did you know that Catalan is the fourth most widely used language in the forum for debate that the Commission has put in place on the future of Europe?
I would ask you please to look once again at this request in the Bureau, because it would help to bring the citizens closer to Europe and to all of their fellow citizens.
Â Â  I am pleased that the European Union is making the right moves in the battle with Lukashenko's dictatorship, because we, as Europeans, must not support this dictatorship at the heart of the continent.
However, I have here a list of European Union cities from various states and regions, which have cooperative, brotherly ties with various Belarusian cities and regions.
And as we know, in Belarusian cities there are loyal servants of Lukashenko's regime and they are the people who are supporting the dictatorship.
Therefore we, Members of the European Parliament, must urge European Union city leaders to suspend official relations with the servants of Lukashenko's regime.
There is no doubt that our European cities must maintain ties with Belarusian cities in the areas of culture, sports and education.
However, our city leaders, city leaders of the European Union states, must not legitimise or recognise Lukashenko's dictatorship by maintaining relations with the official servants of the regime.
I believe that we must make some sort of decision or position on this matter.
Â Â  â Mr President, political detainees in Russia are in a very bad position.
The case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky is a concrete example of how various means are used to break them down both mentally and physically.
Whilst Platon Lebedev received inadequate treatment for his serious illness north of the Arctic Circle, Khodorkovsky was attacked in his cell by night.
No precise evidence is available as to what happened.
That such a thing should occur is incomprehensible in view of the fact that the prisoners are under permanent observation.
This occurrence confirms the dire conditions in Russian prisons.
Russiaâs holding the presidency of the Council of Europe offers an opportunity to approach it and call upon its government to agree to Khodorkovsky and Lebedev receiving the independent medical examination that has hitherto been denied them.
I call on the Council to bring influence to bear on Russia in order that the human rights of those it holds in prisons may be secured.
Mr President, a version of the envisaged North of Ireland Assembly has reconvened today in Belfast.
The Assembly and its power-sharing executive have been suspended by the British Government since 2002.
Sinn FÃ©in is committed to seeing local ministers make local decisions.
At present, British ministers make all policy decisions in the North of Ireland, yet are not accountable to voters there.
It is time for Ian Paisleyâs Democratic Unionist Party to move forward with the rest of us, on the basis of equality, to fully restore the North of Ireland Assembly and the power-sharing executive.
The recent sectarian killing of Catholic teenager Michael McIlveen shows that much change is still needed in our society.
Continued assistance and support at European level are also needed.
Â Â  â Mr President, the month of May this year marked the 61st anniversary of the end of Hitler's barbarity against Europeans and Jews.
However, it has been 87 years since the barbaric genocide of Turkish Greeks by Kemal Ataturk.
On 19 May 1919, he entered the city and slaughtered 490Â 000 people.
The Black Sea turned red.
Observers at the time said that there were squares piled with the heads of innocent people.
The only difference is that post-Hitler Germany said sorry.
Turkey has never said sorry, either for the genocide of the Turkish Greeks or for the genocide of the Armenians.
On the contrary, the other day it coerced the French parliament into withdrawing the Armenian genocide bill and three days ago in Vienna MrÂ Erdogan embarrassed the Greek prime minister because we want to acknowledge the genocide of the Turkish Greeks.
People do not forget history, they relive it.
I therefore want the European Parliament to take an initiative to recognise the memory of the genocide of the Turkish Greeks.
Â Â  ( Mr President, last Wednesday we received the sad news of the death of our colleague Rolandas Pavilionis.
We recently worked together in the Committee on Culture and Education.
His position was that of member and coordinator for the Union for Europe of the Nations Group.
We will all remember his commitment and his dedication to cultural matters, as well as the openness and kindness he showed to his colleagues.
His passing away is a great loss.
On behalf of my colleagues from the UEN Group, and also on behalf of all Polish MEPs, I would like to offer my condolences to his family.
Â Â  Mr President, last week was the 61st anniversary of the end of the Second World War.
It was the most tragic war in human history and it deserves to be commemorated.
We need to build a future together in Europe, but in order to lay the foundations for that future we must pay tribute to those who died and learn the painful lesson of history.
I say this as a Pole, aware that the Second World War claimed 6 million of my fellow citizens, both Poles and Jews.
We should remember them with the greatest reverence, just as we should remember the many other victims of that historical catastrophe.
We live in a Europe full of difficult challenges, a Europe of peace.
This peaceful Europe is our joint achievement but it is, therefore, all the more important to remember those who did not taste happiness and peace.
Their memory should be what unites us all in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, in Ireland last week we saw the horrors of trafficking when a programme was broadcast on RTE television about young women from Romania being trafficked into the EU, and into Ireland in particular.
The programme showed that, unfortunately, Ireland is one of a small number of countries that has failed to implement various EU directives on combating trafficking.
It is important to point out that, as a cross-border activity, trafficking knows no borders.
All European countries should implement all the various directives as required.
I would call on the Irish Minister for Justice to do just that, because trafficking is a terrible abuse.
It is growing in reach and is affecting young girls and women in particular.
It was a great shame to see that Ireland was one of the countries not implementing the required directives, and I would hope that our government will change that and immediately implement them.
Â Â  â Mr President, a study published on 8 May by the non-governmental organisation 'Save the Children' revealed that underage children are prey to sexual exploitation in the refugee camps in Liberia, including by members of humanitarian organisations and soldiers from the multinational peacekeeping forces.
The European Parliament should, first of all, be officially informed by the UN as to the extent of these tragic events, which blacken every concept of humanitarian aid, and should condemn politically and legally this conduct on the part of the soldiers who, according to the information in the study, have acquired the mentality and conduct of mercenaries, conduct which is beyond any concept of impartial humanitarian aid.
At the same time, however, the governments and the Commission itself should make the corresponding moves, so that we can all, if nothing else, give children the minimum human right to bread and water without the need for them to debase themselves body and soul.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to ask those in this House to imagine themselves as an 18-year old on holiday in another country.
You take a taxi, it turns into a nightmare.
There are no witnesses, but the taxi driver ends up dead and you go straight to the first police station.
You say he pulled a gun on you and what happened was self-defence on your part.
That leads to a legal process lasting 18Â years.
You spend these 18 years in prison, away from your family, enduring a legal process that goes back and forth, condemning you to death, then finding you innocent, then starting again until every appeal is exhausted and you are finally condemned to death a second time.
Eighteen years â half your life â in prison, with some of that time on death row, is punishment enough.
That is the terrible story of my constituent, Mirza Tahir Hussain, condemned to death early next month.
Mr President, if there is anything this Parliament can do, with its long history of opposition to the death penalty, I implore you to do so by writing to the President of Pakistan appealing for clemency.
Â Â  Mr President, for the past two weeks, the Dutch press has been dining out on the vulnerable position in which Commissioner MrsÂ Kroes finds herself, having already been questioned by this House in 2004.
The questions mainly concentrated on some of her business dealings with entrepreneurs who seek to increase their profits by flouting the law or by deliberately acting against the general interest.
MrsÂ Kroesâ answer, at the time, was that she had learned from her previous mistakes.
She was reported to have ended all her business interests and relations prior to her possible appointment.
It was in part this undertaking that meant that she was eventually considered an acceptable candidate by a majority in this House.
Meanwhile, it has transpired that until 2006, she was the beneficiary of a guarantee in respect of losses made on office blocks which she owned in two Dutch towns, and which were worth EUR 7 million.
The person who guaranteed those office blocks, and as appeared subsequently, her own private dwelling as well, has once again been arrested on suspicion of being the financial brain behind a very violent criminal syndicate that has been known to murder people.
Mr President, how will Parliament be informed about this and how can this Parliament speak out about the risks and implications?
Â Â  Mr President, I appeal to the Members of the European Parliament, and to MrÂ Poettering in particular, but also to other public figures and those who are waging a campaign of terror in the mass media, to cease manipulating, blackmailing and exerting pressure on the democratically elected Polish Government.
In our opinion, interpreting solidarity on energy issues as submissiveness and acquiescence and coercing countries into accepting the European Constitution are forms of economic and political intimidation well known to Poles from the period of Soviet occupation.
Fortunately, we do not play democracy by ear in Poland, which is, however, something we see during votes in the European Parliament.
We demand that the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States ratified by the UN in 1974 be observed.
Article 1 of this Charter reads as follows: âEvery State has the sovereign and inalienable right to choose its economic system as well as its political, social and cultural systems in accordance with the will of its people, without outside interference, coercion or threat in any form whatsoever.â
Â Â  Mr President, on 22 January a demonstration was held in Madrid in support of the victims of terrorism, which was attended by the then Minister for Defence, who was jeered by many of the demonstrators.
That Minister insisted that he had been assaulted during that demonstration and, as a result, two Peopleâs Party activists were arrested by officers of the National Police, despite the fact that there was no evidence against them.
There were political orders, however.
Those arrests were illegal, since they breached constitutional rights, and judges have therefore sentenced three police officers to terms in prison for that crime of illegal detention, which, as the sentence indicates, was an unmotivated, arbitrary, abusive and illegal detention.
When these events took place, the Minister for Home Affairs, who at the time was MrÂ Alonso, who still holds a post within my countryâs Socialist government, endorsed in Congress the actions of the police that he was in charge of.
In other words, he endorsed an attack against Spanish democracy, which was the arrest of these Peopleâs Party activists despite the lack of evidence against them.
Now this Minister is washing his hands of the affair and, far from accepting his responsibility, he is protecting himself through the resignation of a second-rank political figure.
We are therefore denouncing this case in the European Parliament today and my Group will be asking the Commission and the Council about this issue which is casting a shadow upon a Member State of the European Union.
Â Â  Mr President, the historically most extensive enlargement of the European Union was two years old on May 1.
In its latest announcement, the Commission emphasised that accession has brought economic perspective and resources for new Member States, and a new momentum and a larger market for old Member States.
In spite of the fears, social dumping has not materialised, and wage levels and social resources in Western Europe have not dropped.
Therefore, let us put a stop to the initial distrust between the two camps, and let us show European citizens the true effect of accession, because in our globalising world neither the new, nor the old Member States stand any chance of remaining in the competition without the European Union.
The first signs of working together without distrust are already noticeable in the compromises reached in handling the Services Directive and the Financial Perspective.
We must join our efforts to speed up the transformation of the structure and decision making of the European Union, because it is possible to adopt a Constitutional Treaty, and it must be done.
My wish for all of us is that we draw faith and courage for our work from the second anniversary of the last enlargement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the city of Strasbourg is today hosting the , women from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, who have come to meet other women from their countries living in Europe.
They want to demonstrate the fact that they have been fighting for a long time for their rights and for the developments that have taken place in their respective countries: the right to move and work, and to educate their children.
These women have come to Strasbourg, the seat of the European Parliament, in order to call on us to support their work by taking action here, in Europe, against the attempts to bring about a return to the obscurantism to which they can fall victim not only in their own countries, but also here.
A delegation of these courageous women is currently present in the galleries of our Chamber.
I would be grateful to you if you would kindly extend to them the warmest of welcomes and show them your support, for example in Broglie square, in Strasbourg, where one of their demonstrations will be taking place.
Thank you, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen.
Â Â  Thank you, MrsÂ Roure, and thank you to our visitors.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to call on the Council and the Commission to take another look at the situation with regard to the sugar regime in the European Union.
In particular, they should now consider bringing in flexibility with regard to the compensation payments to sugar beet growers and sugar producers who have lost their livelihoods, and targeting those resources instead towards the creation of alternative energy crops and alternative fuels.
This would require the Commission to make a decision that compensation can be given for new processing methods without actually taking away the structure of the manufacturing capacity that is available for these alternative fuels in many Member States.
That can help to eliminate or to reduce our dependence on oil, it can also contribute towards a cleaner environment and, most importantly of all, it can offer many farmers around the European Union a valuable crop to grow, which would guarantee them economic security for the future.
Â Â  â Last week, the so-called Middle East quartet, which includes the EU, decided to set up a temporary international mechanism to provide humanitarian aid for the Palestinian people.
This decision follows moves, of which the United States was the leading proponent, to isolate the Palestinian Authority, namely the suspension of funding for the running of the Authority.
In the context of the occupation and oppression by the Israeli Government, this measure will have the objective effect both of hastening the collapse of the Palestinian Authority â and consequently public services such as education and health â and of exacerbating the already desperate situation in which the Palestinians live, a situation that the United Nations had warned would arise.
This unjustifiable punishment of the Palestinian people is happening at a time when the Israeli Government, having breached all agreements, is continuing to pursue its policy of violating international law and of failing to comply with United Nations resolutions, is maintaining its military occupation, is continuing to build the fence and is threatening once again to strengthen settlements in the West Bank.
Mr President, the time has come to put an end to what are effectively sanctions and to take political initiatives that promote compliance with international law and with United Nations resolutions.
Â Â  Mr President, each village and town in England has a line around it for planning purposes, stating that it is a defined village or town settlement.
However, we are now witnessing the erosion of the traditional communities and destruction of our landscape due to the total disregard for sensible and locally acceptable planning developments.
You might ask who is responsible for this.
Have a guess: the regional assemblies accountable directly to Brussels.
Is this surprising?
Not at all, when you consider that planning applications and projects are no longer discussed with the people that they affect.
To protect Englandâs precious greenbelt land and to end overdevelopment and towns merging, we have to abolish these unwanted and undemocratic assemblies and return planning issues to where they have been dealt with traditionally: town halls.
Then, and only then, will our greenbelt land be given the protection and respect it deserves.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish briefly to take issue with what Mrs Krupa â who unfortunately has now left the Chamber â said a minute ago.
She made a statement comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union.
I must say that it is not a fair comparison.
I shall just relate one little anecdote.
MrÂ Prodi, the previous President of the Commission, went to Estonia before it joined the European Union.
He was asked why Estonia should join the European Union, since it was just like the Soviet Union.
He thought for a while and said that it was a valid point, but he could not exactly remember when Estonia applied for membership of the Soviet Union.
I think Mrs Krupa should always keep that in mind when she thinks about Polandâs role in the European Union: it is there because membership is in its interests and came about through a democratic process.
Â Â  â Mr President, the Galician language is one of the oldest Romance languages.
It survived for centuries with no institutional protection, thanks to the will of its citizens, until democratic Spain recognised its official status and its right to be used by the citizens.
I therefore deplore the Bureauâs decision to reject the reasonable use of this language within the context of Parliamentâs relations with the citizens.
I regret that it has taken the opposite view to that adopted by other Community institutions, thereby showing a lack of democratic coherence.
It is an unfair and disproportionate decision, and I would therefore ask that it be reconsidered.
Galician Literature Day will be held on Wednesday, during this part-session.
Aware of your work in this field, Mr President, I would therefore ask you to send a message of support for this Day, which recognises the European vocation of the Galician language and its contribution to the Unionâs cultural diversity and wealth.
Â Â  Tomorrow we will await the European Commission's Convergence Report covering Lithuania.
I hope that this will recognise that Lithuania has made strong economic progress and satisfies many of the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Agreement.
The acceptance of Lithuania to the Euro zone should not be delayed on the grounds of a slight mismatch with the inflation indicator, because, according to the Treaty Establishing the European Community, inflation criteria can be interpreted quite broadly.
Lithuania has not used artificial measures to reduce inflation, and the somewhat higher level of inflation has been caused by rises in the cost of global energy resources.
I believe that Lithuania could be admitted to the Euro zone on economic grounds, bearing in mind its rapid economic growth.
I would go so far as to say that this uncertainty in the application of the Maastricht criteria is a matter of political importance and should be included in the agenda of the summit of EU leaders in June.
Â Â  â Mr President, the period of reflection expires in 2007 and I imagine that it is for this reason that the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, presented the Commission's position last week.
However, it is with regret that I see that the Commission has insisted on retabling the question of the European Constitution, without there having as yet been any pan-European consultation with citizens.
During the same presentation, MrÂ Barroso also spoke about a citizens' agenda, with greater solidarity between citizens in future.
I wonder what measures will be used to strengthen this solidarity: globalisation, the Lisbon Strategy or liberalisations?
To close, I believe that it is our duty, as an institution, to dedicate at least one more sitting of the European Parliament before the cut-off date of 2007 to debate this most serious issue.
Â Â  â Mr President, in the procedure to rekindle interest in the ratification of a European constitutional treaty, it would perhaps be useful to correct the text so that it supports institutions which have created and highlighted the particular character of European culture and the European economy.
Today we are celebrating World Family Day and we see that the large majority of European men and women continue to create families and to support and be supported by the institution of the family.
Let us not be influenced by the minorities.
Of course, family policy must continue to be a matter for the Member States, but the inclusion of the family dimension in various Community policies will help to strengthen social cohesion and increase competitiveness and reduce socio-economic problems such as unemployment, poverty and reduced productivity.
Apart from equality between men and women, apart from the rights of children, the difficulties encountered by every family during its creation and development need to be recognised, because these are the main reasons for Europe's demographic problem.
In order for the European constitutional treaty to be accepted by European citizens, importance needs to be attached to the family and to traditional European values.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to say something today about the human rights situation in Romania, with specific reference to the MISA yoga school and the visa for its founder, Gregorian Bivolaru.
On 21 October 2005, the Swedish supreme court ruled that Mr Bivolaru, the founder of the MISA yoga school, should not be handed over to the Romanian justice system on the grounds that his personal beliefs meant that he could not expect a fair trial in Romania.
He was granted political asylum in December of the same year.
Proceedings in Romania against 39 persons associated with the MISA school of yoga have still not yet been concluded.
Freedom of religion and an independent justice system are fundamental to the European Union, and Romaniaâs accession in 2007 is conditional upon them.
Romaniaâs and Bulgariaâs accessions are, of course, on the order of business for tomorrow.
I think it important that this House should continue to keep a very close eye on the human rights situation in both the present and future Member States.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to submit a proposal concerning the human rights situation in Tunisia: this situation remains extremely worrying, as the President of the European Parliament highlighted only last week.
Last week, members of the militia violently attacked several lawyers inside the Bar, which continues to be occupied by their fellow lawyers as a sign of protest against the project relating to the creation of a lawyersâ training institute, as provided for in the agreements between the European Commission and Tunisia.
In actual fact, the project is designed systematically to bring the training of lawyers under control by placing it at the mercy of the political power and, more specifically, of the Ministry of Justice.
We must strongly protest against this attack and show concern about the fate of our fellow lawyers, who are currently rallied in Tunis.
The Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League will take place next week.
It is the first Human Rights League on the African continent.
It has already been the subject of many European Parliament resolutions.
Its Congress will take place in Tunisia, where the conditions and the atmosphere are currently atrocious.
It would be helpful if official representatives from Parliament were sent there.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to draw the Houseâs attention to the fact that this morning in Belfast the Northern Ireland Assembly came together, almost three-and-a-half years since it was elected.
I should like to ask the President of Parliament to send a goodwill message to the Speaker of that Assembly in view of the difficult role and task she has ahead of her.
The European Union has always been very supportive of my constituency of Northern Ireland.
Mr Verheugen, who is here today, played a central role at one stage, a number of years ago.
I thank the European Parliament and the Commission for their support in this regard.
I would like to see a democratic, stable assembly in Northern Ireland, where we make our own decisions for our own people and are able to make those decisions work.
Â Â  â Mr President, a few days ago, at its invitation, I visited the , an animal protection organisation in Styria, and was very impressed to see what it does, not least, and particularly, since they are now starting to build up networks throughout Europe and to attempt to develop contacts in this Parliament too.
Believing as I do that that is the right thing for them to do, I agreed to present a petition on an issue that is of recurrent concern to me, that of animal transport.
As you all know, millions of animals are transported the length and breadth of Europe.
The journeys take a very long time, the lorries used are full to bursting point, and the animals are short of water, food, and ventilation.
To that must be added the fact that the people in charge of them are generally quite utterly inadequately trained for the job, that they are subject to too few controls and the penalties applicable are derisory.
The present situation in this area is utterly unacceptable.
The total time that live cattle spend in transit must be drastically reduced.
I endorse the views expressed by the animal welfare organisation and would like to call on the Council, the Commission and the whole House to at last do something of practical usefulness in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President, two years have passed since the largest enlargement in the history of the European Union.
During this time significant changes have occurred in the economic and social spheres.
What we lack, however, is a substantial, overall assessment of these changes.
It seems appropriate for the European Commission to prepare a document assessing the economic and social effects of enlargement for the Union as a whole, as well as for the new Member States which joined the structures of the Union two years ago.
Â Â  â It is exactly one year since the election in Ethiopia, when the people voted en masse for democracy and change.
Through its mission, which I headed, the EU unfortunately had to conclude that the elections did not meet international standards, due to the lack of transparency of the count and, above all, due to the serious violations of human rights that took place.
The main opposition leaders and thousands of people have been arrested and face the death penalty.
What more needs to happen for the Council to take action and impose targeted sanctions on those in charge of the Addis Ababa regime, as it did in the case of Belarus?
What more needs to happen for the Commission and the Council to take action to secure the swift, unconditional release of the detainees?
The EU does make a difference in Addis Ababa.
We must not let the people of Ethiopia down.
Â Â  Mr President, in Surinam, a country in South America, 25Â 000 people have been homeless since 7Â May.
There are 175 villages largely under water, and tens of thousands of people have fled.
Surinam is one of the ACP countries, with which we in Europe deal through the Cotonou Agreement.
Poverty reduction and schooling are seriously at risk.
Last week, I asked the Commission to help via ECHO emergency aid.
I should like to ask you, on behalf of this House, to convey to the people of Surinam and their Parliament our sympathy with their suffering.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0143/2006) by MrsÂ Kaufmann, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the outcome of the screening of legislative proposals pending before the Legislator [2005/2214(INI)].
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugenâs initiative towards bringing about a marked improvement in European lawmaking, which will involve withdrawing 68 pending legislative proposals, hits the mark in no uncertain fashion.
Public opinion in our own Member States has for some considerable time regarded the European Union as far too bureaucratic and as possessed of a mania for regulation, and so the time for facing up to this justified criticism is already overdue.
At the end of the day, the bottom line is that the âless, but of better qualityâ approach can bring dividends, and it would certainly be good for Europe and for its citizens, and so, Commissioner, with this approach to policymaking, you have the European Parliament â the directly elected representatives of the public â wholeheartedly and unreservedly alongside you, and I would add that it is not just the Commission, but also this House, that has work to do in this respect.
The focus of my report, though, Commissioner, is not on the âwhetherâ but on the âhowâ; it has to do, firstly, with the question of how the Commission and Parliament work together as institutions, and, secondly, with the question of whether it takes Parliamentâs legislative role sufficiently into account.
As you know, the Commissionâs announcement that pending legislative proposals would be withdrawn or amended was the cause of some excitement in our House, and not just from an institutional point of view.
This Houseâs committees subjected the specific individual proposals to close examination, the upshot of which was an exchange of letters on the subject between the Presidents of our two institutions.
In the case of certain of the proposals, Parliament does not share the Commissionâs view, but the Commission has not changed its mind.
It was almost exactly a year ago that Parliament and the Commission adopted a framework agreement that renewed the basis on which our two institutions work together, and so the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has examined not only the package you have announced in terms of its impact on the Treaties, but also, of course, the framework agreement itself, notably points 31, 32, and 33.
Believing as we do that there is a need for legislation over and above the framework agreement, it is our expectation that the Commission will not turn a deaf ear to our proposals, but will instead endorse them in a spirit of sincere cooperation with Parliament.
The first thing that has to be said is that it has become apparent from the whole affair that the agreement, which has generally been held to, that our House should be informed in advance of the Commissionâs intentions, is just not enough.
We must not only be informed in advance, but also informed in good time, and what that means is that Parliament should be in a position to do more than just give an opinion on the proposed withdrawal of proposals.
The main thing we expect from this is that proper account should be taken of our opinion when the Commission takes its final decision; if, for compelling reasons, the Commissionâs decision differs from our own, then we take it as read that we will at least be given an explanation as to why.
That is why â secondly â the Commission must, in future, go about things in a different way, by adopting the discontinuity principle as practised at the national level.
Every newly-appointed Commission should, immediately after taking office, draw up a list of the legislative proposals produced by its predecessor indicating which of the pending proposals it is planning to keep.
There should also be an indication in the annual legislative and working programme of which of the proposals currently going through the lawmaking process are to be withdrawn or amended.
Thirdly, as part of the present streamlining initiative, a package was submitted, containing both a list of proposals and an explanation of the package itself.
Quite apart from the fact that I myself cannot see why the criterion of competitiveness should be declared to be an overriding principle and virtually ennobled, I want, in my role as rapporteur, to stress that an explanation of the package is precisely what we do not want in future, for it was the explanation of the package that was the cause of a certain amount of irritation, since it cannot be one of Parliamentâs functions to explore the Commissionâs thinking and match the principles set out in the explanation to the various proposals to which they relate; that is precisely what the Commission is supposed to do when it announces its intention of withdrawing or modifying certain proposals, and that is why we want, in future, to see every single proposal for withdrawal justified separately.
I can tell the Commissioner that it is not only important from our point of view that this practice be adopted; I also think it would be beneficial to the Commission, for, if you had explained your proposals one by one and item by item, I am sure you would not have got tangled up in the undergrowth of your own institution.
You would then not have announced the withdrawal of the proposal for the Council resolution approving the European Communityâs accession to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, without having already noticed that it had already been adopted.
You can find it in the Official Journal, L 30, for the year 2005.
The Commission really does not possess the authority to declare null and void laws that have already been adopted.
If you had checked them one by one, you would not have announced the withdrawal of proposals that had already been withdrawn, for it is to be presumed that you would have noticed the mistake.
My report has to do with the way in which our two institutions work together, an area in which little is laid down by the Treaty on the European Communities, which, I might add, gives the institutions in question â us in Parliament and in the Commission â discretion to determine the manner of their cooperation in a responsible way.
It is my hope that my report will help to improve the EUâs institutional structures and to promote the duty of sincere cooperation between our two institutions.
I wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs of the other groups for their good cooperation, which has made it possible for us to present this report without dissent.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the same constructive spirit in which the rapporteur has just spoken that I would like to reply on behalf of the Commission and say that the most important thing about this project is indeed that the institutions should cooperate closely with one another.
I am most obliged to MrsÂ Kaufmann for having said that, considered from the political point of view, this project enjoys your Houseâs wholehearted support; although the debate we have just had has made that clear to me, it was important that it should be confirmed.
I will also readily concede that there was room for improvement in the test run that we are discussing today, and I am quite sure that the Commission will accept many of the suggestions you have made in your report.
I do not think that we will, in future, have any more grounds for complaint about cooperation in this matter.
I would, though, very much like to set out once more what we have actually achieved.
Current legislative procedures have been reviewed in the light of the new considerations and priorities that have recently emerged.
What happened before they did so?
This Commission is concentrating its efforts on a strategy for growth and employment, and what we wanted to know was whether the proposals that were already on the table were congruent with this strategyâs objectives and priorities.
MrsÂ Kaufmann will be aware that the problem with many of these proposals was that no assessment whatever of their eventual impact had been carried out, even though it was to be expected that some of them would have a massive effect on the economy.
That is the second argument, for the Commission had in fact, in the previous year, already decided that no more proposals would be put forward without a broad-based and methodologically sound means of assessing their impact, and it was with this, too, in mind that the proposals were reviewed to determine whether they would be equal to the demands for quality lawmaking that we had newly devised.
Lastly, too, there was also the question of whether specific proposals still stood a chance of being adopted, and that brings me to the point that you so rightly addressed.
There were a number of proposals in respect of which your House did not share the Commissionâs view, for example where the legal status of association and companies on a mutual basis is concerned, proposals in respect of which have been lying around in the Council for twelve years without the least thing being done with them.
There is not the remotest indication of the Council actually wanting to do anything with these proposals, and one cannot but wonder whether they are perhaps unlikely to survive the political process, and whether one perhaps ought to think again and come up with something better.
It is in precisely those cases in which your House has expressed misgivings that the Commission has announced the forthcoming close re-examination of the underlying issues â the social significance of which I acknowledge â and the possibility of our producing new proposals that would actually stand a chance of being considered within an appropriate period of time.
Where justification is concerned, I am of one mind with you; I do not believe that to be a problem in either political or legal terms.
When the Commission took its decision, it had in its possession individual justifications for every single proposal.
I am myself unable to explain to you why these individual justifications were not put before your House, for I had no objection whatever to that being done, and, moreover, had personally handed over the individual justifications to the groupsâ rapporteurs, so I am sure that we will be able to take these proposals into consideration.
I would like to make it quite clear how important it is to me that the rapporteur has not lost sight of the point that the withdrawal of proposals forms part of the exercise of the right of initiative.
The Commission is also, in principle, open to your suggestion that the annual legislative and working programme should, in future, indicate which, if any, proposals the Commission intends to withdraw, so that Parliament may express its point of view in good time.
I regard that as a very sensible proposal.
I hope that it will be clear to you from my response that I do not believe that we should get into an argument about the principles of this.
I am quite happy to acknowledge that things could have been done better in one or other respect, but what matters to me is that we should, together, make a success of the political project, and where that is concerned I can do no other than agree with your rapporteur that that is precisely what Europeâs citizens expect of us.
What they expect is not deregulation, not the erosion of rights and certainties, but rather that European legislation should be clear, simple, comprehensible and usable, so let us work together to that end.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will start by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur for the very good report but above all for having taken on board the Committee on Legal Affairsâ opinion to a considerable degree.
I am sure that we are agreed that the wording of the Treaty enables the Commission to withdraw proposals up until such time as the Council has taken up a Common Position, and this state of affairs is unsatisfactory from the legal point of view, in that the Commission could, following the first reading in this House, which can require a great deal of effort â one need only think back to the services directive to realise that â withdraw its proposal, thereby wiping out with one stroke of the pen a great deal of work on the part of this House.
That is why I would like to emphasise the principle of sincere cooperation, to which reference has been made in this context.
If the first reading stage, with all the hard work that it entails, has been reached, then the Commission should no longer be able to withdraw its proposals.
The Commission should also respond with greater sensitivity if Parliament requests by a large majority that its proposals be withdrawn.
I need only remind the House of the dispute about the software patent directive, where we repeatedly asked the Commission to withdraw a proposal that was disastrous and scarcely worthy of mention.
It declined to do so, whereupon this House in any case rejected the proposal by over 500 votes.
I think â and you have yourself just said â that there were a number of inconsistencies in the package of withdrawn proposals that was submitted.
The Committee on Legal Affairs attached particular importance to the Associations Statute and to there being European law covering such entities.
I am pleased to note your willingness to review this matter and look forward to really new proposals, for the âjustificationâ for this package as having to do with the reduction of bureaucracy and of excessive impositions is certainly not applicable here.
If we want there to be a European law on associations, it is because we want to relax many of the rules and regulations in this area, thereby enabling non-governmental organisations, in particular, to operate more easily across Europe.
I would also like to draw attention to something that the Commission has overlooked.
We recommended the withdrawal of certain legislative proposals: not just the software patent directive, but also the mediation directive, and I do not see why other proposals for legislation were withdrawn, but this directive was not.
Here too, it is not quite clear in what way the package is balanced, but if you can promise us that closer cooperation with Parliament will result in that changing in future, then we will be happy to take note of that.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am actually speaking on behalf of your countryman, Mr Protasiewicz.
Firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent job.
The work we did in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs went very smoothly and most of the committee stands behind the report.
I would like to make three points.
The first point is that our group welcomes the Commissionâs initiative of withdrawing 68 pieces of legislation.
The original idea of European integration was to bring down walls, not to create them, and the Commission in its analysis and screening did an excellent job.
The second point, however, is that when we deal with this issue we have to be very careful that we do not start changing the Commissionâs exclusive right of initiative.
The idea of a new Commission withdrawing initiatives or announcing which initiatives it will withdraw as soon as it comes into office is a good one, and to a certain extent we could say that the Commission did that this time around, which should be welcomed.
My third and final point is that we want increased consultation between the European Parliament and the Council as well, but it is very important to retain and keep the institutional balance pretty much as it stands.
So we want closer involvement, but maintenance of the institutional balance when we talk about screening of legislation in general.
I have always considered myself to be a bit of an institutional nerd, but I can guarantee that the next speaker, Mr Corbett, is even more of one!
Â Â  . Mr President, that is one reputation that I will have to live up to, or should I say live down!
My group, too, welcomes the report by Mrs Kaufmann.
We believe it is an excellent report, which has got the balance just about right.
The original logic of the Treaties, in giving the right of initiative to the Commission â in those days the Commission proposed and the Council disposed â was entirely right for that time.
We wanted the Council to work not on the basis of competing drafts put forward by different Member States, but on a common proposal drawn up by an institution that belongs to all of us â the Commission â and that is duty bound to serve the interests of all Member States in the proposals that it brings forward.
It was then up to the Council alone to look at that proposal, modify it if necessary, accept it or otherwise.
There was a certain balance.
Since the original Treaties, though, we have seen the emergence of this Parliament, which was first directly elected in 1979 and more recently has acquired co-legislative powers.
Because of their national experience, people in most of our Member States expect that a parliament will have the right of initiative, that its members can propose legislation and that when they stand for election they say they will propose this or that.
That is lacking in the European Parliament.
It is true that it is lacking in some national parliaments as well and many parliaments have that right in theory, but it is not exercised in practice.
Nonetheless it is something our citizens expect.
So how have we tried to resolve that at European level?
The Maastricht Treaty gave this Parliament the right â and the Council already had the same right â to ask the Commission to bring forward a legislative proposal.
In practice that has usually worked quite well.
Now the Commission has told us that it will also listen very carefully to Parliament and consult us before it withdraws proposals.
I welcome that sort of not quite sharing but working closely together on the right of initiative, as regards both proposing and withdrawing.
I believe the Commission listened to us quite carefully on this recent package, although not, I regret to say, on the proposals regarding mutuals and the European Statute for Associations.
There I believe the Commission should review its position.
But on the whole I believe the system has worked quite well.
If the Commission is going to be able to defend its monopoly on the right of initiative, it must continue to exercise it in that responsible way, to maintain a dialogue with Parliament and take up the legitimate concerns expressed in this Parliament.
The Commission must also accept that its right to withdraw should not be a right of veto at the last stage of the legislative procedure.
The right to withdraw should exist right up to the end of the first reading in each body, Parliament and then the Council.
Once the Council has reached a common position and it comes back to Parliament, it is no longer the property of the Commission.
It is a Council common position that we will be dealing with, and so on through the rest of the legislative procedure.
The Commission will still play a role, but should not at that stage have the right of withdrawal, which would unbalance the system.
It should have it in the first stages, as it does.
I welcome what has been put forward by our committee.
It is a good balance in that it proposes that there be due justification, due dialogue, proper consultation and advance notice.
If we can work together on that basis, I believe that is a reasonably correct balance in the context of the current Treaties.
Â Â  . Mr President, I have two comments to make with regard to MrsÂ Kaufmannâs report, the general thrust of which I endorse.
First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the need for screening legislative proposals not only in respect of Better Regulation principles or the Lisbon agenda, but also with regard to subsidiarity.
I am aware that this is a concept to which this House is increasingly averse, but in no way does that alter the fact that European legislation must clearly add value over and above national legislation.
I take the view that fighting overregulation at European level plays an important role in the pursuit of a better and simpler approach to legislation at Community level.
My second comment concerns the role of national parliaments.
I am right behind MrÂ Barrosoâs initiative to send new legislative proposals to the national parliaments, for Member States are capable of carefully screening for subsidiarity, something which will undoubtedly increase the support base for European legislation among Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, better lawmaking is one of the Commissionâs priorities, and this initiative has been welcomed by both the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and this House as a whole.
There is indeed a great deal of clearing out to do where our legislation is concerned, some of which will involve simplifying and codifying packages of laws, but it will also be necessary to withdraw those that are no longer appropriate, and it is at this point that I would like, not only to thank MrsÂ Kaufmann for presenting a very good report, but also to make three observations.
On Wednesday, in the German , Chancellor Merkel raised the question as to whether we too ought to bring in the concept of discontinuity between one legislative period and another, so that laws would lapse and have to be reintroduced.
This was a problem that we had with the Bolkestein directive, when the old Commission had proposed something that its successor certainly did not want in that form, not least because of changes in circumstances and in outlook, so I do think it would be a good thing if the Commission â at the beginning of its term of office, at any rate â were to sift through the proposals on the table in order to determine which they are going to keep because they fit in with their programme, and which they are going to withdraw on the grounds that their substance or something else makes them obsolete.
My second observation is this: MrÂ Corbett said, and rightly, that Parliament acquired the right of codecision over a period of time and that there is therefore something missing from Article 250(2), in that it states only that the Commission can no longer withdraw legislation once the Council has delivered its Common Position, but it does not state that it could not do so either following the first reading in this House.
There is a loophole in the Treaties, and the only acceptable way to fill it is for us to be very sincere in our dealings with one another, and â as has been said today several times over â for this House to be given a say when the Commission contemplates withdrawing proposals, at least when we have gone past first reading.
I can tell you, Mr Vice-President, that we even said that you could withdraw a proposal even following the Councilâs Common Position if the Council turned the proposal into something it had not been, for it seems that, on two or three occasions, the Council adopted a resolution that was the precise opposite of what the Commission had intended to propose, and we were advised by the legal service that you would, in such a case, still have the right of withdrawal.

The third thing I want to say is that you mentioned the growth and employment strategy as the yardstick against which these sixty-eight proposals had been measured, and I am glad that you said that this was an inevitability in the case of European law on associations; I live in the Saar-Lor-Lux region, which borders Lorraine and Luxembourg, and I could tell you some stories about the difficulties civil society organisations there have with establishing associations that cross borders.
The journalistsâ Inter-Regional Press Institute, for example, tried to, and then ended up somehow doing it under French law, because its chairman lived in France, while other associations have had recourse to Luxembourg or German law; that is not an appropriate way of going about things.
This is an area in which you should be doing more, perhaps by coming up with a more modern proposal.
Overall, though, we are working well together in this area.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, the programme for better legislation aims to improve the transparency of the Union, to ensure its effectiveness, efficiency and to move closer to the goal of implementing the Lisbon Strategy.
The programme is also intended as a response to accusations that Brussels all too frequently opts for legislative mechanisms and, as a result, creates too many laws.
Until now, the Unionâs has consisted of tonnes of documents written in a language that is unintelligible to citizens, generally drawn up without consulting European social partners or European citizens.
This last accusation suggests that European Union legislation is created without the participation of the citizens of Europe, for whom we, as the European Parliament, work and whom we represent.
What should be done to change this image and to bring the European Union closer to its citizens, now that it finds itself in the midst of a constitutional crisis?
It seems that withdrawing these 68 pieces of draft legislation is a step in the right direction, but is it enough of a step in terms of better legislation?
It does not seem enough.
It seems that, in order to improve legislation, we need better inter-institutional cooperation between the Commission and Parliament.
We need these two institutions to have, as part of their structure, special groups created to work towards better legislation.
These groups will act as the conscience of the EU, a legislative barometer which will issue a warning if one of the institutions lapses into bureaucratic routine and acts against the code of good EU legislation and legislative principles such as appropriateness, subsidiarity, cohesion, transparency, proportionality and predictability.
Commissioner, I have no doubt that good EU legislation will be possible when good cooperation is established between the Commission and Parliament.
Parliament and the Commission must trust each other, respect each other and treat each other as full partners with complete respect and trust.
Only then will the legislation improve.
Only then will we be able to create legislation together for the good of the citizens.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- the recommendation for second reading (A6-0122/2006), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position established by the Council [09858/3/2005 C6-0018/2006 2003/0165(COD)] with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods (Rapporteur: Adriana Poli Bortone) and
- the recommendation for second reading (A6-0078/2006), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position established by the Council [09857/3/2005 C6-0017/2006 2003/0262(COD)] with a view to adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods (Rapporteur: Karin Scheele).
Â Â  . â Mr President, today finds us discussing a brace of regulatory packages on foods, in the shape of MrsÂ Poli Bertoneâs report on the nutritional and health claims made in respect of them, and my own report on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to them.
These two proposals for legislation have always been discussed and considered simultaneously and in tandem, since there would have been no point in taking the two at different times.
This House having taken up some very controversial positions â as some of its Members still do â on whether, and if so how, claims of health and nutritional value should be regulated, there have always been time problems whenever the report on enrichment by the addition of minerals and vitamins was on the order of business.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those concerned â the groupsâ staff, the European Council and the Commission â for the very good cooperation in between sittings, which has made it possible for us to keep the lines of communication open and to achieve good compromises.
The intention is that the proposed regulation should harmonise the various national regulations on the addition of vitamins and minerals, and of certain other substances, to foodstuffs, and, today being the occasion of its second reading, I would like to mention that this regulation covers only the voluntary addition of vitamins and minerals, so that national regulations requiring their addition are unaffected.
One principle underpinning my report is that the Community should work towards a state of affairs in which it is with considerations of nutrition and health in mind that manufacturers use vitamin and mineral supplements, and so I am glad that, not only within this House, but also between the institutions, a compromise has been achieved, and that there is support for the bio-availability approach, according to which all added vitamins and minerals must be capable of being used by the body, for, if that were not the case, it would be misleading for the consumer and in extreme cases could result in adverse effects on human health.
In debating it, we have heard, over and over again, of examples of how, when too many vitamins or minerals are added, the human body ends up being unable to process this combination of substances, and so I think it is a good thing that we should opt for this bio-availability approach.
We have also made progress by agreeing to define other substances as well as vitamins and minerals, which are, of course, listed â and hence defined â in Annexes 1 and 2 to this Regulation.
It is because an excessive intake of vitamins and minerals can cause damage to health that safe maximum amounts must be laid down for the addition of such substances to foodstuffs.
Provision is already made for such maximum amounts in the directive on food supplements, but these have not yet been published.
Considerations of consumer safety, then, make it a matter of urgent necessity that they be laid down.
The amendment of Article 6 is intended to ensure that the Commission will submit proposals for safe maximum amounts within two years.
Having myself been, for many years, a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I am also pleased that the Commission, in a supplementary statement, has announced a revision of the nutrition labelling directive, which is long overdue.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the vote on the report concerning the labelling of foods, I am pleased to inform the House that, following intense negotiations, we have arrived at a common text that I hope will enable us to avoid the conciliation procedure.
Before going into detail, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, MrsÂ Sommer, MrsÂ Corbey, MrÂ Maaten, MrsÂ Evans, MrsÂ Breyer, MrsÂ Liotard and MrÂ Blokland, for their decisive contributions and for their willingness to negotiate, even in the most trying times.
In a state of deadlock, in which the Council did not seem willing to grant us anything further, we succeeded in putting a compromise package together: a final text that, bolstered by the support of all the parliamentary groups, prompted the Council to accept the proposals on the table.
All that remains is for tomorrowâs vote to put the seal on matters and, in that regard, I call on all of my fellow Members to support the compromise with the aim of reaching the qualified majority that we need to amend the common position.
I believe that, overall, this is a balanced text that effectively pursues the objective of guaranteeing consumers accurate, clear and understandable information, so as to enable them to make a balanced and informed choice about their diet.
Everyone in this House agrees on the need to promote a healthy and balanced diet for Europeans, and to prevent a situation in which a tempting label promising extraordinary benefits for a personâs figure or, worse still, for his or her health, in reality disguises a high-calorie foodstuff, without the consumer having the opportunity to identify it as such.
In a Europe in which, according to the WHO, one in five children is obese, and in the light of the recent studies demonstrating the link between advertising and junk food consumption, this regulatory measure can no longer be postponed.
I believe that the primary objective of consumer protection has been fully achieved in the text resulting from the compromise.
I should like to add that, through Parliamentâs intervention, we have succeeded in following up and responding to the requests for clarity and definite timescales that were worrying the food industry.
This compromise has not been easy, partly because the Councilâs position on some points remained very inflexible â practically rigid â until the end of the negotiations.
That is precisely why I regard it as a great success that we have won concessions on these very points: I refer, in particular, to Article 4 and to the measures relating to alcohol that we will address later on.
I should, however, like to point out straight away that the agreement with the Council relates to a package that must be supported I therefore call on you straight away to reject Amendments 90 and 49, which fall outside the package agreed on with the other European institutions.
As for the placing on the market of so-called 'health' labels, the Council has agreed to introduce a simplified and faster procedure that will guarantee our businesses more certainty.
Ever since we cast our unanimous vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, it has been clear that shortening the timescale should not mean sacrificing a thorough scientific assessment of the authenticity of the claims made on labels.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) should have exactly the same amount of time to assess claims under both procedures.
The Council has supported us in this proposal and the final outcome is that Parliament has succeeded in ensuring that health labels presenting no particular problems will be able to receive a definitive marketing authorisation in eight months.
On the other hand, the simplified procedure will not apply to some labels that are particularly dangerous insofar as they are very appealing, such as those that boast of being effective in reducing health risks and those that refer to childrenâs development.
Those labels will instead have to be subject to the full authorisation procedure that will guarantee greater control, not only in scientific terms on the part of EFSA and the Commission, but also on the part of the Member States in the context of the comitology procedure.
As regards the controversial subject of nutrient profiles, or the notorious Article 4, I should like to point out that, until last Wednesday, the Council was against any derogation from the text.
In essence, the common position stipulated that no type of labelling â neither nutrition nor health labelling â could be used on a product that did not comply with the nutrient profiles established by EFSA.
For example, a sweet with a high sugar content could never bear a health or nutrition claim.
The compromise text accepted by all of the groups and the Council now provides for the option to affix labels containing nutritional information even when a substance exceeds the nutrient profile, provided that a statement is added on the same side of the packaging to warn the consumer of the high levels of the substance exceeding the nutrient profiles.
In that way, the consumer is guaranteed accurate information, which can be seen at a glance on the same side of the packaging, while, at the same time, the food industry is given the opportunity to use this type of claim.
I regard this text as a victory for Parliament on a point that the Council had initially thought untouchable.
In relation to brands, we have succeeded in ensuring that existing brands can continue to be used for 15 years without any further requirements.
Once that period has expired, they may continue to be used provided that they are accompanied by a corresponding claim that complies with the provisions of the present regulation.
I believe that this is a sufficiently long transitional period for the industry, enough, at any rate, to enable it to adapt to the Community regulations.
Furthermore, we have safeguarded the use of generic names that traditionally accompany food products such as âaperitifâ, âdigestiveâ and âcough sweetsâ: those terms will be granted special exemptions and may be readily used.
I would also point out to the House that all the systems of negative labelling, the so-called âtraffic lightâ or âred stampâ systems, which are already in use in some countries, remain outside the scope of the regulation and will therefore be regulated at national level.
In our role as Parliament, we have won some important victories in the negotiations concerning the protection of SMEs.
What we had initially been told was impossible on technical grounds has instead been granted to us.
Two recitals highlight the importance of making it easier for SMEs to use the labels, insofar as they represent âimportant added value for the European food industryâ.
Under the new Article 15, the Commission will have to commit itself to making instruments and guidelines available to SMEs in order to make it easier, in particular, to apply the present regulation.
Furthermore, by reducing the data protection period to five years, compared with the seven planned initially, we have shortened the waiting times for claims to be used by those small and medium-sized enterprises that do not have the financial resources needed to fund their own research into labels.
Thanks to Parliamentâs amendment, SMEs will soon be able to use all of the labels that have already been authorised and that are available in the list provided for in Article 13.
They can be used free of charge and without any formalities.
Those who do not have the financial means to fund research into a claim will therefore also be able to use it easily and at no extra cost.
As regards the protection of children â a matter of great importance in this House â we have succeeded in ensuring that all labels that refer to childrenâs development or improved health are assessed under the full authorisation procedure, so as to ensure that thorough checks are carried out, including by the Member States, on whether the label is scientifically valid and whether it can be understood by the consumer.
Claims made by medical, dieticiansâ and nutritionistsâ associations will be accepted, but not those made by individual doctors.
As regards alcohol, nutrition labels had already been accepted in the common position.
Beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol were authorised to bear labels marked âreduced alcohol contentâ or âfewer caloriesâ.
As a further, albeit final, offer, the Council has also allowed the use of the wording 'low alcohol content'.
We have also obtained significant recognition of the importance of safeguarding the variety of culinary traditions, as well as the possibility for those who sell foods loose to receive special conditions.
To conclude, I call on you all to support the amendments forming part of the compromise signed by all of the groups, and those amendments alone, so that the legislative process for this report â which has been so controversial that it has remained before this House for more than three years â may be brought to a successful conclusion.
I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone, including my colleagues from the groups and the support staff.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs, MrsÂ Poli Bortone and MrsÂ Scheele, for their excellent work and cooperation with my services in working out this compromise.
I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution.
It is true that it was not an easy task.
You will remember the great differences that separated the views of the three institutions on this issue.
However, I believe â and the rapporteurs have rightly said â that we have managed to reach a good compromise.
That is a fact.
However, as with any compromise, it leaves a little to be desired by all sides, so each side would have preferred to go a bit further in one direction or another.
Nevertheless, these compromises on both documents have managed to balance the interests of all involved: consumers, industry and economic operators.
But this is a delicate and sensitive balance and I believe that the two documents should be adopted as agreed in the compromise, because anything else would upset this balance and would definitely upset the compromise.
These two regulations state that, if economic operators voluntarily use claims or other marketing tools to sell their products, they have to be truthful and accurate and the claims must be scientifically based.
This means that it is the consumerâs choice â it is ultimately for the consumer to decide â but the consumer has to be presented with correct, accurate and scientifically-based information in order to make this informed choice.
I agree with the rapporteur that this is a very important step in the long-term struggle that has just begun for the health and nutrition of European citizens.
The health claims regulation will prevent consumers from being misled by unsubstantiated or misleading claims.
At the same time, it will provide harmonised rules allowing products to circulate freely in the internal market.
It will also create a clear legal environment, a level playing field for economic operators to ensure fair competition, and it will encourage investment in innovative food practices.
For example, in addition to the list of permitted nutritional claims or the list of physiological function claims, it will now allow, through an authorisation procedure, claims related to the reduction of a disease risk, something that until now has been prohibited.
So, these harmonised rules will be of great interest to the European food industry but, through the process we have adopted in the legislation, we also guarantee consumer protection.
Also, for health claims based on newly developed data, the compromise now provides for a simpler and faster procedure in order to boost innovation in the area of food.
I am sure Parliament recognises the effort that both the Commission and the Council have made on that point.
On the nutrient profiles, which have already been described, these are products that, on the basis of the claims, are made to appear better to consumers, encouraging more consumption.
We therefore need proper criteria in this respect.
The nutrient profile is one good criterion that could be used and the proposed compromise introduces flexibility in order to facilitate the application and use of these claims.
In the context of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:
âIn establishing the nutrient profiles referred to in Article 4(1) through the Regulatory Committee procedure, the Commission undertakes to accompany the proposed Commission measures, submitted to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with an explanatory note outlining the criteria that will be taken into account for the establishment of the nutrient profiles.â
As I have said, I believe that this is a good compromise which covers the interests of all the key stakeholders.
On the regulation concerning the addition of vitamins and minerals, again we have reached a good compromise.
On the basis of this compromise, I should like to make the following statement:
âFurther to its statement accompanying the adoption of the common position, the Commission has the intention to present, as soon as possible and in any case within two years of the adoption of the regulation, a proposal for the revision of Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs.
In that context, the Commission has the intention to consider the review of the rule concerning the meaning of âsignificant amountâ as mentioned in the Annex to that directive.â
I very much hope that Parliament will support this compromise package, which regulates the composition aspects of foods and ensures the safety of the product.
It also introduces appropriate specific rules on labelling, presentation and advertising, and at the same time provides the basis for scrutinising and if necessary regulating the addition of certain other substances, as already mentioned by the rapporteur.
That will ensure a very high level of protection for public health and consumer protection and at the same time allow the industry to have a stable, concise, clear regulatory environment that will allow for innovation and the need to remain competitive at Community and international level.
In conclusion, may I again thank the two rapporteurs and everyone else who has cooperated in achieving this compromise.
I am looking forward to an interesting debate.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though, in our campaign against this law, which has lasted three years, we have achieved some good tactical victories, the fact is that what we face tomorrow is a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea; we have to approve the compromise package from the informal trialogue, even though I have to say to the Commissioner that we are very far from pleased with it, for, if we do not, we will then be thrown back on the Councilâs Common Position, which is every bit as revolting as the Commissionâs original draft.
Those are the facts of the matter.
Moreover, the tendency of this law â even with this compromise â is to deprive citizens of their freedom of choice by categorising foods as âgoodâ or âbadâ on the basis of mythical nutrient profiles.
To this day â even after three years of debate â the Commission has been unable to submit even a rough outline of what these values might be.
The consequence of this is that we will be obliged, tomorrow, to vote for something that does not actually exist; can being constrained to do that be described as a reliable way of making policy?
