I have not, but I have read various comments about it.
I met Mr Seifert early on in my time as European Commissioner, just after he launched the tentative takeover by Frankfurt of the London Stock Exchange.
I have read what he said in his book.
Whereas the book is interesting, it is just one perspective on the subject.
I should like to say to Members of this House and others outside, who always seem to be concerned about outside influences contaminating the European experience, that I believe that some of the proposals on the table at present suggest to me that market players worldwide seem to want to be involved in the European experience and see it somewhat in the other way.
Evidence seems to suggest that a lot of business is now done in Europe that used to be done on the other side of the Atlantic.
There is a reason for that.
Some people want to get involved in the European way.
We should not always be so defensive.
Mr HÃ¶kmark and others referred to the regulatory matter.
I would agree with what they say.
We should let European rules and regulations apply to European companies.
That is what our interest is going to be.
The question of whether there should be takeovers or mergers of stock exchanges in different parts of the world is entirely a matter for the market players and one about which I am entirely agnostic.
Â Â  Mr President, I am astonished at the Commissionerâs response.
Some very precise questions were put to him.
We are not asking him to intervene in the reality of the markets, we are asking him to play his part in initiating legislation.
Failing to take a decision has an effect on the markets.
Not taking decisions about decoupling or the application of the competition rules in a particular market affects the definition of the framework.
We also asked you specific questions about the impact assessment.
When will Parliament be able to have this impact assessment, before it has been totally rewritten by your services, Commissioner?
Â Â  Mr President, I do not think my question on the consolidation of the banking sector and whether there was anything in the Muscat report that could give comfort to the stultifying of the savings bank structure in Germany was answered.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0217/2006) by MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation repealing Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 to maritime transport, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 as regards the extension of its scope to include cabotage and international tramp services (COM(2005)0651 C6-0046/2006 2005/0264(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, it is my pleasure to join you tonight for this discussion on the report by Mr Wortmann-Kool on the Commissionâs proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) NoÂ 4056/86.
The Commission is very pleased with the reportâs recognition that price- fixing liner conferences are no longer justified in todayâs market conditions, either legally or economically.
The thrust of our proposal is to increase EU competitiveness, much in keeping with the Lisbon agenda.
Roughly 18% of imports and 21% of EU exports are affected by carriersâ ability to fix prices jointly under the liner conference block exemption.
The repeal of this block exemption will result in lower transport prices, engendering an overall benefit to the EU economy.
That said, the Commission has also been concerned with preserving the competitiveness of the EU liner shipping industry.
That is why we are preparing guidelines explaining how competition law will apply to the liner sector, once Regulation (EC) NoÂ 4056/86 is repealed.
The Commission is committed to promulgating the guidelines by the end of 2007.
In view of the two-year transitional period, the guidelines will be in place before the repeal of the liner conference block exemption takes effect, thus giving industry ample time to adjust to a new competitive environment in the knowledge that what it seeks to do is lawful.
The Commission has been discussing closely with both the transport providers, carriers, and the transport users, shippers, on the content of the guidelines.
The focus will be on ensuring the competitiveness of the transport sector.
I think we all agree that ensuring competitiveness is not the same as shielding the sector from competition.
Information exchanges are lawful and are common practice in most industries, because they enable business to make better decisions.
However, they must not go so far as to prevent undertakings from determining their conduct in the market independently of each other.
The process leading to the adoption of the guidelines by the Commission includes discussions with both transport users and transport providers, as well as with the Member States in the European Competition Networkâs maritime transport subgroup.
Draft guidelines will be published so that all interested parties have the opportunity to comment.
Other institutions may also put forward comments during that time.
In other cases, notably in the field of state aids, the European Parliament has used this opportunity to make its views known.
We look forward to the European Parliamentâs continued interest in this important initiative.
I understand the concerns raised on international issues.
I would like to reassure you that we are keeping our trading partners aware of our initiative, explaining the economic and legal reasons that underpin it.
These contacts have so far been positive.
There is a general acknowledgement that the repeal of the liner conference block exemption by the EU will not cause conflicts of law with third countries and that it is a process that responds to todayâs market conditions.
Overall, the Commission can take on board most of the amendments tabled.
This should, however, not be in the form of recitals to a legislative text.
I believe it should remain a clear and simple repeal of Regulation (EC) NoÂ 4056/86.
However, your recommendations will be reflected in follow-up measures.
These include the guidelines, as well as the information updates and the reassessment of other legislative texts such as Regulation (EC) NoÂ 954/79 on the accession to the UN Convention on the Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, to which the European Parliament has drawn the Commissionâs attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, the maritime sectorâs economic importance is considerable, and its growth potential enormous.
Precisely at a time when globalisation develops at an ever quicker pace, those global transport flows and the effective handling of them are of key importance.
European industry has an important and strong role to play in this.
It is a sector that is becoming highly competitive, and it is in actual fact the only sector that is still exempt from the application of the Treaty's rules of competition.
It is therefore high time we abolished this exemption.
Consequently, this House pledges its support for Commissioner McCreevyâs proposal to repeal the present RegulationÂ 4056/86.
Legal uncertainty about the interpretation of competition rules is, however, something we want to avoid, and I am pleased that the Commissioner recognises this, because the Commission will, not least in the future, need to continue to take into consideration the specific characteristics of this internationally operating sector.
That is why the rules should become clear in future.
That is also the reason why this House would like to see clear guidelines drafted for the sector before the regulation is withdrawn.
I am pleased that the Commissioner has expressed the intention of doing so before the end of 2007 with regard to liner shipping.
This House, though, since this criterion is an essential pillar in this proposal, believes that it should be explicitly mentioned in the legislative text.
The sector must be given guaranteed legal certainty about what is, and is not, permitted in the present regulation.
I am pleased to hear that you have entered into intensive debates with the sector.
This House would also ask you, though, and will also do so explicitly tomorrow, to consult it about the content of the guidelines.
Can you give your word that this House will be consulted on this matter?
This is, after all, often good practice in other areas too.
I am pleased to say that, by the looks of things, we will, by a large majority, be able to send this powerful message to the Commission.
This House sets great store by the fact that the Commission spells it out that other forms of cooperation, including the consortia block exemption, would continue to apply to this container liner shipping sector, because important operational agreements can be made in this respect, for example in terms of capacity.
Whilst that is a necessity for this sector, this should, of course, always be subject to ArticleÂ 81 of the Treaty.
It is vitally important to ensure that this cooperation should run smoothly.
With regard to cabotage and tramp services, the Commission suggests moving the enforcement of competition rules to European level.
That is a logical step because the Treaty already applies at that level.
Since this enforcement also belongs at European level, you can count on our support in this.
Some Members of this House have proposed exempting cabotage, but I will not be supporting that view.
Parliament would like to see guidelines drafted in the tramp sector too, because that sector, just like the other sectors, is also entitled to know where it stands.
According to Parliament, guidelines should therefore be known in that area too before this legislation enters into effect.
Clarity right from the start prevents all kinds of costly legal procedures which the sector can really do without.
There are already examples of such cases in the tramp sector with regard to pool agreements.
There have been complaints in that sector, and it is unclear to that sector how the Commission will go on from here.
So, once again, this lack of clarity should be mitigated by guidelines in that sector too.
The international dimension is, of course, vitally important to this internationally operating sector.
We would therefore ask you â and fortunately you are already aware of this â to be very mindful of this international competitive position when the proposals are fleshed out further.
That also applies to the repeal of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) code, and we look forward to receiving a report about those international developments so that we can follow them closely.
Once again, we will be pledging our support, but the conditions are tough as nails as far as this House is concerned.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time we have debated the issue we are debating this evening.
We have exchanged views with the European Commission within the framework of the White Paper, and in a resolution adopted by a large majority the European Parliament maintained that our merchant fleet, in the competitive and rapidly developing international environment, needs a clear framework for manoeuvre which must guarantee fair and healthy competition.
Our economy and development plan are based on competition.
However, it is up to us to predict the conditions and possible side effects and to create a suitable political framework.
That is why we called on small and medium-sized shipping enterprises not to throw away opportunities and not to sacrifice their interests and their business plans to mergers and to the behemoths being created in the industry, especially on regular lines.
We called for care to be taken to ensure that the market was not sent into shock by the European Commission's proposals and for gradual and creative adaptation to the new circumstances.
We want our concerns to be taken seriously by the European Commission in all cases.
My thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool, and to the Committee on Transport and Tourism, whose opinion proposes solutions to the matter which I hope will be voted through and accepted by the European Commission.
Allow me to reiterate the matters that concern us; they are the transitional period for proper adaptation to the new circumstances and clear guidelines.
I agree with the rapporteur that cabotage should not be exempted from free competition.
To close, I wish to highlight the lack of attention on the part of the European Commission to the international dimension of the matter, both as regards whether the UNCTAD code will apply and how the Member States will be able to change regime, and as regards the lack of detailed information on the dialogue with our partners China, Japan, Singapore and India, as regards their reaction to a possible change of regime.
I would point out by way of example that Singapore has already announced that it will continue to maintain the conference system.
This is therefore a point on which I expect a reply from the European Commission as to how the European Union will act.
Â Â  Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ Wortmann-Kool, for her work, both on my own behalf and on that of my friend MrÂ Savary, who was unable to be present to take part in this debate this evening and who has asked me to give you his apologies.
It is a balanced report, and while it does not include all the views expressed by my group, it is still acceptable, since it stresses the most important things.
It asks for the speedy publication of guidelines by the Commission so as to afford greater legal certainty to those providing international tramp and maritime cabotage services.
It also points out that exchanges of information are important and may be beneficial for the stability and efficiency of these sectors.
It brings useful detail and, lastly, gives particular importance to small operators.
As a member of this Parliamentâs Committee on Transport, I would nevertheless like to express a few regrets, stressing one point in particular.
Together with my colleagues MrÂ Savary and MrÂ Sifunakis, I tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis of the text on which Parliament is to vote tomorrow morning.
That amendment was rejected by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
As a result, it could not be submitted for the vote in plenary.
I deplore that.
Regulation (EEC) NoÂ 4056/86, which this regulation proposes to repeal, was adopted on a twofold legal basis: Articles 84 (transport policy) and 87 (competition) of the Treaty, now Articles 80 and 83.
The proposed repeal takes up only ArticleÂ 83 (competition).
That is a political choice with serious consequences.
It in fact determines the procedure applicable and limits the powers of Parliament, since the legal basis relating to competition alone involves a consultation procedure.
The legal basis relating to transport, on the other hand, would have resulted in a codecision procedure.
In my opinion, that would have been preferable.
While I think that competition may be stimulating and beneficial to the economy, I do not see it as a panacea and am not in favour of its blind and indiscriminate application to all sectors of the economy, with no regard to their specific nature or even the state they are in.
Sadly, the Commissionâs Directorate-General for Competition has sometimes given us the impression of defending that rather dogmatic outlook against all comers and especially against the opinion of other Commission services.
Although it is a consultative document, I hope that this report will at all events give the Commission a better picture of the concerns of operators who are not against the idea of reform, but who would like some guarantees and guidance regarding the changes with which they will be faced.
These are legitimate concerns, and all the more so because this sector is of fundamental importance for Europeâs future and its development.
Â Â  . â Mr President, within the framework of the European Union's common shipping policy, shipping conferences have been set up as a form of union of regular line shipping companies with a view to controlling the strategic and profitable sector of maritime transport.
These are similar in form but less advanced than the pools of chemical shipping companies which were set up later.
Shipping conferences regulate the lines of ships' round trips, the ports they put into, the number of ships available for each line and the freightage charged.
The argument that shipping conferences have supposedly brought about better and cheaper services for the workers is unsubstantiated.
Inflation, poverty, unemployment, poorer and more commercialised services are the harsh reality which workers have to put up with.
Shipping conferences were developed for the transportation of raw materials and in international trade in general, mainly between the northern European shore and shipping monopolies, and they secured huge, astronomical profits for euro-unifying capital.
Today, the same business groups are calling for shipping conferences to be abolished and the European Commission agrees with this.
The aim of the new legislative initiative is obviously to strengthen competitiveness, expand the insulting privileges of the euro-unifying monopolies engaged in maritime transport and allow them carte blanche to increase their profits.
Today, the concentration of capital in this specific sector has advanced to such a degree that basically a few companies, which can be counted on the fingers of one hand, control transport on regular lines.
Typically, one European container transport company operates 550 ships while, by contrast, a similar Asian company operates 112 ships.
To talk of competition under these circumstances is pure hypocrisy.
We do not agree that cabotage should come under competition rules, just as we do not agree with Regulation No 4050/86 or Regulation No 3577/92.
The reactionary institutional framework for shipping, the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union is strengthening the implacability and insatiable lust of shipowners for profit and is creating serious political and social problems in Greece, France, Finland and Ireland.
Of course, the Council and the European Commission, in collusion with employers, are pushing them towards the European Court of Justice.
The point is that they will have to face them because the workers are not prepared to sell out their rights.
Unequal pay for equal work, a heavier workload for maritime workers, the fact that ticket prices and freightage have gone through the roof, the reduction in schedule frequencies and the system of keeping overly old, under-maintained ships in coastal shipping are typical of domestic maritime transport.
The application of the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 has already struck a heavy blow to maritime transport and caused serious problems for workers, passengers and residents, especially in isolated island regions.
Maintaining the exemption of maritime transport conducted solely between ports of the same Member State from the application of the competition rules is of strategic importance to the economic development, social cohesion and national defence of these countries.
Consequently, it is vital to maintain the exemption provided for in ArticleÂ 32(b) of Regulation No 1/2003.
That is why we propose Amendments 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 in this direction.
In addition, the anti-grassroots Regulation No 3577/92 urgently needs to be abolished for coastal shipping.
Maritime transport is a social necessity which cannot be satisfied within the framework of an anti-grassroots competition policy.
Â Â  . Mr President, the Commission is very grateful for the hard work that has gone into the preparation of this report and for the excellent collaboration with our services.
I believe that we have worked towards an initiative that will have an echo in the years to come in other jurisdictions as well.
Liner shipping has been organised as a cartel, albeit legally, since the 1870s, not just in Europe but in most other industrial nations.
By taking the step of examining market conditions carefully, we have all come to acknowledge that liner shipping is a highly competitive industry that does not need to be protected against competition.
We are confident that our initiative will encourage our major trading partners to review whether their approach to this industry is correct and economically viable and, most importantly, our perseverance has convinced the industry that it does not need price-fixing.
It is now considering in earnest how it can best adapt to a very competitive environment, fuelled by globalisation.
Parliamentâs contribution to this process has been significant.
First, the Committee on Transport and Tourism produced an own-initiative report in December 2005, in response to the Commissionâs White Paper, drawing our attention to several issues we had not considered before.
We took those issues on board as we pursued our revision process.
Then the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs set out its views after extensive discussions with my services.
We are grateful for your work and the confidence you have shown in addressing these complex issues.
We will respond to your suggestions in the coming months in several initiatives, for instance through information updates on the situation regarding the application of competition rules for liner shipping in third countries, the Commission guidelines on the application of EU competition law to the maritime transport services and a reassessment of other legislative texts on the validity of which you have raised doubts.
We will consult widely and look forward to Parliamentâs views on the guidelines.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0196/2006) by MrÂ Alvaro, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds (COM(2005)0343 C6-0246/2005 2005/0138(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Alvaro, rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and Mr Bullmann, draftsman for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their outstanding efforts and readiness to reach an agreement on this technical and complex file.
The proposal for a regulation on payer information accompanying the transfer of funds is an important step towards our aim of cutting off terrorist funding.
It shows the EUâs determination to participate fully in the international efforts to combat terrorism.
Nobody can deny that combating terrorism is a key political priority worldwide today.
At European level, the commitment to combat all forms of terrorism is clear.
The EU plan of action on combating terrorism defines as a priority close cooperation with the Financial Action Task Force and the adaptation of the EU legislative framework to the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing adopted by this body.
The proposed regulation transposes into EU law Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force.
This recommendation requires that money transfers be accompanied by the identity of the sender with name, address and account number.
This regulation will facilitate the traceability of money transfers through a number of obligations.
These obligations apply to payment service providers, mainly banks, but also money remitters.
They will be obliged to send information on the payer throughout the payment chain and keep the corresponding records.
This information shall be available to the national authorities in order to assist them in their tasks.
It will help combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
The agreed deadline for the implementation of this special recommendation is 1 January 2007.
Non-coordinated action by Member States alone in the field of cross-border transfers of funds could have a significant negative impact on the smooth functioning of payment services at EU level. It would also damage the internal market in the field of financial services: hence the importance of respecting the deadline.
Parliament, the Council and the Commission have worked hard during the last year to reach an agreement on the text.
We all have done our best to find solutions to complex issues and I believe that we have been successful in doing so.
One of the main topics of discussion in our negotiations has been the issue of the EUR 1000 threshold, below which receiving banks in the EU would not be obliged to reject a transfer or to ask the sending bank to complete the information on the payer.
The Commission is pleased that this option has finally not been retained.
This idea has also been rejected by all Member States in the Council.
Terrorists can be financed by a series of small payments below the threshold.
I consider this a valid concern if we want to tackle terrorism effectively.
A solution has also been found with respect to the obligation of the receiving banks to stop dealings with foreign banks not sending the appropriate information, and on the obligation to send back low-value payments.
I have noted Parliamentâs concerns on these points.
The circumstances under which these obligations apply have been restricted considerably, making them a solution of last resort.
I am also happy to note that we have been successful in reaching agreement on technical issues, such as the use of systems with technical limitations by intermediaries receiving funds from outside the EU.
Now that an overall agreement on comitology has been reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the adoption of this regulation is an excellent opportunity to put into practice that agreement.
I am therefore appealing to the Members of this House not to insist on the inclusion of specific sunset clauses on the Commissionâs regulatory powers under this regulation.
All in all I think this proposal is ripe for adoption in a single reading and I hope it will receive support from all of you.
This regulation provides us with means to combat terrorist financing in a consistent manner throughout the European Union.
I look forward to hearing your comments.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have exercised the right to sit nearer the front so that you do not have to keep looking up to the back rows, and it might make the debates in this House more lively if we moved closer together.
After all, we want to ensure that we engage in proper parliamentary deliberation.
I do not think I need dwell any longer on this technical point.
Commissioner McCreevy explained very well what is essentially at stake here.
He pointed out that we have an international obligation to fulfil Special Recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force.
He has dealt with the technical details, and for that reason I need hardly reiterate these.
As he quite rightly said, we have achieved a balanced and reasonable compromise with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in collaboration with the Commission and the Council, a compromise which, as I see it and in the view of my committee, takes full account of the interests of data protection and data security as well as meeting the concerns of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
Nevertheless, in the case of such reports, even those that come from international bodies, we should ask ourselves far more frequently whether they actually achieve anything.
As this document has been on the table since last year and its existence has been common knowledge since some time around November 2005, I took the liberty of taking it with me on a trip to Israel, where I had talks with an expert at a university who specialises in the study of countermeasures to freeze the flow of funds to terrorists.
He used to be an agent and a lieutenant in the Israeli armed forces and had worked for Mossad.
He looked at this document and, to be perfectly honest, did not really see the value of it.
I can quite understand his reaction.
My own background is as follows: I have worked in a bank, and I have studied law.
I know that terrorist funding does not involve TerroristÂ A going into a high street bank, depositing his money and hoping that someone will draw it from a bank based in Damascus.
There are completely different ways of channelling funds to terrorists.
We are perhaps closing a window of opportunity, and we shall no doubt catch some small fry as a result â so much seems certain â but it is not the proper sharp instrument we need to combat terrorism.
I am honestly convinced of that.
I naturally believe it is right and reasonable to try to curb and dry up the flow of funding to terrorists.
That is an absolute must.
There might be other ways to achieve that goal.
The fact is, however, that instead of standing here I would probably be going up to receive the Nobel Prize if I knew exactly how to do it.
Things being as they are, I believe we have at least a good starting point here.
For all that, we have engaged in lengthy discussions.
We have spoken about this report with many different institutions, including the European Central Bank.
With regard to our talks with the ECB, it was hugely disappointing to learn from the press that the ECB had long been aware of the system for which we are now creating a legal basis and which has been publicised in the media and that the ECB knew what SWIFT was doing with the United States.
I am not trying to link two issues here, but it is surely obvious that what we are doing here is rubber-stamping a by creating a system after the event and putting it on a legal basis.
It would have been very helpful â and this is not addressed to the Commission, because the fault does not lie with it â if an institution like the ECB had said âWe know that such things are happening, and we want to cooperate with you to develop a sound legal basis on which to create provisions that protect the fundamental rights of our population, particularly in relation to the United Statesâ.
The United States is, of course, a transatlantic partner of ours.
I would never question that, particularly as a German.
Yet we are starting to think things over.
It is not only the recent disclosure of events in connection with SWIFT.
There was also the issue of storing aircraft passengersâ personal data, we suspected the existence of secret prisons, there were secret flights, and we had the discussion on data retention.
These things are steadily escalating.
For precisely this reason, I personally would have inserted a sunset clause â irrespective of the fact that this is an international instrument â so that we could check after five years whether the whole system had achieved anything, whether it had proved useful or whether we had created unnecessary legislation, for that cannot be our function as a parliament.
If I call in a painter, I want him to paint the wall properly when he comes.
I do not want him to come back twice more to paint some of the bits he has missed.
The public have exactly the same expectation of our legislative activity.
In this respect, I would like to see the sunset clause stay in place â and I am aware that there has been an agreement on committee procedure â so that we in Parliament have an obligation to review what we are actually doing.
Nevertheless, I shall hold discussions with my colleagues from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to determine our general approach to the subject of SWIFT in the context of transfers of funds.
At the end of the day, however, my thanks go to the Commission for cooperating in a spirit of mutual trust, and I would ask whether it might also exert some influence on the European Central Bank to encourage it to cooperate in the same spirit as the Commission itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the reservations expressed by the rapporteur, MrÂ Alvaro, were explained and discussed in detail by both of the committees to which this matter was referred.
What we have here is a small piece of legislation, namely the implementation of Special Recommendation VII, defining the information that should accompany money transfers.
Precisely because it is a small piece of legislation, though highly political and with the potential to intrude extensively into peopleâs private and business affairs, this Parliament has wisely and rightly decided to ask in earnest what needs regulation, what is worth regulating and what constitutes an appropriate response.
We did not simply bow to the fact that there was already a prior understanding between the Commission and the Council.
Both committees did their best to find proper answers.
This applies to the question of the threshold for incoming funds, which will remain traceable, while the threshold will prevent legal over-reaction against the participating banks on the issue of possible international threshold values.
It also applies to anonymous donations, which are made in several countries, such as Austria, the country of the outgoing Council presidency.
They are not to be prohibited if a Member State wants to keep that option open.
A threshold of EURÂ 500 has, however, been set, and larger anonymous donations are only permissible if they are made to absolutely organisations.
The same applies, moreover, to the technical matter of an intermediary bank involved in the transfer of funds.
Here too, we have come up with sound solutions.
In Member States where complete information cannot be transmitted for technical reasons, it will still be possible, acting jointly and with the consent of the bank of final destination, to hold intermediary banks accountable too.
Last but not least, it also applies to the question of outgoing payments from the European Union.
We did not make the mistake of creating too much red tape or imposing too many requirements; on the contrary, we made a conscious distinction between payments with the risk of a terrorist link and payments that might simply be made by migrant workers who have not the slightest connection with terrorism.
This distinction was important, because we support the Commission in its desire to extend the licensing system to the more informal providers of payment services that operate in grey areas and thus to bring them to the surface in order to obtain as much knowledge as possible, thereby avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy and ensuring that no undue restriction of civil rights occurs.
On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups for their excellent cooperation.
I believe the remaining problems can be resolved by the time of Thursdayâs vote, because the committee procedure, on which we were still at odds with the Council, actually relates to only a small section of the draft, namely the matter of an committee to which associated territories have to be admitted.
It does not concern the sensitive issue of thresholds or politically sensitive provisions.
Allow me to make one more point.
We are creating transparent legislation that is clearly understood by the people of Europe, reliable legal provisions, not unilateral declarations by individual states in this world that seek to induce private companies â even international organisations with cooperative property rights â to do things that may or may not be compatible with national law.
We are asking the same questions as the Belgian Government, and we will assist them in their search for answers to these questions, because those answers must be found.
For this very reason we should continue to legislate and build the foundations for international agreements on the basis of the rule of law and not give way to the law of the jungle.
Together with the rapporteur, we shall find suitable ways to pursue that approach.
Â Â  . Mr President, this regulation is one of a number of efforts by the European institutions to improve our effectiveness in combating terrorism and money laundering.
Analysis of terrorist attacks in Europe has shown that terrorist groups use various methods to collect funds for their activities.
One such method is the use of payment orders for varying amounts of money made both outside the European Union and within its borders.
This regulation will mean that money transfers will henceforth be subject to greater supervision, and banks will have to ensure that for each transfer of a prescribed amount of funds, all information relating to the payer is available.
Even if this results in a slight increase in the workload of the banks, this regulation should not be allowed to reduce the efficiency of payment transactions.
Although initially it appeared that this was one of many regulations â and may I mention in passing that there are around 60 regulations of this type aimed at combating terrorism â although this is one of a number of regulations that we initially thought would be rapidly completed, this has not yet happened.
A series of proposed amendments have emerged, and more often than not the subject of our discussions has been what level of funds should be subject to transfer supervision.
After a lengthy process of coordination with the rapporteur, the Commission and the Council, we finally have an agreed 15 proposed amendments supported by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
We also support the proposed amendments that relate to the so-called âreview clauseâ, and the fixing of a threshold for payment orders.
Towards the end of the discussions another question arose, namely the gathering of information by the US intelligence agency, the CIA, which would obtain data on bank transfers using the SWIFT code and the kind of consequences this might have for data protection.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party believe that this issue is not a subject of the regulation, and we do not therefore support a debate in the context of this report.
Moreover, although a large number of regulations, directives and so forth relating to the fight against terrorism have been produced since 2001, within our political group we believe that this regulation will make its own contribution towards the easier identification of financialÂ ...Â 
Â Â  . Mr President, the Member States of the European Union have committed themselves to implementing the Special Recommendation VII of the FATF concerning money transfers at a European level, with the aim of successfully preventing the funding of terrorist activities.
Therefore in order to ensure an exchange of information concerning the person making the transfer at each stage of the transfer process, we have to introduce a system which obliges the financial services suppliers to include specific and accurate information about the person making the transfer in the financial transfer documents.
We must fight terrorism and adopt measures to make the funding of terrorism impossible.
However, it is also important to make sure that the bodies responsible for combating money laundering or the funding of terrorism act in accordance with national criminal law and respect fundamental rights.
The five-year period proposed by the Commission for storing information deserves our support.
However, as far as the implementation of the regulation is concerned, some exceptions, such as those proposed by the rapporteur, have to be included.
Certain definitions must also be made more specific and more complete.
We must limit the use of stored and transmitted information to the defined scope of application in order to prevent general storage of information on citizens and to minimise the infringement of fundamental rights on the basis of this regulation.
We also have to prevent executive powers being used to introduce changes and the comitology procedure.
Changes in legislation which were subject to the codecision procedure should also take place within the framework of the codecision procedure.
The Member States should ensure the creation of lists of organisations in their countries to which the regulation applies and make sure that these lists are updated and always made accessible to an interested Member State.
Moreover, three years after the regulation enters into force, we should introduce a revision clause relating to money transfers and mobile payments as well as a sunset clause of five years after the regulation comes into force.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report on a very complex and important issue for the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a member of both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home, I have to say, wearing both hats, that I am starting to get really concerned.
From the perspective of civil liberties, I wonder where we are heading if we are going in for some sort of permanent and comprehensive monitoring of all citizens.
In that way, the whole principle of presumption of innocence goes straight out the window!
As a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am worried about the burden on industry.
I find it actually extraordinary that the Commissioner for the Internal Market should give an introduction that only covers the fight against terrorism, because we should actually also be discussing industry.
After all, commercial enterprises that simply go about their commercial activities, are increasingly burdened with the collection of data for police and judicial purposes.
I would, by way of example, also draw your attention to the Directive on data storage and passenger name records.
The effectiveness of all those measures is questionable.
We appear to have some kind of blind faith in technology and that, as long as we collate as much data as possible on members of the public, we are bound to pick out a terrorist sooner or later.
A recent report in the United States, however, makes an equally strong case for the fact that in reality, terrorists do not use standing orders to collect their criminal funds, but use all kinds of different channels for this.
If we adopt measures of this kind, then I wonder in all honesty whether we may well force those money flows underground.
I hope in any case that we have made the proposal somewhat more workable for the enterprises that have to use it.
I am, for example, pleased that the clauses about the EUR 1Â 000 and USD 1Â 000 thresholds are included.
I would question whether the EUR 150 threshold for donations to charity organisations is not rather low after all.
In this context, I would once again like to stress the importance of what we call purpose limitation, namely that those data are only used for the purpose for which they are collected.
Finally, I should like to add my voice to those who have already expressed their concern in no uncertain terms about the âSwiftâ scandal that has recently come to light, and I think it is really high time for a much more fundamental debate on how we here in Europe want to fight terrorism effectively without affecting fundamental rights.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, the European Union has already taken a host of measures in connection with the war on terrorism.
One of the most effective measures needs further improvement, and that is why we are now looking at this means of checking the flow of funds.
In the war on terrorism we must not only assist the competent authorities in combating money laundering but must also go further by enacting measures to improve the surveillance of electronic payment transactions where these are being used to finance terrorism.
For this reason, the authorities must be able to trace electronic payment transactions from start to finish.
We do, however, need a practical solution, in other words a solution that helps the authorities without making unreasonable demands on providers of payment services.
In the tabled proposals we have struck a decent balance between these requirements.
One of the problems is posed by donations.
My own country of Austria is one of those in the spotlight here.
We know that the donation system is being abused to finance terrorism.
On the other hand, we cannot stop donations being made to charitable organisations or for academic or research purposes.
This is why I am in favour of these practicable proposals being implemented for non-profit organisations, including those engaged in educational and scientific activities.
I also welcome the practicable solution of the reduced thresholds. This is another advance that came out of the negotiations.
In general terms, I am convinced that this will give us a small but important additional instrument to cut off terrorist funding and to raise security standards in the European Union still higher.
Â Â  Mr President, the proposed regulation is yet another piece of legislation which harms, that is to say limits, fundamental rights.
The previous regulations dealt with population records, the introduction of microchips and so on.
This measure aims to limit financial freedom.
It continues the measures started in 1978 by OLAF (then called UKLAF) to combat large-scale tax fraud that damaged Community finances, a practice closely linked to organised crime.
How is the proposed regulation supposed to prevent money laundering and the funding of terrorism?
By monitoring the billions of transactions our citizens make and storing them for a five-year period?
I am sure it cannot do that!
It is good that both the rapporteur and those bodies providing their opinions, namely the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the European Economic and Social Committee and the European Central Bank, have pointed out the serious flaws in the proposed regulation.
To conclude, let us read it over once again and avoid creating a regulation that benefits the financial and secret services.
Let us hope that we can avoid becoming their collaborators or victims in the future, something that is happening in Poland today.
Â Â  . Mr President, for the record I wish to confirm that the Commission accepts all amendments that reflect the agreement allowing the adoption of this proposal in a single reading.
I have arranged for a list of the Commissionâs position on all amendments to be handed to the secretariat for inclusion in the record(1).
Some Members raised subjects this evening that are reflected in amendments that the Commission is not in a position to accept and these relate to the following.
A threshold of 1000 euros or dollars for incoming transfers would deprive authorities in charge of fighting money laundering and terrorist financing of an effective means to do their job.
Below the threshold, information on the payers would not have to be collected or recorded.
The risk is that these funds could be used for financing new terrorist attacks.
Terrorist acts can be organised with little money.
It has been estimated that the cost of the Madrid attacks only amounted to about EUR 8000 and any threshold for incoming transfers can easily be abused by dividing the amount to be transferred into several payments below the threshold.
The general sunset clause that would limit the applicability of this regulation in time: this was not accepted by the Council either.
Such a clause could be useful in certain cases in the context of better regulation, but the Commission does not see added value in including this general clause in this regulation.
Inserting this clause would mean that users and providers of payment services would be deprived of the necessary legal certainty.
A comprehensive review clause is no doubt better suited for this regulation.
If it turns out in the light of the review that changes are needed, the Commission will set them in motion and I therefore appeal to the House to accept this sensible solution.
The comitology procedure under the provisions of this regulation covers a special procedure of authorisation by the Commission for Member States to conclude bilateral agreements with territories or countries outside the Community.
Member States authorised to include such agreements will benefit from derogations from the obligations under the regulation.
Such waivers will allow Member States to treat transfers of funds between that country or territory and the Member State concerned as transfers of funds within the Member State.
Amendment 103 limits in time, until 1 April 2008, the possibility for the Commission to grant such authorisations.
Imposing such a sunset clause is clearly not in line with the recent agreement on the revised comitology procedure.
As part of this deal both the Council and Parliament agreed not to limit in time the powers granted to the Commission.
For the same reasons, Amendments 20, 22 and 24 are not acceptable either.
Some of you have raised the SWIFT crisis widely reported in the media during the last few weeks.
You are aware that the issue is on Parliamentâs agenda later this week and my colleague Mr Frattini will make a declaration on behalf of the Commission.
We will make sure that we have all the facts of this case before taking any decision on further action.
As far as this regulation is concerned, the Commission considers that it contains the appropriate standards on data protection and access by the competent authorities to such data.
Your rapporteur had the foresight to submit the proposal to the European Data Protection Supervisor, who gave a positive assessment.
No problems were detected on data protection issues.
Let me stress once more that non-compliance by 1Â January 2007 with the agreed international standards to ensure an effective fight against the financing of terrorism will not only send a negative message to the financial community on Europeâs commitment to fight terrorism. Non-compliance would also have significant economic consequences due to disruption of money flows from and to the European Union.
The Commission has been ready to take the concerns on board.
The compromise found is a good one.
It will make Europe a safer place and show that Europe lives up to its responsibilities in the world.
I count on your support in bringing this dossier to a successful conclusion now at first reading, thus avoiding lengthy discussions and probably less satisfactory results at second reading.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Annex â Position of the Commission
The Commission can accept the following amendments in full: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 80, 86, 90, 91, 94, 96, 98, 99, 101, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 119, 121, as well as amendments 126 to 140, both inclusive.
The Commission is not in a position to accept any of the other amendments.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Szejna on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on recent developments and prospects in relation to company law [2006/2051(INI)] (A6-0229/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, this own-initiative report on recent activities and prospects concerning company law aims to react to steps taken by the Commission, as well as to work out a strategic plan for Parliament concerning further actions in the field of company law.
Significant progress has been made in implementing the 2003 Action Plan.
However, further action is needed aimed at achieving the targets set out in the amended Lisbon Strategy, at committing ourselves to increasing growth and employment, at strengthening and increasing competitiveness in industry and improving conditions for entrepreneurship, and at supporting the âSocial Europeâ project.
The European Parliament calls on the Commission to guarantee that the steps taken to modernise company law and corporate governance are, and will be, in line with legislation in related sectors.
It also emphasises the importance of taking into account the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the principle of entrepreneurial freedom.
Parliament calls on the Commission to make a decision concerning further measures aimed at developing company law, and in doing so to consider the European social model, especially the involvement of employees.
Better regulation and simplification of legislation are very important in order to increase cohesion and clarity of Community legislation, especially in the field of company law.
However, this should not be the only aim.
First of all, we should define the areas where further initiatives are necessary at a European Union level in order to achieve the previously mentioned goals.
We should investigate whether there is a need to consolidate the whole of company law in a single legal document or whether the first stage of the consolidation process should only cover certain areas.
The Commissionâs decision to withdraw some draft legislation, in fields where it should already have noted the interest expressed by the companies concerned, cannot be justified by the need for better legislation.
The European Parliament should be constantly involved in drawing up, defining and adopting measures aimed at simplifying legislation.
The European framework for corporate governance should create the appropriate institutional conditions to support long-term viability for companies and employment prospects, define mechanisms preventing bad management and guarantee transparency and responsibility in terms of investments and revenue.
We should also not forget that workers represent human capital for a company.
Employees are not only important in terms of contracts, but are also investors and European Union citizens.
Employees should be viewed in the same way as shareholders, as people involved in the company in the sense that they also bear a risk related to decisions made concerning the company.
The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in future draft legislation and revisions of existing legislation and to remember that they create jobs and are a motor for economic growth.
In the field of company law, the European Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Commission concerning the Parliament and Council Directive on the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies having their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market.
The European Parliament also welcomes agreements relating to matters including the proposal on the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive as regards the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital and the proposal relating to the Parliament and Council Directive amending the Directive on the annual accounts of certain types of companies and on consolidated financial reports.
The European Parliament should always take part in the debate on setting further priorities in the field of company law and corporate governance.
This means, amongst other things, that Parliament should be regularly informed about expert group discussions.
In the field of company law, Parliament expects the Commission firstly to guarantee companies a choice of different management systems, including the chance to choose between a monoist and dualist system without the need to adopt legislation defining the rights and obligations of the companyâs management.
Secondly, Parliament expects the Commission to analyse the opportunities for amending the principles of the European Company Statute concerning the creation of such companies, with the aim of simplifying them and adapting them to the requirements of the market.
Thirdly, it expects the Commission to put forward a proposal on the European Private Company to fulfil the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.
The European Parliament deplores the fact that the Commission has already taken a decision to withdraw two proposals: the proposal for a regulation on the European Association Statute and the proposal for a regulation on the European Mutual Company Statute, as well as two proposals for directives complementing these statutes with respect to the participation of workers.
We note, however, that in the Commissionâs 2003 Action Plan, the Commission announced its intention to provide active support for the legislative process in relation to these statutes.
We call on the Commission to draw up new legislation on the European Mutual Company Statute and on the European Association Statute.
The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to present, in the near future, a proposal concerning the Fourteenth Directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered offices of limited liability companies.
The European Parliament expects the Commission, if appropriate, only to put forward draft legislation concerning the principle of âone share, one voteâ following the revision of the Parliament and Council Directive on takeover bids.
Finally, I would like to thank the draftsman of an opinion, MrÂ Lehne, whose excellent comments increased the value of this report.
Â Â  . Mr President, I warmly welcome Mr Szejnaâs report and todayâs discussion on the recent developments in and prospects for company law.
This report is timely, as we have just finalised our consultation on future priorities for the Action Plan on Company Law and Corporate Governance.
Our detailed report on that consultation will be available on the Internet shortly.
Let me thank Mr Szejna and his colleagues in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Mr Lehne and colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the efforts they have put into this piece of work.
Our consultation has been successful.
We received more than 250 replies and around 300 people actively participated in our public hearing on 3 May.
The views expressed in the replies to the public consultation were confirmed at the hearing.
What are the main lessons of the consultation?
Firstly, there was overwhelming support among stakeholders for the application of the âBetter Regulationâ principles.
Respondents praised the consultation exercise.
They supported the commitment to the strict application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.
They also welcomed the Commissionâs commitment to undertake systematic regulatory impact assessments before any potential legislative initiative.
A majority of respondents supported the objective of simplification.
However, most stakeholders considered a recasting exercise inappropriate.
Stakeholders do not want us to take the risk of opening a Pandoraâs box.
A codification or consolidation exercise would seem to be the most appropriate.
Secondly, as regards the continued relevance of the Action Plan, and in particular the measures proposed, respondents generally supported the work done since 2003.
However, opinions were split on the details of the measures proposed for the medium and long term.
A number of respondents expressed âregulatory fatigueâ.
However the general opinion was that work should continue on enabling legislation that would enhance the mobility of companies in the European Union or facilitate company restructuring.
The vast majority of respondents called for the adoption of a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices.
A large number of respondents also called on the Commission to table a proposal for a European Private Company Statute.
In addition, a large number of stakeholders wanted to see more focus on small firms.
Thirdly, when it came to the detail of the measures proposed in the Action Plan in the field of corporate governance, views were split.
There was general support for exploring certain issues at EU level, for example the issue of âone share, one voteâ, at least by carrying out a fact-finding study, or the rights of shareholders.
Views were more qualified on the disclosure of institutional investorsâ voting policies.
There was clear opposition to the adoption of an EU wrongful trading rule, as well as to potential harmonisation of the legislation on directorsâ disqualification.
Parliamentâs report provides the Commission with very useful input for the development of a strategic perspective for further action.
You underscore the trends observed during the consultation exercise on the need to have more regard to the needs of small firms, the call for a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer of registered offices and the opposition to the adoption of a European initiative in the field of wrongful trading rules.
It is too early at this stage for us to respond in detail to all the issues raised in this exercise.
I have heard the views expressed.
On the basis of the outcome of the consultation and of the report discussed today, we intend soon to publish a statement in which we will indicate our priorities for the near future.
Our views are mostly convergent.
I welcome that.
The Commission and Parliament must work hand in hand if we want to develop a regulatory framework that makes a difference in strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by expressing my special thanks to MrÂ Szenja, the rapporteur in the lead committee, for our close and fruitful cooperation.
This is an extremely significant report, because it makes clear from the parliamentary perspective the priorities we still wish to pursue in implementing the rump of the old action plan on company law in this legislative term and shows how far we intend to push the Commission to present concrete proposals in the course of the present term.
In the policy debate, I was not surprised to see that there was broad agreement, not only between the large political groups but among the smaller groups too, on the substance of the reports, which were adopted by large majorities in both the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, subsequently, in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
In the view of my group, this is also a compelling reason for us to reject all the amendments that have been tabled in the intervening period for the reading in plenary.
The report is good as it stands and should not be watered down by amendments that may also scupper previous compromises.
This is why we in the PPE-DE Group cannot support the amendments that are now on the table.
Allow me to add a comment on the subject of âone share, one voteâ.
There were differences on this point, not only in the debate within the Committee on Economic Affairs but also in the Committee on Legal Affairs.
At the time when we negotiated the Takeover Directive, we became aware of these differences.
Even then, we managed to find a reasonable consensus.
The consensus view is quite simply that we should wait first of all for any studies that have been commissioned and then wait for the evaluation of the Takeover Directive in 2012/2013.
At the end of the next legislative term, a decision can be taken as to whether further proposals need to be made.
This is a good example of a sound compromise.
In conclusion let me reiterate my thanks to everyone involved.
This is a good report that merits a large parliamentary majority.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo MrÂ Lehneâs words of thanks to the rapporteur.
The report, which does not really fit into the series of diverse reports on company law that have previously been adopted in this House, especially as it enjoys a sort of special status through having been drafted on the initiative of a parliamentary committee, helps to fill a genuine gap, and the Commission should now fill that gap completely in the coming years with initiatives of its own.
We eagerly await the Commissionerâs statement on the next steps in the realm of company law, because, as we all know, European company law is an important element of the single European market and an important instrument for the continuing integration of companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
This means that the policy we are pursuing here is one which directly creates jobs.
Jobs can only be created in really large numbers if SMEs receive special support.
And SMEs can derive particular benefit from this form of company law because it lowers their consultancy costs and because a harmonised legal form would make it easier to start up a business, which we also want to encourage on a cross-border basis â as you said, Commissioner â by improving mobility.
For this reason, I believe it is right that the Commission should take initiatives to simplify the creation of European private companies in future.
There is already MrÂ Lehneâs project, of course, to have Parliament foster the Commissionâs activities by means of a motion for a legislative resolution.
I also welcome the fact that the proposal to introduce a European private company, which was contained in the action plan back in 2003, is now to be resurrected.
The amendments contained in this report, which focus especially on accounting standards, are extremely important in my opinion, and I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to give these amendments due consideration.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like first of all to thank and congratulate Parliamentâs rapporteur.
In this field, Commissioner, you are really in quite a paradoxical situation.
Since May 2003 you have had an action plan that would enable you to influence this debate, which is taking place in all the Member States.
The reality is, however, that the speed at which the Commission works is such that, during that time, each Member State has been preparing for European negotiations.
So rather than initiate a European process on subjects that are new, you allow the Member States time to adopt their own proposals, which then makes the development of European governance more complicated.
Especially since it is a subject where the transatlantic dimension must not be underestimated and Europe would be better prepared if it were more advanced in the development of that European governance.
I am a little surprised at my colleague MrÂ Lehneâs reaction to the amendments that have been proposed â but he is not listening to me, so I shall have to go and tell him afterwards â when he says that adopting such and such an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament would dilute this report a little more.
I believe adding one or two useful references for corporate governance to the draft resolutionâs 47 paragraphs deserves to be reconsidered.
So far as the double voting right is concerned, I for my part believe that the balance we found in the takeover bids directive was satisfactory.
Unlike the Commissioner, I do not propose reopening that debate, especially since the question is not whether one national model or another is reprehensible but rather how a body of citizen shareholders can be put in place that will get us away from the volatile and stateless nature of todayâs shareholder in the largest quoted undertakings.
We should be encouraging long-term shareholding, employee shareholding and transparency of directorsâ pay.
That is where your energies should be directed, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, I was very pleased to learn that work on updating company law and on the strengthening of corporate governance in the European Union was to continue.
In my work as a lawyer, I have frequently encountered problems resulting from the failure to adapt company law and corporate governance to reality.
I think that the Lisbon Strategy guidelines have contributed significantly to the progress made in work on this subject.
We cannot underplay the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the best motor for economies.
It is therefore comforting to see that the Commission has also noticed the need to create the best possible environment for precisely this kind of activity.
We need to pay particular attention to an appropriate analysis of these environments.
All barriers, including administrative ones, should be removed as soon as possible.
I agree that the report we are debating should set out a plan for further action by the European Parliament concerning activities in the field of company law.
There were no particular difficulties involved in implementing the 2003 Action Plan.
Its main aims, such as increasing the effectiveness or competitiveness of companies and strengthening the rights of shareholders, are still relevant today.
However, we must take further action aimed at achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, namely by showing our commitment to increasing employment, increasing competitiveness in industry and improving the conditions for entrepreneurship as well as, and this is particularly important, our commitment to supporting what is known as âSocial Europeâ.
The Commission should not delay in presenting a Fourteenth Company Law Directive on the transfer abroad of registered offices of limited liability companies.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, most people support better and simpler legislation and measures to prevent abuse.
Transparency and public scrutiny are often good tools for achieving these things.
Politicians often have a tendency to believe that companies are public institutions owned by themselves, but that is not the case.
Companies are property, and they belong to their owners, not to politicians.
Ownership is the very basis of the market economy.
Do not allow market forces to be eliminated.
If the ground rules are changed, businesses suffer, as does everyone.
Businesses need fixed, long-term ground rules.
My concern regarding the matter on todayâs agenda relates to the rules governing voting rights.
The Member States have different models for taking care of companiesâ interest in developing their business, which is to say entrepreneursâ interests.
Sweden has a model guaranteed in the compromise we reached in April 2004.
I should appreciate it if MrÂ Lehne too listened to what is being said.
I am therefore less delighted about the external study that is to review the rules governing voting rights because experience shows that such studies have a tendency to be rather one-sided.
The fact that objectivity has been included among the demands made of the working party does in fact indicate a lack of confidence right from the start.
There can be no guarantee of objectivity.
It would therefore be appropriate to have representatives of the Nordic system in this working party so that any kind of result that is finally produced might inspire confidence in the people of the Nordic countries.
This is a matter to which I should like MrÂ Lehne to pay a bit of attention.
It is true that this is an own-initiative report, but it should not be used in such a way as to block development after 2012.
If large countries retain their cross-ownership and their rules on voting rights, small countries should be able to do so too.
We have a deal, and it must be honoured.
There is nothing to say that it must be abandoned in 2012.
Instead, it can be renewed. Pacta sunt servanda.
Â Â  Mr President, I, too, should like to congratulate MrÂ Szejna on his report.
In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group could have quite happily added a whole load of things, but we whittled them down to a few points only, namely those also indicated by MrÂ Lehne, whom I should like to thank for his willingness to compromise.
Like MrsÂ BerÃšs, though, I think that what we have added to the amendments for the plenary is not in conflict with that compromise.
I shall return to this point in isolation later.
In his report, MrÂ Szejna has opted for a wide approach, which appeals to me.
Unlike MrsÂ CederschiÃ¶ld, I think it important â and that was also subject of the debate that was held earlier this evening â that enterprises should not simply be the property of shareholders.
Shareholders have shares, but enterprises are more than simply a piece of paper or an investment object.
Enterprises function in the real economy where interests other than those of shareholders are at play.
That is why I should particularly like to stress recital F and general point 3, the section concerning employee participation in corporate decision-making and the thesis that is expressed in this report that this should also form an integral part of corporate governance and of company law.
I hope that MrÂ McCreevy can agree with Parliament on this and can ensure that this will also play an important part in future dossiers.
In the light of the fact that it is of major importance that this cannot be circumvented by, for example, the European company and a change of office, we have tabled a number of amendments to that effect.
I hope that MrÂ Lehne will revisit this issue â even though he does not seem to be listening at the moment â to see if he can support those.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to acknowledge a number of salient points in the report.
Among them, the explicit recognition of a European social model, notwithstanding the various national approaches to company law; and the connection between company law and corporate governance, on the one hand, and social policy, including by means of corporate social responsibility, on the other.
The European Parliament is making the relationship with stakeholders a priority, thus rooting companiesâ social responsibility in processes of corporate governance and is therefore taking advantage of the most genuine opportunity in this regard.
I would also mention the explicit recognition of the need for directors to have a relationship of dependency and for transparency with regard to remuneration as well, together with the guaranteed rights of workers and their representatives to participate in company decision-making.
I would reaffirm the need to provide for the possibility of coordinating with the financial markets, so as to take due account of developments in the real economy, and I hope that these suggestions will be adequately and correctly implemented in national law as soon as possible.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Members for their comments and observations.
We had the opportunity to cover some of the ground two weeks ago when I met the Committee on Legal Affairs to discuss the annual policy strategy.
Let me repeat that I welcome the report as Parliamentâs contribution to setting priorities and developing a strategic perspective for further action.
As I said, we shall shortly be publicising how we will carry forward the priorities identified.
Some issues were raised and I note in particular the difference of opinion on a number of areas, for example as regards âone share, one voteâ.
I am very conscious of the debate that took place on this matter before I became a Commissioner, and Mr Lehneâs advice that we should await the publication of the study is probably best.
Looking back over what has been said here and the great debate that has taken place previously on this issue, I think this has emphasised that throughout Europe there are different cultures and a different ethos regarding both company law and corporate governance.
That is a fact that we should all bear in mind, as I will certainly do in whatever I recommend in this particular area.
I think that was also brought home by what other speakers said, such as Mrs BerÃšs, who spoke of moving towards a certain degree of European harmonisation in some of these areas.
It would be very difficult to harmonise company law measures in the European Union because of the different cultures and traditions and the different ways that have developed in many of the Member States.
The situation is not the same in every Member State, and I shall certainly be taking that into account in whatever proposals I bring forward and in whatever I decide is the best and most effective way to do things on a Europe-wide basis.
It is important to remember the different areas of conflict that we have had in the past and I certainly will take them into account too in whatever recommendations I bring forward.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0201/2006) by Caroline Lucas on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on reducing the climate change impact of aviation [2005/2249(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I warmly welcome the Commissionâs communication on reducing the climate impact of aviation and that my report strongly supports the Commissionâs position that a comprehensive package of measures is needed to address the full impact of aviation on the climate.
I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for their good work and collaboration.
The starting point for my report is that while aviation has brought a great many benefits to society, its current growth rate is completely unsustainable.
Between 1990 and 2003, the EUâs international aviation emissions increased by 73%, corresponding to an annual growth of over 4%.
At this rate the increased emissions from aviation will neutralise more than a quarter of the reductions required by the EUâs Kyoto target by 2012.
Moreover, crucially, aviationâs total impact on the climate is estimated to be two to four times the CO2 impact, even without considering the potential effects of cirrus cloud enhancement.
Of course, the industryâs efforts to reduce its emissions are welcome.
However, as Eurocontrol predicts, EU air traffic movements are set to more than double by 2020 compared to 2003.
It is clear that rates of technological improvements â which historically run at about 1-2% per year â will be insufficient to offset this enormous growth.
It is clear then that action is urgently needed.
International aviation is not subject to Kyoto or other commitments.
Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol urges states to pursue reduction of greenhouse gases from this source through the International Civil Aviation Organization, but there are currently no plans for a global solution here.
That makes it vital that the EU shows leadership and exploits the advantages of laying down an example with early regional action.
Council Conclusions of December 2005 reaffirm this, calling for âspecific action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation if no such action is agreed within the ICAO by 2002â.
I therefore welcome the communicationâs recognition that we need this comprehensive package of measures, including regulatory, economic, technological and operational instruments.
In particular, its plan to pursue the introduction of kerosene taxes is very important, given the existing imbalance between the treatment of aviation and other modes of transport.
This should begin right away with a tax on all domestic and intra-EU flights â with the possibility of exemption for all carriers on routes where non-EU carriers operate.
The ongoing renegotiations of air service agreements must continue so that third-country carriers can gradually be taxed on an equal basis with EU carriers.
Ending the VAT exemption would further level the playing field, and bring fiscal as well as environmental benefits.
Colleagues will see that I have brought back an amendment to seek to achieve this.
Improvements in air traffic management could reduce average fuel burn by between 8% and 18%, with resultant decreases in all engine emissions.
All of these measures are necessary, but the main focus of the Commissionâs proposals and therefore of my report is on emissions trading.
I agree that it has the potential to play a role, but only provided any scheme is properly designed.
First, it is clear that other policy instruments must be introduced alongside an emissions trading system to address the full climatic impact.
Instruments directly linked to the impact in question, such as a NOx charge, would be most likely to induce the most efficient behaviour, although multipliers on CO2 emissions are an interim alternative.
This is crucial, because if there is not a parallel emissions charge or multiplier formula to cover aviationâs non-CO2 impacts, the effect of buying the right to emit a tonne of CO2 from another sector with much lower non-CO2 impacts would actually be a net disbenefit to the environment.
Second, and crucially, a separate closed system for aviation is crucial at the very least as a pilot scheme because, apart from the administrative difficulties of including aviation in the EUâs general ETS, many sectors already in that scheme are concerned about the possible effect of aviationâs inclusion on carbon prices, noting that as a sheltered sector, aviation will be able tolerate higher prices than many others.
There is a very real risk that excessive pressure on vulnerable, energy-intensive industries could lead to a loosening of the overall cap.
It would also be impractical for aviation to join the general ETS before 2012.
I do not think we can afford to wait another six years before we act, so good use could be made of the period 2008-2012 by running at least a pilot scheme.
Any arrangement by which aviation was ultimately incorporated into a wider ETS would also need a cap on the number of emission rights the aviation sector could buy from the market to ensure that aviation itself begins to make some of these cuts.
Finally, if colleagues are in any doubt about the importance of a separate scheme, they should consider the words of a chief economist of British Airways, who admitted last week that if airlines joined the existing emissions trading system their emissions would simply continue to grow at an alarming rate: they would simply buy up the right to emit as ever, their own emissions would not go down, and we would still see aviation having a massive accountability for the climate crisis.
Therefore, I urge colleagues to vote for this report, which will send a very clear signal to the Commission and to the Council that Parliament is looking for ambitious but realistic proposals in this field.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Lucas and thank her for her report.
I should also like to thank the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for unanimously adopting the relevant report and the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism and its opinion draftsman, MrsÂ Hennis-Plasschaert, for agreeing to include aviation in the European Union greenhouse gas trading system.
The aviation sector contributes approximately 3% to the production of carbon dioxide in the European Union, but this rate is increasing rapidly.
As MrsÂ Lucas said earlier, in a few years' time, by 2012, it will have increased by 150% in comparison with 1990, which is approximately just under 5% per annum.

This rate of increase in carbon dioxide is, of course, helping to exacerbate the greenhouse effect and it should be noted that it is not only carbon dioxide which aircraft emit; there are other side effects, such as emissions which help to create other greenhouse gases and, as such, the contribution of aviation to the greenhouse effect is much greater than the 3% reported for carbon dioxide.
As MrsÂ Lucas also said, the Kyoto Protocol does not extend to limiting emissions of carbon dioxide by aircraft, although there is, of course, a reference in ArticleÂ 2, paragraph 2.
This is precisely why the European Commission will continue its present efforts and step up its efforts in future in order to include aviation and maritime transport in any system agreed for post- 2012.
However, this period is still several years away and, that being so, the gas trading system now needs, following the European Parliament and Council codecision procedure, to include gases so that we can limit and aviation can help to limit the greenhouse effect and so that this sector does not end up at an advantage compared with the other sectors which help to limit the greenhouse effect.
In other words, we do not want the other sectors to fare worse than aviation.
That is why it is particularly encouraging both that the relevant reports have been submitted by the parliamentary committees and also that the Council of Ministers for the Environment of the European Union and the Heads of State or Government of the European Union also agreed at the European Council last December to include aviation in the trading system and called on the European Commission to table the relevant legislation under the codecision procedure.
I should like to make three comments on the points made by the Committee on the Environment and the points raised earlier by MrsÂ Lucas:
First of all, would it be better to have a closed or open system for aviation?
The European Parliament committee report wants a closed system, a separate system for aviation, either as a permanent system or in a pilot stage up to 2012.
The Commission has taken a different approach: it considers that the broader the scope of the trading system, the less it will cost to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and, as a result, aviation will have lower costs without reducing the benefit to the environment.
Similarly, I should like to follow on from MrsÂ Lucas's thoughts on a tax on kerosene, the fuel used for aircraft.
It is a fact, as you said earlier, that there are bilateral agreements which basically exempt aviation from payment of tax.
Of course, the European Commission has been passing Community legislation since 2003 allowing the Member States to tax fuel on their domestic flights and, following agreement with another country, to allow tax on flights between the two countries.
The Commission is continuing and will continue its efforts towards third countries, in accordance with what you too said earlier, in order to abolish this tax exemption for kerosene, which clearly does not have positive environmental results.
Furthermore, I should like to make a comment about the geographical scope of the trading system: the Commission has proposed including all flights from airports in the European Union and the parliamentary committee has proposed including all flights to or from airports in the European Union and flights which cross the airspace of the European Union.
We consider that the Commission's approach is simpler and more effective and could make it easier to extend the system to other countries.
Without doubt, however, as Parliament and as the airlines themselves and non-governmental organisations have proposed including all flights to and from airports in the European Union, the Commission will examine this approach during the course of the detailed study of the impact this will have before submitting its proposal during the codecision procedure which we hope to have before the end of the current year.
Finally, I should like to say that, without doubt, in addition to including aviation in the trading system, there are other measures, such as those you mention: improvement of air traffic, investment in research, so that more environmentally-friendly technologies can be developed, improved and used, the possible use of biofuels in airlines â although this last option is still at the research stage â and a series of other measures which can be applied in parallel in order to mitigate the impact of aviation on climate change.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Dimas for the realistic contribution he made a moment ago.
I very much endorse the remarks he addressed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
Indeed, in a communication by the Commission, different options are being examined and a more consistent application of energy levies is also briefly looked at.
At the same time, the Commission recognises that this latter cannot be seen as a cornerstone of a strategy for fighting climate change effectively.
In the end, the Commission concluded in its communication that market-based instruments are by far the most effective.
It settled on the trade in emission rights, and that is a conclusion I fully endorse. It is environmentally effective and economically efficient.
In recent months, as is still the case today, a great deal of hard work has gone into further fleshing out this initiative, including its scope, and I have tried, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to draft a realistic opinion.
The goal is, after all, to develop at the earliest opportunity a model that is as workable as possible and that can be extended worldwide.
Despite all the appreciation I have for MrsÂ Lucas herself, my amazement was nevertheless considerable when I read the final version of her report which is totally devoid of any realism or workable solutions.
The resolution has been decorated with the proverbial Christmas baubles. One such Christmas bauble is, for example, the C02 multiplier, while the CE study shows that including non-C02 effects is very difficult to measure.
Also, it harps on endlessly about kerosene tax as being the panacea for all environmental problems and much more.
With all due respect, while a tax of this kind is good for the coffers, its environmental effectiveness has not been proven in any way.
Do not get me wrong, I too would prefer to see all transport modalities treated the same way, but I would urge you to take all aspects into consideration, including, for example, the way in which the infrastructure is financed.
Moreover, this discussion takes the attention away from what this is really about, namely a swift integration of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), and as Commissioner Dimas was right to point out a moment ago, a directive that allows Member States to apply fuel tax to domestic flights is already in force, something which only the Netherlands has taken up so far.
I would therefore ask you to shift your attention to this.
I have taken the liberty of applying for a list of separate votes and votes in sections, in the hope of removing all Christmas baubles from the resolution.
Should this prove impossible during the vote, then I will ask for my name to be removed from this resolution.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their work.
The adverse effects of air transport on the climate are considerable, and are rapidly becoming more acute.
For this reason, the Commission must lose no time in presenting us with legislative proposals on how to remedy this problem.
We cannot use the argument that air transport makes up only a small percentage of total global emissions.
We keep hearing this in debates on climate: that the individual emitter is only ever responsible for a proportion of the emissions.
If each individual emitter talks his way out of it by arguing that he is only responsible for a small proportion, however, we shall never see an active fight against climate change.
In addition, the EU already imposes very heavy taxes, charges and environmental requirements on other modes of transport such as buses, railways and even cars.
Operators of bus or railway enterprises, for example, cannot see why we are imposing heavy charges on them â relatively environmentally friendly modes of transport â yet have thus far imposed such small charges on the relatively environmentally unfriendly aeroplane.
This distorts competition not only between the various modes of transport, but also â and this is a point I should like to make in view of the holiday period in Europe â between holiday regions.
There are European holiday regions to which Europeans normally travel by bus, train or car, and there are others that are primarily reached by aeroplane.
In the region from which I come, representatives of hotels, other establishments providing food and drink, and other tourism enterprises openly complain that, to give an example, the taxes that a Dutchman would have to pay if he flew from Amsterdam to Turkey are very much lower than those he would pay if he took the bus to a mountainous area in Germany or France.
That is a distortion of competition that we need to remedy.
We should, however, be careful in our choice of instruments for this purpose, so that we do not create new distortions of competition.
For example, it is important that we take care that the instruments chosen give rise to the minimum possible distortion of competition between the European airlines and their non-European competitors.
In our view, the original draft prepared by MrsÂ Lucas had a number of weaknesses in this regard. For this reason, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has drafted some amendments and has also endorsed a number of amendments along the same lines from the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Focusing our discussion exclusively or primarily on the kerosene tax is unlikely to solve the problem.
We should concentrate on other instruments: namely a fundamentally redesigned emissions trading scheme that remedies the weaknesses of the present scheme, plus a mixture of other instruments.
What is important is that emissions trading should cover not only flights within Europe, but also intercontinental traffic, or at least that which takes off and lands in Europe.
It goes without saying that we want to see a worldwide system as soon as possible.
The weaknesses in the present Emissions Trading Scheme need to be overcome: that means less bureaucracy, a uniform allocation method throughout Europe and greater recognition of past performance.
This is one of the reasons for my plea, on behalf of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for a separate scheme â as this will mean that the shortcomings can be remedied more quickly than if the deficient scheme were adopted.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants to see an impact assessment, and I assume that the Commission will soon be presenting one.
In addition, in the context of all the emphasis on emissions trading, we should like to see equal priority being given to further pursuing other measures, such as air-traffic management.
We should also reflect on the fact that one way of remedying distortions of competition is to reduce taxes on environmentally friendly modes of transport.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, MrsÂ Lucas, on her well-balanced report.
Indeed, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament support her on many points â with the exception of the one about creating a separate emissions trading scheme for air transport.
From 1990 to 2002, the CO2 emissions from international air traffic that were generated by the 25 EU Member States rose by 60%.
In addition, the altitude at which air traffic produces emissions means that their impact on the climate is far greater than their quantity would suggest.
Heavy fuel taxation is common practice in Europe, yet almost nowhere in it is aviation fuel taxed.
This has a considerable impact on the competitiveness of the other modes of transport.
Long-distance rail transport is stagnating.
Parliament should give its resounding support to the Commissionâs intention of further pursuing the introduction of kerosene taxes, and implementing these as quickly as possible.
The EU must take the lead on this and set a good example by taking timely action at regional level.
This report does not discuss only the kerosene tax, however, but also the massive distortion of competition caused by tax exemptions on air transport.
Rail transport is subject to taxes and to the Emissions Trading Scheme, which entails considerable cost increases for this environmentally friendly mode of transport.
Emissions trading is not a replacement for the measures needed to reduce climate change impact, but it has the potential to be, provided it is properly organised.
As I have already emphasised, we support the Commissionâs proposal to integrate air transport into the existing Emissions Trading Scheme, but we also support paragraphÂ 24, which calls for a pilot phase of a separate scheme covering the period 2008â2012.
Â Â  . Mr President, we like to proclaim the growth of cheap air travel as a European success story.
It is thanks to the breaking of national monopolies that there are now such unparalleled opportunities, mainly for the middle class, to enjoy holidays abroad.
My own assistant just popped over to Stockholm this weekend for an engagement party â not even a wedding, just an engagement party.
We all enjoy this, but I think we have to remember that the poorest in society, let alone the poorest across the world, are denied these opportunities.
Whatever the price of the air fare, they cannot afford the holidays at the other end; but for those of us in a privileged position it is fantastic.
The trouble is the predicted growth is so great as to wipe out the gains being made in reducing carbon dioxide in other sectors.
A big airline operator in the UK told me they expect a 60% increase in the use of their planes over the next six years alone.
That is a fantastic and terrible rate of growth.
What the lobbying letters from the aviation industry are really saying, putting forward every excuse in the world, is this: âjust donât touch us, we are somehow special.
Our growth and our profits must be protected.
Do not take measures against us.
The future of the world can go to hell, frankly, just so long as we are protectedâ.
They want to be included in the Commissionâs emission trading scheme, and you may ask why.
It is because they know it is not going to be consequential on their profits.
The socialists are now saying yes, we are backing the capitalists in this.
I think they should look at this again.
The point is that the aviation industry says a closed scheme would be a tax.
Yes, in effect it would be a tax, but it would be a flexible tax rewarding those who take measures to try to introduce the best technology and to make maximum use of their planes.
Technological development is what we really need to promote.
Our message to the airline industry should be this: expand as you like, but find ways of doing it without increasing CO2 emissions.
We do not want to stop air travel, we simply want to ensure that its growth is not at the expense of our children and our future.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Lucas, for her excellent report, whose proposals for action are very well justified.
Emissions from air traffic are growing faster than any other source of carbon dioxide emissions, and the other emissions and impact of aviation more than double its effect on global warming.
Since 1990, greenhouse emissions from air traffic within the European Union have increased by 85%, which is 4% a year.
This threatens to wipe out a quarter of the reductions in emissions achieved in other sectors for the prohibition period.
This cannot be allowed to continue.
Emissions from air traffic are by far the greatest per kilometre travelled.
For example, the impact is fifteen times greater than that of trains.
Every aspect of air travel, however, is subsidised, including fuel, which is not subject to taxation. On the other hand, rail traffic is taxed in a number of ways, and it is also affected by the trade in carbon dioxide emissions.
The âpolluter paysâ principle must be extended to flight, in such a way, obviously, that it does not lead to distortion of competition, although current tax breaks for aviation and other preferential treatment are a distortion of competition in themselves.
The next global climate agreement should cover air traffic, but there are good reasons now for extending emissions trading to all flights arriving in and departing from the European Union, preferably based on a separate emissions trading system, to make the incentive for reducing emissions effective.
Ladies and gentlemen, every one of us flies, and we do so quite a lot.
Every one of us can do something too.
We can compensate for the emissions from our own air travel voluntarily.
There are organisations which calculate flight emissions per passenger and through them you can finance an equivalent amount of investment to reduce emissions in the developing countries.
I myself started compensating for the emissions from my own flights last year, and now I have paid compensation for all the flights I have taken since I was elected to the European Parliament.
I call on all my fellow Members to do likewise â we can afford to.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank MrsÂ Lucas for her very lucid report.
I support the gist of the Commissionâs proposal in which it wishes to put a check on the fast growing share of aviation in climate change.
MrsÂ Lucasâs report complements the proposal well, and we share her view that including the aviation sector in emissions trading should not be the only instrument, but should form part of a package of measures, such as introducing kerosene tax, VAT on plane tickets and congestion tax for airports.
Like the rapporteur, I take the view that the emission rights to be issued should be auctioned in order to avoid large enterprises feathering their own nests with free rights, without the environment benefiting in any way.
Although my group sees the Commission proposal as a step in the right direction, we should not overestimate the importance of emissions trading, whose environmental benefits have not been proven beyond any doubt.
Moreover, CO2 is not the only problem aviation faces.
The emission of nitrogen oxide (NOx) is also enormously important, not only in terms of the climate, but also air quality.
That is why we are in favour of including NOx in emissions trading, which is what is already happening in the Netherlands, certainly if a separate system is being set up for aviation anyway.
A system that addresses CO2 alone will not yield the maximum effect.
It would be preferable to tackle NOx at the same time.
We agree with the rapporteur that research into cleaner engines is needed, but this should not yet again mean that specific measures against said emissions will be shelved.
If NOx is not included in emissions trading â and it now looks unlikely that it will be â airports must be encouraged to impose local emission levies as part of the package of measures set out by the rapporteur.
My party supports the Commissionâs intention to end the tax benefits which the aviation sector enjoys internationally. This has led to unfair competition between different modes of transport for longer than anyone can remember.
We therefore support the rapporteurâs proposal which indicates that the EU should take the initiative to introduce a kerosene tax on all domestic flights.
This could prove an effective brake on the tremendous growth in the number of cheap flights against which rail is hardly equipped to compete.
Budget airlines already account for a quarter of European air traffic, which has, above all, resulted in the growth of regional airports.
It is important for the Member States to give us an insight into subsidies that are channelled to those airports with the intention of attracting airline companies.
We must move away from the idea that the increase in air traffic within the EU is a driving force of regional growth.
For many of these medium-long distances, rail connections are a much more environmentally-friendly alternative, provided that there is a level playing field.
Since the introduction of emissions trading, rail has been paying a much higher price for electricity, but airline companies still do not pay a cent of excise despite their constant moaning and groaning about high fuel prices.
Â Â  . Mr President, every year, we become increasingly aware of the effects of climate change.
It takes longer for winter to set in, and when it does, it is increasingly milder, and summer starts earlier and is increasingly warmer.
Is this an inevitable process?
I hope not.
We should, though, pull out all the stops to ensure that this trend is bucked. That is why I agree with the Commissionâs communication.
If we want to fight climate change effectively, all sectors must do their bit, certainly the aviation sector, which is responsible for high-altitude emissions and which has, as such, an extraordinary impact.
I can go along with the plan to set up an emissions trading system for aviation too, provided this meets a number of conditions.
First of all, since it must encompass as many companies and routes as possible in order to fight unfair competition, it should apply to all flights out of, and into, all the EU's airports.
Secondly, efforts which companies have already made to limit their emissions should be taken into consideration.
I would also prefer for allowances to be handed out on the basis of an auction.
Thirdly, it should become possible to include substances other than C02 if this can be backed by scientific proof.
Also, the VAT exemption for kerosene and plane tickets should be abandoned, provided this is done in an all-inclusive plan in which the VAT exemptions for other modes of transport are also reviewed.
In the framework of the discussion on Eurovignette, the Commission has promised to carry out a study into the internalisation of external costs for all modes of transport.
I should like to call for this study to be completed promptly, so that the results can be made available as soon as possible and we can adopt legislation that takes these results into account.
Â Â  As a result of technology developments and the globalisation of tourism and the economy in the past decades, the number of passengers travelling by air has shown a radical increase.
Unfortunately, the number and extent of environmental problems caused by air travel have also shown a proportional increase.
At the moment, aeroplanes account for only 3% of the European Union's total greenhouse emissions, but the rapid annual increase of almost 5% means that it is now time to act.
Europe has assumed a pioneering role by deciding to take action in this area, in conformance with the Kyoto principles.
However, pioneering actions always involve risks.
Therefore, we must make sure that the measures taken do not place European airlines at a competitive disadvantage. At the same time, we must find a solution that effectively encourages the sector to reduce atmospheric pollution.
I personally believe in market instruments, which is why I support the introduction of an adequately developed emission trading system in this area too.
It is important that we make maximum use of the reserves still left in the current imperfect system.
I am thinking, primarily, of improvements in air transport organisation. This is important both in respect of atmospheric pollution and noise pollution caused by aeroplanes.
We need to reconsider the logic of making detours to avoid military facilities, and we must make every effort to avoid flights over inhabited areas, because the increase in air traffic is affecting the lives of more and more European citizens, and is leading to increasingly frequent protests from the population.
The principle and the objective are clear.
Our mobility should not have harmful effects on our health or on the condition of our environment.
I hope that we will be able to achieve this, and I congratulate the rapporteur for a report showing plenty of initiative.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, my compliments to MrsÂ Lucas.
She has drafted an excellent report that encapsulates the problems in aviation and the dilemmas associated with them.
What do those problems in aviation amount to?
First of all, aviation contributes hugely to climate change: per passenger and per kilometre, the C02 emission in aviation is considerably higher than in transport by train or even by car.
Certainly for short distances, the burden on the environment is high and it is precisely when short distances are involved that there are alternatives, of which, at present, too little use is being made.
The second problem is that too few people are aware of the major environmental burden that aviation presents.
That is why it would be good if tickets and cars were to display the CO2 emission per km.
I would welcome initiatives to that effect, Commissioner.
To us in this House, it would be useful to know exactly what the CO2 emission is when we travel to Brussels or Strasbourg by car, train or plane.
The third problem is that the environmental tax is in no way reflected in the costs.
Flying is unnaturally cheap.
It is mystifying why the aviation sector should still be exempt from VAT. This puts the more environmentally-friendly transport methods, such as trains or buses, at a disadvantage.
This phenomenon can, and indeed should, be stopped without delay.
It is, in any case, of the utmost importance that aviation be brought, at the earliest opportunity, within a system of tradable emissions rights.
This would give C02 a price tag and promote innovation, particularly more efficient engines and more economical and better use of fuel.
In my view, it is obvious to use the existing emissions trading system as a basis, as long as we avoid the mistakes that were made in that system.
Instead of free allocation, I would prefer to see auctioning.
It also goes without saying that kerosene should be taxed.
The fourth problem is that it is not easy to tackle the aviation sector.
Aviation is a source of both employment and enjoyment for consumers and tourists alike.
That is why it is important to operate at European level and at the same time to invest in comfortable high-speed connections between the European cities.
This would be an ambitious policy, and one to which the public would be sure to give its backing.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as an important transport sector, aviation is of vital significance to economic development in Europe.
Worldwide and also in the EU, aviation is a growth sector, providing employment for more than four million Europeans.
Although aviation accounts for only approximately 3% of global CO2 emissions, this proportion is growing constantly.
The objective of our policy must be to reduce the climate-change impact without also reducing growth in this key sector.
The growth and competitiveness of our airlines must not conflict with the reduction of greenhouse gases.
The choice of instruments is vital to achieving this objective.
The introduction of a kerosene tax and the levying of departure or airline-ticket taxes would only result in dampening demand.
Making flying more expensive would reduce greenhouse gases, but only at the expense of growth, which is not absolutely necessary.
The incorporation of aviation into the Emissions Trading Scheme, as proposed by the Commission, is a better alternative from an environmental and economic point of view.
Emissions trading that is limited to the EU must offer guarantees that European airlines are not put at a disadvantage in comparison to other airlines.
In addition, emissions trading must not become an end in itself, but must primarily create incentives for investment in improved technologies.
The promotion of technology holds the key to harmonising the objectives of growth and reduction of CO2Â emissions.
The European aviation and space-travel industry, in particular, has made a decisive contribution to the development of engines with greater fuel efficiency, and thus of cleaner aircraft.
In addition to the promotion of technology, two further aspects need to be taken into account that have been neglected in the debate on reducing emissions.
Firstly, the creation of a single European airspace and air traffic control area â the âSingle European Skyâ project â and secondly the extension of airports.
Even without regulatory enthusiasm, we can achieve a considerable reduction in greenhouse gases by reducing flying distances and avoiding stacking.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you, MrsÂ Lucas, for a constructive and clear report.
Action in terms of quotas is preferable to free and complicated allocation.
It is important for us to make a clear decision about separate trading systems for aviation. That is only logical because the climate change impact of aviation is two to four times greater than the impact of carbon dioxide alone.
Aviation would therefore be placed at an undue advantage if it were to form part of the general system, and the fight against climate change would become less cost-effective.
Aviation is expanding rapidly.
It is a kind of tax haven of the skies, with exemption from VAT and fuel tax being the most serious aspect of this.
All this is of most benefit to the richest people in society, who are the most frequent fliers.
Paradoxically enough, it would, then, be those on low incomes who would benefit most from increased emissions charges, for these would reduce the amount of state income needed from other areas, such as rail travel, in which those on low incomes account for a larger share of the market.
I am very pleased about the support for separate systems shown by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I expect the Socialist Group in the European Parliament also to stand up for the less well off.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, it is no simple matter to establish equal conditions for the various forms of transport.
Qualification requirements for crews, the infrastructure of the individual forms of transport, the fuel or energy required to keep things running, unified operating rules for a given form of transport, environmental impact and how to assess it â there are indeed many aspects to consider, all the way from research and development to the investigation of accidents.
This is why the report under discussion is attracting so much interest from the experts in the field.
A basic requirement when introducing any measure is to ensure fair competition.
It is therefore necessary to require that the introduction of carbon dioxide emission permits for aviation fulfils paragraphÂ 32 of the motion for a resolution in the sense of the Kyoto Protocol, in other words with no growth in emissions compared to the base year, and that this applies to all organisations.
In the modern age, aviation is always in the forefront when it comes to introducing new technical solutions.
It is therefore sure to provide an example in cutting other emissions, although establishing limits is a matter for further negotiation.
Despite this, it is necessary to establish standards for volatile hydrocarbons â especially aromatic ones â and solid particulates, oxides of nitrogen and other factors such as noise on an equal basis for all users of the European Unionâs air space, in such a way that EU transport firms do not suffer discrimination through the selective application of limits.
It is similarly desirable to support the use of biofuels.
We must not allow unfair competition from foreign transport firms through the introduction of VAT, and it is essential to coordinate such a step across the entire aviation sector and not just within the EU.
The operation as a whole will certainly be complex but it is feasible, as long as the conditions set out in the report are adhered to.
On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I therefore strongly urge all Members to endorse the report on reducing the climate change impact of aviation, including our amendment.
I would like to conclude with the comment that flights by military aircraft and helicopters used for espionage and guard duties constitute a significant source of emissions.
Let us try to reduce them, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, whether one accepts Mrs Lucasâs figure of 4.1 million jobs or the Association of European Airlinesâ figure of 7.5 million jobs directly dependent on air transport, we must agree that the aviation industry contributes very significantly to European employment and growth.
Air transport is vital to the EUâs economy, accounting for up to 8% of GDP, boosting productivity, attracting investment and encouraging tourism.
Air transport has become an integral part of society, allowing us to travel long distances quickly, but also strengthening Europeâs integration, prosperity and political importance.
Aviation facilitates social cohesion and cultural exchange.
Strategically, air transport is of critical importance, particularly for peripheral regions and islands such as Ireland.
It is easy to exaggerate the contribution from aviation to the present problem of climate change, and emissions from all transport sectors are of concern to the air quality issue and the climate change debate, which is the number one item on every environment agenda.
We should not be singling out aviation and ignoring shipping and the considerably greater impact from increasing road transport and car usage.
In 2003, total emissions from flights into and out of the EU 25 Member States contributed 3.4% of CO2 emissions, which was equivalent to 0.5% of worldwide emissions in this area.
Air transport is treated differently under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in terms of how its greenhouse gas emissions are accounted for.
It is not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol.
While we should acknowledge the advances made by the European aviation industryâs voluntary initiative, the Emissions Containment Policy, with EU air traffic movements set to double by 2020 over the 2003 level, the real question is whether, on the basis of the polluter pays principle, this voluntary initiative will be adequate to counteract rising emissions from air transport.
Do we need legislation?
Interestingly, a recent House of Lords report on aviationâs contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years.
The industry itself claims that fuel efficiency, direct routing and new technology have already achieved a 70% reduction in aircraft emissions over the last 30 years and that air traffic management, improved holding patterns over airports, and replacement of older planes with state-of-the-art technology in fleet renewal could reduce climate-change impact even further as the number of flights increases each year.
An emissions trading scheme and auctioning rights are worth investigating, but, I ask the Commissioner, would a stand-alone or closed ETS for aviation not fall at the first hurdle, since all the trading entities would be net buyers and there would be no market?
A possible solution, following a comprehensive impact assessment, would appear to be incorporation of aviation into a reviewed existing ETS, with the proviso that all flights landing and taking off in Europe must be included.
This should ideally be part of a global solution, with industry and governments sitting down with the International Civil Aviation Organization, as Article 2(2) of the Kyoto Protocol suggests.
Do not hold your breath.
Any economic instruments must have clear environmental objectives, rather than fiscal ones, and must be part of an overall package that addresses technological, operational and infrastructural improvements.
An open skies agreement, reducing stacking and taxiing time through better air traffic control management and improved scheduling and coordination within a single European sky policy must all be part of a comprehensive policy mix.
Â Â  I would like to remind the author of the report that the European Parliament is often called the flying parliament.
Flying as we do every week to one of the EU's capitals, we should be particularly concerned about making aviation a more environmentally friendly mode of transport.
In policies concerning the effect of aviation on climate change, the âpolluter paysâ principle must be upheld.
It is regrettable that air transport does not cover the external expenditure which arises as a result of its effect on the climate.
The logical thing would be to include aviation in the EU's trading system for greenhouse gas emission allowances.
The funds raised by the collection of such taxes could be invested in new technology dedicated to the production of âcleanerâ aircraft.
The expansion of rail and bus transport could reduce both the pressure on overloaded airports and the pollution emitted by aviation.
Unfortunately, the rail and road networks in Lithuania and the other Baltic countries are not integrated into the EU's infrastructure. They are outmoded and overloaded.
If the âVia Balticaâ and more importantly the âRail Balticaâ projects fail to receive special EU attention, it will be a long time before rail and road transport in this region are able to help aviation.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to join other colleagues in congratulating Mrs Lucas on her excellent work.
Mrs Lucasâs report meets with my agreement to a great extent and hence I will confine myself to making some general comments on the subject matter under discussion.
I think we all agree that the dangerous trend of increasing aviation emissions has to be checked.
In my view, the simple, common sense options for a solution offering a reduction in aviation emissions are the following.
First, a general reduction in air travel through encouragement of the use of other, less polluting means of transport, such as rail transport.
For this to be achieved, there has to be genuinely fair competition, which historically there has not been.
It almost escapes logical explanation why today aviation is still not subject to fuel tax or VAT, and this anachronism surely needs to be corrected.
The corresponding air-fare price increases that will result will not only make people use, when possible, alternative, more environmentally-friendly means of transport, but may cause them to limit their travelling altogether, which is not a bad thing.
The second option is the improvement of the fuel efficiency of aviation engines.
For this to be achieved, novel engine technology research and development needs to be promoted even more intensively.
State assistance to that end should be encouraged most strongly.
The third option is the introduction and promotion of aviation fuels which have less impact on the environment.
In this respect, more research should be encouraged into novel fuels such as biofuels.
The fourth option would be the phasing-out of old inefficient aircraft, some of which cause two or three times as much damage to the environment as more modern aircraft.
To this end, the airline industry must be given clear incentives for regularly upgrading their aircraft.
Fifthly, there is the option of operating a more efficient service.
There has already been mention of aircraft holding circles and running half-empty aircraft.
Surely there is scope for improvement in efficiency in that area.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, here, at last, is a report that takes a sufficiently critical line on the impact of aviation on climate change.
I am much obliged to the rapporteur.
All the previous speakers have mentioned the enormous growth rates recorded in aviation.
The rates are so high that their further growth could destroy all the savings that the other economic sectors have worked very hard to achieve.
For this reason, aviation, too, must of course be taken into account in the Kyoto objectives if it is not to continue to be privileged in such an abominable way.
Since we have waited so long, a whole package of measures is now needed to bring the negative impact under control â emissions trading alone will by no means suffice.
As my fellow Member has already said, tourism within Europe will also benefit as a result.
This is not possible at the moment at global level, but we must take action at long last, before the emissions from aviation eat up all the savings we have made in other economic sectors.
We cannot wait any longer.
Â Â  Mr President, information provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation shows that the airline industry in Europe transports over 320Â million passengers each year.
This means that around 110Â 000 aircraft produce emissions that irreversibly pollute the air every day.
It is estimated that by 2050 the amount of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere by the airline industry will reach 5% (in 2000 this figure stood at 2%).
In accordance with Eurocontrol forecasts, by 2020 the number of flights in the European Union will more than double compared to 2003.
This data shows that the negative effects of the growth of the aviation industry outweigh its benefits for society in terms of technological progress.
We have to try to limit these harmful effects on the environment while maintaining the principle of competitiveness within the growing cheap airlines market, as these airlines have become incredibly popular in Europe.
We should also remember that the air transport sector generates around fourÂ million jobs, and that is why it is vital to carry out a detailed investigation into the influence of the airline industry on air pollution and the increase in noise levels.
However, the main pressure should be placed on trade in emission permits and the creation of an appropriate system for enforcing this method.
The system for trade in permits for aviation should cover all flights to and from all airports on European Union territory, regardless of the country of origin of the airline.
If possible, it should also cover intercontinental transit flights passing through European Union airspace.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the first thing we need is a standardised European procedure for stemming the environmental impact of air transport.
Unilateral measures at national level such as airline-ticket taxes and kerosene taxes will not work.
Emissions trading in air transport is the right course of action but, from a transport-policy point of view â or from my point of view â the main instruments contained in the Lucas report are wrong.
Firstly, we need aviation to be included in the existing EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
A separate scheme would be counterproductive and would stall the growth in air transport. That conflicts with our Lisbon Strategy.
Why is that the case?
There is no market without suppliers and, in the early days, air transport will buy only on the basis of its growth rates and of technical innovations for the long term.
In addition, a separate scheme would require a new administrative structure and contradict our intention to strive for better lawmaking.
What would we then do with other modes of transport?
Would we need further schemes?
This does not make any sense.
Secondly, I reject the inclusion of non-CO2 climate-change impacts through multipliers.
Let us look at Switzerland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, where the NOx problem is regulated by means of landing charges.
It makes sense to do it that way.
Â Â  Mr President, when some time ago we drafted the emissions trading directive, it was hard to imagine any other report that would have so much influence on the situation in Europe and about which the decision-makers knew so little.
At the time, Europe was stepping into unknown territory, because there was only very little theoretical research into the effects of emissions trading.
Now, however, those effects are very well known, especially those which hamper European competitiveness, as well as the effects which, paradoxically, damage the global environment.
As we are now extending the front where the fight against climate change is taking place, we can no longer afford to make the same mistakes again.
It is in this context now that the call in this report for the EU to show leadership in the fight against climate change by taking regional and early action reminds me too much of an attitude for which at present we are paying rather a high price.
It cannot be considered leadership when we act alone, while others show their support from the sidelines.
It is obvious that we have to address the problem of emissions from aviation, but the success of the project itself will be decided by the remedies chosen to achieve the goal.
Now that we are wise when it comes to the current emissions trading scheme, we know that we need a common global way forward, so that the environment might benefit from it best.
If the proposed actions, therefore, are to be realised, they will need to be examined much more widely and approached with caution, because we now need workable practices rather than ideology.
On the basis of my initiative and in the name of our group, we have tabled an amendment in which we insist on a clear evaluation of the effects being made, caps on emissions being defined, and an explanation regarding what agency will in practice be responsible for the action to bring about reductions as called for, and, in particular, how we are to ensure that airlines outside the EU are also involved in emissions trading.
If we do not have this knowledge base, once again we will be building a house of cards.
Other options for emissions trading itself should also be studied.
The priority remedies are, for example, the development of technology and the smooth flow of air traffic itself, because a good number of emissions are the result of using obsolete fleets and airport congestion.
It was therefore regrettable that with the emissions directive we made such unsatisfactory progress in such a crucial area.
With the Commission now drafting its own proposal on emissions trading in aviation, it is surely time for it to make a comeback.
Â Â  Mr President, when it comes to the environment, aviation always seems to me to be the easiest target to blame for emissions.
However, there is sufficient evidence in the public domain that appears to contradict what is called for as a solution in this report.
As Mrs Doyle mentioned, the UK House of Lords recently finalised a report on the effects of aviation on climate change.
As she said, it states that the effect would be insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years.
Commissioner, Mrs Lucas, I have a copy of that report with me tonight.
I would very much welcome your views on its contents.
Similarly, as Mrs Doyle mentioned, figures published by IATA show that over the last 40 years, through technological development, aircraft are 70% more fuel efficient.
I have no doubt that such technological advances will continue to improve the situation.
We can already see that in the new generation of aircraft: the Airbus 380 and the Boeing 787.
Given those two factors I suspect that the reportâs author is more guilty of wishful thinking than scientific fact.
One of my main concerns when addressing the topic is that Europe tries to act alone, making decisions which could potentially place EU airlines at a competitive disadvantage.
There are international organisations â one of which is the International Civil Aviation Organization â that regulate the industry at a global level.
I believe any action that is necessary should be taken at that level.
In my view what is needed is incontrovertible scientific evidence, not speculation.
That is why I support a full impact assessment being carried out before any proposals are brought forward.
We must be careful in the messages that we send out, not only to the aviation industry, which contributes greatly to all our countriesâ economies, but also to our citizens, who I believe have the right to continue to enjoy affordable air travel, whether on business or for pleasure.
Â Â  Mr President, I thank the Members of Parliament for their very important speeches and for their contribution to this evening's debate.
In closing this debate, I should like to say that the Community initiative in the sector in question is extremely important.
As MrÂ Bradbourn said, aviation is a global sector and, as such, responsibility for the matters in question must lie with the International Civil Aviation Organization, and account must be taken of scientific results and scientific proof and of the very important study carried out by the House of Lords committee, which I too have seen.
Without doubt, we shall have a full impact study to support our legislative proposal.
I should also like to say that there is excellent cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization.
On the question of climate change, in particular, we must take action at European Union level, including for the simple reason that the European Union agreed in the Sixth Community Action Programme that it must determine, propose and take measures if the International Civil Aviation Organization failed to propose the relevant measures by 2002.
This deadline expired a long time ago.
Consequently, we must take action and, as I said earlier, the European Council called on the Commission last December to submit the relevant legislative proposal under the codecision procedure.
In all events, the action we are examining will not contradict the European Union's commitments towards the International Civil Aviation Organization, given that the Civil Aviation Organization itself is in favour of an open system of emissions trading; in other words, it has accepted that emissions from international aviation will come under the current national systems of emissions trading rights.
Our proposal moves in precisely this direction.
Last year, as you know, the Community trading rights system was put into practice.
This is the first and the largest international trading system and now, of course, is the best time for us to extend it by including aviation in a way that is compatible with the International Civil Aviation Organization.
The European Union accounts for approximately 50% of total carbon dioxide emissions by international aviation, compared with Annex I countries, in other words countries which have restrictions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Consequently, the measure recommended by the Commission will doubtless have important repercussions.
We hope that this example will be followed by other countries.
Finally, I should also like to refer to the concerns expressed to the effect that our proposal will put European companies at a disadvantage, compared with companies in third countries.
This is not the case; there is no such risk because, under the Commission proposal, the trading system will cover all airlines operating flights in the geographical area, within the geographical scope of the system, irrespective of nationality.
This means, therefore, that airlines in the European Union will be treated in exactly the same way as their foreign competitors.
I hope that plenary will approve the motion and support the Commission's proposals.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Â Â  Mr President, I am pleased with this Parliament's opinion report aimed at seeking alternatives and measures to alleviate the negative effects of aviation on the environment and its impact in terms of climate change.
I would like to point to the danger of proposing measures aimed at increasing kerosene prices, take-off and landing fees or flight ticket prices, since these measures would have a direct impact on users, who would have to shoulder any increase in prices by airlines.
This increase would harm tourist areas, such as the islands, and would increase the costs of imported products, which would have a negative impact for consumers living in island regions.
It would also mean a loss of competitiveness for the islands and it would slow down accessibility to continental markets and the full integration of the island regions into the so-called âmotorways of the seaâ.
I would call upon the Commission and the European Parliament, before taking the measures proposed, to carry out a study of their economic impact on all regions and to pay particular attention to regions with structural disadvantages due to natural, geographical and permanent conditions, as in the case of the islands.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0230/2006) by Mrs Eija-Riita Korhola, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies [PE-CONSÂ 3614/2006 â C6-0156/2006 â 2003/0242COD)].
Â Â  . Mr President, the regulation on applying the provisions of the Aarhus Convention to Community institutions, which will finally be voted on regarding its adoption in tomorrowâs plenary session, will complete a process whose principal beneficiary will be the EU citizen.
The issue concerns important environmental legislation which applies to access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making.
Together with the Conciliation Committee we achieved a result in which we endorsed both of these, at Union level too.
The end result itself is, I believe, a balanced one.
I am particularly satisfied that our Conciliation Committee adopted it unanimously.
At the same time I want to thank my fellow Members. After some initial problems of interpretation, we found a common policy, which we successfully upheld.
I have been rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention throughout the entire process, ever stressing the importance of citizensâ rights in environmental matters.
Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental element in our own safety.
That is why I am especially happy that we were able to improve the transparency of the institutions while retaining the powers, but also the accountability, of the institutions to which they are relevant.
This concerns democratically elected institutions, such as the European Parliament, not forgetting the Council of course.
In a democracy, the people are the highest authority and the decision-makers that they elect implement their will.
That is why I did not consider it right to go down a path where politicians would be delegating power away from themselves to less open and less transparent agencies.
The Aarhus Convention, ratified by the EU and the Member States in the European Community, will be implemented by means of three directives, the two first so-called pillars of which have already passed through the codecision procedure, with conciliation.
These pillars concerned the transparency of environmental information and the publicâs right to participate.
The fate of the third pillar, the directive on access to justice, is, unfortunately, still unknown.
As these three Aarhus pillars were now being extended to the EUâs own institutions, that brought with it some legal challenges which set this regulation apart from earlier ones, those which were targeted at Member States.
One area which became problematic during conciliation was the proposals regarding access to environmental information.
Parliamentâs amendments contained technical and legal errors, which was one factor in the reason why our Conciliation Committee was closer to the view of the Commission and the Council than was still evident after the second reading.
The exceptions to releasing environmental information were one example of this.
Parliament, after the second reading, would have liked to rely on Directive 2003/4/EC, intended for the Member States, as far as exceptions to access to EC environmental information were concerned.
Legally, however, it would have been impossible, as the directive is only intended for the Member States.
The final solution was to apply Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001/EC, which deals with the public scrutiny of documents held by the EC institutions and which is tailor-made for this very purpose.
This way the approach is consistent for all types of information.
The other difficult area where we abandoned the view reached during the second reading was the right for the public to participate in the drafting of action plans and programmes funded by the EU institutions.
Right at the start there had been some confusion over concepts relating to this amendment.
Some understood that the amendments related to access to information, although the question was about the right to participate.
We nevertheless negotiated a good compromise.
With these few compromises we succeeded in preserving the spirit of the changes during Parliamentâs second reading, although we did also abandon some of them in the end.
Other important achievements in line with Parliamentâs policy were lengthening the period of time citizens have to make their voice heard, and broadening the scope of the obligation which the EC institutions are under to open their archives.
Furthermore, with regard to access to justice, Parliament succeeded in extending from four weeks to six the period during which NGOs may avail themselves of access to justice.
In the regulation itself, NGOs have been given a special role: that of requesting an internal review with regard to decisions by the institutions.
This role, now created for them by the regulation, is important for the Union.
I wish to thank the environmental organisations for their involvement and their input during the Aarhus legislation process.
Although perhaps we did not always agree, for example, on the scope of the rights accorded them, I appreciate and respect their desire to genuinely be involved in drafting better environmental legislation in the EU.
The future will show how well we have succeeded in our task.
If the regulation is to work in practice as well as the two earlier directives, it will raise transparency in the EU to a level which will serve both our common inclinations and the public in the best way possible.
Finally, I wish to say a special thank you to Austria for the excellent work it did as the country holding the presidency of the Council.
This was the third form of conciliation which I led in my capacity as rapporteur.
My experience of the Austrian representativesâ expertise, familiarity with the subject and negotiating skills was incredible, and I therefore have every reason to give Austria top marks for its presidency.
Similarly, I would like to thank the Commissionâs representatives for their excellent levels of cooperation, which I have enjoyed throughout the entire Aarhus process since it began in 2000.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to thank MrsÂ Korhola, rapporteur for the Aarhus Convention, and Vice-President Vidal-Quadras, who chaired the conciliation committee with the Council, for the excellent results achieved during conciliation.
The discussions held were constructive and achieved positive results and feasible solutions.
The few outstanding matters have been settled satisfactorily, which is why the Commission supports the conciliation text.
European citizens will therefore have a legislative framework which will guarantee them access to environmental information and participation in decision making on environmental matters.
This being so, the Commission recommends that Parliament ratify the excellent results achieved by its negotiating team.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this outcome of the conciliation aims to achieve greater transparency in environmental matters and greater public participation in decision-making with regard to these.
MrsÂ Korholaâs report makes it very clear that there had been a wide variety of developments in the legislative procedure and also some documents that certainly would not have met with our approval.
Seen from this point of view, the compromise reached is undoubtedly acceptable.
Evaluating this text on the basis of the objectives given is another matter, however.
These state quite clearly that, through public participation, every citizen should be able to live in the environment he or she finds pleasant, yet this objective cannot actually be achieved, as everyone has a different way of looking at his or her environment.
The fact is that this is a noble objective and, if I take it as a basis, our achievements do not live up to it.
I should also like to make the basic comment that this compromise, in particular, fails to meet the general demand for less bureaucracy, more transparency and more democracy; on the contrary, it is completely wide of the mark.
The additional bureaucracy that this proposal entails is hardly acceptable.
In addition, from my perspective, it is unacceptable to grant special rights to non-governmental organisations in the environmental field.
After all, many proposals and amendments would make it possible for NGOs to block or amend legislative texts from this House and Council just like that.
I value the work done by NGOs in the environmental field, in particular, but I also see them as just lobbyists and representatives of a certain movement, like representatives of enterprises or associations.
In this regard, we must follow closely what progress is being made with the legislative text, what the impact is on legislation in general, and also which objectives are being achieved â quite apart from the fact that I can also see this leading to harmful competition between enterprises and, potentially, to distortions of competition.
We must monitor this situation.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentleman, Commissioner, I would like firstly to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached.
The most important thing at the moment is for this legislation to be applied as soon as possible.
In that way we will increase our objective of transparency in the environmental measures adopted at Community level.
I would like to highlight certain positive aspects, such as the work carried out by the trialogue, with the participation of the Commission, the Austrian Presidency and the group of MEPs who took part in it.
I believe that through all of this work we are improving access to information relating to issues affecting the environment, making the exceptions, and their interpretation, more restrictive.
I would also like to stress, in relation to public participation in the adoption of decisions, that it is very important that that participation has been increased in the preparation, modification and revision of the environmental plans and programmes funded by the European Investment Bank.
It is also an achievement for the citizens that, when adopting decisions on environmental plans or programmes, the relevant Community institution or body must inform, and not just make reasonable efforts â as the text previously said â to inform, the public in relation to all decisions, since in that way we will increase the transparency of this kind of process.
With regard to access to information, perhaps the most important thing is the agreement reached on the basis of RegulationÂ 1049.
Since this Regulation is in force and relates to public access to documents held by the institutions of the European Community, there will be a system for access to all kinds of information held by the institutions and bodies of the European Union.
Finally, as well as repeating that I hope this agreement will be approved tomorrow and be implemented as soon as possible, I hope that the Community institutions and bodies will recognise that its effective application will benefit everybody and that they will act on that basis.
This is a legal tool that will in many cases help us to preserve the environment.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur and indeed everybody involved in reaching an agreement which has produced a joint text on this important regulation concerning the Aarhus Convention.
In Parliament and elsewhere we often speak about bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
Well, Aarhus translates our words into action.
I believe this regulation certainly helps to put flesh on the bones of Aarhus.
Too often governments and other public bodies pay lip-service to public consultation and participation.
It is seen as a necessary evil to be dispensed with as soon as possible; an inconvenience that the real decision makers have to endure.
Too often public participation is filed away in some deep, dark drawer and very conveniently ignored.
That was and, in many cases still is, the system.
That system has decided in its wisdom that the public â the ordinary citizens â whose lives will be immediately and permanently affected by certain environmental decisions cannot be trusted to participate in and influence such important decisions.
The system is due for a shake-up and this regulation will significantly help that process.
Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m speaks of Plan D â for dialogue, debate and democracy.
Well, Plan A, which is Aarhus, is surely a framework for ensuring that we can have dialogue, debate and democracy in environmental matters.
Unfortunately we have not yet ratified the Aarhus Convention in my own country, the Republic of Ireland, unlike most of our neighbours in the EU.
That continues to place Irish citizens at a disadvantage, as Aarhus is the worldâs most far-reaching treaty on environmental rights and guarantees public rights to access to information and public participation in environmental decision making.
This regulation, I am sure, will be welcomed by those who have an interest in the proposed incinerator in Ringsend in Dublin and will have certainly greatly facilitated those with concerns about Corrib Gas in the west of Ireland.
However, I am pleased that, in this House at least, we are going in the right direction even if some countries, like my own, are dragging their heels.
