Explanations of vote
Although I understand the need for Europol to carry out internal changes with regard to salaries and subsidies, Parliament has, since 1998, consistently rejected all initiatives put to it when consulted on detailed issues relating to Europol.
Such consultation could not be considered relevant while Europol remained intergovernmental in scope, with neither democratic nor legal control.
I welcome the fact that Parliament's repeated requests have finally been answered: in December 2006, the Commission stated its intention to give Europol a more acceptable legal framework, conferring on it the status of an EU agency, funded by the Community budget, and giving its staff the status of Community employees.
Although the process of transforming Europol has yet to be concluded, I have decided to vote in favour of this Finnish initiative on adapting the basic salaries and allowances of Europol, and this as a message of good faith and of complete support for this process of transformation, which I trust will be completed at the earliest opportunity.
in writing. (SV) The June List believes that increased democratic, legal and budget-related control over Europol is desirable.
Because the Europol Convention constitutes intergovernmental cooperation, it is the national parliaments, however, that should exercise this control, and not the European Parliament.
We have therefore voted against the report.
Bulgarian and Romanian refiners depend to a great extent on the import of raw cane sugar from third countries.
That being the case, in order to prevent a break in the supply of raw cane sugar to full-time refiners, tariff quotas for imports of raw cane sugar to Bulgaria and Romania from third countries must be opened.
It is in this context that the Commission's proposal, which will have no impact whatsoever on the refineries of other Member States, has appeared.
I agree with the Commission proposal, given the exceptional circumstances involved, and shall be voting in favour of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report.
in writing. (SV) We have voted against this report.
The June List is of the view that comprehensive reform of the sugar market within the EU is necessary with a view to liberalising the market without delay and giving sugar-producing countries outside the EU the opportunity to compete on fair terms.
It is absurd, then, to induct new Member States into a system with no future and get them used to that system's rules.
Because Romania and Bulgaria have properly operating sugar markets, they should be allowed to keep them and not be inducted into the EU's common organisation of the sugar market.
This common organisation should instead be abolished.
I will be voting for this report.
As the Member representing the European Parliament on the Council of Ministers' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia, I strongly supported the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia.
Since its inception it has done some excellent work.
When it was initially established I resisted its remit extending to cover not just the EU but the territory of the Council of Europe as I believed it would dilute the Centre's work and cause it to lose its focus on the rising tide of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism inside the Union.
Now we are to make it a fundamental rights agency.
I believe this is a similar mistake that will lessen the attention that must be paid to extreme right-wing organisations and parties in the Union, particularly within some of the new Member States.
Some who supported the change were merely misguided, but others knew exactly what they were doing!
in writing. (PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of Edit Herczog's report on discharging the budget of the European Air Safety Agency for 2005.
Mrs Herczog has accurately assessed the problem of the growing number of Community agencies which do not always succeed in meeting the general requirements and whose tasks do not always meet the real needs of the European Union and the expectations of its citizens.
I support the appeal to the Commission to set out general framework requirements for the creation of new Community agencies, for a cost-benefit analysis before any new agency is set up, and for a report every five years analysing the value provided by all agencies in operation.
I am pleased to support the decision by the Agency's Board of Management to adopt standards of internal control based on the standards adopted by the Commission and on ISO 9000.
During this monopolist phase of capitalism, the response to the contradictions of a system that lives off financial speculation has been to put finance first, thus creating an ever greater need to bring more money to the financial sphere.
The directive before us forms part of this scenario.
The aim of this proposal is to create an internal market for payment services and it forms part of the financial services action plan aimed at integrating the EU's financial services markets.
Once again, this area is characterised by private initiative, in this case from the banking sector, yet the intention is always the same, namely to promote the opening up of national markets to cross-border payment services, to water down the rules on prevention and to authorise operators not subject to the supervision of the banking sector to provide these services, whilst promoting the concentration of the sector at EU level.
Countries that, like Portugal, already have advanced payment operators and services, such as the Multibanco system, will be particularly badly hit, as the issue of the transmission of data to external information services has not been made clear.
We therefore voted against the report.
in writing. - (FR) EU citizens are interested in fast, affordable payment systems and in the creation of an internal market that is effective and functional when it comes to their making transfers and receiving payments.
We can be fully satisfied with the vote in favour of Mr GauzÃšs' report, because, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, this is a piece of work that has been done well and done in everyone's interests, proving to them that Europe makes their daily lives easier.
We could have obtained this result far quicker, however.
We actually finished our work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 12 September.
In spite of the goodwill of the European Parliament, it has taken the Council seven months to finally convince itself that our proposals are the best for protecting consumers, too.
It was also important to guarantee fair competition between the payment institutions that are created or recognised by this directive and the banks that are subject to strict regulations regarding capital.
It is important to maintain the good reputation of the payment services sector by keeping any dubious payments agencies in the background.
The payment execution time set by the Council is more rigorous than the one that we are proposing.
(The explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)
I voted for this report as the Directive should ensure that European citizens have their payments processed more quickly by banks, that their cards will be more widely accepted in other countries and that their rights will be better safeguarded in the event of disputes.
I believe that this will be an important improvement for European consumers.
Payments are the financial lubricants that allow the real economy to function.
Currently each EU citizen is making on average 138 non-cash payments per year and this is likely to grow.
I firmly believe that if European citizens and businesses are to reap the full benefits of this internal market, then they have to be able to trust in efficient, cheap and secure payments.
It is for this reason that I support the payment services report by Mr GauzÃšs.
Currently both consumers and retailers have to contend with the fact that goods can be physically moved across the EU in one or two days, yet the payment in relation to these goods can take between three and five days to clear.
The slowness of payments is no longer tolerable in an age when we can boast of nanosecond technology.
I firmly believe that European competitiveness will only improve when, in Ireland for example, businesses and consumers can make a payment from Dublin to Madrid as easily as from Dublin to Cork.
Mr President, I have voted in favour, because I believe that the internal market works, and that payment services do too.
If the Single European Payments Area initiative is properly implemented, it should lead to increased competition within a larger market, with higher levels of security, better services and attractive prices.
We could call this 'the best service at the lowest cost'.
I have one reservation, though.
In countries with more advanced payment markets, such as Belgium - but we are not alone - there is the fear that the conversion from existing national payment schemes could lead to extra costs for businesses and consumers.
Reference is made in this context to the level of the so-called 'interbank settlement payments'.
In response to a question in writing in relation to this issue, the Commission has assured me that it will monitor the respect for competition rule and will retain the right, if necessary, to take regulatory action.
I am relying on the Commission availing itself of the correction mechanisms that are at its disposal, should this prove necessary.
I hope, above all, that the bank sector will be smart enough to make this unnecessary and to lend its all-out cooperation to the further unification of the internal market for financial services.
(LT) When Lithuania entered the European Union it was allotted a starch quota that allowed starch factories to work at only 9.32% of production capacity.
Two years ago, in a session of the Council of European Union Agriculture and Fisheries, it was negotiated that the potato starch quota would be reviewed after two business years.
The consumption of starch is increasing in Lithuania.
At present it is 10 times greater than the permitted manufacturing quota.
Taking into consideration that as of January 2007, according to Commission data, European Union starch production quotas are under-utilised by 5%, an increase of the Lithuanian quota to ten thousand tonnes would not even amount to 0.5% of EU starch production quotas.
Therefore, Lithuania requests that its starch production quota be increased to ten thousand tonnes.
This is essential not just for domestic consumption, but to provide a background for the renewal of potato starch production capacity, an increase in its consumption as well as ensuring a certain level of income for producers of starchy potatoes.
It is unconscionable to hand out privileges to other countries at the expense of Lithuanian starch production capacity and agricultural producers in general.
in writing. (SV) We are opposed to the common agricultural policy as it stands and object to changes of little fundamental importance within the current system.
We demand a total overhaul and review of the whole of the common agricultural policy, so it is difficult to isolate individual areas such as the one we are now to vote on.
In our opinion, the quota system for potato starch should definitely not be extended.
Instead, the EU must abolish quota systems of all kinds within the agricultural sphere.
As in May 2005, Parliament's federalist majority continues to advocate extending the quota system.
The June List observes that, in this situation, it is just as well that Parliament does not have powers of codecision in relation to the EU's agricultural policy. Otherwise, the EU would end up in the trap of protectionism and of providing heavy subsidies to all the groups within the agricultural industry.
in writing. - (EL) Even though we are clearly opposed to quotas on any agricultural product, why does the EU set so many barriers on the development of production that each Member State could achieve depending on its needs and abilities, but we agree to increase quotas for Lithuania and Poland regarding the production of potatoes?
Because once more, we acknowledge a flagrant injustice against the new Member States in the quota status, regarding the production of starch out of potatoes.
It is a provocative injustice against new Member States to receive approximately only 10% of quotas, while having approximately 30% of production.
Today's suggestion to increase duration and quotas is a partial remedy for Lithuania and Poland.
I will prove my point by saying that even though Poland is the top producer of potatoes in Europe, with its allocation of quotas it is forced to import starch for potatoes due to the restrictions to its production and this naturally puts medium-sized farming enterprises out of business.
There are similar problems in Greece with regard to other products, which force our country to import them, despite favourable climate conditions for the production of agricultural products, thus giving a surge of millions of euro to the commercial agricultural deficit and forcing medium-sized farming enterprises to die out.
- (PL) Mr President, this report raises two fundamental problems faced by the European Union.
The first is future enlargement, and the second is the new dimension of cohesion policy following the latest round of accessions.
Advancing negotiations with Croatia, and the need for the complete stabilisation of the Western Balkans means that we need to analyse the impact of this enlargement on the entire European Union.
What makes such an analysis all the more significant is that while we have had a long period of association, and are currently in negotiations, with Turkey, we should not forget countries such as Ukraine.
The report is a good foundation for work on the 2009 budget review.
It is good preparation for the future of the Community over the next 50 years of its existence.
The accession of 10 countries from Central and Eastern Europe in 2004 and of Bulgaria and Romania in 2007 has increased competition and energised the entire Community, as well as bringing about stability and security and firm democracy.
Cohesion policy means solidarity, and it is a tool for integrating less developed countries.
That is why this is such an important report.
(DE) Mr President, I voted in favour of the Pieper report, since I am glad that the EU is at last appearing to recognise that Turkish accession would make excessive demands on us in financial, political and social terms.
Croatia, on the other hand, has already drawn so close to the EU that its imminent accession can scarcely be in doubt, particularly as it has been established that the financial effects of it would be minimal.
Existing disparities not only between Member States, but also between regions, have been accentuated as a consequence of the last wave of enlargement, of globalisation, of an ageing population, and also of migration from third countries to urban centres.
It may well be - as one does indeed read on the EU's homepage - that cities such as London, Hamburg and Brussels are among the most prosperous places to be, but it must not be forgotten that in them, too, the gap has been widened and slums have already come into being.
We have already, from the French example, seen where that can lead, so it is past high time that we paid more attention to internal cohesion in order to prevent these social powder kegs from going off.
(SK) European cohesion policy is the driving force behind lasting, sustainable development, especially in the less developed regions.
It contributes significantly towards raising the standard of living of the population.
The European Parliament, together with the ministers of the Member States, has the final word when the EU budget is approved.
In this seven-year programme period, a record 347 billion euro were earmarked for 84 regions in 17 Member States whose GDP is greatly below 75% of the EU average, and 16 regions whose GDP, due to statistical averaging after enlargement, was only marginally above 75% of the EU average.
These regions are viewing the Irish boom with enormous hope.
Ireland is the cohesion policy's outstanding success.
By drawing successfully on the structural funds, it was able to transform itself from the poorest region of Europe into one of the richest and to send aid from the European Solidarity Fund to those most in need.
I expressed support for Markus Pieper's administration because the European Parliament is very concerned that cohesion policy should also achieve successes in Eastern Europe.
For cohesion policy to be effective, we must reckon with the consequences of future enlargement, especially in the medium term as regards Turkey and Croatia, which already have official status as accession countries and with which the EU has already begun accession negotiations.
Then there are the seven East Balkan states which are potential candidates for IPA funds.
These enlargements alone would require the cohesion policy budget to be increased by EUR 150 billion.
If Europe is to become the most competitive economy ...
(DE) Mr President, believing the Pieper report to be a good one, I did actually want to vote in favour of it, but, since both my amendments were rejected, I have ended up voting against.
My view is that the accession of Turkey would overstretch the EU's capacity to integrate by means of its cohesion policy, and I am astonished that a majority in this House does not share it.
My second amendment reads as follows: 'believes that it is not possible, for financial and political reasons, to apply the principles of the EU's structural policy to Turkey'.
The majority may well have voted against this amendment today, but I am nonetheless convinced that my view will, in the longer term, be proved to be right.
in writing. - (FR) I was anxious to endorse the following amendments.
Amendments 25, 20 and 28, because adequate funding of regional policy is necessary in order to reduce the economic, social and territorial disparities between regions and to carry out future enlargements properly.
Amendments 22 and 39, because I feel that it is unacceptable to talk about 'a special form of EU membership' and 'a graduated approach' to regional policy exclusively for this country and also not to envisage, from this moment on, any outcome to the negotiations under way with Turkey other than membership.
Amendments 14 and 24, because the rapporteur's proposal for an increase in national cofinancing in regions that have received structural funds over several programming periods would put an end to efforts to implement this policy in the most underdeveloped regions of the old Member States.
I am opposed to the overly penny-pinching approach of the rapporteur, who is proposing a maximum period of time during which regions may receive structural funding.
As I see it, it is precisely these regions that are suffering from natural or human handicaps or from a difficult process of economic regeneration and that are not really equipped to deal with international competition that we must continue to help through the structural funds.
This report is negative as regards future enlargement, and in particular Turkey's possible membership of the EU.
I do not entirely agree, although I believe that any further enlargement will be unacceptable to the people of Europe for some significant time while we assimilate and integrate the twelve new Member States from 2004 and after.
As for Turkey, there is still much work for it to do by itself, including on the treatment of trade unionists and human rights for the Kurdish and Assyrian minorities before it would be in a political position to join, even if it manages to achieve the economic criteria required of new members.
On this basis, I will abstain on this report.
in writing. - (FR) Territorial cohesion in Europe aimed at reducing inter- and infra-regional disparities is a major objective of the European Union.
I welcome the adoption of this report today. It raises the issue of the European Union's absorption capacity and specifies, in particular, that, given the current state of the Union's own resources system, any further enlargements could not be funded without the effectiveness of the current cohesion policies being harmed.
From this perspective, regional expenditure needs to be rationalised.
An institutional, financial and political reform is desirable as part of a revision of the Community financial framework.
Furthermore, it is impossible to have an honest and effective cohesion policy without the European Union's budget being increased.
We are delighted that some of the most damaging proposals have successfully been removed from this report following the adoption of our proposals and following the action we took.
The proposals in question would have undermined cohesion policy and would have centred the debate around the interim review of the current financial framework and of cohesion policy.
The rejected proposals were as follows:
the increase in national cofinancing of cohesion policy;
the establishment of a maximum period for receiving Structural Funds, regardless of eligibility criteria;
making the award of funds conditional on compliance with certain criteria of economic and/or budgetary policy, such as the Stability and Growth Pact.
Furthermore, and regardless of prevailing opinion on the EU's enlargement process, we welcome the removal from the report of proposals aimed at creating a different accession status for new countries whereby they would be completely integrated into the internal market but without any involvement in the institutions or in the decision-making process, thus creating a form of neo-colonialism in which the so-called aid would always be conditional on the countries concerned yielding to political pressure.
The report still contains some very worrying aspects, however, such as those relating to financial resources and the objectives of cohesion policy.
We cannot possibly accept those points and accordingly are voting against the report.
I was concerned about the negative references to Turkey in this report and as they were supported by the plenary I had no alternative but to vote against this report.
Cohesion is one of the core principles and values of the EU, whether of 12 or 30 Member States.
This is based on the idea, firstly, that partners in the same project should all benefit equally, and, secondly, that the bigger and more widespread the economic development of the Community, the greater will be the success of the project as whole and of all the citizens.
For this reason, I share many of the concerns raised by the rapporteur, even if I do not agree entirely with all of the proposed solutions.
There are other aspects to take into account, however.
Given the type of economic challenge currently facing us, arising from the pressures of globalisation and from the accelerated modernisation of economic structures, we must seek the most appropriate instruments for changing the paradigms.
Accordingly, I feel that, whilst we must stick firmly to the values and principles that guide us, we must also be creative and innovative in our responses to the fresh challenges that face us.
Preparing the economically least privileged regions for the 21st century is no longer a visionary gesture, it is a current priority.
Times have changed, and responses need to be innovative.
I voted in favour of the report because, first of all, it draws attention to the budgetary difficulties that the Member States are expected to experience, given the demographic changes predicted to take place in the EU.
This point is of major importance because, with EU enlargement, expenditure on cohesion policy will, from a political perspective, reach unrealistic proportions.
Secondly, it would be unacceptable if some EU regions no longer benefited solely because of the statistical effect caused by a fresh round of enlargement.
Globalisation, moreover, will have a detrimental impact on some European regions.
This is an issue that requires a great deal of prudence, and I therefore support the call to the Commission to calculate the expenditure on regional policy likely to occur in relation to the forthcoming rounds of enlargement if the current criteria were to be applied, together with the consequences that such likely expenditure would have on regions that have so far been considered eligible for funding.
Lastly, I agree that there is a need to develop graduated models that will permit further differentiation between pre-accession assistance and full membership of the cohesion policy.
The EPLP attempted to modify the Pieper report by removing the most contentious amendments.
However, those amendments were carried and our efforts were unsuccessful.
The EPLP voted against a very negative report in terms of its general view on future enlargement and its specific references to Turkey.
(DE) Mr President, I voted against the Virrankoski report, and my reason for doing so is that the control of the Budget should be organised more efficiently in view of the imminence of the revision of the EU Budget heralded for 2009, which is intended to create greater transparency by, among other things, clearing a path through the rebate jungle.
What is needed above all else is something for once to be done about recovering sums of money paid out in error, since fraudsters will otherwise keep on getting away without penalty and Member States will have no incentive to tighten up their excessively casual and lax controls.
The presentation of the Commission's strategic policy for 2008 is the start of the process of negotiating the Community budget.
Against a backdrop of attempts to revive the already rejected Constitutional Treaty and of the debate on the Community budget for 2008-2009, 2008 is intended to be viewed as the penultimate year of Parliament's sixth legislature and of the Barroso Commission.
Among the political priorities put forward by the Commission, I should like to highlight negative aspects such as the liberalisation of the labour market by means of so-called flexicurity, the financing of European infrastructure supporting the liberalisation of gas and electricity, the creation of the European patent and the strengthening of the EU's military element.
The Commission states that 'the 2008 budget will build upon the 2007 budget' - once again, it appears, falling short of the budgetary ceiling in the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
This will clearly be insufficient to address the needs of economic and social cohesion in the enlarged EU.
We reject proposals of this nature and emphasise the need to adopt policies that promote sustainable economic development and employment, that combat unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and salary inequality and that reduce regional imbalances and promote genuine convergence.
in writing. - (EL) In the report on the annual strategic priorities of the Commission with regards to the 2008 Budget an effort is underway to make the EU capital budget more efficient in order to serve better its anti-grassroots policies.
Research studies are sought to confirm how efficiently resources were used with regards to the priorities of the regional imperialistic EU.
Nobody tries to obtain data, however, on unemployment, the 'extinction' of medium-sized farming enterprises, other problems of the people with regards to health, education, social security, which have emerged due to the anti-grassroots EU policies.
They are pursuing more room for manoeuvre in the budget for 'emergency situations'.
This is a step towards satisfying the emergency needs of capitalism.
All anti-grassroots EU policies are being promoted intensively, while at the same time funding for the promotion of the anti-labour Lisbon Strategy is being increased and research studies are expected for the review of the CAP, in order to speed up the extinction of the medium-sized farming enterprises.
Measures to suppress the resistance of workers are taken on an intensive basis (with the increase of Eurojust expenses) as well as steps for their subordination through the strengthening of propaganda mechanisms.
The funding of imperialistic intervention by the EU is given priority openly.
The peoples have experienced 'peace' efforts aimed at their subordination in the interest of capitalism.
To conclude, the 2008 budgetary plan fortifies the aggressiveness of capitalism against the peoples.
We are voting against it and are calling on people to fight against it, because the allocation of resources shows the reactionary policy of the EU.
in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of Mr Virrankoski's report on the annual strategic priorities of the Commission regarding the budget procedure for 2008.
This report is a first step in the annual budgeting procedure.
It defines the strategic priorities of the European Parliament for 2008 and serves as a pointer for the Commission in preparing the draft budget for 2008.
The report covers most of the major issues.
It raises the issue of increased integration between the legislative works programme and the budgetary procedure, and underlines the need to respect the basics of the financial perspective for 2007-2013.
In addition, the Members of this house have stated that during work on the budget for 2008, priority will again be given to the principle of a 'results-based budget', as was the case in the budget for 2007.
Mr President, obviously I voted against the discharge of the Commission's accounts, as I always do.
It has been such a long time that I cannot even remember when the Court of Auditors last gave a positive statement of assurance on the Commission's accounts.
I found it quite amusing that, on the day that this House's Committee on Budgetary Control was voting to wipe the slate clean and pass the accounts, the Belgian police were piling into Commission offices to arrest individuals.
They obviously thought there were some problems.
I did a massive survey in the region I represent.
In one particular part, in the wonderful constituency of Daventry, I sent 15 000 surveys out and asked people whether they thought that Britain should continue with its contribution whilst the accounts have not been signed off.
Over 10% of people returned that survey and 95% of those that returned it said we should not be paying any money in whilst this problem still goes on.
In today's vote on the discharge to the Commission for the 2005 Budget, I voted against it being given discharge on the grounds that the Court of Auditors has issued no Statement of Assurance in respect of this year, any more than it did for the years before it.
This amounts to a statement that prudent and efficient use of funds is no more guaranteed than it has been in previous years.
As is well known, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, has stated his intention that an unconditional Statement of Assurance should be achieved by 2009, and it is clear to me from the discharge given today that no visible steps have been taken to that end.
(SV) Mr President, I should just like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow MEPs for supporting the two amendments I tabled.
I have been trying for a long time to find out what the travelling circus to Strasbourg really costs, and what is embarrassing is that no one has been able to give me an answer.
No one knows, then, what the travelling circus costs.
It is, in any case, not our own but taxpayers' money that we are spending.
The least that we and the taxpayers are ultimately entitled to demand is that a serious investigation into the costs be carried out - a view I put forward in the two amendments I tabled today.
According to the only information I have found, the travelling circus costs SEK 2 billion, but that is a figure from the year 2000 when we only had 15 EU Member States.
My hope is that we shall now obtain new figures and new fuel for this debate so that, following today's vote, we might hopefully be able to take the first step towards abolishing the whole travelling circus.
in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have voted in favour of report on granting discharge to the European Parliament for 2005.
The vote must be seen in part as a success, in spite of the fact that a number of amendments concerning increased scrutiny of MEPs' pension conditions - amendments that we supported in the vote - were rejected.
We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen not to become members of the European Parliament's pension system.
We believe that the system is unethical in the way that it is designed and we have therefore chosen to remain outside it.
Because only a very small part of Parliament's activity relates to pensions, we think it unnecessary, however, to vote against the whole report on the grounds that precisely these amendments were rejected.
in writing. - (FR) Our Committee on Budgetary Control has once again been over-zealous.
If we implemented some of its proposals, we would need to employ a small army of officials to carry out unnecessary tasks and controls, which do nothing to increase transparency or combat abuse, but merely result in pointless costs and squabbles.
I regret that neither the rapporteur nor the majority of the committee members were inclined to take into consideration the comments of the chairman of the Members' voluntary pension fund in order to eliminate obvious falsehoods relating, among other things, to the statute due to enter into force in 2009.
Instead of behaving like irresponsible populists, certain members of the Committee on Budgetary Control would be better off dealing with real problems, such as the potentially exorbitant costs of the pension system for the French and Italian MEPs, costs that will be in the region of EUR 150 million.
I am in favour of the discharge, but I voted against a whole host of proposals that are as hare-brained as they are costly and perfectly unnecessary, and that have nothing to do with the 2005 discharge.
in writing. (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats chose to support Amendment 1 about the need to debit the Council for the costs of the European Parliament's activity in Strasbourg, because the Council denies Parliament the right to decide for itself about the location of its seat.
The best solution, however, would be for Parliament itself to be allowed to decide and for Parliament to choose to carry on its activities only in Brussels.
Mr President, ordinarily, I would just give one speech or explanation of vote on the discharges, saying why I voted against them.
But in this particular case, I can imagine the champagne corks are already being popped in the Committee of the Regions because this House has quite happily swept under the carpet all sorts of problems that have been ongoing there for a number of years.
In this House, two or three years ago, we asked for an apology to be made to the Committee of the Regions' then internal auditor, Mr Robert McCoy, who had made a plea to us for help in asking Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control to force the Committee of the Regions to change and to look after public money properly.
We ignored that. We passed a resolution saying he should get an apology but the Committee of the Regions ignored that and, to this day, Mr McCoy has no apology and the Committee of the Regions knows it can flout whatever the Parliament decides because no one cares.
It is a great shame.
Conservatives will be voting against Parliament's main reports on the budgetary discharge of the European Parliament, the Commission, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the grounds that for the 12th year running, the Court of Auditors has been unable to give a positive statement of assurance of the overall EU accounts.
Conservatives believe that this situation must be resolved as a matter of urgency by the Commission and that there must be zero tolerance in all cases of mismanagement and fraud.
Apart from the implementation of the new accountancy systems and encouraging whistleblowers to come forward, Conservatives are focused on the key priority area of the 80% of the budget that is spent in Member States which concerned the Auditors.
Through the concept of 'shared management', the Union system splits power from responsibility: the Commission is responsible for the expenditure of all EU funds but, in reality, the power is delegated to paying agencies in the Member States.
Some progress has been made by including in the agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspectives a commitment that a certification of expenditure by Member States will be required in future.
It is essential that this is implemented in full.
There must be greater transparency of the use of EU funds by Member States ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163)
I supported the Court of Auditors' view that discharge can be given to all seven institutions.
(PL) Mr President, I would like it to be noted that in the Andrejevs report, when voting for point L of the preamble (it was a roll-call vote) I accidentally voted in favour when I meant to vote against.
(LT) The first occurrences of HIV infection were identified 25 years ago.
The disease has spread all over the world.
The exact number of people suffering from the disease is not known.
Treatment is expensive and it is not accessible to all, especially in the new EU Member Countries.
A very important observation was made in the report concerning the complex relationship of the HIV/AIDS issue to migration processes.
Streams of migrants, especially from countries where HIV/AIDS is widespread, and from Eastern countries, about which we have very little information, constitute a threat of the further spread of HIV/AIDS.
Research shows that migrants are becoming the largest HIV/AIDS risk group in the European Union and its vicinity.
Health testing of twelve thousand migrants in Moscow revealed that 10% are suffering from HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.
I support the proposal to use the framework of neighbourhood policy to provide aid for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in vulnerable groups, especially migrants.
It is essential to give more attention to this problem.
My vote on the Andrejevs report on combating HIV/AIDS within the European Union and in the neighbouring countries, 2006-2009 is a vote in favour of a coherent strategy aimed at tackling such a large and tragic problem.
I would like to make it clear that my vote should not be interpreted as approving abortion practices.
in writing. It goes without saying that I and my colleagues from the Fianna FÃ¡il delegation are very much in favour of the eradication and combating of HIV/AIDS within the EU and the neighbouring countries.
We and the Irish Government have concerns regarding references to a strong linking of HIV/AIDS prevention and sexual and reproductive rights in policies, programmes, strategies and public education.
It is the Irish Government's position that such references should be contextualised by linking such rights to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994, and the Beijing Platform for Action (1995) and the UNGA reviews of these in 1999 and 2000, so as to ensure that Irish national legislative/regulatory regimes are respected.
Both the ICPD in Cairo and the Beijing Declaration refer to the need to grant sexual and reproductive rights to women but these rights are qualified by the need to respect national legislative processes when considering the issue of abortion.
'Any measures or changes related to abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or local level according to the national legislative process.' ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163)
We voted in favour of this report, as it contains many positive aspects, of which I wish to highlight the following:
urges the Commission to allocate resources to prevention measures within the framework of the Public Health Action Programme to combat HIV/AIDS and to require that the beneficiaries of public funds devote a certain amount of their research to such diseases;
highlights the fact that palliative care has an important part to play in the care of people with HIV/AIDS and urges its development and expansion throughout the European Union;
asks the Commission to pay particular attention to the promotion of sexual and reproductive health programmes for women, in order to counter the increasing spread of the epidemic among the female population;
encourages the Commission and the Member States to subsidise and provide money for research and development of microbicides and female condoms which give women the power to protect themselves and a male partner from HIV/AIDS with or without the partner's agreement, since condoms continue to be the most well known and widely available protection against HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), but require a male partner's agreement.
in writing. (PL) I am voting in favour of the report on combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries in the years 2006-2009.
Mr Georgs Andrejevs' report is an excellent response to the European Commission's Programme for 2006-2009 to combat HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries.
The rapporteur rightly sets out the need for a comprehensive public information campaign which will help both to increase awareness of how to avoid AIDS, and to start fighting the stigma and discrimination suffered by people suffering from the disease.
The latest trends show an increasing numbers of people infected with the virus.
Georgs Andrejevs has underlined the role played by international organisations in combating AIDS, noting at the same time that they do not have sufficient funding to play that role properly.
The rapporteur's initiative encouraging the Commission and the Member States to assess their methods of supporting their health services, which are at the forefront of the difficult situation of ensuring general accessibility to costly anti-retroviral treatment, deserves our support.
in writing. - (EL) The 2006-2009 report on treating HIV/AIDS in EU and neighbouring countries highlights some correct aspects of the issue.
It omits, however, to refer to the need of the people for prevention, treatment of HIV/AIDS through common, public and free of charge modern health systems of the Member States.
It does not provide any answers to the demand of the people for the free provision of all necessary medications to patients.
The research on HIV/AIDS treatment is part of the anti-grassroots 7th framework programme on research, tailored to the needs of multinational corporations.
The treatment of HIV/AIDS requires a comprehensive plan by Member States.
NGOs cannot play such a role.
The request to reinforce NGOs aims to disorientate the work force away from the responsibilities of Member State governments, away from the current needs of people in the health sector.
Workers are once again being forced to carry the burden through volunteer work.
The responsibility for the treatment of HIV/AIDS does not lie in the hands of one and joining forces with corporations will not prove effective, because they are only interested in making profit.
It is an issue concerning all workers, for they have to fight and force governments to take comprehensive measures regarding prevention and research as well as access to medications and treatments which are currently overpriced..
in writing. I voted for this report, which seeks to strengthen the fight against HIV/AIDS by promoting prevention through education and information and by combating discrimination and inequalities with regard to access to treatment and drugs.
I have abstained because I do not feel this is an initiative that has any hope of reversing the upward trend in HIV/AIDS infection in the EU.
HIV/AIDS causes great suffering and yet Parliament at committee stage refused to include all approaches known to be effective.
I want to save lives and I will wait and give a positive vote to any truly positive initiative.

Galileo (debate)
The next item is the Commission statement on Galileo.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Parliament for having taken the initiative for this resolution.
The content of the resolution assists the efforts of the Commission.
Its adoption in plenary is further testimony of the European Community's clear and unwavering desire to bring to a successful conclusion this great European project that is Galileo.
What is the situation?
In the face of a standstill in the contract negotiations with the consortium candidate and in the absence of progress on the conditions that I laid down a year ago, I have issued an ultimatum with precise deadlines in order to break this deadlock.
On the basis of this ultimatum, supported by the Council, I have received a mandate from the Council to work on all the possible options.
The work of the Commission on the basis of the Transport Council's mandate of 22 March 2007, to which your resolution gives invaluable support, is progressing satisfactorily.
The result of this work will be the subject of a communication to Parliament and to the Council, which the Commission intends to adopt on 10 May 2007, that is, a month before the next Transport Council in June 2007.
This communication will respond to all the demands made by the Council of 22 March 2007 and by Parliament in the resolution that you are going to adopt.
This communication will include an examination of the current situation, of the difficulties faced by the programme, including the reasons for the deadlock in the concession contract negotiations, then an analysis of the chances of a rapid conclusion of the concession contract and also alternative solutions to the plan adopted until now.
There will be no taboos, whether on the causes of the current difficulties, on the possible timetable, or on the issues relating to finance or to governance.
As far as alternative solutions are concerned, several options are possible.
They range from retaining the project in its present form to, obviously, ending it, which I do not envisage, of course.
An intermediate solution could be for the public sector to assume responsibility for the deployment of all or part of the satellite infrastructure, then, for its operation to be taken on by a private partner.
That is one of the alternatives.
Each of these alternatives, however, will be the subject of a detailed examination looking at their technical and financial implications, including in terms of governance.
The Commission's concern is still to ensure the best cost-benefit ratio for the project while avoiding further delays.
Avoiding fresh delays is crucial in the face of the risks that would arise from the modernisation of competing systems.
Of course, should the current plan be pursued and the concession contract negotiations resume very actively over the coming weeks, I will inform Parliament of the progress achieved.
I should like now to speak to you about the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programme, which improves the global positioning system for European users.
The European Space Agency will complete the operational readiness review of this system by March 2008.
EGNOS will then be ready for full operation, and an economic operator able to use the EGNOS applications will have to be found before March 2008.
The European institutions will also be in a position to provide funding for the system from that same date.
I am insisting on this slightly because EGNOS will give us the opportunity, already, to evaluate some applications for satellite navigation, and it is therefore of great interest, because it is the first step that will pave the way for Galileo.
Concerning the funding for the European satellite navigation programmes, you know that the Commission proposed from July 2004 a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.
This proposal provided for a specific legal instrument for the Galileo programme that was consistent with the future European Space Programme and that responded to the concern for sound financial management within the financial framework 2007-2013.
This proposal mentions provisional arrangements for financial aid from the European community amounting to EUR 1 billion.
The Council reached a partial general approach on this proposal on 21 April 2005.
Parliament also adopted a positive opinion at first reading on 5 September 2005.
The definitive costing will depend on which options are taken up and, of course, it will be submitted in good time to the budgetary authority.
Concerning governance of the Galileo programme, the Commission is currently considering ways that are likely to enable more effective coordination between the different actors in the programme: the Commission itself, the Supervisory Authority and the European Space Agency.
A word now about external relations.
International agreements concerning the Galileo programme are negotiated on the basis of Article 300 of the Treaty.
The procedure laid down in this article still includes consultation with Parliament prior to the conclusion of these negotiations.
I am, of course, aware of Parliament's concern to be closely involved in the monitoring of governance.
With regard to the applications of Galileo and to the Green Paper on these applications, the public debate phase is about to come to an end.
More than 70 contributions have been received, from a wide range of actors.
The Commission must now analyse the results before working out the plan of action to be implemented from 2008.
You know, ladies and gentlemen, that Galileo is the most ambitious industrial project that Europe has ever undertaken.
Naturally, I am keen this evening to seek the support of Parliament, taking into account the difficulty of the undertaking, but also our desire to make it succeed.
It is true that the month ahead is going to be a time of extremely hard work for the Commission and for the competent services, in order to find the best solutions that will enable us to emerge from the current situation and move the programme forward in due time.
That is what I wanted to bring to the attention of Parliament this evening.
Of course, during the course of the studies under way, I shall make it a point of honour to keep Parliament informed, and I would thank it in advance, Mr President, for agreeing, in the proposed resolution to be voted on tomorrow, to give us the assistance we need to convince the Member States that a project such as this is too important for the future of Europe not to be pursued with determination.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Mr Vice-President, thank you for the detailed information.
This afternoon at the opening of the Airbus photo exhibit we heard of the impressive achievements of 21st century European developmental engineers.
But we have also heard from the representative of Airbus that the problems arose with manufacturing, that the delay has caused irremediable damages, and also that Airbus was not European enough but was governed by considerations of the Member States.
Now Galileo has also embarked on this road, but since the spring Council, it seems the Council, the Commission and Parliament have agreed that these errors can still be avoided in time.
Last autumn, Parliament drew the attention of the Commission and of the Council to the growing number of unsolved problems and delays, and therefore we welcome and are pleased, Mr Vice-President, with your bold move and decisive action.
I can assure you, Mr Vice-President, that you will have the support of the European Parliament in the resolution of the most difficult questions if a transparent, clear and feasible timetable and affordable financing are finally worked out, either by means of negotiation or by an alternative solution.
This is what we are waiting for: effective, better public governance, clear political lines of responsibility for the acquisition of the necessary tools.
We are looking for an unambiguous response regarding the overall need for Community financing and responsibility.
We are awaiting a clear answer at last from the players in the European space industry, regarding financial participation, the mode of funding based on a 2/3 formula, since this is what was stated in the call for tenders.
Galileo is the first Community infrastructure, and this is why the European Parliament is following it with great interest.
Mr Vice-President, you mentioned that the EP voted almost 1 billion euro for the Galileo programme in its seven-year budget.
The amount is available as of 1 January, and we would like to know what we will spend it on and how we will make use of it.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly a bit frustrating to see the pretty pass we have gradually come to because of the delay in the Galileo project.
It is unquestionably an ambitious venture to conduct a PPP project on a European scale for the first time.
However, the small and medium-sized enterprises that took part in the survey conducted through the Green Paper are waiting for the go-ahead to devise, produce and market their applications, so that the jobs they all expect to create can actually materialise.
The business community expects us to keep it free from political interference.
'Business does business' is a familiar saying.
Time and again, however, although I personally am always very business-friendly, I get the feeling that, whenever the business community hits difficulties, it reverts to appeals for political assistance and shies away from taking risks.
Fair sharing of investment, risks and profits is of paramount importance in the PPP model.
The proposal in the opinion delivered by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy that funds be held in reserve for the Supervisory Authority in the first instance was intended by us as an admonition to all parties to move forward and make up for lost time.
We know full well that this is rather like kicking the dog and meaning the master, to quote an old proverb, but unfortunately we have no other means of exerting pressure.
We remain optimistic, and our Socialist Group in the European Parliament also continues to support the project, but our patience is not inexhaustible.
I hope the time limits and deadlines that have been set will now serve to bring together the business participants and the requisite consortium.
To close with another proverb, actions speak louder than words. It is time to let them speak.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion tonight on Galileo, but it gives me a very strange sensation of being in a time warp.
It was seven months ago that we last had a plenary discussion on this topic and it is very alarming to realise that no progress has been made since then.
On that occasion in September I expressed my concern, as did other Members, at the spiralling cost of the project.
We need to be brutally honest: no taboos, as the Commissioner said.
Galileo has the potential to be a great European project, but technology moves very fast.
There has been so much delay that the point could be reached where it is simply not worthwhile doing any more.
Galileo is dependent on revenue and, if it offers no added value, then no one will pay to use it.
I listened with great interest to what Commissioner Barrot said.
It seems that something which has at last changed is the Council and Commission's willingness to take firm action.
I very much welcome the 10 May deadline and the insistence that substantial, immediate progress be made by then on the heads of terms.
I also welcome the undertaking to explore alternatives for delivering the project, but I am alarmed at the possibility of an interim solution dependent on the public purse.
Finally, the Commission has said that it may have to revisit some fundamental aspects of its earlier assumptions and approach.
I would ask the Commissioner whether with hindsight he would concede that it was a mistake to agree in July 2005 to the merging of the two consortia.
It seems to me that this was the point when the Commission lost all leverage.
Would he now agree that it is the spur of competition and the existence of alternatives which is most likely to keep a public/private partnership on schedule and in budget?
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in its financial perspective, the European Union is making a significant effort to launch this Galileo programme.
We now have an obligation to ensure that the Union's money is spent and managed properly.
If the programme's private partners are not fulfilling their obligations, they must be replaced immediately.
We trust that the Galileo system will be operational as soon as possible and will become a key element in helping transport and improving the observation of our environmental problems, such as climate change.
We would like the Galileo project also to be compatible and interoperable with the conventional navigation systems, such as the GSM, and others.
It is important that they are interconnectable and complementary.
Together with the US GPS and the Russian GLONASS, they must contribute to improving our navigation system.
At the same time we must continue to monitor the programme in order to ensure that Galileo's applications respect the strictest ethical and human rights standards.
We are now asking ourselves, however, whether Galileo is simply an illusion or whether it will be a reality.
I wonder whether the European Commission's capacity for management is sufficient for the circumstances and challenges of Galileo.
The European Union's prestige is at stake.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, there is a perfectly good existing satellite system available for EU citizens' use.
But we all know that Galileo is really about extending the power and dominion of the European Union and it is eventually intended to be used for military purposes by the planned EU armed forces.
Meanwhile, the funding plans of this grandiose project, which will run into billions of euros, are encountering severe difficulties.
The British Government, ever with an eye for an additional taxation opportunity, plans to use it to implement road-charging schemes so that British citizens can help pay for it by being charged for the privilege of driving on their own roads.
Galileo has all the makings of an Airbus in space and, as Galileo Galilei pointed out, what goes up must come down.
In this case it would be much better if it did not go up in the first place.
(PL) Mr President, the GALILEO satellite navigation system will secure the European Union's place in global civilisation in the coming century.
The selfish interests of individual corporations and countries will not succeed in undermining the entire Union's justified interest in this.
The European Parliament is concerned by the delays in implementing the GALILEO project and demands that the Commission submit a plan which will guarantee that the European Union's own satellite navigation will actually take off.
The European Parliament must support the Commission in its drive to get GALILEO built in an alternative way by a group of contractors different to the consortium set up in 2005.
We have to remember that Europe may be overtaken by the Russian GLONASS or the Chinese BEIDOU system.
The GALILEO system will guarantee the European Union's future place in civilisation.
Mr President, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for the support she has given to this programme, at the same time as being very vigilant, because she has always asked the right questions about it.
I should like to be very clear before Parliament: I do not think, Mrs Hall, that the problem is due to the fact that there is only one consortium.
The real problem is that the Galileo programme was launched with a public-private partnership that perhaps was not worked out as well as it might have been.
The public-private partnership is still based on a very precise business plan, and I would add that, in the United States, independence in space was acquired from the Army's military budget, which later allowed NASA to develop its services.
I think, therefore, that we have to ask ourselves the fundamental questions now.
Does the public-private partnership - even if we keep it - have to have exactly the same dimension?
That is the problem.
I do not believe, in all conscience, that there being one consortium or two is really the problem.
The real problem now is knowing whether the applications of Galileo offer an added value such that they justify a commitment from the Union at the level at which this commitment is envisaged.
I heard also that Galileo could be useless.
We have to know whether we want for the European Union not only independence in space but also a whole series of advances in everyday life for the benefit of the citizens.
This is not merely a prestige programme, but a programme that is intended fundamentally to meet needs, and I am in a good position to know how much, in the field of transport, we could benefit from the Galileo programme.
I have promised, Mr President, to keep Parliament regularly informed about the progress of our deliberations.
I have to tell you that I have personally taken this issue very much to heart; I really want to take a very close look at things in order to make it clear that, if we have to modify somewhat the scenario that was conceived at the outset, it is so that we can be sure of its success.
Mr Glante in particular spoke of the benefits that could be gained by the citizens, as well as by small and medium-sized companies to which Galileo will offer new opportunities: you are right, that is indeed the heart of the matter.
We need to know what added value Galileo will provide and what all the applications that it will be possible to implement consist of.
We are in the process of studying all that very carefully.
That is all I can say this evening, but I shall remain at Parliament's disposal to talk about this fascinating, but difficult, subject.
I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Common rules in the field of civil aviation security (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 (14039/1/2006 C6-0041/2007 (Rapporteur: Paolo Costa).
rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, I am disappointed that the 'Transport live night show' is not the Council's favourite, since it was the Council in particular that I wanted to address.
I believe, in fact, that what I am about to repeat to my colleagues and the Vice-President of the Commission is well-known to them and I think they support my views, while we know that we have some problems with the Council.
Parliament has welcomed with great interest and considerable understanding the Commission's proposal to review the rules that attempt to tackle the problem of security with regard to any attack on airports, aircraft and the aviation system.
The Commission has tackled the issue with great openness, keeping in mind that we are setting about performing an important task, namely the creation of a single security system that will reduce inconvenience for passengers and make it possible to increase security and organise ourselves better to achieve that aim.
I think I can say that we have also brought about some improvement by seeking to define the limits within which it is possible to authorise armed personnel on board and by attempting to resolve the technical problems of the difference between carrying standard cargo and mail, identify procedures for organising inspections in airports, and deal with many other technicalities.
We got stuck, however, on one problem with regard to which I have still not managed to understand the logic behind the Council's opposition.
The issue is very simple: security is both a private matter and a public matter.
Each of us, when we travel, wants to travel safely.
When security can be affected by terrorist attacks, however, it is clearly in everyone's interests to defend ourselves collectively against such attacks.
In the United States, for example, this matter is considered to be an entirely public concern and the costs are borne wholly by the taxpayer.
On this point, I would like to repeat the idea which we have already put forward - and which we continue to put forward, perhaps obstinately - that we should accept the principle that the costs of security ought to be borne both by the citizen who travels and by the States that are protecting themselves, not least in airports and in aircraft, particularly since all we were asking for was for this principle to be accepted, leaving each Member State free to decide how to balance the contributions from the two sources.
As a second principle, we were asking that the security costs borne by the citizens should be transparent and clearly defined, and as a third principle we were asking for a guarantee that every surcharge paid for security should be actually spent on security.
We only asked for these three principles to be accepted, and gave up on the interinstitutional agreement signed back in 2001, on the basis of which the Commission was supposed to put forward much more detailed proposals to tackle the problem of funding security, which would have then, obviously, been approved by the Council too.
On this point we have not had a response and we have not been able to reach a conclusion.
I hope that, if the Chamber cannot recreate the unanimous vote in committee tomorrow, it can at least provide a substantial majority that will demonstrate not the power but the good will of Parliament to find a real solution to the problem for all European citizens.
I would like to stress the fact that unfortunately security is a subject that we will have to live with.
Hiding our heads in the sand and pretending that the funding problem does not exist is not a response worthy of the times, the problem and our expectations.
We therefore fully back more technically sophisticated organisation on the security front, but we ask that this issue be resolved, at least in principle.
If we succeed in achieving this objective as soon as possible, I think that we will certainly have acted in the interest of our citizens.
Mr President, Mr Costa, it is true that this proposal is important.
The fight against the terrorist threat clearly remains a priority for all the European Union institutions.
Aviation security requires constant adaptation.
We need to continue to seek ways to provide greater, effective protection for European citizens.
We need to draw lessons from experience and to reconcile the demands of security with the operational necessities of the parties involved: the administration responsible for the implementing rules, airport managers, airlines and, of course, passengers.
The existing regulatory framework on aviation security was established after the attacks of 11 September 2001. It was developed as a matter of urgency, which probably explains the excessively detailed nature of the annex to Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002.
The prescriptive and detailed nature of this annex is a handicap that prevents us from introducing new, more effective, technologies or from providing security systems better adapted to the actual risks to be accounted for.
Finally, it does not allow us to fill the regulatory gaps concerning air freight and the handling of flights from third countries.
Therefore, this new proposal, the purpose of which is to replace Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 with a new regulation that is better because it is both simpler and clearer, is obviously altogether desirable.
The adjustment of the rules on aviation security will improve the protection of citizens; it will make it possible to satisfy the legitimate interests of stakeholders because there will be a better balance between the risks to be taken into account and the extent of the checks to be carried out.
I admit, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that I would have preferred this proposal to have been adopted at first reading.
This delay is all the more regrettable when one realises, as I am doing today, that Mr Costa's draft report completely validates the necessity for this initiative, and we agree, Mr Costa, with most of the actual operational suggestions.
Mr President, I come now to the amendments that have been tabled.
More than half take up the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading.
Obviously, the Commission's position remains identical with regard to them.
I should like to make a few comments regarding some of the new amendments that have been tabled.
Firstly, Amendment 46 seems timely to me.
It will allow the Commission to cooperate more closely with the ICAO for the purpose of exchanging information and mutual support in connection with audits and inspections.
Therefore, Mr Costa, we welcome the approach set out in this amendment.
Amendment 33 includes a sunset clause for all the implementing measures that are to be reexamined after six months.
However, in a joint declaration annexed to the new decision on comitology, Parliament and the Council have nonetheless recognised that good legislation demands that the executive powers conferred on the Commission should be without time constraints.
I do, of course, understand the argument whereby a text that has come into force as a matter of urgency subsequently has to be reexamined, but nonetheless I am worried.
The systematic application of this principle could cause legal uncertainty, and the aviation sector may then be led to amend its procedures or to create new ones with disastrous consequences for the effectiveness of the procedures, passenger information and costs.
That is why I would prefer to reject Amendment 33 as it stands.
Having said that, I am inclined to accept the inclusion of a commitment to revise the text.
I shall take advantage of this opportunity to emphasise that the Commission constantly reviews the good functioning of measures adopted and that it does not hesitate to amend them if necessary.
Last week, as part of a half-yearly review, the Commission postponed by a year the introduction of a restriction on the size of hand luggage in order to be able to review the merits of this measure and, if necessary, to ensure that operators are better prepared to implement it.
Amendment 37 gives Member States the opportunity not to implement measures that they consider to be disproportionate.
This provision, if it were adopted, could undermine the system of EU-wide harmonised basic standards on aviation security.
We would be in danger of going backwards, to a patchwork of 27 uncoordinated national regulatory systems, and of reducing to nothing five years of work towards harmonisation.
This amendment is also liable to undermine the system of 'one-stop security' for intra-Community flights.
A series of amendments - Amendments 10, 67, 77, 79 and 81 - is intended to make it easier to draw up security agreements with third countries.
The intention of these amendments is good, but unfortunately they are not linked with a mandate.
They have the effect of making the task more difficult, contrary to their objective.
Therefore, we must reexamine chapters 4 and 5 of the annex to the proposed regulation on the basis of the Council's common position, in order to ascertain the aspects on which the Commission could reach an agreement.
These amendments, however, do not seem to me to be necessary to achieve the intended objectives.
That is why the Commission would prefer to reject them.
Mr Costa, you have identified, for the Council in particular, what the main stumbling block is: namely, funding for security in the field of aviation.
Clearly, this is an important debate.
For my part, I shall content myself with a more pragmatic approach to this issue.
Europe needs an instrument that helps ensure that standards adopted in relation to aviation security are implemented in accordance with rules guaranteeing fair conditions of competition.
This level playing field must apply both within the European Union but also with regard to global competitors
Having said that, it is true: who pays the bill?
I should like to take as an example one proposed amendment.
It says that Member States that introduce security procedures that are more numerous and more stringent than those required by European Union legislation should indemnify the operators for the extra costs that those stricter measures entail.
I understand very well the underlying logic of this viewpoint.
It is also true that the Commission has a tool in this field, and that is the Treaty rules on State aid.
Therefore, we ourselves will look at how these rules can be used properly in the context of the financial support measures for service providers in the field of aviation security.
I fully understand what Mr Costa said in his address to the Council.
I should like, however, to draw Parliament's attention to the drawbacks of a delay in introducing an improved technical regulation on aviation security.
There is somewhat of a danger that we will take this draft Community regulation as a kind of hostage against the financial decisions to be taken at Member State level.
I would therefore like it if Parliament were to separate the technical standards of the security funding issue in order to clear the way for the swift implementation of a better regulation.
That is my wish, but the decision is yours.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, firstly I would like to make one point.
I would like to put on record my objection to legislation of such importance to European citizens being put on the agenda in the late evening.
It seems to be common practice that codecision legislative proposals are discussed when the fewest MEPs and members of the public are present, and that is wrong.
The core issues being discussed in this graveyard slot are the revisions to the 2001 aviation security rules, which are very much welcomed.
Having common regulations on this issue, as well as a common interpretation of the rules around all of the EU's airports, means that security and passenger safety can be improved at a time when it is most needed.
However, we cannot expect the travelling public to have to foot the bill yet again.
I refer here to short-term special security measures such as the ones we saw last year at Heathrow airport in London.
These measures are a direct result of Member State decisions and therefore should be funded by general taxation, not by the passenger, who is already fleeced when travelling by air.
This issue has been the most contentious with Council.
Parliament, however, stands united.
This should send a strong message that the issue is not for negotiation.
Also, when looking at our previous aviation security legislation, we see that problems have developed, especially in the context of implementation.
As we say, the devil is in the detail.
For example, tons of in-transit duty-free goods are being confiscated from consumers.
I now hear that this issue is being addressed and that the Commission will be coming forward with proposals to alleviate this problem.
I must pay tribute to Commissioner Barrot and to Commission President Barroso for taking action here and I hope to see Commission officials follow their political lead and come up with speedy and workable solutions.
I must also insist that Parliament be kept informed of developments in this and other areas, as it is MEPs who have to answer to their citizens when things start to go wrong at Europe's airports.
I do not want to see a delay to the implementation of these proposals over relatively minor issues.
To conclude, we must not play politics with passenger safety.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to start, on behalf of my group, by thanking the rapporteur for the good work, and express our support for the strategy he has proposed, namely to stand firm as long as the Council refuses to change its position.
The issue in question is an important one for Europe's citizens, and Parliament has its role to play.
For my group, there are two key aspects in the negotiation process.
Firstly - and this is something to which the rapporteur has already made reference - anything related to funding.
Let me give you a brief outline.
There is, actually, not a problem with regard to funding the measures that are issued by the notorious committee of experts, because it is only logical that industry, passengers and the government should all contribute towards the costs.
What is important is that this is done transparently, that, in other words, the consumer is informed of the cost of safety, and that what is set aside in terms of safety costs is also actually spent on safety and not on something else.
There is, of course, the problem of additional costs which, as we see it, should be covered by the states, provided we can assume that the safety measures are of a high level and are commensurate to everyone's safety.
A second aspect, which is not unimportant either, Commissioner, is democratic control.
You have to understand that we can hardly give this committee of experts some kind of carte blanche.
It is not that we are in any doubt as to their competence, but when these measures have such an impact on the way our citizens move, then we have a duty to do our job, namely to check whether the decision is sound, whether it is proportionate to the threat, whether it is efficient, whether the people are sufficiently informed, etc.
This is why we would like to find a way of assessing these things and the impact they will have.
We have tabled an amendment to this effect.
We are prepared to thrash this out in a debate, but I think it is important that in the ultimate scheme, Parliament has a role to play.
I should like to make one final point, Commissioner, and it is that a few weeks ago, you announced that an evaluation of the liquids regulation was in the offing.
I should now like to ask you when we can expect it.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteurs.
The document before us is a complex one and it was certainly not easy to seek and find compromises, as the debate has ultimately demonstrated.
Despite this, the report that has emerged is in my view a solid one, and as a shadow rapporteur I should like to thank both the translators and my colleagues for their cooperation.
I feel that it is possible to support the report in principle, although it does contain around four issues on which, following consultation with a number of experts, I still have reservations, and about which I should like to speak in more detail.
First and foremost is the question of the funding for safety measures in the area of civil aviation, as has already been mentioned.
I feel that it would be difficult to resolve the funding issue within the framework of this regulation.
For example, in the case of road and rail transport it took a parallel directive to resolve similar issues.
In the case of civil aviation we do not have an adequate statutory act and we are proposing a different course of action.
Another controversial part of the report is, in my view, the proposals on incorporating transparency of the cost of safety into the price of plane tickets.
This is difficult to accomplish because companies selling plane tickets do not have the necessary overview of security costs for airports.
Those who do know what the costs are incorporate them into airport fees.
Similarly problematic is the use of the expression 'that protect the safety of civil aviation'.
This phrase applies mainly to the protection of civil aviation from terrorism, which is important but forms only part of the package of measures on protection against unlawful acts.
I believe that there is a danger of inaccurate interpretation here and of the problem being narrowed to include only terrorism, whereas there are many other unlawful acts in the area of civil aviation.
In referring to the controversial points of the report before us I would not like in any way to call into doubt the overall quality of the work and of the document as a whole.
I will conclude, however, by warning that Amendments 4 and 45 will lead to the Commission's position being very much strengthened, which, in my opinion, is not necessary at this time.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that these comments include more than the usual level of detail, which is due to the fact that the proposal has, to a certain extent, the character of a technical regulation, the objective of which is to establish basic parameters for safety standards in the area of civil aviation.
I have attempted therefore not only to incorporate these into the proposed Amendments but also to express my views as a former pilot, where I considered it necessary, in respect of the document as a whole.
(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, my group stands four-square behind the rapporteur.
Let us make no bones about this.
Our Parliament reminded the Member States back in 2002 that they had to meet their share of the cost of measures for the protection of public safety and order.
We asked you to formulate a strategy for resolving the issue of funding the security measures without distorting competition between airports.
You then presented a report, but in that report you neither said, 'Here is a way we could resolve the issue without distorting competition', nor did you say there was no point in making a proposal.
So we still await a proposal.
We told the Council last year that we expected it to acknowledge clearly its financial responsibility.
It stated once more that it was not prepared to do so.
We are no longer prepared to play these games, which have been going on since 2002, in other words for five long years.
There is no real pressure to carry out this revision, because you were able to enact the basic regulations we now have - the measure regarding liquids in hand baggage being the prime example - on the strength of these rules.
I am not entirely sure whether this measure will remain in place for long.
There is no reason to say that it has to be scrapped now because it is blocking some other security measures.
If you want to propose new security measures, bring them before Parliament.
We are open to new proposals.
What we mean is that, besides the issue of liquids in hand baggage, on which the Committee on Transport and Tourism is to hold a hearing, we must tackle risk analysis as a matter of priority, and I hope we can do that together with you.
I have serious doubts as to whether the present Regulation actually enhances security or whether it is too heavy-handed.
But let us discuss that openly.
Please do not say, 'The intelligence people have information that they cannot pass on to us'.
We have a responsibility to the public to provide straight answers.
Your departments, and more particularly those of the Council, must be prepared to lay their cards on the table, for we will no longer tolerate the present tactics.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the revised version of Regulation 2320/2002 is good and should be applied as quickly as possible.
First of all, let me make two points about the sunset clause.
We are confronted here with a dilemma.
No politician, and indeed no civil servant, will take responsibility for rolling back inefficient security structures.
Accordingly, the burden of proof must lie with those who seek to extend an implementing regulation and not with those who want to let it expire.
That is the main argument.
Secondly, there is sometimes a need to respond very quickly, as you did in the case of the liquids, but the fact is that the risk assessment and cost analysis must follow, so that the process takes its right and proper course.
The sunset clause is also a good means to this end.
Now to the main issue, the dispute about funding.
We should refocus on the problem that exercised us at the beginning, namely how we can eliminate distortions of competition and obtain transparent and, as far as possible, uniform funding models in Europe.
The Commission must intervene here in a mediating role.
We should not focus so sharply on the question whether taxpayers or passengers should foot the bill.
That discussion, I believe, has become unproductive and no longer addresses the real issue.
We need proposals on ways to achieve transparent funding models in Europe that are as uniform as possible.
Mr President, while there is a lot of huffing and puffing about aviation security and its restrictions on international travel and inconvenience to passengers, the reality is that there is a real international security problem.
9/11 did happen; thousands of people died.
The threat to British aviation was a real and not an imaginary threat.
The people who perpetrated 9/11 as well as those responsible for the foiled attack on Britain are not only still in existence but they have also publicly stated that they intend continue their campaign of international terrorism.
Let us be real.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism and the Council have a common cause here, and what is it?
It is the protection of the aviation sector and the protection of the millions of passengers who travel annually.
Looking at the standoff between the Council and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, one would imagine that we had a polarisation of two ends of the planet, representing two different interests, instead of two parallel political participants here in Europe who are supposedly looking after the common interest of the travelling public.
If there is to be conciliation, let us get on with it right away.
What is needed is a civil aviation security agreement that guarantees security and safety.
What is needed is a civil aviation security agreement that allows individual Member States to decide to opt out of certain proposed measures such as the sky marshals.
What is needed is a commonly agreed set of measures designed for passenger security which - and this is a crucially important point - firstly, will be subject to a review every six months, secondly, to see if they are successful, thirdly, if they need modification and fourthly, how much they cost.
What is not needed is the kind of standoff that we are debating here this evening.
We all have one common cause - passenger security- so let us get on with it.
Is it any wonder that the people of Europe are, to put it mildly, sceptical about the way we operate in this Parliament when we have this kind of standoff between the Commission on the one hand, the Council on the other and Parliament, while we all have a common cause?
Mr President, I would also like to commend Mr Costa on his report.
As he said in his introduction, we all want to travel safely and securely.
Both Mr Higgins, just now, and Mr Bradbourn, before him, referred to the alert over liquids in the UK last summer.
Unlike Mr Jarzembowski, most of us think that this threat is not just ever-present, but that it is one that is changing all the time.
We cannot let up or compromise where aviation safety and security is concerned.
European countries need to work together to achieve the highest possible standards, and yes, that does mean that some countries may wish to go further and put additional measures in place.
But on other aspects passengers are confused.
Why are some airports seemingly more secure than others?
Why is there no European agreement yet on hand baggage allowances - on what is permitted and what is not?
Mr Barrot, you said that we need to guarantee that safety rules are applied, and that is crucial.
But you also spoke about fair competition, and I am not sure where competition comes into this debate.
Competition could mean compromise and, as others have said, there is no compromise when talking about aviation security.
We all have to work together in this field.
(DE) Mr President, we all want the highest possible standards.
The only question is who should decide what will guarantee the highest possible level of security.
To a certain extent, all of us here can regard ourselves as experts, simply because we are almost daily air travellers.
One thing we do know is that every single one of us can easily circumvent the new rules on liquids at any checkpoint.
What is on the table here is a placebo, designed to ensure that people feel safe but certainly not increasing security.
That is the real problem.
We have to tackle it, which is the purpose of the two amendments tabled by Mr Stockmann and myself, through which we seek to ensure that this House debates what constitutes a genuine security-building measure and what is merely a placebo.
On this point we can truly regard ourselves as experts, and so we say in all clarity that, six months after the introduction of this provision, we have no need of special rules; what we need is a more rational consideration of this issue than it has previously been given.
In actual fact, what we have here is a kind of extraterritorial US law, enacted jointly with Britain.
That is how we see it.
The British or even the American tail is wagging the European dog.
That will not do.
We therefore call for the most rapid possible review, and if that review does not result in a real increase in security, the measures must be allowed to expire.
That would compel us all to think seriously again about real potential remedies to the present problem.
Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all of the speakers and, in particular, to thank Mr Costa for his report.
It is clear that a better balance between security demands and operational aspects is a real challenge for all of us.
That is why we need a new framework regulation that is simpler and more flexible; I must insist on that.
I am going to answer a few questions before turning to financing.
Mr El Khadraoui, the Commission is endeavouring to keep the European Parliament regularly informed of developments, and in a few days' time you will have a hearing of experts, for which Mr Costa has kindly taken the initiative.
I believe that this is the right method for trying to understand and to have some information from those who were behind these provisions.
Mr Bradbourn, I must say to you that we are actively working on the problems relating to duty free goods.
I hope that, in a few weeks' time, I will be able to give you some answers on this point.
He is not here, but I am speaking to all Members.
I come now to the problem of funding.
Firstly I should like to say that I understand very well the position of the Commission and of Mr Costa.
I think first of all that we must try to avoid distortions of competition.
That seems perfectly logical to me.
I realise, like Mr Jarzembowski, that we have to try to find a compromise.
Nonetheless, together with the Council, we have to take account of the finance ministers.
The transport ministers do not entirely lay down the law in this field.
That, then, is where we come up against a problem.
What stays in my mind from this discussion between us, is your desire for transparency over the cost of security.
On that point, I cannot contradict you.
I think, in fact, that it is essential for the cost of security to be made transparent; this should at least be a first stage.
What I can say to you is that we need this regulation, as I have explained to you.
I would not want all that to fall apart because of a total lack of understanding on both sides between the Council and Parliament.
That being so, the Commission will play its role as mediator and we shall try, as far as is possible, to find a solution, Mr President, because, in the field of security, we must have the right tools and the appropriate tools.
That is why I am insisting somewhat on the adoption of this revised proposal, recognising at the same time the validity of Parliament's approach, which, on the subject of funding, requires greater transparency, more fair competition and, insofar as is possible, an effort towards harmonisation on the part of the Member States.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (FR) The Commission proposal introduces provisions that will enable definite progress to be made in the area of aviation security.
The issue of funding for these security measures has not been mentioned, however.
The amendments that we have adopted within the Committee on Transport and Tourism solve this problem and provide justified and balanced provisions.
It would not be fair to allow the whole burden of the cost of security measures to be passed on to air passengers.
It is desirable to avoid overburdening financially the users who already pay very high taxes on flight tickets.
That is why in my opinion we should support the proposal for mixed funding of security measures, that is, by the Member States and by users, and for funding of the more stringent measures to be made the responsibility of the Member States, and of them alone.
Furthermore, I support Amendment 33, which makes extending security measures dependent upon a thorough assessment of the risks, costs and impact of these measures.
One cannot apply indefinitely security measures that cause great inconvenience to passengers, such as the restrictions on liquids in hand baggage, without examining closely whether they are still appropriate and their consequences for travellers.
in writing. - Aviation security issues are of the utmost importance to our safety and need to be dealt with in a swifter manner than has so far been the case.
A common minimum standard of security is needed not only because of the real threat of aviation crime, but also for the perceived threat that a lack of security shows the public.
It is essential that Member States pay for the cost of new security mechanisms and short-term special measures.
Passengers should not need to pay for security.
Smaller regional airports might have a hard time paying for new expensive measures, while airlines cannot be asked to increase their ticket prices.
This is not a matter of passengers paying for the privilege of safety (this is no privilege but a given right), it is a matter of states keeping aeroplanes from crashing into populated areas on the ground.
An effective evaluation of the measures we put into place is essential.
Some measures might turn out to be superficial; others might need to be more efficient.
New mechanisms might need to be put into place.
Assessment and management of flood risks (debate)
The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of flood risks (12131/6/2006 C6-0038/2007 (Rapporteur: Richard Seeber).
rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a moment to thank my friend Jacques Barrot for repeatedly confronting the problems involved in transalpine freight haulage and for being our comrade-in-arms on the long march towards the solution of these problems.
Today, however, we are speaking about floods and what can be done about them at the European level.
At this juncture I wish to thank Commissioner Dimas and his staff, the shadow rapporteurs and the German Presidency, all of whom have worked very constructively with me to achieve an agreement at second reading, a far-reaching agreement that covers all the key issues.
I need hardly remind you that floods have become the commonest form of natural disaster in Europe.
In 2002 and 2005 we had raging floods with devastating effects.
They claimed people's lives and caused serious damage to housing and infrastructure.
Those floods hit us hard.
There is sound scientific evidence that heavy rainfall is becoming increasingly frequent and severe and that this trend is directly linked to human activity.
The first reason lies in concentrated urbanisation, especially in high-risk areas, with the development of built-up areas and streets, river realignments and ill-considered construction schemes on flood plains.
The second reason is deforestation, especially the authorised clearing of river valleys for developments such as the construction of holiday chalets but also for industrial estates and shopping centres.
Thirdly, highly intensive farming practices result in topsoil being sealed in concrete and reduce the availability of meadows and flood plains.
Fourthly, we have the phenomenon of soil erosion, which is also a contributory factor.
Following the catastrophic floods in 2002, the Commission presented a flood-response programme, which included provision for improvements in research and information.
The Commission also presented a Communication on flood-risk management, which analysed the situation and proposed a concerted EU action programme.
One of the components of that programme is the present proposal for a directive that has now culminated in the compromise package on which we shall vote tomorrow with a view to reducing the flood-related risks to human health, the environment, the infrastructure and the economy.
In view of the increased risk of flood-induced damage, it is truly essential to create a European regulatory framework alongside the national rules, because the great majority of rivers flow across national borders.
A total of 80% of Europe's rivers are not confined to a single country but straddle national borders.
It therefore went without saying that Europe had to respond to the flood problem.
This also means, however, that due consideration must be given to the subsidiarity principle in this legislation.
The fact is that conditions in a narrow Alpine valley differ from those on a Greek island or in the Finnish lowlands.
We must take care to avoid the adoption of blanket provisions that cannot be applied in the real world.
The package on the table wisely provides for three steps.
The first is an initial identification of the places where flood risks actually exist.
It would, of course, be pointless to establish flood defences in places where there is no specific risk.
The second step is the production of flood maps, and the third is the formulation of flood-risk management plans, but only where these are absolutely necessary.
Many Member States have already made great progress in the realm of flood prevention, and we also had to take care to avoid any duplication of effort.
This is why there are very comprehensive rules designed to safeguard existing arrangements, and Member States need have no fear of being compelled to implement a second set of measures.
Their own chosen measures can, of course, be implemented in full, as long as they are consistent with the aims of the Directive.
The Council's common position contained a few points which, in our opinion, required improvement.
In particular, we could not figure out why the phenomenon of climate change had received so little attention.
In our negotiations with the Council, we have succeeded in incorporating the issue of climate change, which now runs like a thread through the entire package.
That is only right and proper, for we must be seen to respond to public concerns.
To sum up the remainder of our efforts, there have been some changes in time limits, we have placed stronger emphasis on flood plains and other natural retention areas, and we have made the case for sustainable land use and asserted the principle of solidarity from start to finish.
The rule is that those on the upper reaches must not take any action that is detrimental to their downstream neighbours.
We managed to achieve this in a spirit of good European solidarity.
I can now present the report to the House with a clear conscience tomorrow, and I commend it to you.
Member of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur Mr Seeber for his exceptional work in the flooding directive, as well as the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its positive contribution.
I am extremely satisfied with the rapid progress in the first and second readings.
The European Parliament played a significant role in order to achieve agreement on an exceptional text and I would like to praise these efforts.
The aim of the proposal is to minimise the risks of flooding for human health, economic activities and the environment.
The text, in its current form, reflects these goals and allows the European Union to fulfil them.
The main characteristics are as follows: the directive introduces a procedure as previously mentioned by Mr Seeber in three stages, which begins with identifying the areas at risk of flooding.
The next step is mapping imminent flooding in the context of intermediate and extreme scenarios.
The third stage refers to the drawing up of flood risk management plans.
They will be coordinated across river drainage basins, basins shared by more than one country as well as coastal areas.
Within the framework of flood risk management, a possible increase in the frequency and intensity of floods due to climate change has been provided for and I agree with Mr Seeber I am very pleased with the fact that Parliament insisted there should be strong mention of climate change.
As the climate is already changing, it is clear that besides facing and abating the phenomenon, we will have to adapt to it.
The European Union will have to be prepared for unexpected floods on a larger scale that will be accompanied by intense and unforeseen rainfall.
Coastal floods due to storms, together with the increase of sea levels, might pose more risks from floods in coastal areas.
The European Union must be ready to face dangers posed by the said natural phenomena.
The improvement of coordination through the water framework directive is an important step forward.
The comprehensive management of the river drainage basins must include both elements: controlling water quality and flood risk management.
I am very pleased that the European Parliament has stood by the Commission on this issue and also for the fact that the scope of coexistence of both procedures has been expanded.
The basic points raised at first reading remained. Namely the implementation of the directive across the European Union and especially the emphasis on river drainage basins shared by more than one Member State.
With this new and significant legislative act the European Union will be ready to decrease and minimise the potentially destructive consequences of floods.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur, Richard Seeber, for the cooperative spirit in which our discussions took place.
He has negotiated a robust compromise with the Council Presidency, a compromise that makes significant improvements to the proposal from the Commission.
It is important to adopt a European approach to the prevention of flood damage. Rivers and floods are no respecters of national borders.
The measures taken by the government of a country on the upper reaches of a river have specific effects on territories further downstream.
In many cases these territories belong to another country.
For this reason I consider it important that each and every Member State of the European Union should take preventive anti-flood measures rather than waiting until a disaster occurs.
As with other proposals from the Commission, it is our parliamentary duty to ensure that unnecessary red tape, excessive administrative input and pervasive reporting obligations are avoided.
We managed to prevent and considerably improve a number of excessively bureaucratic provisions.
I particularly approve of the compromise safeguarding flood plans and maps that already exist or are being prepared.
Thanks to our intervention, all maps and plans already compiled by the Member States are now recognised along with those that are in the course of preparation, provided they are completed by the end of 2010.
The process of drawing and producing these flood maps is in full swing in some countries.
Moving the goalposts at this stage would have caused unnecessary duplication of effort, and the new tendering procedure would have generated a great deal of additional expense without any recognisable benefit in terms of better flood prevention.
For this reason I am pleased that the compromise provides for the possibility of recognising these maps and plans in the framework of the Directive.
I shall therefore vote for the compromise, and may I once again thank the rapporteur for our constructive cooperation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Seeber on the manner in which he conducted the informal negotiation process.
The negotiations were most fruitful and led to a package of compromise amendments that demonstrated broad consensus and that the Council should accept.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament supports the compromise that has been reached as it corresponds to the key objective of this directive, namely to protect human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activities, while taking account of the impact of climate change on the occurrence of floods.
There are increasing periods of extreme drought followed by heavy rainfall, which results in more flooding.
The proposal before us will ensure greater environmental protection by promoting the inclusion in risk maps of information on potential sources of environmental pollution arising from floods.
I also welcome the idea of making the Member States responsible for promoting the sustainable use of soils.
In other words, the Member States should take more care in their spatial planning policies.
The report also calls for solidarity, dialogue and coordination between neighbouring countries.
We know that there is a cycle of natural disasters leaving a trail of death and destruction.
According to the World Health Organisation, hundreds of people die each year on account of natural disasters.
In order to prevent worse evils, the time has come to move from a culture of reaction to one of prevention.
Prevention is better than cure.
It is more effective and less costly.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would naturally like to thank Mr Seeber for the collaboration that we enjoyed while debating and drafting this document.
I would also like to thank Commissioner Dimas, because his presence at such times is always very valuable and highly appreciated.
This is a directive that I believe to be very important, partly in the context of other directives, such as the directive on water, the directive on waste and the directive on soil, which is yet to be debated.
These directives form a very important framework of prevention, particularly with regard to climate change, which is a phenomenon with its origins in global warming and which consists, basically, in a worsening of extreme events, such as an increase in rain intensity.
We therefore need to adopt a preventive approach across the board, particularly in the conservation of our land.
The directive in question is directed at this aim, since it has attempted to stress good practices that can be disseminated, as well as all the infrastructure and knowledge that can contribute to the long-term prevention and the short-term forecasting of floods, with a view to providing significant assistance to civil protection bodies in the management of emergencies.
This is a directive which I believe can easily be supported and I also welcome the compromise reached at trialogue.
On behalf of my group, I too therefore call on you to support the text under consideration.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks underlines the need for action which unfortunately is not always respected in business activity in practice.
Flood risk assessment and management should be the basis of long-term plans for engineering works, information systems and other means of flood damage limitation.
This directive should be tied to the provisions on assessing and avoiding the risk of drought, which also causes great economic and environmental damage.
Both these issues are related to water management and conservation.
If flood water were collected, it could be used to offset the impact of droughts.
Both systems should operate over entire river basins and take into account the interests of all the countries and regions involved.
I would like to thank Richard Seeber for his very competent report.
The proposed amendments enhance and supplement his document.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the seasonal and regional differences in precipitations, long-term climate change and lack of coordination between some countries have resulted in catastrophic floods which account for 43% of all natural disasters in Europe, and are often of a trans-border nature.
Human activity has played its role in this.
It includes felling trees in forest regions, which has led to soil erosion and faster run-off of rain, or urban development in flood plains.
The increasing frequency and intensity of flood events will probably be closely linked with meteorological conditions and climate change as well as changes in river flows.
This makes it imperative to take measures to prevent flooding and to minimise its effects.
While preventing global warming is an important element in this, planning and coordination among Member States on the construction of retention reservoirs, dams, warning systems and disaster relief are just as important.
In the past, emptying reservoirs in one country have resulted in flooding disasters in the next.
Because of the trans-border nature of these events, we must ensure effective international cooperation, both regional and with neighbouring countries, including third countries, which will help us to prepare better and will lead to a reduction in the effects of flooding.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Seeber, it may be the case that we suffer less frequently from floods than we used to because of increasingly effective preventive measures, but their effects are nevertheless disastrous.
Regrettably, technical progress has made us grow careless, with the result that buildings are ever more frequently erected in ever closer proximity to flood-prone areas.
Together with what is often reckless interference with river alignments and the loss of natural retention areas such as flood plains, these actions have created a self-inflicted problem.
The agricultural support provided by the European Community over the past few decades has no doubt done its bit too, and the interaction between agricultural use and changes in soil structure are one more reason to rethink the common agricultural policy with a view to focusing more support on organic cultivation.
As part of the planned common system of flood-risk management, consideration must also be given, of course, to measures such as river restoration, the creation of links between flood plains and exposure of enclosed soil.
If we are serious about pursing the aims of preserving natural habitats and coping with climate change, we shall also have to adopt new, innovative approaches.
(HU) Hopefully tomorrow we will reach the end of a long journey.
Two years ago, when we began debating this directive, we experienced flooding throughout Europe, water sweeping away houses and destroying dams everywhere.
My country, Hungary, is a downstream country, a basin into which a great deal of water flows from many sources.
Two of Europe's five largest rivers flow through my homeland, and so it is not surprising that it has the largest amount of water per capita.
Naturally the damages, too, are enormous.
In 2005, at the time of the great flood that has already been mentioned, we were obliged to invest more than EUR 200 million in flood protection.
There was a lot at stake for us.
If I had to stress a particularly important element of the new directive, I would definitely speak of cooperation.
I feel that joint, planned preparation, sharing of information, and the provision of mutual assistance are all elements that appear in this regulation, and make it clear that we can only deal with and resolve the problem of flooding if we work together.
I agree with Mr Dimas: the future, global climate change, and the responses to these challenges constitute one of the most important questions.
It is probable that there will be more frequent and more unpredictable floods across Europe, along with more significant rises in water levels and greater destruction.
I feel that this directive will soon be put to the test, and I am absolutely sure it will come through with flying colours.
Fewer human lives will be lost and less damage caused thanks to this directive.
I am completely satisfied with the compromises reached, and congratulate Mr Seeber for his excellent work.
I feel that we have really succeeded in drafting a directive that will protect human lives and increase physical safety in Europe.
(DE) Mr President, in the wake of climate change, inadequate river management and building activities in flood-prone areas, floods are set to become an increasingly frequent occurrence.
Population growth and the accompanying increase in the number of economic assets in these areas give rise to higher risks and more costly damage.
Besides their economic and social impact, floods can have serious environmental consequences, for example if they hit industrial plants where large volumes of toxic chemicals are stored.
Our rapporteur has fully explained all of this.
The compromise package that our rapporteur has negotiated will enable us to pursue the aims of this Directive more successfully.
I would like to offer him my warmest congratulations.
Major points in his report have already been incorporated into the common position and can be put into even sharper focus through this compromise package.
It is important to the European Parliament that the impact of climate change is to be taken into account in the assessment of flood risks.
It would have been very difficult to explain the decision to leave climate change out of the equation when assessing flood risks.
One very important demand is that, in each of the three steps prescribed by this Directive, namely the flood-risk assessment, the production of maps and the formulation of management plans, best practices and the best available technology should be used.
(NL) Mr President, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, the Netherlands has played a major role in the development of the High-Water Directive as it is now before us.
It is important to have a legislative framework for assessing and managing flood risks, taking into account the principle of subsidiarity.
What can be done at local level is done locally, such as measures to prevent sewage systems from overflowing.
This is a way of protecting the environment, public health and the economy.
Since a low-lying country such as the Netherlands relies on many of its neighbouring countries where water management is concerned, it is important for Member States not to take measures that lead to increased flood risks in other countries.
It is for this reason that a coordinated approach is called for, and I set great store by the concept of solidarity which is included in this proposed directive and mentioned more explicitly in Amendments 48 and 61 of the compromise package, which I wholeheartedly support.
In addition to the term 'solidarity', it is also important to involve the expected climate change and its potential implications in drafts of risk management plans for floods, so as to prepare ourselves for the future in the best way we can.
All that is left for me to do now is to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for the excellent cooperation and to congratulate him on this result.
Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers in tonight's debate for their positive contributions.
A number of key elements have been included in the overall compromise package that is now proposed.
Most importantly it contains: a clearer and earlier attention to the impact of climate change in the preliminary assessment of flood risks; an agreement on the earlier date of 2011 for the first preliminary flood risk assessment, thus leaving Member States more time to prepare the flood maps; a strengthened role of flood plains and the promotion of sustainable land use practices in flood risk management; sound coordination - also in relation to implementation - with the water framework directive and a link to the cost recovery principles in that directive; a further strengthening of the language on solidarity in river basin districts; and last but not least, a requirement to set clear priorities for the implementation of measures included in the flood risk management plans.
I know that these elements were all important to Parliament at first reading and in the committee this time around.
I believe that the proposed current compromise will satisfy Parliament, as important ground has been won on key principles of sound flood risk management practices.
I am also particularly pleased to note the importance placed by both Parliament and the Council on this directive, which was only proposed by the Commission 13 months ago.
It shows that, faced with the serious challenge of preparing Europe for the risks of possibly increased flooding, agreements can be reached relatively rapidly.
To conclude, the Commission is very pleased with the outcome of negotiations.
The Commission can accept the proposed compromise amendments in full and I wish to thank and congratulate once more the rapporteur, Mr Seeber, for all his efforts to reach an agreement at second reading.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) It is extremely important for Hungary that the European Union enact a directive regulating a common defence against flooding.
My country is typically a downstream country to which 95% of fresh water comes from rivers outside its national borders.
Therefore, it is important that within a flood plain area the downstream countries be involved as well in the tasks of prevention and defence.
I trust that the Austrian, Slovak and Romanian experts will collaborate smoothly with Hungarian water officials in this task.
Likewise, I consider it important that flood protection plans contain those potential sources of danger which can cause environmental pollution in the event of a flood.
In such cases there is often a flooded industrial plant or another factory that causes more harm than the water damage itself.
Since just like air pollution, flooding knows no borders, third countries, such as the Ukraine, should be involved in implementing the directive.
in writing. - Through an organisation I chair in Ireland called Hope Project, I have been participating in Commission research entitled Rescuing Disabled People in Emergencies.
In this research we have identified flooding as a most significant risk for elderly people, children and people with disabilities.
We have just embarked on follow-up research that looks specifically at flooding.
There are two reasons why flooding is becoming such a problem.
First is climate change, with the possibility of rising sea levels, and in Ireland, increased rainfall.
Secondly, throughout Europe, but especially in Ireland, there is a trend of building on flood plains.
It is not uncommon to have fields that were under water for several weeks every year to now be the site of estates with 200 houses.
Eventually this practice will catch up with us.
I encourage the House to establish common sense and preventative action in the area of floods and flood control.
Thematic Strategy on the sustainable use of natural resources (debate)
The next item is the report by Kartika Tamara Liotard, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on a thematic strategy for the sustainable use of natural resources.
rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President and all those present at this late hour, I think that these are times when it is quality that matters, not quantity.
This is, I think, how you should look at it anyway.
The Commission has taken five years to produce a strategy for the sustainable use of natural resources.
That is a long time, and so it is very regrettable that the proposal it has submitted is so lacking in ambition.
To be fair, the Commission has clearly identified the problem, namely that if we carry on in this way, we will be irrevocably faced with exhaustion of our resources, and, along with it, a serious threat to our economy and our quality of life.
Thereupon, though, it also fails to come up with concrete measures.
It calls, inter alia, for more research and more data.
This is all well and good, but we cannot afford to wait for much longer.
Like climate change, the problem of natural resources is acute now, and now is the time we need to take concrete action.
When you read the proposal, there is a vague lack of urgency on the part of the Commission.
It does not invite the citizens to think about this issue all that much, although they are the people eventually who will bear the brunt of it all.
The heart of the matter is simple.
Our ecological footprint, in other words the environmental effect of our consumption, is much greater than what the earth can cope with.
By way of illustration, if this children's shoe is the ecological footprint we would be allowed to have in order for our natural resources to be in balance, this large men's shoe represents the current consumption level.
As you can see, it is really far too big.
This is, therefore, a good illustration of what we are doing at the moment.
I will be very honest, Commissioner.
The gut reaction in our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was that the entire document should be sent back to you and the Commission asked to rework it.
This, however, struck us as not very constructive and besides, we cannot afford to wait for another five years for action.
This is why I decided to commit to producing a sound proposal and called on all my fellow Members to help me in this task.
I can tell you, my fellow Members had a few amazing brainstorming sessions.
Working together, we came up with a large number of ideas to improve the Commission's document, and that took us not more than three or four months.
I would like to thank them, because we have really achieved a great deal.
On account of all these sound amendments, the lay-out of the report may not be anything to write home about, but I hope that the message is clear.
Parliament wants to see concrete measures rather than deferral.
I should like to single out a few proposals, the first of which concerns agriculture.
Agriculture does not feature in the thematic strategy, which is quite bizarre to my mind, if you consider that the agricultural sector is one of the largest users and consumers of natural resources.
This sector is therefore being denied a great opportunity.
I understand that the reason for this lies in the fact that DG Agriculture and DG Environment failed to see eye to eye on this.
It is unacceptable, though, that mutual bickering between European officials would lead to the strategy lacking a wide support base.
I would also propose linking European agricultural subsidies straight to sustainability.
To give you an example: subsidies for corn should be suspended if large-scale irrigation is needed and thus if water is being wasted, but subsidies should instead be given to farms that commit to using alternative energy sources, such as wind energy.
In addition to agriculture, there are also other sectors, including transport, fisheries and construction, that are not included in the strategy - wrongly so.
We will need to do something about that too.
In short, the strategy should cover all areas of policy.
The structure of the strategy is largely determined by the consumer and manufacturer.
Other proposals include a lifecycle approach, a top-10 list of priorities of threatened natural resources, tax incentives, the provision of information, the involvement of NGOs and experts, making use of alternative recycling and re-use.
Too many to mention, really.
I suggest that the EU, in general, seeks to halve the use of resources by 2030.
This is not science fiction, but a real necessity.
Needless to say, European policy should not stop the Member States from performing even better.
By setting the highest achieving Member State as an example to others, this trend can be promoted further.
During his most recent visit to the Committee on the Environment, Commissioner Dimas spoke about the importance of natural resources, and I was delighted to hear him do that.
I have sent him a letter, asking for his cooperation.
I live in hope, therefore, that this Commissioner will stand for a more ambitious policy than what the Commission's current document suggests.
If that is the case, a critical report from Parliament can only be something to which they can look forward.
Mrs Liotard can be sure that this Parliament has listened to her to the best of its ability at this time.
Member of the Commission. (EL) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like, first of all, to thank the European Parliament for the special attention paid to this strategy.
I would like to thank Mrs Liotard and the shadow rapporteurs for the preparation of the report under discussion today.
Indeed, it contains many constructive and useful data that make us think about possible future measures and build on them.
The use of natural resources is of vital importance both for the state of the environment and our economic growth.
The course of events is a cause for concern, while the consequences have become noticeable with the constant loss of biodiversity, the greenhouse gas emissions, the downgrading of the quality of water, of air and ground, but also at a significant financial cost.
It is evident that the way in which we use our natural resources constitutes a threat towards our ecosystems on which our quality of life and prosperity depend.
Therefore we are obliged to adapt our economic activities to our planet's endurance capabilities.
That is the aim of the strategy for natural resources, the result of vigorous often with disagreements but also extremely fruitful debate that has lasted for more than five years.
This strategy offers an approach to environmental policy which focuses on natural resources on the one hand and a long-term framework for limiting the environmental consequences from the use of natural resources in a developing economy on the other.
Moreover, it aims to improve efficiency when using natural resources.
Despite being very ambitious, these objectives are feasible.
Europe has already managed to stabilise the use of natural resources in certain sectors of the economy.
However, we lag behind other countries as for example in the case of Japan, which uses its natural resources much more efficiently compared to Europe.
The strategy promotes products, technologies and consumption patterns that are more efficient with regards to the use of natural resources and less pollutant.
New initiatives have already been undertaken for the implementation of the strategy.
Allow me to mention three examples:
First of all, the Commission is setting up a data centre, which will provide information for the policy planning, and this will lead to a better understanding of the use of resources and the consequences of various economic activities.
Secondly, in order to measure our progress in the direction of environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources, the Commission will pursue the development of a new generation of indicators.
Already many quantitative indicators have been established with regards to the use of natural resources, as for example in the energy and climate change sectors.
The determination of strict quality targets for atmospheric air and water and waste recycling targets contributes towards achieving the targets of the strategy on natural resources.
Through this strategy we will be able to work out the general quantitative goal of natural resources conservation in our economy.
Thirdly, we must adapt all our policies to take account of the use of natural resources based on the entire life-cycle.
We must take into consideration the environmental consequences of natural resources from their creation to their depletion, that is, from their birth to their death, so that the consequences are not transferred from one stage of life cycle to another or to other countries.
When, for example, we import processed metals to Europe we must not overlook the environmental consequences of mining in other countries.
The natural resources we actually use in Europe increasingly come from developing countries.
Biofuel is another characteristic example.
Therefore we are talking about a global challenge and we have to assume responsibility.
Together with the United Nations Environment Programme, we have set up an International Panel on the sustainable use of natural resources, which will start evaluating the consequences of the use of resources on our planet and will propose new measures.
The work programme of this new International Panel already includes issues, such as environmental conditions for the production of biofuel and the implementation of measures on a worldwide scale in order to boost the recycling society.
If this panel manages to reach the achievements of the International Panel on Climate Change, we will fulfil our goals to a great extent.
Honourable Members, the foundations have already been laid.
Following the detailed examination on your behalf, and with the proposals you made, the Commission is committed to ensuring the successful implementation of the strategy for natural resources.
In the long term, this strategy will lead us to sustainable use of natural resources and could constitute a benchmark for other policies.
This is only the first stage of a long process.
We should cooperate, now, with specific actions, so that its implementation can play a part in the development of all policies in all sectors of the economy.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Commissioner says that these are 'ambitious goals'.
I think not, Commissioner!
The Commission's report came under a lot of fire when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety first discussed it in October, as the document is seriously limited in its ambition after five years of gestation.
At best, it could be described as a reasonable basic document with which to start the discussion, but it lacks any concrete objectives and, as I said, any ambition.
This can probably be attributed to a turf war between the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Directorate-General for the Environment - guess who won?
DG ENVI's strategy has been mainly restricted to knowledge-gathering and fails to address some key problematic sectors such as - unsurprisingly - agriculture, forestry, transport and many others.
Whilst some new initiatives are mentioned, such as a data centre for natural resources, a high-level forum and an international panel, the proposed time horizon of 25 years is totally unacceptable.
By contrast, the rapporteur Mrs Liotard has worked hard to add some substance to the proposal.
She correctly makes the point that the Commission communication does not comply with the requirements laid down in the Sixth Environmental Action Plan for concrete targets and timetables.
The report calls on the Commission to replace this non-strategy with ambitious proposals, including clear targets and binding timetables.
I welcome the emphasis on an integrated policy approach and on the external impact of EU policy on sustainable resources.
The only problem is that the rapporteur may have done too good a job.
There is such a broad consensus for her report in the ENVI Committee that practically all amendments tabled were adopted, making the report somewhat long and repetitive in places.
In my view, this takes away from the message.
For this reason I have indicated on my group's voting list a negative vote on certain paragraphs that duplicate points mentioned elsewhere in the report.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we have inherited natural resources from nature or the Creator, but we are responsible for them with regard to future generations.
We hear increasingly varying information on the threat to the balance of nature.
Two-thirds of the ecosystems on which human beings depend are in decline.
Europe's demand on natural resources has risen by almost 70% since the early 1960s.
This dangerous trend must be stopped.
We want economic growth, because many people are still in need, but without increasing the use of natural resources and with less environmental impact.
This decoupling of economic growth and the increasing use of natural resources is the main message of this report.
The strategy proposed by the Commission is rather weak and has no deadlines or targets.
That is why I tabled around 25 amendments on behalf of the PSE Group.
I am happy that all but one of them has found favour with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
My fellow parliamentarians and I have proposed concrete targets to improve our commitment to the future.
I propose specific targets regarding food, housing and the transport sector.
In a market economy, taxation is the proper tool for regulating the use of resources.
That is why it is so important to set up a European eco-taxation system.
This report should be followed by specific regulations and directives to stop the self-destructive over-use of natural resources.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) Greater efficiency in using energy and raw material resources is the objective of the thematic strategy being discussed here.
This strategy is probably the most important partial strategy of the Sixth Environmental Action Plan.
Its main objective is to prevent the unnecessary squandering of renewable and non-renewable sources which is threatening the environmental balance.
Product lifecycles is a philosophy which occupies a special place amongst the measures designed to limit excessive consumption.
It is possible to increase significantly the volume of products that are channelled back into the economy at the end of their lifecycle and to reuse them.
In this regard, the strategy is closely related to the process of revising EU legislation on waste management.
The ambitious goals that we want to see in this thematic strategy are not unrealistic.
In fact, the priorities of the political debate on the economical use of natural resources have already enhanced the willingness of citizens to participate in the beneficial reuse of waste.
Our cities, for instance, are potential mines of raw materials.
Just as we extract ore from mines, we can use advanced waste collection and separation methods to extract iron, zinc, copper and plastic, and in the process we will use three times less energy than we would by producing them from fresh raw materials.
Urban mining offers a promising vision of the modern city as a lucrative cache of recycled materials.
And it is not the only method that considerably improves efficiency in using natural resources.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, almost half a century has passed since the first report was delivered in Rome.
Since then, natural resources have diminished, but we made great technological advances and learned to make more efficient use of raw materials and energy, harnessing resources which we could not have dreamed of fifty years ago.
Have we done everything our knowledge, technology and experience are capable of?
Definitely not.
This is what this report clearly shows.
I am wholly in favour of the report, but I also see that the European Union is doing a great deal, much more than other countries, to protect the earth, air and water.
It is doing a lot to recycle and re-use its raw materials.
However, we need to intensify our activities for the better utilisation of manufacturing waste, which will not only reduce environmental pollution, but also make our use of natural resources more efficient.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Kartika Liotard, for her excellent work.
These days mankind lives on an ecological credit card which goes over the limit of ecological funds.
Mankind as a whole uses 25% more than the sustainable level of natural resources, which means that we are using up our children's capital.
According to the European Environment Agency, the consumption of natural resources in Europe exceeded Europe's own biocapacity back in the 1960s.
If the current trend continues, by 2050 we will be using double the level of sustainable natural resources.
The need to cut climate emissions is only part of the more universal challenge of using natural resources more sparingly and more wisely.
If our use of natural resources is to be brought down to a sustainable level and at the same time we make it possible for developing countries to rise out of poverty, the rich countries, such as ourselves, should over a period of 50 years make the ratio between the prosperity achieved and consumption of natural resources ten times greater.
This sounds like science fantasy but by degrees it only means an improvement of 5% a year.
We have been able to do something similar in improving work productivity so why not in improving the productivity of natural resources?
This century must be the century in which we improve the productivity of natural resources, the ratio between prosperity achieved and the use of natural resources.
As everyone has already said, the strategy put forward by the Commission is far too flimsy, mainly because it lacks any concrete targets and timetables, even though they are required under the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
The knowledge base for producing them exists.
We need clear targets and timetables by next year, including sector-wide action programmes.
The cheapest way of improving productivity in the use of natural resources is to end aid that is environmentally harmful.
That should be done right away.
Kartika Liotard's conclusion that we need more quality and less volume could also be a motto for us in our use of natural resources.
(SK) I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the stance she has taken on this question.
I can fully endorse all the points in her report on a thematic strategy for the sustainable use of natural resources.
The fact that the Commission worked on this document for five years indicates the seriousness of the problem.
The Commission's document does not contain specific schedules, nor does it describe the methods to be adopted.
We have to recognise that we have a worldwide water crisis, especially as regards drinking water, as well as global warming, and a threat to biodiversity, where Europe's ecological footprint is twice as big as its biological capacity, and every year people are dying of diseases caused by a polluted environment.
This calls for a more proactive and radical approach.
I agree with the proposal for a complete reform of the subsidy system.
Subsidising activities which have a negative impact on the environment must be reduced or stopped, especially in agriculture.
If the Commission claims that it does not have enough indicators to set specific timescales, the rapporteur mentions several in her report, for example, gross domestic product, domestic use of materials, etc.
If we wish to reduce our dependence on natural resources, I agree that by 2012, 12% of the energy in the EU must come from renewable sources, and by 2008, a specific policy and line of action must be implemented for the 20 most important materials that have the greatest impact.
(FI) Mr President, Commissioner Dimas's example was a good one, as when the production of bioenergy is increased, it must happen on a sustainable basis and, in particular, at a global level, although the problem, with this strategy, for example, is that agriculture and forestry are not included in it.
This is one of the last thematic strategies that form part of the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
It has already been stated here that quantitative and qualitative objectives have been set under the Sixth Environment Action Programme for the European Union's environmental policy and that they have not been mentioned in the Commission's proposals.
Furthermore, it has not been possible in this strategy on natural resources to meet the objective of ensuring that the use of natural resources and their impact do not exceed the carrying capacity of the environment.
The Sixth Environment Action Programme was supposed to have been reviewed a year ago, and it is vital that we undertake a review of a programme as analytical as this one is, now that we have already come a long way in debating thematic strategies.
I would therefore like to ask Commissioner Dimas when the Commission is going to review the Sixth Environment Action Programme.
(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to thank my colleague Mrs Liotard for her comprehensive and cohesive report.
