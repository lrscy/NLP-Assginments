In the meantime, as I do not know what the evidence is, I cannot make any other comment.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have said nothing about a challenge, and nor am I talking about packages, I am talking about a serious accusation by MrÂ BarÃ³n, which damages the prestige of this House.
In any event, Mr President, if it is true â and I would now ask for an immediate investigation â the votes taken in committee are null and void and we cannot, therefore, vote on this report tomorrow.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, first of all I ask you whether it is right that staff should be sitting on the Council benches laughing and gesticulating.
I ask everybody to maintain a respectful attitude towards this House.
Ladies and gentlemen, I believe I have always respected the positions of others: I therefore ask you to respect them in the same way.
With regard to MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, first of all I had already asked to speak before now, my dear sir, but I was not given the floor.
I have to say that I fully endorse what I wrote, because in effect, in fact, one only needs to take a precise look at the numbers to see what the situation is.
Then, with regard to MrÂ Coxâs letter in reply, I have also had to write back to him indicating the points in his letter where he recognised that there were serious shortcomings and defects in the report itself.
I therefore respect the Presidentâs decision but, I beg you, do not hide behind a problem that does not exist and which, in any case, is not yours, just because you do not want to respond to a specific request by Mr HernÃ¡ndez Mollar.
One final point, MrÂ President: once again I accept the vote of this House, the vote that you, MrÂ President, have had taken here today.
If, however, we read the Rules of Procedure, it is not up to the House to decide when or how a particular vote should be taken: it is your direct responsibility.
As far as I am concerned, then, you asked for advice and then decided independently.
It is not the House that can decide on such matters.
You should all, please, read the Rules of Procedure and study them.
MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, the Rules of Procedure are not something from which you can pick and choose; therefore let the person who has the floor and is democratically elected and represents here the citizens of this âŠ
MrÂ President, I think there is always someone amongst us who has discovered democracy too late and who perhaps, therefore, is not familiar either with its rules or with its deeper meaning.
Â Â  Mr President, with tomorrowâs voting procedure decided, it is unclear to me whether or not it will be possible to vote for referral back to committee, in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure.
What is happening, what we are witnessing, is an inevitable, healthy reaction to the serious irregularities contained in the report, which, to my mind, removes competences from Member Statesâ constitutional institutions.
That is what is giving rise to this fair, legitimate and inevitable reaction to the abuse on the part of the majority of this House, who invoke the Treaties in order to breach them and the Charter of Fundamental Rights similarly to contravene some of its rules.
I therefore feel that this House must reassess this issue and must vote for referral back to committee, in order that the report can be cleansed of its irregularities.
I should therefore like to request, Mr President, that tomorrow this motion be considered, discussed and put to the vote.
Â Â  Let me conclude by remarking, in response to Mr Ribeiro e Castro, that under the Rules of Procedure, you are entitled to move the referral back.
The majority would decide that.
Failing a referral back, we will vote in the manner indicated earlier.
Mr PodestÃ  was correct when he said that it is my choice, but that choice is now informed by your wisdom.
I am sorry for the long delay.
Now you have got to earn your lunch!
Mr PodestÃ  will take the remaining votes.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just want to ask that, in the letter to the Council, you inform them that an error has crept in to the German version of the Common Position.
In our negotiations with them, we succeeded in prevailing upon the Council to replace the term âhigh-speed sea routesâ by the term âmotorways of the seaâ, as we also want to promote slower ferries as well as high-speed ones.
I therefore ask that the communication to the Council should make reference to the linguistic error that has found its way into the German version as regards the term âmotorway of the seaâ.
I believe that view to be shared by the House as a whole.
Â Â  â I have taken note of that, MrÂ Jarzembowski; in any case, it has already been brought to the attention of the competent services.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, since the agreement is being submitted to the Court of Justice, it seems to me a better idea to refrain from putting this report to the vote now, and first await the response of the Court.
I hope that the Commission and the Council agree.
I propose the following, therefore: rather than putting the report to the vote now, refer it back to committee in anticipation of the opinion of the Court of Justice.
Â Â  I would like to ask the chairman of the relevant committee to give his opinion.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe there is no reason or justification not to vote on the report and the motion for a resolution.
What has been voted for this morning is perfectly compatible with the content of the resolution, which calls for the suspension of the agreement.
We must, therefore, issue our opinion on this.
I believe that both the proposal and the motion for a resolution should be voted on and I would ask that this be done.
Â Â  Mr President, surely if the rapporteur is requesting a referral back to committee of her own report, and there is a dispute, then the House should vote on this?
Â Â  If that is an official request for referral, we will have one Member speak in favour and one against and then the House will decide.
Â Â  Mr President, we have decided to refer this matter to the Court of Justice.
If we are now to take a vote on the report rejecting the agreement, then we are showing a discourtesy to the Court.
If the House were to vote to accept the agreement, then we would be prejudging the Court's judgment.
It seems to me quite natural that since we are awaiting the Court's ruling on the matter, we should wait in committee with this report before voting on it.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would repeat what I said before: there is nothing incompatible about, on the one hand, our having voted as we did this morning in relation to the preliminary ruling of the Court of Justice and, on the other, having to give our opinion on the legislative proposal and the resolution.
I will repeat: it is the resolution that calls for the agreement to be suspended.
We therefore have this legitimate right in this House and the political groups would be deprived of it if we were prevented from voting on the proposal and the resolution.
I would therefore insist once again, Mr President, that this report must not be referred back to committee, but that it should be voted on as planned, for the reasons I have just given, which I believe to be conclusive.
Â Â  Mr President, I am simply astonished that paragraph 24 of the van Hulten resolution is not considered inadmissible.
I demand that it should be declared inadmissible.
The text reads: âthe rapporteur deems it necessary ...â.
This Assembly is in no position to say what the rapporteur thinks or does not think.
But this Assembly certainly is in a position to say whether it is in agreement with the rapporteur or otherwise.
This is not the point.
I request that paragraph 24 be declared inadmissible.
Â Â  . Mr President, there is a misunderstanding here.
Mr Bourlanges is referring to the explanatory statement â not to a paragraph in the resolution â and, as you know, the explanatory statement is not included in the final text adopted by plenary.
Â Â  It seems to me, MrÂ Bourlanges, that MrÂ van Hultenâs reply clarifies this point.
Â Â  Mr President, since Amendment No 44 was adopted, I should like, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to withdraw Amendments Nos 29 and 32.
They are no longer relevant.
Â Â  â Mr President, that is correct, and I am grateful to him.
From the interpretation I heard only âandâ, â29 and 32â.
As I understand it, 30 and 31 are redundant too, as they deal with exactly the same subject area.
Perhaps that was an error in interpretation.
I think that Mr Blak and I can agree that his groupâs actions have now in fact lapsed.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if my eyes do not deceive me, Mr Hans-Peter Martin did not participate in this vote, something I would very much regret in view of the extensive reform we have just carried out, and I hope that he will duly give us his backing where these matters are concerned.
After all, it is only right and proper that one should participate in votes of this kind, and I would also have been glad if he had tabled a few amendments in order to put his reforming agenda to the vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, I just want to respond to the remarks that have just been made.
I am here; I just needed to go out briefly, as a statement was being published on behalf of the President in which allegations were being made about me that simply bore no relation to the facts.
I have often seen Mr Ferber leave the Chamber under similar circumstances.
I have always played my part in this reform process, and the present lamentable reaction shows how much you are isolating yourselves, and to what an extent criticisms made from within this House â including my amendments in the committees â are simply ignored.
I feel sorry for Europeâs voters and taxpayers.
Â Â  . Mr President, we did not win the vote against Strasbourg and I admit defeat on this issue for the time being.
On the second issue, we voted by a very large majority to ask for the introduction as soon as possible of the reforms of the expenses system adopted by the Bureau last year.
Would you ask the President to report back to the House as soon as possible as to when he intends to ask the Bureau to adopt those rules?
Â Â  Mr President, could you give the House some indication as to whether you intend to break for lunch?
There are a lot of votes and there are a couple of official delegations, one from the Australian Parliament, waiting for our colleague Mr Sturdy to host lunch with them.
It is also 2.10 p.m.!
Â Â  I leave it to the House to decide
Â Â  Mr President, whatever the vote on the adjournment of the subsequent items, I should like to ask you nevertheless to put the Cyprus resolution to the vote, because it is important that the European Parliamentâs views should be made known in plenty of time for Saturdayâs referendum.
Â Â  . Mr President, I understand and sympathise with the idea behind the amendment tabled that incentives are needed in the marketplace so as to encourage the purchase of environmentally friendly products.
However, the wording is too specific.
I suggest an alternative that reads: 'Insists that, to promote the consumption of environmentally friendly products, the Commission encourage Member States to consider various incentives, such as reduced taxes, rebates, etc.'
I understand that my colleagues who originally tabled the amendment accept this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I support the first part of the amendment, but not the second part.
However, I would suggest that if the House supports the first part then it should it be voted as an addition.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is in my capacity as chairman of the temporary committee on the Sterckx report, on which we have been working for half a year, that I ask you to vote on it in order to obviate the risk of it lapsing.
I ask you to have due regard for the work that Members have been doing for half a year and to put the Sterckx report to the vote.
Before the vote on Amendment NoÂ 2:
Â Â  Mr President, we have asked the competent services to make a linguistic correction because Amendment No 2 has been tabled in English and there are other versions which contain the word âconsiderableâ, which does not appear in the English version, which is the true one.
I would ask that this correction be made.
Â Â  â We will check all the language versions, MrÂ Varela Suanzes-Carpegna.
Â Â  Once again, the European Parliament has just voted for a working schedule for 2005 in which there are no Strasbourg sittings on Fridays.
Of course, I voted against.
What we are actually waiting for the French Government to do â and we have been waiting in vain for years â is to go to the Court of Justice to enforce the Treaty.
I should like to remind you of what I have said a thousand times before in other explanations of vote: the arguments are good ones.
First, the European Parliament is not a sovereign assembly and it must adhere to the Treaty, as the Court of Justice has acknowledged.
Second, it has also acknowledged that, in the protocol establishing the seats of the institutions, which refers to âthe twelve periods of monthly plenary sessionsâ of the European Parliament, the article âtheâ means the sittings as they were held at the time the decision was taken.
This included five days of monthly sittings, including Friday.
Consequently, we must lodge an appeal on this matter, especially since the European Parliament is now so overloaded with work.
Â Â  . It is absolutely essential that Community legislation be simplified and made clearer, in order to make it more accessible to the ordinary citizen and easier for everyone to read.
Objectives such as these will be difficult to meet if we retain, on the same issue, a spread of provisions, many of which are substantially amended.
The aim of the Commission proposal before us â one which I naturally endorse â is to codify the first Council directive of 23Â July 1962, on establishing common rules for certain types of carriage of goods by road, and the other acts that have been modified, retaining the content in its entirety and confining itself to combining them with the formal amendments required by the codification process itself.
This is in line with the Commissionâs decision of 1Â April 1987 to call on its services to set about codifying all legislative acts once they have undergone ten amendments, in order to ensure that Community decisions are clear and comprehensible.
It also tallies with the Presidency conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council of December 1992, which reaffirmed the importance of codification.
I voted in favour of this report, which recommends that this proposal be adopted.

The aim of the Commission proposal before us â one which I naturally support â is to codify Council Directive 78/659/EEC of 18Â July 1978, on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life.
This is in line with the Commissionâs decision of 1Â April 1987 to call on its services to set about codifying all legislative acts after they have undergone ten amendments, in order to ensure that Community decisions are clear and comprehensible.
It also tallies with the Presidency conclusions of the Edinburgh European Council of December 1992, which reaffirmed the importance of codification.
I voted in favour of this report, which recommends that this proposal be adopted.
Â Â  . MrÂ Berenguer Fusterâs report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties.
In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be adopted on uniform technical requirements concerning the burning behaviour of materials used in the interior construction of certain categories of motor vehicles.
The forthcoming meeting of the World Forum for Harmonisation of Regulations of the UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) will be an opportunity for the Commissionâs representative to vote on this issue on the ECâs behalf.
It should be remembered that the European Union acceded to the revised 1958 Agreement of the Economic Commission for a United Nations of Europe in 1997, on which the Council Decision entered into force on 24Â March 1998.
It should also be noted that this draft regulation will certainly ensure a higher level of environmental safety and protection.
I voted in favour of the report, as I completely endorse its position.
Â Â  . MrÂ Berenguer Fusterâs report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties.
In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be adopted on uniform technical requirements relating to the protection of motor vehicles against unauthorised use.
I voted in favour of the report, along with the other packages, as I fully endorse its position.
Â Â  . Mr Berenguer Fusterâs report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties.
In this particular case, it is hoped that a new regulation will be approved on uniform requirements concerning the type approval of tyres with respect to tyre rolling noise.
I voted in favour of the report, along with the other packages, as I fully endorse its position.
Â Â  . The proposal before us seeks to make amendments to the scope of three regulations that establish specific measures for the application of the common agricultural policy in the outermost regions.
They are intended to improve conditions of production and marketing of the agricultural products in these regions and to offset the effects of their geographical situation and their particular characteristics.
In order to prevent diversions of trade in the products concerned, these regulations prohibit, with a few exceptions, the re-dispatch and re-exportation of those products from the outermost regions.
This prohibition and the strict nature of the exceptions have had an adverse effect on the development of the economic activities of certain operators.
This proposal suggests that the dispatch or exportation of the products concerned should be authorised after the economic advantage has been reimbursed.
A further measure concerns the Azores and Madeira.
Currently, the prohibition on re-dispatching and re-exporting the products covered by the specific supply arrangements will not apply to trade flows between the Azores and Madeira, without any distinction being made between processed and unprocessed products.
Sugar from Madeira covered by the specific supply arrangements has been the subject of speculative dealing in the Azores, where the market is facing difficulties.
It is, therefore, proposed that trade between the Azores and Madeira of products covered by the specific supply arrangements should be restricted to processed products.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  . In view of the importance of the European Audiovisual Observatory and the laudable work it has been doing, I welcome the rapporteurâs proposal to accept the Commissionâs proposal to extend the Communityâs participation in the Observatory by two years, whilst retaining the current budget ceiling.
Just two amendments have been tabled: firstly, where possible, to strengthen its capacities, and, secondly, to propose that the European Audiovisual Observatory collect and provide expertise and systematic information in the fields of tax and labour laws, copyright and consumer protection law.
Â Â  . As is well known, the European Audiovisual Observatory is based on an Enlarged Partial Agreement of the Council of Europe.
At present, 35 States, including all present and future EU Member States, participate in the Observatory.
Its aim is to improve the transfer of information within the audiovisual industry, and to promote a clearer view of the market and greater transparency.
The aims of the proposal before us are to extend the Communityâs participation in the Observatory for a further two years, until December 2006, and to keep the annual budget at the 2004 budget level of EURÂ 235Â 000.
This deserves my support.
I also endorse the rapporteurâs proposals: firstly, that, where possible, the European Audiovisual Observatoryâs capacities should be strengthened, and, secondly, that the European Audiovisual Observatory should collect and provide expertise and systematic information in the fields of tax and labour laws, copyright and consumer protection law.
Lastly, I should like to highlight the importance of remedying the lack of statistical information and benchmarking as regards services to assist blind and partially-sighted people, and deaf and hard of hearing people in the EU.
It is appropriate for the Observatory to take on the role of collecting and publishing this information.
For all of these reasons I voted in favour.
Â Â  . In recent years, significant progress has been made on combating tobacco consumption.
Indeed, tobacco consumption represents significant public health risks.
It is, therefore, vital that the European Union and the Member States should propose measures to safeguard public health.
One recent, well-documented example is the requirement that every pack should bear warnings covering at least 30% of the main surfaces of the pack.
Nevertheless, it is universally acknowledged that more needs to be done and it is in this regard that this Framework Convention has been drafted.
Whilst I condemn over-zealousness and the instances of absurdly excessive behaviour that have come to light, I agree that people need to be protected from tobacco smoke in certain places.
I therefore welcome measures aimed at banning the sale of tobacco to minors, the increased cooperation of the Member States and recommendations concerning advertising, particularly as these are not binding.
Whilst the report received a favourable opinion from the committees involved and the adoption of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention would not have serious financial implications and would not affect existing legal acts, I continue to have the reservations expressed during the parliamentary process, particularly as regards ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle.
Accordingly, I abstained.
Â Â  . Directive 2001/113/EC harmonises the labelling of fruit jams, jellies, marmalades and sweetened chestnut purÃ©e intended for human consumption.
Each product is separately defined with separately specified contents.
The aim of the proposal is to amend the German version of the Directive â given that, in certain parts of Austria, the term traditionally covers a wider meaning than that so far used in the Directive â to include both this correction and other potential semantic misunderstandings.
I feel that, while this proposal redresses a highly specific anomaly, it also comprises two wider values that should be matters of priority for the European agenda, namely, respect for traditions and customs, and multilingualism.
Without this objective, I feel that Europe would become âfunnelledâ, a victim of the gravitational movement towards a centre that is divorced from local realities.
For the sake of clarity, I voted in favour.
Â Â  . I wish to record my support for this report and in particular for the discharge to the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2002 (C5-0631/2003 â 2003/2241(DEC)).
The Foundation is a tripartite European Union body set up in 1975 to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions.
It is located in Dublin and I am proud to applaud the excellent research and development projects it carries out to provide data and analysis for informing and supporting the formulation of EU policy on working and living conditions.
The Foundation has contributed greatly to the work of those of us with a particular interest in achieving the Lisbon objectives of more and better employment.
It has supported the constructive engagement of the social partners in developing fair working practices which recognise the true value of employees as key stakeholders.
Â Â  . With this report, Parliament grants discharge to the Commission for the financial management of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) for the financial year ended 23Â July 2002.
We have no objections to this.
Following the demise of the ECSC Treaty, the ECSCâs legal system and procedures disappeared straightaway and its Advisory Board was dissolved.
In 2002, however, the ECSC continued to finance, from its operating budget, redeployment aid for workers, at a cost of EURÂ 35Â million, research grants, EURÂ 72Â million, and the RECHAR Programme of social measures, EURÂ 21 million.
In light of the crisis in the coal and steel sector and the social and economic costs of the restructuring that has taken place over recent decades, the liquidation of the ECSC â irrespective of criticisms that one might level at it â has left a void that must be filled, also at Community level, which the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel does not fill.
Bearing in mind the importance of investment in research in these sectors, it is essential that we consider the measures that might be taken at Community level to support these sectors, retaining some of the social measures of the old ECSC Treaty for a time period to be established.
Â Â  . The salient point made in this report is that, in the past fifteen years, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) has paid out some EUR 800Â million for applied research in the steel sector alone to companies and institutions, without, as a rule, receiving its contractual share of proceeds from the patents that this has made possible.
The Commission must, therefore, enforce its legal claim to its share of the proceeds from research funding by means of a registration procedure for patents and other suitable measures.
I also welcome the successful conclusion of negotiations with the accession countries concerning conditions for their participation in the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel, whereby the payment of their contributions, which will be determined in accordance with the size of their mineral resources, will be staggered to take account of their respective economic situations.
We endorse the rapporteurâs position and, accordingly, voted in favour.
We should also like to join the rapporteur in praising, once again, all those who set up and developed the European Coal and Steel Community, and who thus made a significant contribution towards the unification of Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, various amendments were worthy of consideration, but any amendment would have resulted in a conciliation procedure which would definitely have entailed the risk of a fundamental reassessment and would also have meant equally serious delays.
This is why I could not support any amendment, but this is not the case with the proposed link between Italy and Sicily, which I supported.
Â Â  MrÂ President, as an MEP for Sicily, I would like to express my satisfaction and appreciation, and thank my fellow Members who, like me, voted for the amendment this morning, which has shown how, in the end, common sense prevailed when faced with the willingness shown by the European Council.
There is no doubt that the overwhelming majority of Parliament has today concluded the procedure at second reading by accepting the common position.
Of course, we were once again saddened at the attempt by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, accompanied in this action by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by some Italian left-wing democrats â with an amendment which, fortunately, only received about 50 votes â to abort the continuation of the plan for the Messina bridge on the trans-European route from Berlin to Palermo.
If the amendment had been passed, over and above the very serious detrimental effect, which was mentioned at the end of the procedure, the Italian Government â which has already launched the process to begin construction of the bridge â would not have received the 10% contribution from the Unionâs funds, as provided for in the Treaty.
Even more than the sum involved, there is obviously the political significance that such a vote would have had.
The opposing view, taken by those against the bridge over the Straits, did however â if I may say so â seem to be misleading right from the start and counter, in particular, to the legitimate interests of Sicily and Southern Italy.
We cannot hope for the development of these regions of Southern Europe and then deny them the right to have essential infrastructure.
Building the bridge will of course not resolve all of the problems associated with the socio-economic deterioration of Sicily, but it will finally allow the trans-European road and rail networks to be completed and it will enable the island to play a more competitive role in the area of free trade planned for 2010.
Â Â  . I should like to congratulate Mr Bradbourn on his excellent report on the amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision amending Decision No 1692/96/EC on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network.
I welcome the report, particularly as regards the strategy of reinvigorating the trans-European transport network, which is one of the main keys to the smooth running of the internal market.
I strongly support Mr Bradbournâs call for Parliament to be involved and to monitor the development of projects that form part of the development of the trans-European transport network.
I also support the request that in Article 3(2) of the Commissionâs revised proposal, special mention should be made of regional airports, as they also play a genuinely vital role in the development of the trans-European transport network.
Â Â  . At first reading, in the debate on 10 March, I expressed my rejection of this plan.
What is now happening at second reading is that, without a vote on the total, an excessively long list of motorways, airports, bridges and tunnels is being laid down as an investment obligation for the EU.
This signifies a long-term call for cofinancing, and will probably also enable the circumvention of the obligation to prepare environmental impact assessments.
This package also betrays the desire to further neglect the good rail network in eastern Europe by building a large number of motorways there.
I dispute the idea, propagated by Italyâs Berlusconi Government, that tax revenues must chiefly be spent on infrastructure and other large public works instead of on public service, environmental protection and social security.
A serious debate on this is no longer possible today owing to lack of time.
My group is endeavouring to have plans for the bridge over the Strait of Messina scrapped, as it is unusable on account of earthquakes and gusts of wind and superfluous on account of shortcomings in the connecting rail network, and as its construction chiefly serves the interests of the Mafia.
Furthermore, I support all the Green amendments.
Rejection of all these amendments would burden Europe with a lead weight and an unnecessary assault on the environment for many years to come.
Â Â  . During the last parliamentary part-session, representatives from the works council of the Group, a company that specialises in the manufacture of rolling stock for the railways sector, presented to Members of this House the details of their case and their concerns regarding the loss of acknowledged high levels of quality, experience and technological capacity in the construction of this kind of equipment that would result from the impending closure of six units in the EU.
We hold the Commission and the Member States responsible for allowing this crucial sector to be dismantled and thousands of workers to be made redundant.
In Portugal alone, this situation has led to 550 direct job losses and almost 1 000 further job losses in subcontracting firms.
If the future, priority in developing the trans-European transport network is to shift road transport to rail transport in particular, we will need increasing amounts of new equipment and rolling stock; which is where âs argument to justify the measures it announced â namely, a lack of orders â falls down.
Whereas some aspects of the proposal under discussion are worthy of criticism, we must register our support for its commitment to alternative means of transport that are less harmful to the environment, such as rail transport.
This is not an isolated case, and special measures must be put in place to protect this key sector of European industry.
Â Â  . Unlike the Funds, which are, as a rule, large-scale and vitally important, LIFE constitutes a source of financing specifically geared towards actions to protect nature and the environment.
Such actions are designed to promote the dissemination of practices, develop innovation and demonstrate how skills and experience can be used elsewhere; they also help to enforce Community policy and legislation in the area of the environment.
This instrument contributes towards implementing the âBirdsâ (79/409/EEC) and âHabitatsâ (92/43/EEC) Community Directives, and, in particular, towards establishing the NATURA 2000 European network, aiming at the on-site management and conservation of the most important fauna and flora species and habitats in the EU, by creating, for example, special conservation âsitesâ.
Life III expires on 31 December 2004.
This proposal intends to extend the existing instrument in order to ensure continuity until a new approach is developed in view of the new post-2006 financial perspectives.
Naturally, I voted in favour.
I hope, however, that the conclusions of the âArticle 8 Groupâ, (Habitats Directive) are taken on board, notably that the current funding of the NATURA 2000 network by means of the LIFE-Nature instrument (47% of the total funds of the LIFE programme) is clearly insufficient; that the application process is overly bureaucratic; and that the Life-Nature programme must be substantially strengthened, and in ...
Â Â  . This afternoon, this House agreed by aÂ large majority on an extension, by two years, of the LIFE programme.
This extension will ensure policy continuity until a new approach is developed in view of the new financial perspectives.
When the extension of the LIFE programme was first discussed, the Court of AuditorsÂ told the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy that an audit had been carried out in eight Member States.
This had apparently revealed that, when private entities use European aid to purchase sites for nature reserves, there are insufficient guarantees that these sites continue to be well managed when the subsidy period expires.
It was unable to give us any specific examples, however.
The suggestion by the Court of AuditorsÂ that private entities be excluded henceforth from EU subsidies for purchasing nature reserves was unable to count on support from this House, therefore, which I think is a very good thing.
The Court of Auditors is of course entitled to make suggestions to us.
We can on no account tolerate misuse, but this does not mean that private entities that are functioning properly should be hit.
We cannot and must not leave the thousands of volunteers in the European Union who devote themselves selflessly to the management of nature reserves out in the cold.
On the contrary, we must encourage instead of discourage them.
I am particularly pleased that I have been able to do my bit towards ensuring that properly functioning environmental organisations can continue to obtain European aid for purchasing nature-reserve sites in the future.
Â Â  . I reluctantly voted for this report.
It is not perfect and already there is evidence that such data has been inadvertently released to third parties.
I totally acknowledge the right of any country to protect and maintain its security.
We have a clash of cultures here and expediency has triumphed.
Â Â  . I have voted, again, for the prevention of an unacceptable amount of personal passenger data being transmitted to the US authorities, without adequate protection being offered by the US authorities for the civil liberties of European passengers.
While I fully respect the need for the highest possible level of vigilance against terrorism, the terrorists will have won if we sacrifice civil liberties and human rights under the pretext of ensuring security.
I am very disappointed that Ireland voted for the draft agreement, thus giving the green light for unwarranted intrusions into the privacy of Irish passengers.
The Commission simply must ensure its draft agreement text is modified so that European citizens' data protection rights are protected.
Irish and European passengers deserve to know that their basic civil liberties will not be sacrificed in the fight against terrorism.
Â Â  . Following on from previous positions, Parliament has not agreed to conclude the Agreement with the USA on transferring air passenger data within the framework of the so-called âwar on terrorâ.
Thus far, the only thing that Parliament has approved has been to refer the process to the European Court of Justice for a ruling.
The Commissionâs proposal and the subsequent proposal for a Council decision enabled âaccess by US law-enforcement authorities to passenger name records (PNR) databases situated on Community territoryâ which âamounts to exercise of US sovereign powerâ in EU countries.
This Agreement would declare âapplicable in the European Union and for the European citizens the US legislation in this domainâ and would transfer âto European level the discretionary power of the Member States to authorise (...) the utilisation for security purposes of data originally collected for commercial use and to create (...) a legal obligation for European airlines to give access to these dataâ.
As regards safeguarding the citizensâ rights, freedoms and guarantees, âthe draft agreement does not define the extent and the limits of these rights but it only refers to an unilateral Commission Decision which itself refers to some unilateral Undertakings of the US administration, which finally refers to the actual and future US regulationsâ.
Â Â  . This question was in connection with the Boogerd-Quaak report on the Agreement between the EU and the USA on the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) by Air Carriers to the United States Department of Homeland Security (A5-0271/2004).
In view of the fact that this consultation was approved, this report has yet to be voted on.
There is ample justification today for concluding agreements of this nature, due to the growing terrorist threat.
This should be a basic measure of cooperation between countries, and blocking it only serves to prolong the absence of a firm EU response to the terrorist threat.
Unlike the rapporteur, I feel that signing this Agreement is indeed compatible with the European Community Treaty and does not breach European legislation on data protection.
I fully support the arguments put forward by Commissioner Patten.
Rather than block the implementation of measures such as this, Parliament ought to be working towards requiring carriers that fly into EU territory to comply with obligations of this nature, thereby ensuring the security of each and every one of us.
Because I disagree entirely, from both a political and a technical point of view, with any recommendation to the Council not to conclude this Agreement with the USA, I voted against consulting the Court of Justice, which I see as a disgraceful delaying tactic and a new hurdle in the way of an Agreement that is necessary to our security and freedom.
Â Â  . It is essential that the European Union adopts coherent measures to increase effectiveness in the area of border security, without impinging on the competences of the Member States.
I welcome this proposal for a regulation, ensuring uniform application in the Member States of the requirement systematically to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross the EUâs external borders.
This measure will respond to the need to be able to check the date on which a person from a third country crossed the external border, and will make it possible to verify how long a third-country citizen has been in EU territory and whether or not the person is there illegally.
Recasting the Common Manual of External Borders will be an enormously complicated task and will thus take a considerable amount of time to adopt.
The aim of this proposal is to iron out the disparities that currently exist between the various Member States and any ambiguities that may arise as regards the provisions of the Manual while it is being recast.
This will be a step towards tightening control of the external borders and enhancing mutual trust between Member States in the area of border control.
As these are common borders, lax security in one State will inevitably have a knock-on effect in all of the other Member States.
Â Â  . The Schengen stipulates that, in the case of short-term stays, third country citizens who enter the territory of Member States legally and who meet the necessary conditions to this end have the right to remain within Schengen territory for a maximum period of three months, starting from the first date of entry.
The need therefore arises to check the dates on which a third-country citizen crossed the external border, in order to calculate the total period of stay and to verify that the person is there legally.
The Common Manual of External Borders provides for travel documents to be stamped and land border controls to be relaxed in exceptional circumstances, due mainly to the intensity of traffic implied by such circumstances.
The ambiguity of this provision has led to the adoption of procedures that differ between Member States, and this is something that should be avoided.
Consequently, and in view of enlargement, we accepted Mrs Angelilliâs position that this should be a first step towards ultimately harmonising procedures, such as stamping the travel documents of third-country citizens as they leave the âSchengen areaâ.
Â Â  . The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) has done an extremely good job of improving knowledge of drugs and drug addiction, by providing comparable data and information and primarily by monitoring and identifying dangerous substances that appear on the market and by proposing that these should be banned.
It makes sense that, for reasons of clarity and openness, the Regulation establishing the EMCDDA should be recast, particularly in order to adapt it to the enlargement of the EU and to broaden its mandate to cover polydrug use, involving both legal and illegal substances.
I cannot, however, accept the attempt to confer evaluation tasks on the EMCDDA.
The intention is that the Monitoring Centre should not simply collect data but should also evaluate national policies and strategies and assess trends in drug consumption.
This would confer on an agency powers that are currently held by the Member States.
The Monitoring Centre should be entrusted with the task of furnishing overall information, in other words, of collecting, analysing and disseminating data on all aspects of the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction, which will help to provide the Community and its Member States with an overall view of the drug and drug addiction phenomenon.
This task should not prejudice the allocation of powers between the Community and its Member States with regard to the legislative provisions concerning drug supply and demand.
Â Â  As usual, you were not listening and, as usual, we were right.
At the time of the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 1995, National Front members declared right here, before this Assembly, that it was pointless, and they predicted that it would fail.
Almost ten years on, the results are in fact pathetic: failures in the board of directors, in the information gathering and analysis network and in data dissemination, and lack of assessment of the various policies with regard to drugs.
The annual reports and statistical data are piling up, but the problems have grown worse.
France is now the country where 16-year-old adolescents smoke the most cannabis in Europe.
A real epidemic, the use of drugs now affects all social classes and all ages.
The rapporteur therefore proposes overhauling the observatoryâs operations and missions.
But the solution does not lie in a proliferation of ThÃ©odule committees, nor in the establishment of a community approach to anti-drug policies.
It is time to realise that the use of drugs increases exponentially with tolerance and that only national policies based on zero tolerance with regard to drugs can give young people their future back.
Â Â  . The fight against Drugs and Drug Addiction has always been a priority for the European Union and has been reflected in its other policies, particularly in the last decade.
This is why, in its proposal for a regulation, the Council is seeking to take this fight to a new level.
Nevertheless, it has become clear that the many amendments that have been tabled and which are scattered throughout this report, detract from this fundamental aim.
Although, on the one hand, I agree that extending the powers of the Monitoring Centre is, on the face of it, a measure to be welcomed, on the other, I cannot accept the amendments seeking to ensure that the EP is represented by two Members on the Management Board and to increase the number of tools for evaluation purposes.
I believe that the actions proposed in the report, in particular those originating in Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, do not represent the best approach to adopt.
I could not vote in favour of the report.
Instead, I would suggest that the European Union, the European Monitoring Centre and also the Member States, in cooperation or individually, combine their efforts, not in tasks that will result in wasted resources but in measures that will clearly lead to prevention.
We need measures that effectively combat drug trafficking and drug addiction.
Â Â  I declined to vote in favour of granting discharge for the execution of the Commissionâs budget for 2002 owing to the persistent lack of clarity on matters such as Eurostat.
Back in January, the European Parliament regretted granting discharge for the 2001 financial year without having access to all the relevant information.
I did not want to fall into the same trap for 2002.
Furthermore, the resolution accompanying the decision to discharge includes many questionable points.
For example, it states in paragraph 4 that Member States are in a subordinate position as regards the management of Community funds, which is inaccurate, in so far as they hold the purse-strings and it is the national taxpayers who indeed pay.
I believe, on the contrary, that the Member States should insist on being able to exercise better control themselves.
Another example: in paragraphs 115 and in subsequent paragraphs, the European Parliament wishes to establish a European tax, stating that the prime objective is to âguarantee the financial independence of the EU with regard to national contributions subject to the decisions of national parliamentsâ.
It cannot be admitted any more clearly than this that a European tax would allow the Union to avoid national scrutiny and to finance its expenditure as it wishes.
Â Â  . The discharge process for 2002 has been marked by the Eurostat case and by the ongoing Commission reform.
We have substantial reservations about both of these matters.
Despite the recent scandals and in light of the cases that led to the fall of the Commission in 1999, the administrative reforms that have been announced appear to be almost entirely cosmetic.
The so-called âadministrative cultureâ still needs to be changed, as the Eurostat case shows.
Measures are needed to safeguard against vital information being concealed.
Progress must be made on keeping services in-house, and in particular on amending the Financial Regulation to the effect that the Commission is automatically required to request a full account of the ownership of a firm tendering for a Commission contract and in terms of financial management.
The Eurostat case also highlights the need to review the accountability chain in the Commission and the relationships that exist between the various key players and the Commissioners.
It also confirms that âit was a mistake to concentrate the competences for drawing up the budget and keeping accounts and for combating fraud in the hands of one Member of the Commissionâ.
I should also like, at sectoral level, to express my disagreement with paragraph 115, which suggests a future European tax to replace national contributions from Member States to the Community budget and with paragraph 182, which supports the N+2 rule for the Structural Funds.
Â Â  . The fine results achieved by the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds (EDF) should encourage us to pursue this crucially important aspect of the European Unionâs action: providing real solidarity with the most disadvantaged parts of the world, by supporting macroeconomic or sectoral reforms.
I welcome the suggestion that the ACP (African, Caribbean, Pacific) States in particular should agree to introduce a multi-annual programme for creating and/or strengthening a Supreme Audit Institution before budgetary support can be granted.
The credibility and efficiency of the EDF depends largely on the transparency of these funds and on evidence, upstream and downstream, that they are being used appropriately.
Furthermore, this will enable a more reliable comparison to be made with the EUâs own financial perspective.
Lastly, I agree with the assessment of the Committee on Budgetary Control, highlighting the fact that, apart from the political significance of budgetisation, considerable advantages related to budgetary management can be achieved by integrating the EDF in the general budget of the European Union; for example, more efficient implementation due to the possibility of harmonising existing procedures, greater level of flexibility in implementation, a higher level of transparency concerning total Community aid and avoiding the current complications of transitional measures between EDFs.
I voted in favour.
Â Â  Although elected by the inhabitants of the Belgian regions of Wallonia and Brussels, Mr President, I have as usual supported the continuation of European Parliament activities in Strasbourg.
My support is based on my conviction that the presence of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, despite the passage of time and even present or future enlargements, is of considerable symbolic value.
It is too easy to believe that old wounds have healed because they are no longer mentioned.
On the contrary, history should make us wary of the ability of the past to resurface, sometimes suddenly, when it is least expected.
This is why everyone in Europe, especially the young, needs the continuing presence of European democracy in the capital of Alsace.
Â Â  I voted in favour of the van Hulten report on granting discharge for the execution of the European Parliamentâs budget for 2002, since it provides clear guidance concerning in particular the transparency of Membersâ allowances of the type we have always defended.
Incidentally, note should be taken of the rout of the European Parliamentâs strategy, which has for years linked reform of the system of allowances to the adoption by the Council of an extremely federalist constitution for European Members.
With the elections imminent, the Council has, however, blocked reform of the constitution, and the European Parliament has been obliged to accept that the reform of allowances could indeed be carried out separately.
Furthermore, the initial report contained very regrettable sections casting doubt on the location of Strasbourg as the official home of the European Parliament.
Fortunately, they were voted out.
Strasbourg is in fact the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation and, tomorrow, it should become the symbol of reconciliation for the whole of Europe.
Also, it would be unhealthy to concentrate all the institutions in Brussels, which would then be too inclined to put itself forward as a European federal district.
Â Â  The fact that our colleague, Mr van Hulten has taken the opportunity of discharge for the 2002 financial year to speak in favour of a single venue for the European Parliament, namely Brussels, is no surprise to me.
That he makes use of hypocrisy and makes factually inaccurate statements in support of this is an insult to his intelligence.
Paragraph 69 of his motion for a resolution includes an error.
It gives the impression that the quoted sums of EUR 185 and 203 million are overspends arising from the retention of three venues, while these are in fact the total costs.
Of course, even a single venue involves a cost.
Paragraph 70 goes on from the confusion and includes falsehoods.
I shall leave it for our French colleagues to respond to the attacks on Strasbourg.
I protest vehemently at the insinuations to the effect that Luxembourg has access problems, health problems or security problems.
This is in bad faith.
Consequently, I have voted in favour of Amendments Nos 16 to 20, deleting paragraphs 69 to 73, tabled by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
Â Â  Being in favour of discharge but still voting against the resolution presented by Mr van Hulten requires explanation.
Even in amended form, the resolution is still unacceptable: instead of restricting himself to the execution of the 2002 budget, the rapporteur has made it into a mishmash of his personal ideas.
Neither the rambling considerations on the status of Members nor the proposal concerning the seats of Parliament have any place in it.
This last proposal not only constitutes an infringement of Article 284 of the Treaty, but expresses a narrow view of the financial cost of decentralisation.
While it is true that decentralisation comes at a price, the concentration of all the European institutions in Brussels also has a financial, and especially political, cost.
From a purely financial, or even Calvinist, perspective, the political aspects are insignificant.
This is not the case, however, for the voters.
Â Â  I have not joined in the campaign for reform of the EP intending to make it more efficient, transparent and accountable.
The purpose of the campaign, started by the socialist Member, Mr van Hulten, is to abolish Strasbourg as a seat and Luxembourg as a venue.
Hypocritically, Members of the European Parliament and candidates in the European elections are being asked to âmake a commitment to increasing efficiency by seeking to end the dispersal of European Parliament facilities (...) and establishing a single seat in Brusselsâ.
I eventually voted in favour of the report, after my groupâs amendments had been accepted.
Otherwise, I should not have been able to do so, since Mr van Hulten misused his report in order to adopt a position with respect to the seat of the EP, which is not within our remit.
A survey of civil servants in Strasbourg and Luxembourg has shown that 95% are against moving to Brussels.
Mr van Hulten totally ignores the difficulties which this project would cause for the families affected, not to mention the cost of this , in terms of both money and productivity.
I shall not be intimidated by this manoeuvring and this blackmail on the pretext of restoring the credibility of the European Parliament.
Â Â  . Yesterday, I was one of the signatories of the appeal to EP candidates for the term 2004â2009 to put an end to excessive expenses and to wasting money as a result of meeting in two different cities.
Today, it is possible to gauge the level of support for this within the 1999â2004-term Parliament that is soon to retire.
On a proposal from the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, a majority of 31 voted against moving all sessions to Brussels.
The costs of this refusal amount to EURÂ 185Â million each year, rising to EURÂ 203Â million after enlargement.
The proposal to reimburse only the actual travel costs incurred was not included in the vote, as a much vaguer proposal was first adopted on a study into travel costs.
My group presented two proposals to limit the period for which the attendance register can be signed.
Limiting it to the fixed session times was rejected by 99 votes to 355, and abolishing the option of signing it on days on which there are no sessions was rejected by 151 votes to 320.
Only the recently introduced option of additional taxi expenses has been abandoned, with 351 votes for and 146 against.
That is an extremely poor yield for now in the fight to reduce this Parliamentâs unnecessary costs.
In these circumstances, in particular, it is a good thing that the Council did not allow the recent pay increase.
Â Â  Mr van Hultenâs report is an important one.
We are nonetheless sorry that the call for parliamentary activities to cease in Strasbourg was not accepted.
We believe that all of the European Parliamentâs activities should be transferred to Brussels.
For this reason, we abstained at the end of the voting.
Â Â  . The reason I have voted against this report is mirrored in the roll-call votes that have been taken, on the Membersâ Statute and on maintaining Strasbourg as Parliament's seat.
As regards the first matter, although I agree with many of the amendments that were tabled, I believe they only make sense if incorporated into a future Membersâ Statute, as the rapporteur to a certain extent acknowledges in his explanatory statement.
There is no guarantee that this Statute will enter into force, as I would like to see â a desire that I have expressed clearly in previous votes.
In fact, it was even rejected recently by the Council.
Concerning keeping Parliamentâs seat in Strasbourg, I fully realise that any change to the current situation will require a corresponding change to the Treaties.
Nevertheless, there is no reason why I should not express my position on the matter, which has nothing to do with having less regard for France or the French.
What it reveals is my opposition in principle to a regrettable duplication of costs, with no visible benefit, either for the quality of the workings of Parliament or for the working conditions of its Members and staff.
Â Â  . On behalf of the Members belonging to the Austrian Freedom Party, I wish to explain our vote on the van Hulten report.
The reason why we voted in favour of Amendment No 40 is that we advocate a new Bureau decision leaving no loopholes permitting additional mileage allowances and payments for extra time.
We therefore advocate that the Bureau decision of 8 May 2003 should be revised to allow for the reimbursement of costs actually incurred.
We voted against Amendment No 1, tabled by the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, believing as we do that it could be interpreted in such a way as to facilitate the retention of the 28 May 2003 decision on costs, with its hidden lump-sum allowances.
In the final vote, though, we nevertheless voted against the report, as it fails to deal with such issues as the demand for a single venue for the European Parliament or the abolition of allowances for Fridays in Strasbourg.
Having considered all the arguments, I wish to emphasise that the decision to reimburse only those travel expenses that are actually incurred met with our wholehearted support, although, at the same time, I regret the failure to take on board many of the amendments.
Â Â  . I support this report in order to state that, as one might expect, there is no consensus on the Membersâ Statute, an issue that I have followed with particular interest, both as a Member of this Parliament and in my capacity as Quaestor between 1994 and 1999.
I feel that this is a political issue and I would state unequivocally that Membersâ allowances and expenses must be based on the economic and social situation of the Member State in which they are elected because, once elected, they are in this Parliament to represent their communities â in any event this is one reason for their presence here.
Â Â  I have voted in favour of the amendments to the following effect: 1) that the European Parliament itself be allowed to decide upon its seat (adopted by 275 votes to 223, with 16 abstentions), 2) that the European Parliament have a single place of working instead of, as today, three in the form of Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg (adopted by 271 votes to 223, with 21 abstentions), because this dividing up of its work leads to an additional cost of EURÂ 185Â million per year (approximately SEK 1Â 750 million) and, after enlargement, EURÂ 203 million (approximately SEKÂ 1Â 850 million), 3) that the reimbursement of expenses be reviewed (adopted by 380 votes to 119), 4) that the reimbursement of expenses be based on the principle of reimbursement of actual costs (partly taken into account in Amendment NoÂ 40 and adopted by 336 votes to 138, with 28 abstentions), and 5) that outlay on taxis not be refunded separately but be included in the general reimbursement of costs (adopted by 351 votes to 146, with 18 abstentions).
Â Â  . I voted against the van Hulten report because the rapporteur has taken the opportunity presented by the assessment of the implementation of Parliamentâs accounts to proffer, out of context, his own political opinions on the system of payments to Members of Parliament and on the location of Parliamentâs seats.
These matters, which are causing a deep rift within Parliament, must not, therefore, be viewed in isolation (which is currently the case), much less at the end of a legislature and, apparently, as the result of particular personal interest and of inappropriate pressure from the media, whose sole intention is to damage the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections.
The rapporteur has failed, this time, to serve the European cause well and should not, therefore, receive the European Parliamentâs approval.
Â Â  We do not want the Commission to table a proposal aimed at changing the national share systems.
We have chosen to vote against the wording that calls upon the Commission to implement the one share/one vote principle, because this is not in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
Such a proposal would have far-reaching consequences for patterns of ownership in quite a few Member States.
Different national company law systems must be respected.
Nor can we support the wording designed to facilitate the movement of workers, because it takes no account of trade union aspects and is not accompanied by demands that companies accept social responsibility.
Increased movement in the European labour market is good, but we cannot accept flexibility at workersâ expense.
Â Â  If the principle of âone share â one voteâ is introduced into all legislation there is a risk of legislation having retroactive effect, with the present ownership being changed and thus expropriation taking place.
We think, instead, that the market itself must define the forms of ownership that it wishes to reward.
For these reasons we have been unable to support the introduction through legislation of the principle of âone share â one voteâ as a general principle.
Â Â  We have today voted against the report, our justification being as follows.
An agreement on takeover bids (relating to company purchases) has been made just recently.
The EU institutions should keep to what has been agreed in these negotiations.
This report proposes deviations from the agreement.
Such behaviour may lead to its becoming more difficult in the future to conclude agreements, if the institutions do not keep to them.
We therefore believe that the points relating to the weighting of voting rights and various forms of defensive measure should not have been included in the report.
When those aspects of company law that benefit from harmonisation are changed through European legislation, the principle of subsidiarity must be respected, and central corporate governance must as far as possible be avoided.
The freedom to enter into agreements must never be infringed in the manner proposed.
We particularly welcome trade and industryâs initiatives in the interests of increased transparency and the scrutiny of administration and reporting, and we hope that these principles will influence future European development in this area.
Â Â  . I have abstained from voting today on the Directive on unfair commercial practices.
The reason is not that I oppose this kind of legislation in principle, but that this is the umpteenth compromise that has been presented with regard to the internal market.
Four years on from the Lisbon Summit, I note that little progress has been made.
Every day this Parliament advocates following the Lisbon Strategy, but when it actually has the opportunity to opt for the completion of the internal market by means of mutual recognition and possibly maximum harmonisation, it shrinks from it.
Whenever we talk about the consumer, emotions flare up.
Various amendments do afford the consumer protection, which is a good thing in itself, but on the other hand they do not take account of the costs this entails for traders.
In my view, the present draft legislation does not yet strike the correct balance.
Â Â  . I am pleased to support this report which significantly improves on the Commission's proposal to harmonise consumer protection against unfair commercial practices.
While I am in favour of the Commission's proposals for corporate governance its key policy objectives should include reference to promoting sustainable development, environmental justice and fair trade.
They should also place greater importance on the involvement of other stakeholders, such as workers, consumers and community representatives.
European corporate governance and Company law must include decent structures and practices for informing and consulting workers, and all European company law directives should contain obligations to inform and consult employee representatives where major decisions are at stake as regards the continuity of firms and jobs.
Therefore the European Corporate Governance Forum which the Commission proposes to convene ought to be representative of all interests and trade unions and civil society ought also to participate in it.
Â Â  . Following the major financial scandals that have erupted across the world, such as the Enron and Parmalat cases â and their systemic nature, the Commission is seeking to show that it has been working on the matter, with a view to improving transparency in companies, in other words their âgovernanceâ, (which appears to be the way in which they are governed) and their sense of âsocial responsibilityâ.
This could be said to be a case of shutting the stable door once the horse has bolted but, once you remove the declarations of intent and the appeals to the good nature of the business community, all that is left in the report is propaganda, because the aims are quite different.
These are: to restore public confidence â particularly in the financial markets; to make regulations more flexible in order to facilitate the cross-border restructuring of companies in the European Union; to increase the competitiveness of companies and to improve protection for shareholders and creditors.
We are consequently unhappy that, instead of focusing on the issue of relations between shareholders and managers â between ownership and control â the Commission has not attached greater importance to effective protection for workers, to their participation and that of the organisations that represent them in the process of taking decisions on the lives of their companies.
The fact is that these employees have fewer rights than creditors and should have not only minimum rights to be informed and consulted, but also the right to active participation, with the right of veto, in decisions that are important for the continuity of the company and of jobs.
Â Â  . I voted in favour for the same reasons that European regulations on company law and corporate governance need to be modernised.
What is at stake are the main political objectives (increasing the rights of shareholders and protecting third parties, improving corporate efficiency and competitiveness, etc.) that must underpin all actions needed in this field at European level.
These include an action plan that classifies in order of priority the various measures that are considered necessary in the short, medium and long term.
In drawing up this action plan, particular attention must be paid, however, to the need to respect a set of guiding criteria, specifically the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality and a degree of flexibility as regards the way the plan is used.
Furthermore, the action plan is an important element in creating, in an enlarged Europe, a transparent and healthy capitals market, in particular given recent events in Japan, followed by those in the United States and in Europe â the Parmalat case, to be specific.
Such a market will need further useful measures for sound financial management so as to prevent similar scandals and the economic and social consequences that they entail.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, in which the Commission advocates updating the European regulatory framework on company law and corporate governance, by proposing measures aimed at: increasing businesses' competitiveness as a crucial component of economic growth and job creation, improving protection for shareholders and creditors and enhancing the transparency of the way in which businesses operate.
Nevertheless, although I endorse the report and although the rapporteur is a socialist, I voted against the amendments tabled at a later stage by the Socialist Group.
Nor could I accept paragraph 21 of the original text which, using the fallacious argument that it would ensure equal treatment for all shareholders, calls on the Commission to accept the principle of âone share one voteâ.
Unlike what is put forward in that paragraph, the terms of equal treatment for shareholders have nothing to do with the principle of âone share one voteâ.
In addition to being a matter for social organisations, the rules linking the social participation of shareholders with the right to vote are rules of proportionality, in which equality is fully respected.
Â Â  Mr President, the draft plan for the reunification of Cyprus supported by the Commission, and just approved by the European Parliament, simply cannot be right for us.
In order to make absolutely sure that agreement was reached, Turkey was granted concessions which are difficult to swallow.
Although it is illegally occupying the north of the island and it has been criticised by everyone at the internationalÂ level âÂ this has to be stated before it becomes completely forgottenÂ â it has been granted the right to sustain a regime controlled by the armed forces, with 100Â 000Â settlers established in northern Cyprus and all kinds of restrictions on freedom of movement between the two parts, not to mention persisting obstacles to religious freedom.
In these circumstances, the plan seems to have just a single objective: to sweep under the carpet, even at the cost of the very worst of concessions, even to the detriment of the Greek Cypriots, a problem which was threatening to be an obstacle to Turkeyâs accession to the European Union.
Those who voted today for the resolution supporting this plan have therefore simply acted as supporters for Turkeyâs entry.
Â Â  .âAt a time when the UN Security Council refuses to take a stand, the ÎU and the European Parliament are throwing all their weight behind the Annan plan, coercing the people and the political forces of Cyprus.
The resolution adopted is an insult of the first magnitude to the Cypriot people, in that it calls on them 'to be fully responsible, consistent and committed to their status as EU citizens'.
It extols the Annan plan as a shining example for the settlement of equally difficult international issues and maintains that it establishes a functioning federal system of intergovernmentalism.
Of course, it does not contain a word about the Turkish invasion and occupation, the British bases and the guarantor powers.
No embarrassment about the presence of Turkish troops on EU territory.
Equally repulsive of the content of the resolution were the positions of numerous 'friends' of Cyprus, including President Pat Cox, Commissioners Verheugen and Patten and Greek MEPs.
The President accused the Cypriot media of exclusion at a time when he himself, in an interview with a Cypriot newspaper, talked at leisure about the Cypriot leadership's lack of courage and imagination.
The Commissioners spoke in unacceptable terms, extremely derogatory and insulting, as sovereigns to their subjects.
The Communist Party of Greece supports the Cypriot people, Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, and roundly condemns any form of pressure, threat or coercion.
Â Â  .â Surprise and anger were caused by the stand taken by Mr Verheugen, who set the tone for the unrestrained catalogue of dangers and pressures heard in plenary today.
The Commissioner exceeded the remit granted to him by his institutional role and the need to respect the democratic rights of which the Commission is supposedly the guardian.
Such stands should not be adopted when the common ground of all the Greek parties is that the Cypriot people should decide without pressure, assessing without haste the possibilities and the dangers which each possible outcome of the referendum implies.
Apart from the viability and workability of the proposed solution, security guarantees and guarantees for the application of the arrangements are needed.
This sort of stand by Parliament would operate beneficially in shaping the political preconditions, by which I mean support for the solution by the overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, so that unification of the island can proceed and the two communities can be reconciled within the framework of a twin-community, twin-zone federation.
The resolution, instead of adopting a pressure line, should have clearly emphasised respect for whatever choice the Cypriots make and accepted the constructive amendments proposed by the GUE/NGL and the Coalition MEP Îr Papayannakis on securing clear undertakings and guarantees.
Following the rejection of the positive amendments, I could not adopt such a text and I abstained from the final vote.
Â Â  . We reaffirm our ongoing solidarity with the Cypriot people in their fight against military occupation by Turkey and in their struggle for their country to be reunified.
We believe it is a matter of principle and a fundamental requirement to ensure that the sovereign decision of the Cypriot people on its present and future â which falls to the Cypriot people alone â is respected, without any unacceptable interference, blackmail or pressure, in particular over the plan presented by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 31Â March, and which will be the subject of a referendum on 24Â April.
For this reason, we firmly reject any intention or attempt to renegotiate the Republic of Cyprusâs Treaty of Accession to the European Union, to consider Turkeyâs accession to the European Union, when what are termed the âCopenhagen criteriaâ have not in any way been fulfilled, or to âlegitimiseâ Turkeyâs occupation of part of Cyprus.
Hence our vote against the resolution, which did not even consider the amendments tabled by our group.
Â Â  .âThe Annan plan is totally out of keeping with the UN resolutions.
It cancels out the crime of invasion and occupation, it acquits, rewards and proclaims the conqueror guarantor.
It establishes a state which is unique in the annals of international law and which is not viable.
Basically there are two states, with separate economies, trade, industry, agricultural policy and employment policy.
It leaves huge problems with regard to the return of refugees, compensation for property and the presence of colonists.
It creates a situation of constant tension between the two communities, leaving the door open for new â including military â interventions.
The Cypriot people are being put under intolerable pressure and are being subjected to all sorts of coercion.
We consider the statements made today by MrÂ Verheugen and others and threats of the 'end of the world' if they do not accept the Annan plan to be unacceptable.
We especially condemn the disgraceful, pitiful warning by Mr Verheugen to the Cypriots that, if they do not vote yes, the number of occupying troops and colonists will double.
And he was applauded for that!
It is a disgrace!
This is the EU 'of peace', as Mr Verheugen maintained today.
We consider it unacceptable for the USA and the EU to keep reminding the Cypriots that this is a unique opportunity (for whom exactly?).
The Communist Party of Greece again expresses its undivided support for the Cypriot people.
The only acceptable solution is to apply existing UN resolutions and summit agreements on a united, independent Cyprus with no foreign bases and troops, a federal, twin-community, twin-zone, common homeland for Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, without foreign guarantors or protectors.
Â Â  . For forty years, the Greek Cypriots have insisted on their island's reunification.
To the Turkish Cypriot minority in the North, that was unacceptable, because they feared becoming a disadvantaged minority in their own country.
Meanwhile, a majority of the Turkish-speaking Cypriots are probably in favour of reunification and reconciliation on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's plan.
In it, a Belgian model of state is being proposed, a federation of two monolingual federal states.
It now looks like a majority of the Greek-speaking population will be voting against on 24 April because it wants more rights for itself and fewer for the Turkish-speaking minority.
It wants to enforce the unilateral pre-condition that Cyprus become a Greek-speaking unified state, in which individual Turks are allowed to live.
At this rate, agreement will never be reached between the two nations and the barbed-wire border separation will remain in place for ever.
Along with most of the groups, Commissioner Verheugen now feels cheated, and rightly so.
I warned against this as long ago as 5 September 2001 when we discussed the Poos report on Cyprus' accession to the EU.
By only admitting the Greek-speaking part to the EU initially, the Turks could be forced to choose between poverty outside the EU or submission within the EU Member State Cyprus.
After the failed referendum, we will have to look for another way of admitting the Turkish-speaking part to the EU, if it so wishes.
Â Â  .âImmediately after Helsinki, the Communist Party of Greece stated that the procedure for integrating Cyprus into the EU was being used as a lever to bring about a definitive partition of Cyprus.
I mention this in order to emphasise that the course of events was prescribed from the moment resolving the Cyprus problem became expedient and in the interests of the ÎU rather than of the Cypriot people.
Indeed, how could the results of the 1974 Turkish invasion and occupation be reversed when the EU never addressed the Cyprus problem as such, never made withdrawal from the occupation of Cyprus a precondition to the integration of Turkey?
How could a fair solution be obtained with the involvement of the EU and the USA when what happened in 1974 is daily practice nowadays on the part of the imperialist powers in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and Palestine?
How could the UN Secretary General express something different from the international coalition of forces, by which we mean the new imperialist order?
It is therefore no paradox that the Annan plan tramples over earlier UN resolutions and twin-community agreements, establishing a peculiar, so-called confederation of a state, unique in the annals of international law and partitioned under a foreign protectorate.
The Communist Party of Greece expresses its undivided solidarity with the entire Cypriot nation.
We call on you to do likewise and to stop this blatant coercion.
Â Â  I have voted against the resolution (adopted by 422 votes to 30, with 47 abstentions) prior to Cyprusâs referendums on 24 April, because the European Parliament would thus be contributing to the Turkish occupation of the northern part of the island.
The resolution clearly supports the Annan plan.
Previously, the European Parliament has consistently referred to the UN resolutions on Cyprus, demanding that the occupation cease and that there be an end to the division of the country.
The occupation forces are being reduced in number, but are to remain in place for an unspecifiable period.
Turkey continues to be given the right to intervene unilaterally, and its occupation continues, even though it is being reduced from 37% to 28.5% of the island.
A number of the Greek Cypriot refugees are being allowed to return to their occupied homes.
Others are being offered financial compensation in the form of bonds that can be redeemed, for an unknown value, in 20 to 25 yearsâ time.
Cyprus is not being allowed to contribute to, and support, the EUâs security and defence policy in its territory without the approval of the Turkish Government.
In practice, Cyprus will not be a fully-fledged EU Member State.
Turkish citizens are being given the same rights to visit, and stay in, Cyprus as Greek citizens.
Cyprus cannot enter into Schengen cooperation because the whole of the Turkish population would be given free entry to the Schengen area.
Cyprusâs presidents are being urged to request that the European Court of Human Rights overturn all the judgments in which Greek Cypriot refugees have been given the right to recover their property in the northern part of the island.
Â Â  We voted against the resolution in support of the Annan plan, which is flagrantly biased and iniquitous and cannot form a firm and enduring basis for settlement of the Cyprus question.
The resolution is right in line with the pressure and blackmail being exerted on the Greek Cypriots by the Commission, another example of which we heard today with the intervention of Commissioner Verheugen in plenary.
This pressure takes the form of both unacceptable blame heaped on those who would dare to vote against the plan that others wish to impose upon them, and promises of fabulous financial aid if the vote goes the right way.
In actual fact, the Commission has just one single objective: to exonerate Turkey, drawing a veil over the fact that it has invaded the northern part of Cyprus, where it is still in military occupation.
Who cares if this means an agreement which tramples on the rights of the Greek Cypriots!
The main thing is for Turkey, whose Islamist government naturally supports the Annan plan, to appear to be a respectable candidate deserving to join the European Union.
Those who supported the European Parliamentâs resolution are therefore clearly in favour of the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
Â Â  . This report aims to speed up the creation of a single euro payment area, before 2010, thus making a further contribution to completing the internal market.
In the name of competition, priority is given to the interests of economic operators to the detriment of consumer protection.
It is interesting to note that the rapporteurâs main concern is the efficiency of the payments sector, which is deemed to be âunsatisfactoryâ.
Nothing, however, is said about the charges faced by consumers, about the increased rates and commissions for payment service operations, such as cash transfers, which have occurred particularly in the banking sector following the Euroâs entry into circulation, which have heavily penalised consumers, and on which no serious study has been conducted and no appropriate legislation exists.
The rapporteur is extremely quick, however, to reject the idea that payment service providers should be held to account in the event of merchant-customer disputes, the idea of maximum charges for closing bank accounts and the idea of restricting the personal contribution by customers in the event of unauthorised transactions.
He also considers the obligations on operators to provide their customers with information to be excessive.
This is why we voted against the report.
We also have reservations about the scope of the future legal framework for national payments, since consumers should clearly not have to put up with conditions that are less favourable than they are currently.
Â Â  . The need to expand and complete the internal market requires payment services to be more efficient.
The introduction, at the beginning of 2002, of Euro notes and coins has helped to make cash payments more efficient.
The introduction of new systems â such as TARGET â for the banking sector has also streamlined cross-border transfers of large sums, with visible advantages for consumers, by adopting a coordinated approach to the security of transactions and to the efficiency and speed of the system.
The shortcomings seen in the sector involving the cross-border transfers of small sums apparently reside in the inadequacy of the legal framework at European level that the Commission proposes to present, nevertheless, the structure of this framework â the form and number of legal instruments â is still not known.
I welcome, in principle, the intention announced by the Commission, although I do agree with some of the rapporteurâs observations, in particular his warning that regulatory initiatives should be restricted to the âbig pictureâ and a number of selected areas, giving the economic operators themselves the necessary leeway for self-regulation.
Â Â  . I am pleased to support this report and the IPP Communication, which seeks to support sustainable development by reducing resource use and the negative impact of waste disposal, and by reducing the environmental impact from products throughout their life-cycle.
The Commission puts a lot of emphasis on 'working with the market'.
Such an approach has clear merits, but will only be successful in an environment where 'green products' are priced favourably compared to other products.
The application of the Polluter Pays Principle would be a key step in this direction.
I hope that the Commission will respond to this report and take urgent steps to present a framework directive for IPP based on clearly defined principles and objectives and including the specific demands included in this report.
Â Â  . This Commission communication, which follows on from consultation with the interested parties, which took place following the approval of the Green Paper on IPP (Integrated Product Policy), in February 2001, defines the measures the Communication will adopt, in order to push ahead with the IPP at European level, with the aim of limiting the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle.
The Commissionâs IPP approach consists of pushing ahead to achieve sustainable development: pragmatically including all the interested parties, such as those working on the projects, the various sectors of industry, retailers and consumers, creating an appropriate economic and legal framework (corporate acquisitions that are more ecologically sound, promoting ecological labelling) and promoting research (drawing up pilot-projects targeting specific products).
As I have stated many times before, European industry and producers must be made more aware of the importance of genuinely sustainable economic growth and of sustainable systems of production â which entails recycling, waste treatment, protection of the water, etc. â to match the growing awareness of the European public itself.
This issue is becoming increasingly important in Union policy and this Communication is a step in this direction.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  Mr President, as I stated during yesterday's debate, I have voted in favour of the Sterckx report because it is a sound one.
It does, however, give the European people an unwarranted sense of security.
Yesterday, I found out that the European Maritime Safety Agencyâs plan of action cannot, for budgetary reasons, be implemented.
This means that both in terms of quality and quantity, there is insufficient capacity to guarantee the safety of citizens along the European coasts.
Which means that all the work we have done has reached a disappointing conclusion, particularly because we know that Member States refuse to take part in introducing criminal sanctions.
Consequently, what we have proposed here is lacking in substance, which is very regrettable, but it has not prevented me from voting in favour of the report.
I do take the view, though, that it is necessary to clearly define responsibilities, and so this must be recorded in the Minutes of this House.
Â Â  The June Movement has today decided to vote in favour of the report on improving safety at sea, since we naturally support all sensible comments on environmental considerations and the combating of oil pollution.
It must be emphasised, however, that the June Movement cannot support the ideas concerning a European coastguard service.
The Member States themselves should determine control of their own waters and coasts.
There is no reason for the EU to be involved in this.
Moreover, the June Movement decided to vote neither in favour of, nor against, Amendment No 5, since we are unable to support a desire for greater harmonisation.
At the same time, however, we consider it necessary to put a stop to the ruthless exploitation suffered by crews on many vessels.
Â Â  . We welcome the fact that two important proposals, which we have retabled in plenary, have been adopted.
- The first acknowledges that, in order to ensure maritime safety, crewmembers must be qualified, have decent working hours and conditions and a reasonable salary and that the exploitation that takes place on countless vessels must be ended.
This is why the Commission is called on to adopt legislative measures to harmonise and enhance this profession at European level and to sign up to this idea under the auspices of the IMO.
- The second advocates EU action to ban flags of convenience in European territorial waters.
Hence our vote in favour.
Â Â  We are giving this explanation of vote in connection with the following items.
Item 13: We welcome increased European cooperation between the national coastguard services when it comes to joint operations, planning and the development of competence.
We do not therefore believe that there is a need to develop a new, parallel organisation in the form of a European coastguard service.
Item 17: We are doubtful about European funding of places of refuge.
We believe that those countries that have accepted their responsibility and funded places of refuge along their coasts should not be forced by other statesâ negligence to create places of refuge.
Â Â  . â The report by the temporary committee is yet another attempt to conceal the anti-labour policy in shipping and defuse reactions by the grass-roots and labour movement to crimes at sea in which dozens of seafarers lose their lives every year and which have grievous consequences on the environment.
The allegation in the report, that 80% of accidents are due to human error, is erroneous, unscientific and suspicious, in that it endeavours to cover up the responsibility of the shipping companies and government authorities by concealing the deterioration in naval training and glossing over the consequences of an obsolete fleet, defective surveys, inadequate crew compositions and intensification of the work of seafarers.
The accidents are directly linked to the unaccountability which prevails, especially in the second registers of the Members States of the EU and on ships sailing under flags of convenience.
It has been proven that the shipping registers operate as mechanisms to cover up infringements of legislation and perpetuate the unaccountability of shipowners, by issuing certificates which, on most occasions, do not reflect the actual state of the vessel.
The proposals by the Commission and by Parliament conceal the responsibilities and promote the behaviour of the big shipping and shore monopolies and, on the pretext of combating terrorism, promote measures which strike at fundamental democratic rights of seafarers.
We demand the immediate release of the master of the tanker and his return to Greece.
Â Â  . â To widespread indifference, eighteen people died in January 2004 in the wreck of the freighter off the coast of Norway.
Maritime transport is still subject to the laws of the âcrooks of the seasâ and the European Union does nothing!
Three years since the adoption of the âErikaâ legislative packages, seven Member States (Italy, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and the Netherlands) have still not incorporated Community decisions into their national legislation.
There is a pressing need to put an end to the system of convenience in maritime transport.
We must do away with flags of convenience, starting with those in the EU.
We must guarantee a high level of training and remuneration for seafarers.
We must provide ourselves with the means of enforcing the legislation, strengthening the ranks of the inspectors or establishing a European coastguard force.
Finally, we must turn the spotlight on the responsibilities involved in the sinking of the , especially those of the Aznar Government.
With the accession of Cyprus and Malta, the EU will become the number one maritime power in the world.
It will have the ability to change the IMO rules in a sector affected by capitalist globalisation.
Without this commitment, we shall continue to be powerless to stop the human, social and environmental destruction.
The Sterckx report is broadly inadequate in this respect.
Â Â  . I congratulate MrÂ Sterckx on his report on maritime safety, which I fully support.
I share the concerns about maritime safety expressed by the Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and by the rapporteur himself, reminding all parties involved that maritime safety is an issue that still requires substantial and lasting political attention.
This will determine the quality and safety of vessels navigating European waters and European vessels throughout the world as well as protection of the coasts and of the European public.
I firmly support the measures that have been adopted in this field, particularly those banning single-hulled tankers transporting heavy oils from European waters and those conferring further powers on the European Maritime Safety Agency.
I shall conclude by reaffirming something to which I have referred on several occasions during my term of office: safety is everyoneâs responsibility and requires everyoneâs commitment!
Â Â  . The Spanish Government, which was responsible for the disaster involving the tanker and the fuel oil on the coasts of Spain, France and Portugal, has now been voted out by the electorate.
In order to ward off possible oil pollution in one Spanish port, the captain of this ship was instructed to leave the coast and eventually to sink in open sea, as a result of which the disaster became much greater.
Of the 77Â 000 tonnes of crude oil on board, 43Â 000 tonnes have been salvaged, and it is estimated that 14Â 000 tonnes are still on board.
This means that 20Â 000 tonnes disappeared into the sea and that the coast of Galicia remains polluted long term.
The report is right to criticise the Netherlands and Belgium for not, apparently, regarding the application of port state control and vessel inspection by classification bureaus as an urgent matter.
Proposals have been made for the designation of ports of refuge, compulsory insurance cover to be able to recoup damage and costs from shipowners, the use of transmitters to trace lost containers and the stricter observation of existing environmental and safety rules; these receive my support.
It is unfortunate that the European coastguard service, which it is apparently planned to set up, is not only intended for the joint protection of the environment, safety and compliance with fishery restrictions, but is also directly linked to the hunt for immigrants and possible terrorists and the further construction of a European superstate.
Â Â  . Following on from an EP resolution of September 2003, inspired by the and petrol tanker disasters, a temporary committee was set up specifically to deal with issues relating to maritime safety.
This committee has held various hearings with experts and leaders from Union countries, who helped it to gain a more thorough understanding of the issue.
Its activity is coming to an end, with the adoption in plenary of a resolution aimed at summing up the approximately six months of its duration.
Unfortunately, because some of the contributions have contradicted one another, this temporary committee has not been able fully to clarify the causes and the circumstances of the sinking of the , an aspect also referred to in the Sterckx report.
I share the rapporteurâs concerns, specifically where he focuses on ways of improving maritime safety and insists on some points that I believe to be important, such as the need for the EU to work together with countries affected by maritime disasters; the publication of the black list of vessels that must be banned from entering EU ports and the development of a system for detecting vessels transporting hazardous goods at sea.
Although the temporary committee has to date served to maintain the interest of the Institutions, Member States and other organisations involved in the field, it is now up to each of these to assimilate this concern and, above all, to bear in mind ...
Â Â  It was out of the question for us to vote in favour of the Sterckx report, in view of its criticism of the Malaga measures jointly agreed by France and Spain to the great benefit of European maritime safety, but with the inherent defect, in the eyes of the majority in this Parliament, of being the product of cooperation between Member States and not of a supranational procedure.
I am also astonished that French Members were able to go along with the categorical condemnation of an initiative taken by Messrs Chirac and Aznar, which considerably improves the safety of our coasts, our coastal populations and our fishermen.
Although we eventually abstained on the Sterckx report, this was due to the adoption of a number of positive amendments improving the text, in particular with regard to the need to outlaw flags of convenience in European waters and provide for complete redress for damage caused by oil slicks to all of those involved, within the framework of a thoroughly restructured IMO.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
(1)
Â Â  Colleagues, it is my pleasure to welcome this afternoon, on behalf of the European Parliament, two eminent representatives from the Geneva Initiative for Peace in the Middle East: the former speaker of the Knesset, Mr Avraham Burg and the former Minister of Information in the Palestinian Authority, Mr Yasser Abed Rabbo.
I hope that the meetings they had yesterday and this morning with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the delegations for relations with Israel and the Palestinian Legislative Council, and representatives of the political groups will have been fruitful.
The lively interest shown by Members in these meetings testifies to the enthusiastic support of the European Parliament for the Geneva Initiative.
You are very welcome here.
I hope that you appreciate that this afternoon we have a very light attendance in the House because we only finished our vote eight minutes ago.
I think everybody is enjoying their lunch at the moment.
Thank you for coming.
Â Â  The next item is the continuation of the debate on the Council and Commission statements on transatlantic relations.
Â Â  Mr President, thank you, although I regret that Mr Patten has perhaps not had time to come back to the sitting.
On several occasions, I, like others, have been deeply concerned about the unilateralism of the United States.
The list is a long one, covering collective security, human rights, development and environmental protection.
What type of proposal should be made with regard to trans-Atlantic relations just a few weeks away from the Dublin Summit?
Would not the best âserviceâ the Union could do for this partnership be to display a critical attitude with respect to American views in several areas and, especially, to take the initiative in different directions?
I am thinking first of all of the distressing situation in the Middle East.
Mr Prodi has described the assassination of the Hamas leader as an illegal and irresponsible act.
I also heard, and duly noted, what the Council said at this morningâs debate.
However, just a few days since the green light was given by President Bush to continue with the policy of occupation and division of Palestinian territory, when is Europe going to decide to take the courageous initiatives that are required and that it has the means to implement: suspend the EU-Israel agreement, insist that an international protection force be sent, and convene an international conference involving in particular the protagonists of the Geneva agreement?
In Iraq, the blinkered attitude of the Bush administration, producing daily human tragedies, should mean, in this area too, far greater involvement of the European Union so that a real transfer of sovereignty guaranteed by the UN can take place as soon as possible.
This critical attitude is again of relevance with respect to the American plans for the Middle East as a whole, attempting to impose a âdemocracy kitâ from the outside, mainly to guarantee American economic and strategic interests as defined by President Bush.
Finally, the needs of the war on terrorism cannot be used to justify a drift towards discriminatory security.
Also, I am concerned about the statements made by the Council and the Commission today, going back over Parliamentâs rejection of the transfer of air passengersâ personal data.
Apart from clearly essential security measures, observing the rule of law, the response to terrorism must not ignore its causes.
Taking the initiative within the IMF or the WTO with a view to alleviating inequalities throughout the world could, again, be a useful European contribution.
Â Â  Mr President, Europe and the United States do, of course, have a great deal in common, and the need for a dialogue between the two is self-evident, for neither can solve the global problems on their own.
However, let there be no misunderstanding: this would be a dialogue between partners that hold fundamentally different views on a number of crucial issues, some of which I should like to mention.
At the heart of Europe's safety strategy is conflict prevention and preventive involvement.
Crucial to the Bush strategy is armed preventive attacks.
The EU's objective is to reinforce the United Nations; that of the United States is multilateralism via the UN, if possible and if it suits Washington and not via the UN if it does not.
The EU's ambition is to stop the distribution of weapons of mass destruction.
Officially, that is also the line taken by the US, but at the same time, friendly regimes, including Israel in Palestine, are being protected, while the US itself continues developing what is called mini-nukes.
The European Union is in favour of the International Criminal Court with a view to reinforcing international law.
The United States is making every effort to make life for the Criminal Court as difficult as possible.
The European Union is a civil superpower or, rather, it could be, if it were to concentrate more on improving the points it is good at, or could be good at. These points are conflict prevention, reinforcement of multilateral organisation, trade â fair trade if it were up to my group â and military action, under the UN flag, only if that proves to be unavoidable.
In Iraq, the United States learnt the hard way that it cannot solve the problems of dictatorial regimes and terrorism without the help of the United Nations and Europe.
However, let there be no mistake: that applies just as much to the European Union.
That is why it is best for Europe to adopt the policy of joining forces with the United States where at all possible, but it should not shrink back from being uncooperative should this prove necessary.
Not because idealistic politicians think so, but because our citizens expect Europe to speak with one voice and act assertively in order to restrain the United States if necessary.
Â Â  Mr President, the distress in Iraq is as acute as ever.
That was again brought home to me in a telephone call I received from Baghdad on Monday evening.
My Iraqi informer is directly involved â in the Ministry of Education, no less â in the reconstruction of his home country, multifariously ruined Mesopotamia that is Iraq.
He was very harsh in his criticism of the United States and the European Union.
If the transatlantic partners do not finally join forces emphatically in a military and economic sense for a better future for Iraq, this could well backfire at some point.
What does this urgent appeal from Baghdad mean in practical terms?
It means that NATO must pacify Mesopotamia, preferably under a UN mandate, and that there must be a generous Marshall plan in order to neutralise the pull of radical groupings.
Personally, I should like to warmly back this appeal within the Council and the Commission.
That is the only way for the European Union to prove itself a solid partner to the United States.
It is the only way for the European institutions to prove that they want to carry political responsibility for a world which appears to be ripe for the assault by the forces of the ultimate evil of terrorists for whom human life does not count, irrespective of whether this involves the life of Iraqi fellow-countrymen, fellow-believers or that of Spaniards.
According to the Bible, a divided house will not stand.
That applies to the European Union itself.
Â Â  Mr President, since the war in Iraq, transatlantic relations have gone sour.
This has led to much tension within the present European Union.
It looks as if this tension is set to stay, certainly initially, following enlargement.
That is a very sad conclusion because I am convinced that Europe is mistaking its enemy.
After all, the debate is not about how Europe can provide a counterweight for the power of the United States, but about the question of how we can best fight international terrorism.
In my view, terrorism can only really be tackled by means of transatlantic solidarity and collective action.
That is why the political leaders in Europe have an important role to play.
More specifically, this Parliament should underline more emphatically how much Europe stands to lose in the event of continuing tension and how much it stands to gain from actual cooperation with the United States.
With this message, I bid the European Parliament farewell.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the presidency for the hospitality shown in Ireland.
It was indeed a memorable occasion, though I did not know that we were in Mr Roche's constituency.
Of course, we were very well received and the hospitality was superb.
Thank you very much indeed, Mr Roche.
The spirit of your remarks and of Commissioner Patten's shows that, despite the enormous difficulties we have had in transatlantic relations in the past few months, a great deal could be achieved at this EU-US Summit if we have sufficient courage to do so.
The remarks made give me some encouragement that we can make real progress.
My first point concerns the question of the joint study â which you mentioned, Commissioner â looking at the economic aspects.
I warmly welcome that because, if we can look at the remaining barriers to trade, we can aim for a barrier-free transatlantic market.
Perhaps you might have the courage to say that this should be done within a ten-year period.
That would genuinely galvanise communities on both sides to overcome the remaining obstacles.
My second point, perhaps as important, is that we should look at the broader framework of transatlantic relations.
As you have said, Commissioner, so many subjects form part of this agenda: the environment, foreign policy, industrial and social policy and, as we have seen, PNR data as well.
It now needs a new framework to take these into account and, in particular, bring the parliamentary dialogue into the broader framework of the relationship.
I therefore welcome the fact that you wish to carry out an independent review.
I hope this wish will be shared by our American friends as well, so that at the EU-US summit next year, when we have the incoming administrations, we would be able to pave the way for a broader agreement, possibly a partnership agreement, to be struck between the EU and the US perhaps by 2007.
Thank you very much for your comments.
I wish you well, President-in-Office, and hope that, when you come to Dublin, we will have a statement to set out the future of the relationship which both Europeans and Americans can recognise.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, if we look back over the last debate and compare it with the situation we have today, we have, I regret, no option but to conclude that the gulf in relations between the United States and Europe has at least not diminished.
We all had expectations and hopes that this would change for the better in the course of time.
Looking at our report, our declaration, our motion for a resolution, I see three major political themes: the strengthening of the United Nations, the situation in the Middle East and the fight against terrorism.
In all three of these â when considered realistically and not just optimistically â there are major differences.
Where strengthening the United Nations is concerned, I do not see any change in emphasis in the USAâs policies.
If we are now to really get the United Nations more involved in Iraq, then we have to be very careful about it, for it must be the United Nations in reality, rather than the United Nations acting as something like an extension of the occupying powers in that country.
In that event, they will be sucked into the same maelstrom of violence and retaliation as the Americans have been.
The fact is that there is, in the region itself, nothing left of the loudly-trumpeted initiative for a new Middle East.
I wish we could join with the Americans in getting right down to the root causes and devising an overall strategy for the Middle East, which cannot, to be sure, focus on Israel and Palestine alone.
I also think there are still serious differences where anti-terrorism is concerned.
Today, I listened to Commissioner Patten â as always, it was a pleasure to do so â and I agree with many of his arguments.
He is wrong about the way I voted, but he is right about much else.
We have to be very careful about this, and it may be that we have to go to the outermost limit of what is legally feasible in order to have a real defence against terrorism, but what is essential is that we combat its causes, and there are, as before, great differences in the ways in which Europe and the United States of America go about doing that.
Â Â  Mr President, this morning, listening to Mr Patten, I was struck by the fact that he stated that, at the end of his five years in office as a Commissioner, he considered the international situation to be more dangerous than it was five years ago.
I share this view.
Perhaps more emphasis should be given than has been given in this resolution to the fact that one of the aspects of this dangerousness is the policy of unilateralism and, above all, the new American doctrine with regard to unilateralism.
I believe that this aspect is largely lacking in the motion for a resolution.
This is why we support most of the amendments submitted.
I shall take three extremely relevant examples of expectations with respect to the EU.
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, we actually heard Messrs Burg and Abed-Rabbo yesterday.
There was a very explicit request that the European Union and the ministers of foreign affairs should give far more support than they have in the past to the Geneva initiative.
There was also a request that the European Union should be proactive in the support of independent organisations, under international control, in Palestine.
These points should be clearly stated in our draft resolution.
Finally, I should also like the European Union to give more consideration to international studies.
Some have been quoted.
A report was published this summer under the aegis of the International Labour Organisation making practical proposals relating to good economic governance and the rules with respect to globalisation.
If we do not understand that, as has often been said in this House and as Commissioner Patten has also often repeated, the struggle against poverty is one of the fundamental aspects of the war on terrorism and if we do not follow the recommendations of international reports to which we ourselves contribute, we shall lose all credibility.
It is this type of message which the Bush administration must also be made to hear.
Â Â  Mr President, the United States, with just 3% of the world's population, is able to produce approximately 30% of the worldâs goods and services.
China, with six times the population and covering a much larger area, produces just 3%.
Russia now ranks below Switzerland in terms of gross domestic product.
What I mean to say by this is that the United States clearly enjoys a position of unprecedented political and military hegemony.
It is also fair to say, however, that the US has achieved this on its own merits.
I believe we must conclude that, if Europe wants to fulfil all its potential, we must do so in loyal cooperation with the United States.
This loyal cooperation does not mean that Europe has to issue a blank cheque; Europe has its own positions in relation to the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extra-territorial laws and trade policy.
We must also bear in mind that relations between the European Union and the United States are based on common values, on a shared history, and I believe it is important that we do not forget that the trans-Atlantic link is in the European Unionâs genetic code and in a shared passion for freedom.
Furthermore, I believe it is important not to forget that there is an extraordinary degree of interdependence in the economic and commercial fields.
Four-fifths of the new investments made in Europe today come from the United States and we must not forget that the 15 current Member States of the Union invest more in Texas, the home State of President Bush, than Japan invests in all 50 States of the Union.
I would therefore like to express my agreement, Mr President, with a fortunate phrase by Commissioner Patten, which I often use in my speeches, which is that everything we want to achieve as Europeans we will be able to achieve much more easily if we cooperate with the United States and I am sure that the United States can achieve what they want if they cooperate with us.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to raise two issues in my one minute.
Firstly, the proposal to launch a transatlantic marketplace is the brainchild of the Transatlantic Policy Network, consisting of multinational corporations, neo-liberal think tanks and politicians in this House.
It has never been the subject of a proper public debate, even though it will be the biggest deregulation project ever undertaken.
We do not believe it is in the interests of ordinary people.
Secondly, I want to urge the Council to raise with US colleagues the issue of Iraq and in particular the recent massacre at Fallujah â and I do not use the word massacre lightly.
Images of the US military's handling of the uprising in Fallujah have shocked the world.
More than 600 Iraqis have been killed or injured in the last two weeks by US bombing and ground operations, and yet EU Member States have failed to condemn the US military actions.
Maybe they accept the reassurance of the commander of US Marines that his men are 'trained to be precise in their firepower'.
However, over 350 of the dead in Fallujah were women and children.
In the light of US military use of unjustified and disproportionate force, and given the high death toll in this siege, I call on the Council to raise its human rights concerns in this transatlantic dialogue and to call for an independent commission of inquiry into the US military actions in the Fallujah region.
Â Â  Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate Minister Roche and Commissioner Patten for the very fine contributions they both made here today, contributions that should be carefully read by Members of this House who would benefit considerably from so doing.
There must now be a dawning realisation on the American government that unilateralism is simply not the way forward if we are to address the serious problems which confront the international community.
It is now clearer than ever that the American government did have a plan to rid Iraq of the evil dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, but that it did not have, and does not have, an exit strategy from Iraq.
This is the root of the political problem which now faces us.
Multilateral systems have a greater success and lay claim to greater legitimacy in upholding respect for the rule of law in relations between states.
Effective multilateralism means a commitment to work with others to resolve the root causes of conflict, to promote respect for human rights and to create the machinery for resolving differences by peaceful means.
A rule-based international order and strong international institutions, such as the United Nations, are of fundamental importance if international problems are to be tackled.
Multilateral cooperation is in the interests of us all and most particularly serves the interests of smaller states which, lacking military power, must rely on building support for a strong rule-based system.
We have placed our faith in the multilateral regime for disarmament and in non-proliferation treaties and agreements.
The war in Iraq has certainly strained relations between many countries in the European Union and with the American government.
The real question now is how best we can rebuild relations between the European Union and the United States of America.
We should remember that when it comes to European-American relations there is much more that unites us than divides us although that does not mean that we do not have our differences.
We have our differences over the Kyoto Protocol, we have our differences over a number of trading issues, but we are in a stronger position to promote the rule of law and to promote democracy when the European Union and the American government can work together as opposed to working in different directions.
Â Â  Mr President, the thought of the United States-European Union Summit planned for Dublin in two monthsâ time is sufficient justification for todayâs debate, which, just for once, is being held far enough ahead of the event. This should be the norm as often as possible in this House.
I am pleased that, on this occasion, the draft resolution produced by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, MrÂ Brok, makes much of the matters of security and defence which would justify, if necessary, a reassertion of the transatlantic links, which became extremely stretched at the time of the Iraq crisis.
On the eve of our next plenary session, which will witness the implementation of the enlargement approved today, it would be appropriate to repeat what we already stated in April in the context of the own-initiative report on European defence policy, the conclusions of which have been taken up by our treaty partners and will, I hope, result in positive decisions when the Intergovernmental Conference has completed its deliberations.
What did we say then, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten?
We said it was a good idea quite simply to repeat that NATO is still today a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security and that this is why it makes sense to strengthen the capabilities of both NATO and the European Union.
We must bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that we Europeans are partly responsible for the unilateralism of which we accuse the Americans so much, quite simply because we have been refusing for years to share with them the burden of defending our common values.
This is why I am pleased about the commitment in this respect, recently reaffirmed by our Parliament and by the Convention.
Â Â  Mr President, many of us, particularly on this side of the House, wish to strengthen relations with the United States.
In these dangerous times it is vitally important that democracies should come closer together and that any differences should be minimised.
I am encouraged by much of the positive and constructive language in the resolution before us and I am particularly pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my amendment calling for the establishment of a transatlantic single market by 2015.
We must now work to turn that aspiration into a reality.
It is a pity therefore that an otherwise good resolution is spoilt by some sniping against the United States or a subtext that has little to do with transatlantic relations and more to do with the obsessive movement towards some sort of European state.
The integrationalists clearly visualise just two interlocutors in the transatlantic relationship, the US and the EU.
The ambition is also for the EU to speak for the European countries in NATO and the UN.
Indeed, in the objectionable draft European Constitution there is a requirement that the new EU Foreign Minister should present the EU case in the UN Security Council in certain circumstances.
As a United Kingdom representative, I cannot accept that the European Union should represent us in our dealings with the United States on defence and security matters.
For over fifty years NATO has provided the forum where the nations of Europe and of North America have discussed the great security issues of our time and agreed on necessary action.
Difficulties arise when other institutions come into the frame.
It is misleading our own citizens and our allies to suggest that the development of an autonomous EU military capability has anything to do with reinforcing NATO or is motivated by the desire to work in close partnership with the United States.
I see no willingness among many EU Member States to contribute more military resources to the defence of the democracies and there is a lack of political will to deal robustly with the security threats that we face.
We have no wish to see the EU as such involved in defence policy.
We welcome rapid progress in the creation of a transatlantic single market.
Â Â  . Mr President, again I wish to thank Members for their contributions, not all of which I will be able to cover.
Parliament is well aware of how vital the transatlantic relationship is.
Indeed, I almost signed up for Mr Van Orden's presentation when he said that all sniping should stop, but I unfortunately part company with him on his portrayal of the new Constitutional Treaty.
That is a debate for another time.
He is right that it is all too easy to fall into the trap of sniping at the transatlantic relationship, and at the Americans in particular.
We know about the shared history of Europe and North America, how the history has been shaped and how it has shaped the values we both share â Mr Collins made that point.
All too often, however, the between the United States and Europe make the headlines.
It is time to promote the positive element of the relationship and to look at what we can achieve together, rather than continuously to focus on those issues on which we cannot agree.
We should consider how we turn the ideas we share into a common reality.
That is the challenge that faces political leadership in Europe and in the United States.
Like all close partnerships, we do not agree on all issues at all times.
Even the happiest marriages occasionally have points of disagreement.
We must, however, work to maintain our dialogue and to cooperate in areas of shared interest.
Mr Suominen was right to say that finger pointing is neither attractive nor productive.
I would certainly agree with that view.
When Mr Collins pointed out the benefits of an effective multilateralist approach, as seen from Europe's viewpoint, he did so without the necessity that some people feel to attack the American viewpoint.
He simply put forward the fact that there are two different viewpoints and proposed that we should work to produce a synthesis rather than to generate disagreement.
The fact is that we are working successfully with our United States partners across a full range of foreign policy issues, trade issues and economic issues in a sprit of partnership.
There certainly are â and will continue to be â areas of disagreement.
The reality that so much that we do in this relationship is positive should not be obscured by the disagreements of the moment.
Mr Belder mentioned the Marshall Plan.
It was very interesting and timely that he should do so, because we need to remind ourselves that if it were not for the extraordinary generosity of the United States and the Marshall Plan, where would Europe be and where would this Union have been?
The forthcoming EU-US Summit in June is vital.
It is very important in terms of the relationship and it is important that we share views, discuss differences and identify more clearly the areas of cooperation.
The Irish presidency is working hard to ensure a successful summit.
That is not to suggest that we are supine or that we would not agree occasionally to disagree on issues â of course we will.
However, we in the presidency will do all we can to steer the relationship back onto a positive and productive track.
I would just like to mention, because a number of Members made this point, that what we say in Europe is amplified in the USA, and that what we say here is very frequently misportrayed over there.
I am often shocked when I am in the United States at how often Europe is misunderstood and sometimes misrepresented.
However, I have no doubt that visitors from the United States listening to our debates must sometimes be mystified as to how the United States is perceived, misunderstood and misrepresented here in Europe.
As politicians, we have a responsibility to inform our citizens about the positive aspects of the relationship, notwithstanding the fact that there are occasional blips in it.
In the past that relationship has been incredibly positive and I believe that will continue to be the case.
One speaker made the point that this was a good debate to have and a good time to have it.
I agree.
I thank Members for their contributions, in all their diversity.
While it will not be possible to follow all the advice that has been proffered simultaneously, I feel it important to say that the presidency has listened very carefully to what this House has had to say on this matter.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I would be extremely grateful to you if you were to allow me to say one more thing about trans-Atlantic relations.
I would like to urge the House to support this resolution, for, as the debate has shown, we have to strengthen transatlantic relations in such a way that they are no longer founded only upon NATO and security policy, but that we will be spreading them more widely and deepening them.
The Council Presidency will support this, and so, I am sure will the Commission.
The idea of the Transatlantic Marketplace is certainly a matter of very great importance, and so it would make sense if the EU/US Summit were to convene a group of experts to carry out, over the coming months, the studies that will be needed to enable us to get more involved in this project.
Its significance is not merely economic; it will have a direct effect on the deepening of transatlantic relations.
At the same time, though, it has to be said that my committee â unlike the lead Committee â actually takes the view that we should welcome the outcomes of the Commissionâs negotiations on air transport, to prevent matters being made more difficult at this present time for people travelling back and forth, and that, here too, we should seek a practical approach in order thereby to strengthen relations even in the age of terrorism.
Â Â  I have received one motion for a resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am reminded of an occasion when a senior politician in Ireland was described in very uncomplimentary terms because he was up and down so frequently making contributions.
I will not go any further into the quotation, but will be available for private consultation on it later on!
I would like to thank the House for this opportunity to address the situation in Pakistan.
I know that this is an issue on which there are divided and diverse views.
The Council considers it vitally important that the European Union should continue to strengthen its relationship with Pakistan.
That view is shared by Pakistan itself.
An enhanced relationship between the European Union and Pakistan is not just important on a bilateral basis.
It is also important given the context of Pakistan's regional role in South Asia.
I am therefore pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs â and I see Mr Brok is here to present its views â last week approved the conclusion of the third generation agreement with Pakistan, and that in consequence a resolution to that effect is before Parliament and will be voted on later.
Parliament is aware that the Council is of the view that the agreement is an important element in building an enhanced relationship with Pakistan.
In such a relationship Pakistan can demonstrate its commitment to the respect, protection and promotion of human rights and to democratic principles, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and contained in Article 1 of the agreement.
We all know that serious concerns remain in relation to human rights and democratic principles in Pakistan.
Indeed, these concerns have been outlined in the resolution and recognised in the work of the committee.
I can well understand that the committee needed time to weigh up carefully the pros and cons of the issue and would like to extend my appreciation to the committee members and in particular to its chairman, Mr Brok, and to the rapporteur, Mr Cushnahan, for the work they have done in this area.
I can assure Parliament that the Council is well aware of the concerns that have been aired in the committee and takes those concerns very seriously.
At the end of February this year Ireland's Foreign Minister, Mr Brian Cowen, as President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, conveyed those concerns to President Musharraf and to the Pakistani Foreign Minister when the EU ministerial troika visited Islamabad.
The well-documented revelations regarding Dr Khan and the proliferation of nuclear technology were also addressed.
The EU ministerial troika expressed its grave concern at these revelations.
For its part the Pakistani side assured the European Union that the revelations will continue to be fully investigated.
The presidency hopes this investigation will be thorough and credible.
The European Union will continue to monitor this issue.
There are other political issues which give rise to serious concern.
The situation within the parliament, where the committee system has yet to be fully established, is far from ideal.
Furthermore, on 13 April Mr Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy, was sentenced to a total of 23 years imprisonment for what Pakistani authorities called 'inciting the army to mutiny'.
The European Union has raised and will continue to raise with the Pakistani authorities its concern at these issues and the implications they could have for future EU-Pakistan relations.
There is also the position of religious minorities and journalists, who have been subject to restrictions on freedom of expression, arbitrary arrest and worse.
We are concerned at all these issues.
Nevertheless, on the positive side of the balance sheet, the third generation agreement would strengthen the platform from which the European Union can convey to the Pakistani authorities at the highest level the importance it attaches to relations with Pakistan and, as part of those relations, our concerns on human rights, democratisation, non-proliferation and other vital issues.
I would also mention that the conclusion of the third generation agreement clears the way for immediate conclusion of the technical negotiations already under way between the Commission and Pakistan on the readmission agreement.
It is important to note that there have been a number of other positive developments.
During the ministerial troika visit to Islamabad the EU welcomed the very important agreement that had just been reached by Pakistan and India on modalities for a composite dialogue between the two neighbours, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
It is in the interests of the region, the European Union and the wider international community that such positive developments be supported and encouraged.
President Musharraf's commitment to the fight against terrorism is also to be welcomed.
It highlights Pakistan's crucial regional role, which has a bearing on the situation in Afghanistan and its nascent democratic process.
I would also like to point out, again on a positive note, that significant progress has been made on the issue of the since our last meeting.
Following the very positive moves by the Pakistani authorities in response to repeated European representations, all eight people have been released and have now returned to their homes.
I am certain that honourable Members will welcome this development, as the presidency does.
I am also certain that they will take some satisfaction in it because the vigilance and attention this Parliament has shown on this issue has been helpful.
In summary, while there remain points of concern as regards Pakistan, the Council considers that the European Union must engage with Pakistan on those points rather than isolate it.
The Council will continue to work towards a resolution of these remaining concerns â which are shared by Parliament â in the interests of Pakistan, the region and the Union and, most importantly of all, in the interests of peace in the international community.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome the vote by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy at its meeting of 14 April, to recommend approval of the third-generation cooperation agreement with Pakistan.
I am fully aware that this was passed by a pretty slim majority and that for many committee members this was not a decision that was taken lightly.
I very much respect the principled stand taken by the rapporteur during the deliberations that have taken place in the European Parliament.
I have come to value my honourable friend as a friend of democracy and a friend of human rights in Asia and he has done outstanding work as the European Union's Chief Election Observer in Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Although I sympathise with many of the rapporteurâs views, I was not able to support him in his recommendation to keep the agreement pending.
This is because I feel we should regard this agreement as an opportunity to engage positively with Pakistan as an important partner in a sensitive region.
I therefore hope that plenary, when it votes, will be able to endorse the Foreign Affairs Committee's recommendation that the agreement be concluded.
Perhaps I could recapitulate why the European Commission continues to support the entry into force of this third-generation cooperation agreement.
First and foremost, by means of Article 1, it offers an opportunity to engage more substantially with Pakistan on critical issues of human rights and democracy.
Secondly, the agreement gives us a better basis for addressing challenges in several key areas, including basic education, trade and institutional links.
Last but not least, the agreement opens up the possibility of engaging Pakistan in new areas not previously covered, such as regional cooperation, money laundering and energy.
We regard recent developments as strengthening our position in favour of entering into this agreement, in particular the encouraging efforts for reconciliation with India, as well as domestic political developments in Pakistan.
As a result of these initiatives there has been a noticeable thaw in Pakistan's international relations.
For example, there are now indications that Pakistan may be readmitted as a full member of the Commonwealth in due course.
I am also pleased to see that the seamen of the , including the master, have now been released and have returned to Greece and the Philippines.
I know that many Members of the House have taken a strong personal interest in this matter.
I myself raised it repeatedly with Minister Kasuri when last I met him in Berlin on 31 March; but I have raised the issue on a number of other occasions as well.
The release of the men is indeed a very welcome development.
We can finally draw a line under this most unfortunate incident and leave remaining issues to be sorted out by the claimants and insurers.
However, I would be the last to say that democracy in Pakistan is in perfect condition.
The discussions on this agreement have very usefully highlighted the many areas of concern in our relations â concerns that are well reflected in the motion for a resolution currently before Parliament on the situation concerning human rights and democracy in Pakistan.
In this regard, the Commission would welcome any further guidance Parliament may want to offer, in particular in the crucial areas of democratisation and human rights.
I am obviously aware of reports that General Musharraf may still be in two minds as to whether to shed his army uniform by the end of the year.
In this connection, it is helpful that the Minister of Information has confirmed on the President's behalf that he would stand by his prior commitment.
Any other outcome would hardly bolster confidence in the constitutional process in Pakistan.
Pakistan needs to overcome the perception that real power lies with the President rather than the elected parliament and the civilian government.
I have, however, during my personal visits to Pakistan, always been encouraged by the resilience of civil society in that country, and I remain convinced that this is a strength which the country will be able to build on in the future.
I would like to associate myself with what the Minister Roche said about the recent conviction of Javed Hashmi, President of the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy.
I can assure Parliament that we will continue to monitor his case very closely and pursue it strongly in our dialogue with the Pakistani Government.
With regard to the overall human rights situation in Pakistan, there have been some positive developments, such as the adoption of a juvenile justice system order, but several serious concerns remain, including the blasphemy law, violence against women, the application of the death penalty and the incidence of child labour.
Pakistan is a focus country under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, and the Commission is actively trying to address some of these issues.
This summary shows that the problems and challenges in Pakistan are manifold, but there are also advances and positive developments.
It is the assessment of this balance that allows me to continue to believe that closer dialogue and cooperation within the structured format offered by the third-generation agreement will best enhance the European Union's capacity to help Pakistan deal with sensitive issues, including human rights, non-proliferation and counter-terrorism.
To sum up, then, I recognise the strength of views of some colleagues who would like to keep this agreement on ice.
I think myself that, on balance, we should move ahead with the agreement, and I hope that in doing so we will be able to continue to take an active interest in the development of human rights and democracy in a country which is important to all of us.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I can endorse what has been said in the previous speeches, for this is one of those cases in which one has to find a balance, in which one can describe the glass as half full or half empty, and in which, therefore, one may justifiably come to different conclusions without there being any reason to reproach anyone.
It is in fact my belief that what Mr Cushnahan has been telling the House for months, and what is expressed in his resolution, does amount to apposite points of criticism that must be addressed in dialogue with Pakistan.
There is no doubt about the fact that it does not present evidence of fully-fledged democracy, the rule of law, observance of human rights or of the rights of women in the sense in which one would expect on the basis of the United Nations Convention on Human Rights, which is, after all, universal.
For this reason, it is certainly right and necessary that this third-generation cooperation agreement should also be used in such a way that the Council, the Commission and Parliament can work together in monitoring its further progress.
Another possible model is that the Commission should regularly report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and to Parliament on progress in these fundamental issues of human coexistence, which is the proper way of moving the process along, a process also announced by the President of Pakistan.
On the other hand, we have to concede that progress may have been unsatisfactory, but there has been some.
In particular, though, it has to be clear to us that, in what is one of the greatest conflicts Western civilisation has seen, Pakistan is very definitely on the side of those who are fighting terrorism, and that, if there is to be cooperation rather than confrontation, Pakistanâs position in a conflict affecting Iraq and Afghanistan is of the utmost importance.
We are well aware that, in this Union of ours, mistakes have often been made, and misguided positions have been taken up.
We know that both the United States and Pakistan have taken up positions on the Taliban that we would today regard as ill-advised, but, even so, we have to realise that it would have been impossible to make progress, in the aftermath of 11 September, without the help of neighbours such as Afghanistan and other countries, of which Pakistan is one.
That is why I see ratification as necessary; we have to open up the way for the Council to take a decision and for the Commission to make use of its instruments accordingly, always, though, taking the positions expressed in the Cushnahan resolution as our starting point, so that there may be real development and progress in this area.
At the end of his speech, Commissioner Patten said that he was, on balance, in favour of recommending this agreement.
I think this âon balanceâ will have to be reconsidered, in the course of months and years, if the resolution that â I hope â we are about to adopt with a view to going forward, is to continue to be justified.
Let me once again invite the Council and the Commission to cooperate with Parliament in this joint project, this model project aimed at improving relations while at the same time causing human rights to prevail.
Â Â  . Mr President, my committee's opinion was that the cooperation agreement should be approved, subject to the enforcement of the human rights clause.
This would mean that we really do monitor respect for rights, such as freedom of speech and religion, and intervene when breaches occur.
The EU has not always exploited such possibilities to the full, and Parliament should push harder in future.
The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights is well aware of the imperfect state of democracy and human rights in Pakistan.
We are outraged at the discrimination and violence against women, at the continuation of the death penalty and at the persecution of minorities, especially religious and national ones.
The role of the army is unacceptable and the intelligence services are far too powerful.
However, this situation is more likely to improve if we are engaged in the dialogue that the agreement will create, and which will enable us to encourage the forces of progress and modernisation.
The Pakistani diaspora in Europe, which is especially numerous in the UK, can play a very important role in conveying the human rights message.
My impression is that they want this agreement concluded. They are right.
Â Â  . I wish I could share the optimism of the Council and the Commission that Pakistan is about to demonstrate its commitment to democracy and human rights.
I find it more likely that Pakistan would quote Article 1 of the agreement, where it says that respect for human rights and democratic principles underpins Pakistan's domestic policies and constitutes an essential element of the agreement.
In other words, we have now given legitimacy to the current behaviour of Pakistan.
The Committee on Development and Cooperation has therefore asked the Commission to make an evaluation of the human rights situation after one year.
I should like to ask Commissioner Patten if the Commission is prepared to do that and also, if the situation is not better after one year, to bear the consequences.
Â Â  In their decision to abandon the human rights and democracy clause in the Third Generation Agreement with Pakistan, regrettably the Council and the Commission are betraying those in Pakistan â especially those within civil society â who risk their personal safety on a daily basis to defend these principles.
This betrayal is taking place for a combination of unjustified geopolitical reasons and the 'thirty pieces of silver' in trading benefits that some Member States value so much.
I listened today to Minister Roche, Commissioner Patten and Baroness Ludford, who argued that there will be an enhanced human rights dialogue.
Ask those who are persecuted and incarcerated in China, North Korea and Uzbekistan, where there is already a supposedly enhanced human rights dialogue whether it has helped them.
Let me remind you that, in the case of Uzbekistan, this Parliament was pressurised into ratifying a similar agreement in 1999 and, since then, the human rights situation has deteriorated further.
The real reason why we are being asked to approve the accord is because of pressure from the US and the UK as a consequence of the current mess in Iraq resulting from a war that should never have been fought without UN approval.
Does anyone think that it will help the situation in Iraq by abandoning the democratic and human rights of the people of Pakistan?
Instead we will be feeding the arrogance of the President of a unipolar power and a subservient UK prime minister and supporting their mistake, which is currently being repeated in the Middle East with likely disastrous consequences!
I must ask my colleagues in the European Parliament, are we to be the puppets of the Council and the Commission or will we be the democratic voice of the people of Europe, defending freedom and human rights and giving hope to the oppressed people of the world?
If we ratify this agreement we abandon this role in favour of conferring political legitimacy on a quasi-military regime which continues to abuse democracy and human rights and allows nuclear secrets to be sold to rogue states.
I ask Members of this Parliament, where do you stand on this issue?
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I have the highest possible regard for Mr Cushnahanâs dedication, and there are many in my own group who argue as he does.
I, too, am very sympathetic towards them, but I do think that we, who perhaps represent another outlook, are not led or guided either by the Council or by the Commission, by the USA or the United Kingdom.
Seldom indeed do we find them all taking the same line.
This is indeed what the Commissioner and the President-in-Office have said it is; not a choice between black and white, but rather between differing shades of grey.
The fact is that Pakistan is â as it ought to be â an important partner in the development of the region as a whole.
As I see it, there has, over the past few months, been some progress in Pakistanâs attitude to Afghanistan and to the Taliban situation, as well as in relation to Kashmir, democracy and human rights.
I am happy, though, to agree with Mr Cushnahan and all those who say that this is far from enough, and that much more has to be done to get Pakistan out of its isolation and moving towards more democracy and human rights.
I also agree with all those who say that an agreement of this kind must serve as a basis for more intensive dialogue with Pakistan â and with countries like it â in order to spur them on to make further progress.
I can tell Mr Cushnahan that I understand not in the least why it is that, having had most recently discussions even with Israel on this, we should not perhaps, here and there, insist on withdrawing from similar agreements if the undertakings given are not met.
I am therefore entirely of the opinion that, having considered all the pros and cons â and I agree with you that there are a lot of the latter â there is, I think, an argument in favour of recommending this agreement by way of the resolution that Mr Brok has described so very well and that you too have signed.
I would be the first to speak up on behalf of my group and demand our withdrawal from this agreement if the progress that has been begun were not to be continued and completed.
This leads me to believe that the arguments put forward in this debate do indeed hold water, and my group will recommend acceptance of the agreement.
I do, however, respect all those who take a different line and whose consciences lead them to vote another way, for the human rights situation is as unsatisfactory as ever and in need of radical improvement.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance agrees in the main with MrÂ Cushnahan.
Naturally, a balance has been struck, as MrÂ Brok said.
Positive things too are happening in Pakistan, especially the peace talks with India, which are incredibly important and which should have our total support.
Is it not a little odd that, whenever we strike balances like this, the commercial, trade-policy aspects almost always end up counting for more than the very clear human rights principles we have written into our agreements?
What are we playing at, having human rights clauses in agreements with other countries if we always strike balances that end up with our not bothering about the human rights clauses but allowing other, mainly economic, interests to count for more?
This leads to our undermining respect for our own high principles.
It is that balance that makes us in the Greens/ALE Group think it obvious that we must say no to this agreement now.
We hope that Pakistan will understand this signal and take measures that mean we can quite soon say yes instead of no.
I should like to have said yes, but that is unfortunately impossible if we are to hold to our human rights principles.
Â Â  Mr President, I had the honour to be a part of the delegation to Pakistan's visit to the Pakistani side of the line of control in Kashmir in December.
We had the opportunity during that delegation meeting to meet with President Musharraf, and I was much impressed by his commitment to pursuing a programme of peace and reconciliation with India.
It looks, for the first time, as though both sides are prepared to think the previously unthinkable and find a resolution, driven by the economic impact on their two economies of a continuing conflict; a conflict that has dogged the world for the last 50 years.
Nevertheless, there are still enormous problems in Pakistan regarding human rights, democracy and nuclear proliferation.
Colleagues have told us about the treatment of Christian and Ahmadi religious minorities, the situation of women, the deeply flawed election result that Mr Cushnahan oversaw, and the jailing of members of the opposition like Javed Hashmi.
I would therefore concur with my colleagues on those concerns.
Last year Mr Tannock and I added to our resolution on North Korea the fact that Pakistan had supplied blueprints for a highly enriched uranium technology programme to North Korea for the production of nuclear weapons.
At the time, we were roundly attacked by the Pakistani Government and when I raised the issue with Foreign Minister Kasuri during the December meeting I was told that the North Koreans needed no help â they were well advanced with nuclear weapon technology, including miniaturisation.
Whether or not they needed help, it is now clear that it was provided.
Now new questions are arising about the nuclear test of 30 May 1998 in Baluchistan, which looks as if it could have been a joint test of a plutonium weapon between Pakistan and North Korea.
When I raised the issue with the Pakistani Ambassador, who came to see me this week, he said that they were cooperating with the United States.
That is not good enough: we in the European Union want cooperation and to be kept in the loop as well.
However, despite that, I will support this third-generation cooperation agreement.
We will be paying close attention to further progress on human rights in Pakistan.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, although I do think that what MrÂ Cushnahan said is of course highly credible, the point at issue is not whether we feel like puppets â which I do not believe that we are â and nor is it a case of us giving priority to commercial considerations, as Mr Gahrton said.
Something quite different is at stake.
It is what Commissioner Patten was talking about in relation to the Middle East this morning; it is about avoiding a clash of civilisations.
It is about how, by working towards intercultural dialogue, we Europeans are performing what is a primary task for our own age and for our world.
Whatever the reservations expressed in this debate, Pakistan very definitely has a positive role to play in this.
The question at issue is: who is our partner?
North Korea is not one, but Pakistan is a partner in the fight against international terrorism, and the coalition ranged against that is of course much greater than the coalition of states at present in Iraq fighting terrorism there and fighting against the regime.
The coalition combating international terrorism includes Germany, France, Russia and others.
Pakistan is among them.
It is for that reason that I believe that the conclusion of the Third Generation Agreement is a matter of the utmost urgency.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, democracies do have weapons, but when they give up using them, they lose their souls.
The way they have dealt with the status of women in Afghanistan should serve as a lesson.
Today, we are dealing with an agreement between the European Union and Pakistan which has no direct financial impact, since the European Community signed a technical cooperation agreement worth EUR 5 million with Pakistan in February.
The main thrust of the agreement put to us is therefore political.
We are all aware of Pakistanâs geostrategic role, bordering as it does on Afghanistan and India.
We are all aware of the contribution it has made to the anti-terrorist coalition initiated by the Americans following the events of 11Â September 2001.
None of this, however, can justify our support for a country where the present authorities came to power by means of a military coup and where the most recent elections were held in circumstances condemned by our observers and resulted in the installation of a coalition of supporters of President Musharraf and Islamist fundamentalist religious parties not afraid to express their support for Bin Laden.
President Musharraf has just adopted an amendment increasing the powers of the armed forces.
The leader of the opposition, Benazir Bhutto, is still in exile and her husband has been in prison for five years.
We do not underestimate the signs of produced under American pressure in relations with Kashmir, but we feel that nothing practical has yet been achieved.
We, as European democrats, cannot continue to bemoan the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma and go along with such an agreement without some soul-searching.
For all these reasons, I beg you, on behalf of the French socialist delegation, to refer this agreement back to committee.
Â Â  Mr President, for three years the Parliament has blocked the association agreement with Pakistan to encourage that country's return to democracy and the observance of human rights.
If we want to maintain that encouragement and not reject the genuine progress made, now is the time to give our support to ratification.
I do not deny that profound concerns remain in relation to freedom of expression, religious discrimination, and the treatment of women.
This Parliament cannot and will not justify any abuse of human rights in the name of the war against terror.
I respect the sincerity of Mr Cushnahan in particular, although I regret that he has chosen to make a personal attack on the British Prime Minister this afternoon.
However, I reach a different conclusion that does not deny that the 17th Constitutional Amendment represents a return to democracy; that President Musharraf is supporting the bill on the Hudood Ordinances and action against so-called honour killings; that Mr Hashmi was tried in an independent court, he will appeal and that the appeal to the higher court against exile by his own party leader was recently successful.
We cannot deny that nuclear proliferation is being exposed and stopped, that the Greek seamen have been returned to their own country or that the President has once again confirmed that he will cease to be the chief of the army.
I want the human rights clause to be a more effective part of our association agreements, but I also want that in relation to the agreements which exist today, with Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Israel.
A 'no' vote against Pakistan would risk this Parliament being accused of double standards.
When Pakistan, with India, has had the courage and vision to resume talks which lead the subcontinent from the brink of war, a signal of positive encouragement from Europe is the only just and fitting response.
Â Â  Mr President, in the past I have been a long-standing critic of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in terms of its human rights violations, in particular the ongoing persecution of Christian and Ahmadi Muslim minorities; its ambivalent and lukewarm cooperation in the fight against Islamist terrorism, which has led to the destabilisation of Afghanistan by aiding Taliban forces to regroup; ongoing Jihad infiltration across the line of control into Indian Kashmir; and â as Mr Ford said â most importantly of all, the Pakistani export of nuclear technology to rogue states such as North Korea and former terrorist-supporting Iran and Libya, which threaten global security.
Nevertheless I support the trade agreement, as I have to recognise that Pakistan has recently made some encouraging moves in human rights, including women's rights, which deserve recognition and reward.
Also, as a friend of India, historically Pakistan's giant neighbour and foe, I take great heart at the peaceful rapprochement as evidenced by several confidence-building measures, most visibly and recently the successful cricket tour.
Only three years ago the two states teetered on the verge of nuclear war.
India is today in the midst of general elections as a beacon for democracy and prosperity.
Its growth rate is now higher than China's and it does not want to see Pakistan suffer economically.
The recent campaign in Waziristan shows Islamabad's intent to prosecute a war against al-Qa'ida strongholds in tribal areas, historically no-go areas for the government of President Musharraf, who has now pressured tribal leaders to hunt down Islamist militants.
Maybe human rights clauses should not be in trade agreements, as this muddies the waters, but should instead be conditional on aid received.
Otherwise, does the EU stop trading with Russia, China, Uzbekistan or Iran, to name a few examples of countries with human rights problems?
Clearly that is a matter for another debate, but for the meantime we must support this accord.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for their comments.
A stable and democratic Pakistan would be a benign influence in the region, especially in the context of neighbouring Afghanistan.
There are benefits to what is proposed.
I fully understand the passion that has been injected into this debate by Mr Cushnahan but I do not understand the choice of language.
It is not a good strategy to portray those who disagree with you as selling out or as being puppets.
Perhaps when he has the opportunity he might like to reconsider those words.
You can have principled positions and you can also have pragmatism; they do not rule each other out.
Nonetheless, I too compliment Mr Cushnahan on the work that he has done and I compliment also Mr Brok, as chairman, on his work and that of his committee.
The conclusion of the agreement would help the European Union to better engage with Pakistan on the very issues that Mr Cushnahan touches upon, the issues on which we want to have changes.
Perhaps the last speaker is right when he suggests that human rights issues and issues relating to democracy should be completely excluded from trade agreements, perhaps not.
A number of other contributors made points with which I can certainly agree.
