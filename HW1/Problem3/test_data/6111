on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this is, of course, unfinished business from the Services Directive, and, although I agree with much of the Commissioner's analysis, we do have a problem.
We have a problem of confidence.
It is a bit like the Northern Rock bank in the UK over the past few weeks.
Whatever it said, the customers were still queuing outside, wanting their money back.
It is a bit like that with us and cross-border services.
Whatever we say, consumers still are not confident enough to use those services.
We have to find a way of addressing that.
Those in this House that sat on the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society also saw only too clearly that there is this problem of confidence.
But we will not be able to address that by going back to old proposals that dealt with problems perceived some 20 years ago.
We have got to deal with the problems and situation that we have now.
What we are basically dealing with, in looking at service providers' obligations, is looking at basic contract law and basic contractual obligations.
In this regard, we currently have on the table Rome I, which Ms Kauppi has referred to; if we get that right, it will help.
We also have the whole review of the consumer acquis; if we get that right, it will help.
We have the preparation of the Common Frame of Reference on contract law; if we use that, and if the Commission puts a great deal more effort into getting the Member States to take it up, that would also help.
So there is much that can already be used to help us get right the relationship between private international law and regulation.
What we do not need - I agree with Mr Harbour - is the Commission writing soft law codes of conduct.
Let us use what is already being done at the moment and what is in preparation.
We can keep a weather eye on whether or not we need yet another horizontal instrument, but, at this stage, I really doubt it.
What we also need to address is the possibility of giving our consumers the right to cross-border access to justice where they can act together as a group.
This would be a balancing of arms against providers.
It would make good the current lack of cross-border access to justice, which we saw all too clearly with Equitable Life.
People do not like to use the words 'class actions', and neither do I, but a European right of collective redress might help give us the confidence for consumers that is currently lacking on this continent.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the development of the Union's internal market is very significant in terms of forging links between the countries and citizens of the Union.
Increasing cross-border exchange of services on a competitive basis requires an increase in mutual trust, which should be supported by a consumer-friendly policy.
This policy aims to improve the legal framework for cross-border services whilst also simplifying procedures, which will increase competition.
It will also improve access to services and raise their standard whilst reducing costs, thus benefiting European consumers.
The report contributes to improving this policy by indicating a range of issues impeding the dynamic development of the market.
These include the lack of a single system regulating the obligations of cross-border service providers and the need to supplement Union documents in this regard.
The report also highlights the lack of clarity in implementing provisions resulting in mental barriers concerning foreign suppliers, the poorer legal protection for service users than for service providers, the failure to regulate public and private services under the same provisions, the diversity of provisions concerning the obligations of cross-border service providers, and the lack of the necessary transparency for the protection of these services.
Consideration should be given to the introduction of quality certificates for service providers in order to improve the recipients' confidence.
The conclusions and proposals emerging from the report coincide with the findings of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
I would like to thank the rapporteur for a business-like report.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, although sadly I have not yet had the pleasure of reading one of his books.
However, I have made a note of it and will make good the omission at the next opportunity.
Many thanks for the good cooperation, and many thanks, too, for your efforts to address important issues in your report.
Admittedly, legal frameworks are already in place for services in the internal market, such as the Services Directive or the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications, but the implementation of these Directives - both of them - sadly still leaves a lot to be desired.
I therefore think it is regrettable that the Council is not present this evening, as we could have made it clear once again that we expect both Directives to be implemented by the deadline and the work in the Member States to be pursued accordingly.
However, we also need more initiatives - as the rapporteur has rightly pointed out - to increase consumer confidence in cross-border services in the internal market.
Here, too, previous reports have addressed important issues.
In her report, Mrs RoithovÃ¡ has pointed out that there are still very many deficits in relation to Internet sales in particular, and that consumers still lack the requisite confidence in cross-border services here.
Similarly, Mr Lehtinen, in his report, draws attention to the obligations of service providers and to the issue of legal protection for consumers.
I would like to come back to a topic which has already been mentioned by two previous speakers today, namely the right of collective redress in cross-border cases.
We urgently need initiatives in this direction, so that consumers have confidence in cross-border services, and that can only be achieved by strengthening their legal position.
In my view, both reports - the RoithovÃ¡ report and the Lehtinen report - give important indications of the deficits that still exist.
The Commission should take both these reports seriously in its work to genuinely overhaul, modernise and update the consumer acquis.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Mr President, we have adopted a Services Directive through which we have handed over to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg the power to decide what we have decided!
We do not yet know if the Member States' agreements are to be respected.
We do not know the extent to which the establishment of national quality requirements will be permitted.
We do not know whether it is lawful for the Member States to decide which services they would like to have under private or public control.
The report is therefore just as unclear as the legal situation.
We are waiting to hear from the judges in Luxembourg whether we can retain our hospitals and a long list of other core services that together constitute our welfare state.
In Denmark all citizens have social rights, which we finance through high taxes that only 7% of Danes would like to see reduced.
It would seem that this 7% will be rewarded by the judges in Luxembourg, but what about the majority?
Who will safeguard the decisions and our democracy?
We also have a flexicurity system, which is based upon voluntary agreements between parties within the labour market.
How can they be protected?
It is the nerve centre of the Danish social model that is being threatened by the uncertainties and judicial activism of the Services Directive.
The June Movement would very much like to contribute towards the creation of clear rules for a common market for all services that are suitable for the market, but we do not want to prevent the Member States from also having a democracy to set limits on what should be decided by the electorate and what should be decided by the capitalists.
on behalf of the ITS group. - (RO) Mr. President, the free movement of services is, as we know, one of the four fundamental freedoms decisively determining the functionality and efficiency of the single market, an important element of the first pillar at the basis of the European Union construction.
This is one of the reasons why I believe that an analysis of the progress in achieving this single market instrument is both important and necessary.
It is important because the consistent economic and social development of the European Union equally depends on the area of services, the 70% weight of services in the Union's GDP being significant in this regard.
It is necessary because the volume of cross-border trade in services is very low as compared to the trade in goods, a situation that also generates the lack of confidence of European Union citizens in the consumption of such products.
Based upon these arguments, I support and I will vote for the approval of the report.
Nevertheless, I consider that, in relation to the pertinent and, at the same time, valuable solutions proposed by the Rapporteur, a more substantial analysis would have been required regarding the situation of some newly acceded countries, such as Romania, whose markets are far less developed than those of most of the other Member States of the Union.
From this perspective, I believe that the report should also have contained a set of objectives for leveling the degrees of national markets development, a condition required for the development of the single market and, consequently, of the segment of border services.
(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would of course like to thank the rapporteur as well.
The discussions in advance of this report were always very fruitful and interesting.
Much of what came out of these discussions has been incorporated into the report, although not everything, which is unfortunate, at least from my point of view, as the report emphasises in some places that the completion of the internal market for services in the European Union is trailing far behind the internal market for goods.
From my perspective, there is actually no real scientific or indeed objective evidence of that, given that we have not only the Services Directive but also the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as well as other Directives in the services sector.
Secondly, the services sector in the internal market is far more heterogeneous than goods.
It ranges from subordinate services to medical or legal services and finally large-scale services such as major banking and insurance services.
Lumping all these services together, which is what repeatedly happens in this House, is risky, in my view.
I believe - and a number of previous speakers have already pointed this out - that a differentiated approach would certainly be useful.
The third point which has been raised repeatedly, namely collective redress, is unlikely to become more relevant simply by being the frequent subject of discussion.
I think what we can say, clearly and unequivocally, is that Parliament expects the Commission to undertake a study to review which of the diverse models that already exist in Europe would genuinely be best for the European Union.
I think that is all that needs to be said on this subject.
The liability systems in the individual Member States - and this is my fourth point - are still highly diverse.
That is why we need a unified system of obligations for service providers.
Clarifying the legal system governing these obligations will generate more competition and create more choice for the consumer, but I believe - as some of the previous speakers have said - that it would be wrong to ask the Commission to produce a horizontal instrument at this stage.
In any case, I am very sceptical about the creation of this type of liability law at European level.
(PL) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which highlights many problems consumers encounter on the internal market.
This report rightly draws attention to the lack of legal clarity and certainty regarding safety and the quality of services.
It also refers to the general lack of confidence in cross-border consumption felt by European consumers.
This is confirmed by the statistics.
In 2006 only 6% of European consumers made cross-border purchases over the Internet.
This situation has a negative impact on competition and on the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.
It also contributes to the expansion of illegal trade.
Dishonest entities often exploit the differences between the legal systems within the European Union to defraud people.
Swift action is called for once such situations have been identified, hence our response.
I would like to remind the House of the many months of work devoted to the Services Directive, that is to say, to a review of consumer legislation.
As Members will be aware, the Services Directive must be implemented in all Member States by December 2009.
A substantial proportion of the problems referred to by the rapporteur will certainly cease to exist after the transposition period.
It should be borne in mind that the Services Directive will significantly improve consumers' rights.
Thanks to this Directive, service providers will have to offer consumers better information regarding the services proposed.
This will enable consumers to make better and more informed choices.
Consumers will also be more effectively protected by the relevant institutions.
The Services Directive also imposes a series of clear obligations on the service provider, including ones related to conflict resolution.
I believe there is no need to introduce further legal instruments until the provisions of the Services Directive enter into force.
In my view, it is premature to call on the Commission to present a horizontal instrument.
The same applies to the entire review of consumer legislation.
The Commission has already presented a Green Paper on consumer legislation and will in due course present legislative proposals in that regard.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are times when more legislation does not mean better legislation.
We would do well to keep that in mind.
(SK) The Service Directive, which is to be transposed into national law in all the Member States by 28 December 2009, will have a significant effect on cross-border services.
This Directive and even the Green Paper on the Review of the Consumer Acquis do not lay down the fundamental obligations of service providers and therefore I welcome the report by Mr Lehtinen on this issue.
The report seeks to ensure that not only consumers but also small and medium-sized businesses buying and selling cross-border services can benefit from additional legal certainty, simplicity and reduced costs.
I believe that European standardisation is key to the success of craft, small and medium-sized enterprises and the introduction of European standards at European Union level is thus a means of supporting the safety of services and guaranteeing consumer rights with regard to cross-border services provided by Member States.
Where consumers feel uncertain about the safety and quality of services, they tend to build up psychological barriers towards foreign suppliers, which dissuade them from using cross-border services.
If a consumer has a negative experience, that experience will often wrongly have repercussions on all foreign service providers.
Consumers have an opportunity to resolve problems arising predominantly as a result of the different procedures in force in the individual Member States within the European Consumer Centres Network, ECC-Net, and the cross-border Consumer Complaints Network for Financial Services, FIN-NET.
Where a consumer has enough information about his internal market rights but attempts to exercise them in vain in another EU Member State, he can seek help from SOLVIT.
Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that this report focuses primarily on consumers since they, in particular, are a fundamental and important element of the internal market.
Our common objective must therefore be to create the conditions for consumers that allow them to have the same confidence when making a purchase in another country as they have when doing so at home.
(CS) Mr President, although the EC Treaty guarantees its citizens free access to services beyond their national borders, only a handful of service providers and consumers make use of this advantage of the common market.
A low level of competition thus makes services in the border regions more expensive and not always easily accessible, compared with services within a country.
Surveys show that the problem lies not in language barriers but in legislation.
It is not always clear when to apply the legislation of the country of origin and when to apply national legislation.
Unfortunately, thanks to the opponents of the country of origin principle, we lost out on the opportunity to provide a better definition in the Services Directive.
Here in Strasbourg this report is also accompanied by an irrational fear of mentioning the country of origin principle, notwithstanding the fact that in many professions service providers do not have to know the neighbouring country's legislation in order to provide cross-border services.
Soon we will see case-law that will end the disputes about when the issue of consumer protection is governed by national legislation or the legislation of the host country.
I consider Mr Lehtinen's report to be an excellent contribution in this respect because, in my opinion, our definition of providers' general obligations should be based on agreed European standards.
I agree that when it comes to consumer protection, the same obligations should apply to the providers of private and public services.
I also support the financing of communication networks between Member States.
This will lead to effective control and to progress in solving disputes out of court.
Commissioner, we owe the European citizens a lot when it comes to the conditions governing the free movement of cross-border services.
This report settles one part of this debt.
The European Parliament gives the Commission the political support to clearly define providers' obligations regardless of their origin.
Mr Lehtinen's report is testament to the excellent work of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I have been listening very carefully to the discussion on Parliament's report on the obligations of cross-border service providers.
I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments.
Now allow me to stress a few key points.
First, the Commission supports the aim of the report on which Parliament will vote tomorrow.
We are indeed concerned with the lack of consumer confidence in the internal market for services.
Let me stress that, as Commissioner for the Information Society, this lack of confidence in internet business is very important indeed and we will have to have a look at that.
Second, as I mentioned earlier, the Commission has already undertaken a number of initiatives which aim to remedy the current situation.
I have quoted the Services Directive and the review of the consumer acquis.
The latter, by the way, is one of the key priorities of my colleague Commissioner Kuneva.
I would like to say that we are very grateful for the support of Parliament and we would like to encourage Parliament to continue to contribute to the review process, and we would like, together with Parliament, to be able to deliver results as soon as possible.
What are we going to propose in a concrete way for the coming weeks and months?
First a summary of the responses to the consultation will be published on the Commission's website at the beginning of October.
Then there will be an impact assessment carried out with a view to a possible Commission proposal in the second half of 2008.
The Members having had a look at this problem carefully will certainly be interested in this.
Third, the Commission agrees on the need to promote the safety aspects of services because it is very important to better ensure the health and the physical safety aspects of services provided within the internal market.
With the Member States, we will draw attention to possible shortcomings in national systems, or necessary enforcement of the assessment.
We will promote consumer education and awareness-raising initiatives.
We will facilitate access to existing information on accidents and injuries related to the safety of services offered to consumers, and one of the very important elements which has been stressed by several Members relates to collective redress.
The Commission is carrying out studies and concerting stakeholders in order to assess the opportunity of an initiative in this area but one thing is certain, and I would like to underline it - this will not be a US-type class action.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and Parliament for the importance it attaches to this issue.
We are sure the parliamentary report will be instrumental for our future work in the interests of the consumers.
Thank you very much indeed, Commissioner, for an interesting debate, in which more than 50% of the speakers were women, which is just as it should be.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (PL)
I should like to thank Mr Lehtinen for a well-prepared report.
The freedom to provide services is one of the four fundamental freedoms of the internal market.
Over the years, the services sector has become increasingly important for the economic and social development of the European Union and has undergone substantial change.
Despite the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the ongoing process of transposition of the Services Directive into national law, in practice the free movement of services continues to be hampered by administrative provisions and differences between the legal systems of Member States.
Bearing in mind the threats and challenges stemming from globalisation, together with the shortcomings in the services sector identified in the report, it is particularly important to take action aimed at eliminating obstacles to the supply of cross-border services.
Lack of confidence on the part of consumers and the reluctance of companies to operate outside their home country limit access to the internal market.
As a matter of urgency, the Community should introduce mechanisms making it easier for companies, especially SMEs, to benefit from the internal market.
Community provisions on the supply of cross-border services should therefore be rationalised, and a minimum period for the harmonisation of quality standards introduced, so as to protect users' interests.
Strengthening cooperation between Member States, limiting administrative procedures and appropriate control of cross-border services will promote an increase of cross-border activity.
Harmonisation of quality standards will strengthen consumer and supplier confidence in cross-border services.
Facilitating the provision of cross-border services will lead to a properly functioning single market for services, thus laying the foundations for an economically cohesive internal market.
i2010: Digital libraries (debate)
The next item is the report by Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Descamps, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on i2010: Digital libraries.
Once again, more than 50 per cent of the speakers in this debate are women, the first of which is Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Descamps, the rapporteur.
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of a European digital library originated from six EU Heads of State and Government who wanted to allow universal access to the European cultural heritage and to preserve it for future generations.
This federal project for Europe will strengthen the expression of a true European identity and help spread our cultural and linguistic diversity across the world.
The project, which is without precedent for Europe, combines the past with the present and links the cultural with the digital dimension.
It is the perfect response to the various issues now affecting our fellow citizens in the form of new information and communication technologies.
The Internet, which is the third favourite medium of Europe's young people, is in effect one of the main means of access to knowledge and learning.
While some real progress has been made, the digitisation of our cultural resources and their bringing online nevertheless remains very fragmented and relies on the various mechanisms that have been put in place by the Member States.
If they are to be effective and reach the greatest number of people the initiatives for promoting and disseminating our cultural heritage need to be well coordinated.
This is the intended objective of the European digital library, which the Commission is supporting through its beacon initiative 'i2010 digital libraries'.
The first part of this initiative, namely the communication of 30 September 2005, was based on three main aspects: digitisation, online access and preservation of digital content.
The Commission has set out to analyse the main technical, legal, organisational and financial challenges that a project of this scale would pose.
At the same time, an online public consultation has been launched and a high-level expert group has been set up.
On the basis of these different elements the Commission adopted a recommendation on digitisation, online access and digital preservation on 24 August 2006, in which it calls on the Member States to accelerate the pace of digitisation and to coordinate their efforts in order to achieve real synergy.
On 13 November 2006 the Council adopted these recommendations unanimously.
It is now up to the European Parliament to send a strong signal so that this exceptional project can become a reality.
This undertaking is such that we need to proceed in stages.
While working on the conceptual and technical organisation of all categories of cultural material, we therefore have to concentrate initially on the potential provided by the out-of-copyright text material held in libraries and to do this via a single, direct and multilingual access point.
Our libraries offer the advantage of already being coordinated at European level through the TEL, the European library that was set up in 2005 by the national libraries, which holds a large stock of digital works that are in the public domain and therefore can be used immediately.
As a second stage, and in order to promote the success of this tool, the library must also provide access to works of a more contemporary nature in addition to those documents that are in the public domain.
Any decision in this area will inevitably have to be taken in consultation with all the parties involved.
Indeed, the protection of copyright and other creative rights is vital for maintaining and protecting creativity in Europe.
If this project is to achieve the success that is expected it will have to be based on a coherent economic model.
The report therefore proposes, with the agreement of the copyright holders, that in the European digital library users should be able to browse the Internet to find any kind of digital documents, whatever their status, and to consult works in the public domain freely and in their entirety, whereas only short extracts would be accessible for copyright works.
Beyond that, users wishing to scan through a certain work or access a protected document in its entirety would be directed to private sites specialising in secure digital dissemination, where a number of options would be open to them in return for payment of a fair remuneration to the copyright holders.
Moreover, such a library needs to be organised so that it can provide access to content that is reliable and of a quality that is intended for all ages.
To this effect the report calls for a steering committee to be set up in which the cultural institutions would play a major role.
This committee would determine the priorities for, and the guidelines of, the European digital library, while ensuring the coordination, management and monitoring of its activities.
Finally, in order to provide access to all European cultures, the other cultural institutions and sectors, including archives, museums, cinema, audiovisual arts and universities, have to be involved at each stage of the project.
In this way we will shape the face of a Europe that is unified in diversity.
I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues in the Committee on Culture and Education, especially Mr Weber and Mr GraÃ§a Moura, for their support and contribution to this report.
I also wish to thank the Commission for having cooperated so effectively throughout the preparation of this document.
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is a great report and Ms Descamps has done excellent work, together with her colleagues in the Committee.
The digital libraries initiative is an example of how Europe can contribute, through concrete projects, not only to economic growth but also to quality of life.
By bringing Europe's cultural and scientific heritage online, we can disseminate it through into different cultures.
By using modern technologies, we can break down the walls which exist today.
I am very happy that this initiative, taken by the national libraries of our Member States and developed by the European Commission for so many years, has been highlighted and supported by EU political forces at the highest level.
They are right to do so; our Heads of State and Government are right to support this initiative, because there is real wealth in our libraries, our archives and our museums.
It is not only books, but also newspapers, archive records and films.
This is a multilingual wealth, a multicultural wealth.
Knowing that less than 1% of this wealth is digitalised, we know what is in front of us and what kind of work we have to do.
That work is necessary for two reasons. The first is to overcome barriers and to get people to study, work and enjoy these works from their own culture and works from our common European history, and then to allow these elements of our cultural institutions to be reused for added-value services and products.
That is where industry comes in.
That is the reason why the goal of the Commission's initiative is to achieve a common, multilingual access point to Europe's digitalised cultural heritage.
We cannot do this alone.
It requires collaboration between different types of cultural institutions, from all European countries.
I am very glad to see that this is taking shape and is being formalised through the creation of a legal body that will increase the capacity of the European digital library to act.
This common access point will be launched in 2008.
In the years thereafter the content will be gradually expanded as more libraries, more archives and more audiovisual archives and museums contribute their digitalised collections.
I am very glad, also, that the report by Parliament tackles not only the outcome but also the prerequisites for achieving that outcome.
This means improving the general conditions for getting our cultural heritage online as an integral part of the digital libraries initiatives, and the need for Member States to intensify their digitalisation efforts.
I would say very clearly that it is not enough to have a big cultural event where all the Heads of Government make beautiful speeches and then go back to their countries and cut budgets.
That cannot be!
We need words to be followed by deeds.
I want Parliament to move ahead and help us make this very beautiful project a reality.
We have the high level group on digital libraries, which I chair and which is forging ahead on this matter.
We are also very conscious that the preservation of digital material will be one of the essential questions of the future, and I am therefore glad that the Council has endorsed the Commission approach to the European digital library and that Parliament is now helping us move in the same direction and is putting its political weight behind this objective.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, I must warmly congratulate Mrs Descamps on her brilliant report.
It is a document that will make an extremely important contribution to the issue of the relationship between digital technology and cultural heritage.
It calls for a coordination of efforts between national institutions, particularly libraries, and in the future, other cultural institutions.
It starts in a practical manner with works that are already in the public domain.
It proposes the effective use of synergies and the exchange of good practices between those involved in the process at all levels.
It calls on Member States to promote the project and to find ways of avoiding duplication of efforts in digitising holdings.
It calls for coordination of all these efforts.
The Descamps report will be a highlight of this legislature in terms of the relationship between cutting-edge technology and European culture through the ages.
When we talk about European culture, we are also talking about universal culture.
This is not only because European cultural heritage deserves this qualification, but also because the intrinsic cultural diversity of Europe forms a completely open system which will of course have positive consequences as the project advances.
It is also a project that has evolved.
It started as a 'chauvinistic' fallacy in competition with Google, but has been reformulated, following various changes, in more sensible, realistic and productive terms.
It is no longer what the Financial Times previously called 'a blatant case of misguided and unnecessary nationalism'.
The European digital library is different from other solutions because it is a European Union project, because it aims to reach out to all libraries, because it is intended to be based on existing initiatives and because it aims to cover all categories of European cultural heritage, without being confined to printed material.
There are certainly still a number of problems: finding funding partners in the private sector; avoiding, as far as possible, different rates of digitisation between Member States; solving certain technical aspects relating to the coordination of access to digitised works; preserving digitised content; resolving the issue of the integrated search engine for meta-information in image documents and for direct searching of text documents; finding content interoperability solutions, and enabling multilingual searching by subject or keyword in addition to the current situation of searching by author or title.
We also cannot forget that the exchange of experiences between institutions will be essential, particularly with American institutions, and also that a strong research and development component will be crucial to the project producing good results.
In this context, by voting in favour of the Descamps report, this Chamber will take a positive step towards the future, whether the majority is made up of women or whether it reasonably consists of a percentage of women and another percentage of men, Mr President.
Ah, but the women are very happy you are a man!
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, 2010 is just round the corner.
Given that the title of the report is 'i2010: towards a European digital library', that means that we still have a great deal of work to do and in my view, we have been dragging our feet.
I am pleased that Mrs Descamps has presented a very good report, which points the way forward and shows us what can and could be done.
However, we must all make efforts to get things moving.
The report is a challenge and a response to the new technologies, the new management of knowledge and information, and above all, young people's access to learning, information and knowledge.
We have a lot of catching up to do here and, as far as I am concerned, we really have to speed things up.
It is not only about preserving and safeguarding cultural heritage.
Every day, new things arise that we must add to the equation, for things that were invented and written down only yesterday will be our cultural heritage tomorrow.
That means that we have a great deal of ground to make up.
However, we must always look ahead at the same time, to be able to keep pace with developments.
It will be very important to coordinate the process and urge countries - as has just been said - to put national sensitivities behind them and to move forward together along a European path to safeguard cultural diversity.
There are hurdles to overcome.
The first is the financial shortfall that we face.
The Commissioner was right to talk about this.
All the ministers and presidents are very good at giving big speeches and are proud of our cultural diversity, but when it comes to funding and implementation, they quickly pull back and forget all about the pride that they have been propounding.
From my perspective, it is also very important to safeguard copyright, so there needs to be an agreement with the authors and publishers and everyone else involved, so that for an appropriate fee the information can be put on the Internet for people to access.
I think that we have a lot to think about here.
It is certainly no easy task, but the proposals are on the table and the countries could gain a lot.
I am convinced that we can achieve a positive vote on this report tomorrow.
In my view, we must use the new technologies and support this project in order not only to facilitate access for us as Europeans but also to carry our culture far out into the world.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, as has been stated in the Commission's initial document, a European digital library would be based on Europe's rich heritage combining multicultural and multilingual environments with technological advances and new business models.
In the context of integration, this is a fine and welcome objective, an ambitious goal.
However, besides reaching these ideal objectives we have to remain realistic and stay very attentive, prepared to meet the challenges that are inevitable during this process.
The main problems related to the creation of digital libraries are universal, though they are described in different ways.
Technical infrastructure, the creation of digitised resources, digitisation, the identification of copyright, content preservation and the preservation of documents are issues requiring developmental and essential decisions.
The potential to provide virtual services and projects for their implementation are relevant for libraries of all types.
However, it is obvious that digital materials, such as textual, visual and audio information, extend the traditional functions of libraries by adding different content.
For example, access to information stored in a traditional library is determined by its working times which are usually longer than those of other public institutions.
If a library is virtual its access is universal, because there is no physical door isolating information from its users.
Access to information is ensured by the working periods of the server.
Librarians can use traditional skills and knowledge to design virtual services, but these are not sufficient.
Digital libraries are a phenomenon of the third millennium and it is therefore necessary to evaluate not only the specific knowledge essential today, but also that which will be necessary in the future, as technologies change.
It is not so important to have a perfect knowledge of certain technologies, because any flexible and mature employee can attain the skills and experience necessary for his or her job.
In my country, Lithuania, the long-term preservation of Lithuanian heritage through the use of information technologies has been determined by the adoption of legal acts.
However, this problem is not being solved by coordinating the activities of the 'memory institutions' (libraries, museums, archives).
Neither the citizens of Lithuania nor those of other countries are yet able to use all the services provided by digital libraries.
I hope that today's decision will accelerate these processes.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Umberto Eco said that whoever reads books lives twice.
The report by Mrs Descamps provides a good account of the modern approach to cultural and educational issues.
I also referred to the matter in my report on the contribution of the future regional policy to the innovative capacity of the European Union.
Just as Gutenberg's invention marked a turning point in human development at the time, so we can today refer to a cultural revolution brought about by the Internet.
What is at issue is widespread access to the European, or indeed to the world, treasury of humankind's spiritual and material heritage.
The latter comprises contemporary creations along with those dating back over the centuries arising out of different cultures and languages.
Copyright and related rights are certainly an issue in this context.
I recognise what has already been achieved in this regard in many Member States, including the work of the National Library of Poland.
I would like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of more extensive broadband access.
I believe we should find a way of cofinancing digitisation from the Union's resources.
I shall conclude by referring to Goethe, who said that when he read a good book he felt as if he had made a new friend.
Just think how many good friends we could make through the European digital library!
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Commission has defined three essential axes to exploit the potential of digital technology: online accessibility, digitisation of analogical collections and preservation and storage of digital contents, and we are well aware of this.
With respect to digitisation, it is common knowledge that the Commission, through a recommendation in August last year, asked the Member States to coordinate their efforts to ensure synergy on a European scale.
The Council unanimously supported the recommendation, but I wish to take this opportunity - although it is a pity the Council is not in attendance -firstly to inquire of the Commission as to the real progress made by the Member States in this area, and secondly to ascertain whether sufficient consideration has been taken of non-state authorities, which, as we know, are responsible for culture in most decentralised countries.
With regard to another aspect, online accessibility, as I said, we all agree that there must be a multilingual interface and content must be guaranteed.
It is a true joy to enter the digital library webpage and see that, apart from the 23 official Community languages, the contents also appear in Icelandic and Serbian.
Today we are celebrating the European Day of Languages and you, Mrs Reding, made a major contribution to its creation.
You have also said on countless occasions, Commissioner, and rightly so, that big and small languages do not exist, that all of them form part of Europe's cultural wealth, and thus I would like to be given the chance to see an occasional reference in the digital library, or content rather than a reference, concerning languages such as my own, which are not official in the European Union.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, when the library in Alexandria burned down during Caesar's invasion of Egypt, a substantial part of all the literature written by mankind at that stage disappeared forever.
In my view, nothing like that will ever happen again, thanks to the existence of digital libraries.
I welcome the rapporteur's complex approach to the issue.
I come from the Czech Republic where successful digitisation of the National Library in Prague has been under way for some time.
Since the states have their own national libraries, it is only logical that the European Union should also have a similar institution, one that makes use of the latest technologies.
This is not just going through the motions of accomplishing the task of European integration; this is a practical matter.
More and more books are being published these days.
This vast amount of literature cannot be concentrated in one place without the help of computer technology.
This is a mammoth task.
The plan is that the European digital library will absorb those digital sources that already exist and contain the literary works not affected by copyright.
Literary works will be joined by technical, legal, journalistic and also audiovisual works.
Setting up a system that is so universal and yet reasonably simple will be an interesting task for the digital technology experts.
I am sure the European digital library will eliminate endless cross-referencing and complicated searches in virtual cyberspace and will become an enormous library that we will have, metaphorically speaking, at home.
Of course there are also the risks.
Will digital libraries make us even more dependent on computers and threaten the existence of printed books?
It may happen although I do not think it too likely.
A traditional book is an integral part of our culture, just like theatre or art. It offers something digital libraries will never be able to provide: first-hand contact with the reader.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, the British Library has roots going back to 1753. It contains documents dating as far back as 300 bc.
Famous people such as Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Mahatma Gandhi, Rudyard Kipling, George Orwell, George Bernard Shaw, even Vladimir Lenin, are just some of the figures who have studied in the reading rooms of the British Museum and British libraries.
I wonder if they would have found so much inspiration from surfing the internet.
I suspect that our magnificent facility, with its unprecedented collection of publications from every corner of the world and British Empire - and beyond, indeed - will be as treasured long after the EU has gone the way of other Eurofederalist projects from Charlemagne to the awful political nightmares of the last two centuries.
Good luck, Ms Descamps, with your digital library, but in this area, as in so many others, I would rather concentrate on protecting and preserving and developing a heritage that I am proud of than creating the trappings of a new state out of the ruins of failed ones.
Mr President, colleagues, first let me emphasise that I welcome the Commission and Ms Descamps' report on digital libraries as a timely and important contribution towards ensuring that digital information is preserved for future generations.
It is true that the internet has become one of the principal means of access to knowledge and learning.
Digital libraries would surely benefit many researchers, students, teachers and - as one specific group - people with physical disabilities.
So this is a perfect initiative in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All.
I would just like to draw your attention to one aspect that needs to be thoroughly assessed before making decisions.
Public/private cooperation and private sponsorship for the digitalisation of Europe's cultural heritage is an important element of the system as it now stands.
We need to make sure that new regulations in this field do not threaten the benefits of the current system, especially on scientific information.
For example, we have to make sure that the peer review mechanism is safeguarded.
Peer review is the process by which independent experts in a scientific discipline - the peers - critically assess a scientific paper reporting on research.
The peer review system is critical for the scientific community as it is an important quality control mechanism and can influence scientific careers.
We also need to avoid a scenario where open access puts the existing dissemination of scientific research through subscription journals at risk.
One question to be assessed is also damage to the profitability of journals from small publishing houses.
In short, the current system is perceived by many stakeholders as easy to access, efficient, cost-effective and also of high quality.
We have to be sure that the benefits, especially for researchers, will be on the positive side and we must avoid any unintended negative consequences for the very people we are hoping to assist.
(PL) Mr President, the idea of creating a European digital library, by creating an Internet site where resources would be stored that could then be accessed by any user free of charge is certainly an ambitious one.
The library would have a multilingual interface facilitating direct access to the desired material.
Every citizen would be able to access even the least well-known works of world culture in his or her native language.
It should also be noted that this initiative raises an important issue, namely Internet access and the opportunity to connect with the world's cultural heritage being made available to residents of rural areas, island areas and to those experiencing mobility difficulties.
Access to all categories of cultural material, including that which is protected by copyright and related rights will be another major problem.
I trust it will prove possible to resolve it in due course, through investment in technology.
Mrs Descamps has prepared a well-balanced report.
I believe it deserves our support.
(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to echo the previous speakers who congratulated the rapporteur on her well-prepared report.
It sends out a clear message from the European Parliament in support of the idea of establishing a European digital library.
I am pleased to be able to remind the House that Poland was involved in promoting this idea.
My country was represented amongst the six Heads of State and Government who launched it.
The report presents convincing arguments in favour of the gradual implementation of this project.
It suggests progressive inclusion of the various categories of cultural heritage, together with documents protected by copyright and related rights, always complying with legal restrictions in the area of intellectual property.
The idea contained in the proposal whereby institutions other than libraries that are involved in the dissemination of culture could be included in the project is worthy of consideration.
It is only right and proper for museums and archives to play an important part in this system too, as they have enjoyed strong links with libraries over the centuries.
I have high hopes, especially in view of the plan to include in the coordination system for the European digital library not only scientific research on digitisation but also the very important issue of the protection of digital resources.
I believe that in this way it will prove possible to develop common unified requirements regarding the proper storage of digital materials collected in libraries and archives, and also digital materials - archived, I must stress -collected elsewhere than in archives, in other words in museums and libraries.
It is well known that for centuries these institutions have experienced difficulties in properly protecting archive material received from different sources.
We are at last in a position to remedy the situation.
Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mrs Descamps and the other members of the Committee on Culture and Education for having produced this report, because it is a very important one indeed.
You see, Europe's true wealth is to be found not in the euro or in our economic development: it is in our heritage, a heritage that across the centuries has been created and built up; that is what constitutes the real and profound source of Europe's riches.
Now in a certain sense the scandal is that this heritage is disappearing into archives and vaults, into places where the public, the citizens of Europe, cannot go, where they cannot touch it, where they cannot understand it, where they cannot enjoy it.
The precise aim of the digital library is to break down these barriers.
I believe that this is one of the great advances that Europe has made and I would like to pay homage to the national libraries, to our national libraries, because they were there at the launch of this initiative, which has been so valid and so important for European cultures.
The directors of these libraries have been true pioneers.
They understood that symbiosis was involved, the symbiosis between culture, which is richness of the corpus, and technology, which is an instrument that provides access to this culture, and the fact that they undertook this pioneering work essentially means that in 2008 we now have the single multilingual access point.
And yes, yes, yes I say to those who brought up the point, it will even give us access to the literature of Luxembourg.
I am proud of this because Luxembourgish is my mother tongue and therefore for me it is the most important language in the world, just as every mother tongue is important.
This is precisely why the works of art and literature that have been created in all these languages, and the special manner in which these are expressed, are what we need to be able to access.
Take the culture of Luxembourg: of course the people of Luxembourg have access to it, but do you in this House know that there is a such a thing as the culture of Luxembourg?
No!
However, once we have the digital library the common access point will enable you to understand that there really is one.
It is extraordinary that we can have access to these cultures, that we can share this wealth all around us, including - and I would emphasise the fact - outside Europe, because culture does not stop at our borders.
Culture means sharing and therefore it is in a spirit of openness that we wish to create this library, for interoperability will be a very important aspect, and this will apply not just to the books but also to all the other forms of culture: films, music, museum collections and so on.
We are therefore witnessing an extraordinary cultural opening-up that is both multilingual and multicultural, something that will truly show the very essence of Europe itself, which is this unified diversity.
Of course there are problems to resolve and the honourable Members have been quite clear on this.
There is the problem of financing, for one.
I would therefore appeal to the Member States to ensure that the discussions are followed by effective action.
Some have already done so and I would like to thank them for this.
In 2008 we shall be presenting an analysis of what has been achieved and also, therefore, of what has not been achieved.
I believe that this will be very important for moving the whole venture forward.
Of course we are also going to recommend the private-public partnership, because that will be essential for the progress of digitisation, which is a very expensive business. I am also thinking about the preservation of fragile material that can be destroyed if it is not taken care of.
How many reels of film are allowed to go to dust?
If we are to preserve this common cultural heritage then we simply have to digitise it before it is too late.
I am also naturally thinking of other problems that need to be resolved, namely those relating to copyright - which is a real headache - and to scientific information.
Our high-level group is currently working on solutions to these issues.
Mr President, what we have here is an extraordinary project that shows what European value added really is, and I believe that the greatest thing is to unite Europeans around their cultures plural, around their respective histories plural, which are things of beauty and which have been developed through creativity.
This really is the best of what we have.
Let us preserve it and let us work together so that we can share it.
I would like to thank all the speakers very much, and especially Commissioner Reding for her charm and intelligence.
I would like to thank her in own language, Luxembourgish, because today is Lesser Known Languages Day.
Merci!

Efficiency and equity in European education and training systems (debate)
The next item is the report by TomÃ¡Å¡ Zatloukal, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on efficiency and equity in European education and training systems.
rapporteur. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is facing a number of connected socioeconomic challenges: the emergence of highly competitive countries, the ageing of the population, migration, a fast-changing labour market structure, and booming information and communication technologies.
Each one of these factors affects the issue of access to quality education.
People with low qualifications are increasingly at risk of unemployment and social exclusion.
Fair systems guarantee that education and training are independent of socioeconomic background and other factors that place individuals at a disadvantage.
The challenge is to support the participation of pupils, students and adults from all social groups: the current situation in this regard is particularly unsatisfactory.
The report I am tabling here in this Parliament urges Member States to take positive measures from the pre-school stage to ensure the social diversity of classes and establishments and run quality educational programmes.
Skills that are hereditary or acquired at an early age provide the basis for learning in later life.
The return on investment is highest during this period because the fruit of such investment lasts a lifetime.
I would like to point out that at the level of primary education premature categorisation of pupils has a detrimental effect.
Instead, I consider it important to adapt the curriculum so that it suits diverse groups of children and their capabilities within one school.
On the other hand, differentiation and creating a flexible range of study options is very effective at secondary level.
As far as vocational training is concerned, I would recommend improving access to tertiary education and developing opportunities for lifelong learning.
Third-level education is vital to the success of a knowledge-based economy.
It would benefit from more funding than it receives at present.
The report states that free university tuition does not necessarily guarantee equity and calls for an analysis of the range of financial incentives and support options that can significantly reduce inequity in terms of access to university education.
Education has an impact on the economy: it increases human capital and innovative capability and enables technology to be disseminated.
Each additional year of average school attendance raises productivity in an average EU country selectively by 6.2% and in the long term by a further 3.1%, thanks to its contribution to more rapid technological development.
Increasing the efficiency of education and training brings both individuals and society as a whole a return on investment of up to 8% a year.
A further benefit is a reduction in unemployment: in today's EU the average unemployment rate is 12.6% amongst people who have completed primary or secondary education, as against 5% in the case of people who have completed higher education.
Furthermore, recent research carried out by the Commission has shown that 75 million EU citizens - i.e. 32% of the workforce - have received insufficient education.
In 2010 only 15% of new jobs will be available for that group of people, most of whom come from socially disadvantaged sectors of society.
Education and training policies must have a significant positive impact on social and economic results, sustainable development and social cohesion, whereas inefficiency and inequity entail huge costs: loss of tax revenue, unemployment, a greater requirement for healthcare and support from public funds, and also the costs associated with a higher level of anti-social behaviour.
Education and training are basic factors contributing to long-term European economic growth, to competitiveness and to social cohesion.
In conclusion, allow me to thank all my colleagues who have worked with me on this report.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I really welcome this initiative of the Parliament to take further the message of our communication, which we adopted on this topic last year.
I read your report with a lot of interest and I also listened now to Mr Zatloukal, whom I want to congratulate cordially because I think and I feel we are partners on this issue, in this debate and in efforts to improve the situation.
We could listen now to a description of socioeconomic challenges that we are facing individually, collectively, together, but also of the importance of investment - better investment, more investment - in education and training policies.
I think that education and training policy lies at the centre of our efforts to create a more prosperous and a more cohesive European society.
All European education systems are marked by educational inequities that reflect socioeconomic inequalities.
The paradoxical role of education and training in relation to these inequalities is that they very often contribute to their perpetuation.
But they are sometimes the only vehicle by which inequalities can be ameliorated.
Across Europe, the process of modernising education and training systems is largely driven by the search for greater efficiency in terms of cost-effectiveness.
I think this is really desirable, of course, but it is frequently, and wrongly, assumed that efficiency and equity are mutually exclusive.
As part of our commitment to helping Member States improve their education and training systems, the Commission's communication showed that efficiency and equity do not have to come at the expense of each other, at the expense of quality.
Efficiency and equity are, in effect, mutually enforcing.
I think this is the most important message from the whole communication.
Your report stresses strongly the need for European education and training systems to be both efficient and equitable if they are to help us to achieve not only economic growth but social cohesion.
I am especially pleased to see your emphasis on the need to develop efficient and equitable policies for the whole life-long learning continuum and on the need to invest in education early, as investing in quality early-childhood and pre-primary education and care is shown to be the most effective way of breaking the cycle of disadvantage.
I am also pleased to notice that you confirm our message that early tracking of pupils has detrimental effects on efficiency and equity.
And, of course, you place a lot of emphasis on the need to develop a culture of evaluation in order to develop effective long-term policies and create policies based on solid evidence.
Your initiative will bring us closer to the development of life-long learning strategies that foster equality, inclusion, integration, and social cohesion.
We will take full account of it in our forthcoming initiatives in the field of education and training, especially in the proposal for the 2008 Joint Report on the implementation of our work programme and our reflections for the future, and in the Green Paper on the links between education and migration, in which inequalities will be a central issue.
We hope to present this communication next spring.
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (DE) Madam President, the question is: why are we talking about equality or inequality when more women than men reach a high level of education?
What this means is that we have the same educational opportunities and we are utilising them as well, but equality of opportunity is no longer guaranteed after that.
In training, in the use of their acquired knowledge, women continue to suffer discrimination, which means that there is still no equality in the education and training systems.
That is why it is essential that we take account of women who are already mothers and are studying, for example, that we demand particularly flexible organisation of studies here, and that we promote and support access for young women, especially from remote regions, and vulnerable groups such as migrant women and women from ethnic minorities, for there are major anomalies and inequalities here.
This must start at pre-school and school age and then continue all the way through to vocational training.
If I may, I will continue after a short break.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you, Madam President.
I will speak in Hungarian.
Commissioner, last week, representing the Committee on Culture and Education, I took part in a conference in Lisbon entitled 'Young Voices - Meeting Diversity in Education', organised by the Portuguese Presidency.
It was a profoundly moving experience to hear young people living with a variety of physical and learning disabilities present their school experiences.
There was one common feature in their story: every one of them said that they felt that if they were able to participate in school activities alongside their able-bodied peers, they would not be judged according to their disabilities but according to their abilities and personalities.
Integrating children living with a disability into mainstream education alongside their able-bodied peers is also vital in order to ensure that society accepts them and includes them more easily as adults.
If children are accustomed from an early age to being around children who have some disability or other, and are accustomed to having to respect them equally and perhaps to helping them, then there is a good chance that they will demonstrate more understanding and more empathy towards disadvantaged people in their adult lives.
The report we have before us speaks a great deal about integration issues relating to social differences.
I am convinced that, by analogy to the example I referred to above, it is also important for children who are socially disadvantaged to be able to participate in an inclusive way alongside other children in all the various stages of education.
To achieve this, two things have to be put in place.
One is technological progress and removal of barriers.
From this point of view, central and eastern European Member States are lagging far behind: schools, the school environment, transport facilities, even the hospitals, other institutions, public institutions, for example, are all inaccessible to wheelchair users.
The other, and this will take longer, is the change in attitude that is needed on the part of decision-makers in order for them to acknowledge that inclusive education is the first crucial stage in the process that leads to social acceptance and integration.
In conclusion, let me say that sports, too, are an important tool for education and social leverage, because social and societal differences disappear in sports; the only things that matter are talent, determination and application.
Physical education in schools and sports contribute greatly to strengthening important social values such as solidarity and respect for each other's dignity.
This is why I consider it important that when this House debates the quality, efficiency and equity of education and training, reference should also be made to the importance of physical education and its quality, efficiency and equity.
We also need to ensure that inclusive education in this regard plays a major part.
I congratulate the rapporteur and thank you for your attention.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the right to unrestricted education, which means the right of access to education, is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and yet it is still deficient and has still not been fully realised in practice.
The considerable disparity in performance between education systems in the EU translates into differences in economic and social development.
Education systems must be efficient, equitable and, above all, freely accessible.
Efficiency must be promoted and emphasised from the pre-school level onwards, in schools and also in the vocational training system.
It is extremely important that higher education should become accustomed to some measure of flexibility in order to respond swiftly to economic and social change, for this is the only way to create competitive advantages.
Multidimensionality, quality and cooperation with the private sector and the promotion of research and development are essential.
However, we must not educate people simply to supply the economy with well-qualified workers.
Education is personally enriching and is the prerequisite for us to be able to live in social cohesion.
It fosters personal development and self-esteem, and that is at least as important as specialist, vocational and business skills training.
We need to work towards a situation in which teachers and all their students receive a high-quality education and, above all, have opportunities for advancement and flexible development, for here, we have been travelling down the same track for decades.
That cannot continue!
It would be simplistic to say that education policy should be solely a matter for the Member States.
This is only partly true.
A European educational area with a common goal, namely the Lisbon objectives, also needs a common approach to achieve efficiency and equity.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) Ladies and gentlemen, learning is an inseparable part of the European social dimension, because it reveals the significance of solidarity, equal opportunities and social inclusion.
All citizens must gain the knowledge and skills required of them and continuously update them.
Moreover, it is necessary to consider the special needs of people who are on the verge of social exclusion.
The European Union does not regulate the development of national education systems directly, but it does have a significant impact on their development, firstly through the common objectives of the European Union; secondly through the monitoring of set European guidelines and reports on the development of education systems presented by the Member States; and thirdly through the education and training programmes funded by the European Union.
I welcome the European Commission's recommendation to make investments in human resources a priority for the Structural Funds.
The European Union has to provide the essential conditions for every Member State seeking to create and develop an effective European education and training system in order to solve the relevant problems.
For example, one of the biggest problems in Lithuania today is violence in schools.
To combat this, various prevention programmes have already started to be implemented at national level.
Another issue is that we are searching for any methods that would help to improve the quality of higher education, seeking to ensure that the level of education provided by universities in our country is equal to that provided by the best universities in Western Europe.
The Lithuanian education system faces other problems too.
One of these is low salaries for teachers in all disciplines, inevitably leading to a lack of teachers.
We do not have sufficient money to repair sports halls and grounds, and I believe that improving sports infrastructure is important not only for encouraging schoolchildren to enjoy sports, but also for preventing them from taking drugs and alcohol as well as smoking.
One more very relevant problem is the generation of young emigrants returning home.
They need extra funding and additional teachers for compensatory studies and special programmes.
I have mentioned only a few problems that are no doubt also relevant in other new Member States of the European Union.
I fully agree with the speaker who said that the current situation was unsatisfactory.
Realistic assessment and active support for different education systems complying with common European goals and standards should be today's objective for the European Union.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, there is a popular saying in Poland according to which if you fail to learn certain things in childhood, you will suffer the consequences for the rest of your life.
It wisely reminds us that teaching children is the best investment of all.
The rapporteur is therefore right to suggest increasing the resources allocated to pre-school education, because that is when social integration begins.
The latter helps to develop the individual and prepare him or her to carry out their mission in life.
Integration should be strengthened at a later stage too.
The rapporteur is also right, therefore, in identifying the problem of classifying individuals and the advisability of only introducing streaming at lower secondary level and of extending the period spent in school-based education.
It is appropriate too that the draft resolution clearly identifies the need to link policies on vocational education and training with policies on employment, the economy, social integration, improving the competitiveness of higher education and enabling everyone to access it on equal terms.
The most pressing reason for us to adopt these arrangements for education is the fact that 75 million European Union citizens, that is to say, 32% of the workforce, is inadequately educated.
This has serious implications for the effectiveness of their work, the performance of our economies and the social situation.
Change is needed.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, an equitable and efficient system should guarantee access to education for everyone.
The rapporteur states that we need an improvement in pre-school education, which is when people form their habits and skills needed for later learning.
He asks the Member States to increase funding for pre-school education.
However, what is the reality?
In almost all EU countries pre-school facilities have been closing down in recent years.
The adverse population trend is not the only reason.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality agreed with this, too, and the situation in the Czech Republic is no different.
Pre-school facilities have been closing down because they are expensive to run.
That is how villages and towns try to hold on to substantial parts of their budgets.
Company pre-school facilities practically do not exist any longer.
Waiting times for placing a child in these facilities are starting to grow.
Private nurseries that are run to high standards are beginning to appear: they offer foreign language tuition and other perks but only wealthy families can afford them.
Pre-school education in the Czech Republic used to be, and still is, of a high standard but even there a certain inequality already exists.
Furthermore, I cannot agree with paragraph 21 of the report, which states that free university education does not necessarily guarantee equity.
The situation whereby young people get student loans and pay them back later will have a more serious impact on the poorer students as opposed to the richer ones; this may affect the psychology of young people who start their lives burdened with debts.
Europe is experiencing a wave of immigration.
Among those who come here are many children and students.
These people have a lot of potential that can help the Union in its future development.
They are also standing on an imaginary starting line and we should enable them to participate successfully in the education system.
In this context, it is difficult to understand the legislation governing schools in force in the Czech Republic since January 2005, which regulates the extent to which education is allowed to be provided to foreigners with permanent residence permits, or with long-term or short-term visas, refugees or asylum seekers, or persons under temporary protection.
One bureaucratic decision draws a line between children who must go to school and children who must not go to school.
Everything depends on how quickly the person in question is granted the relevant status.
Their arrival is dramatic enough to begin with.
We must make every effort to ensure that their entry into our Union is easier.
We do not want young people to be dragged into various undesirable social activities.
(RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I congratulate Mr. Zatloukal for the report, which I consider to be very good, because it refers to one of the most important and sensitive chapters in our life, namely education.
Furthermore, I would like to refer to three aspects of the report: I requested increased support for the university excellence programmes, both at the level of Member States and of the European Union, to the extent of its competencies.
This is essential if we want the Lisbon Agenda to be successful and the gaps in respect to other global actors to decrease.
The lack of highly-qualified specialists in Europe is felt everywhere and extremely seriously in the new Member States due to the brain drain phenomenon.
At the same time, I am convinced that the increase of the educational process efficiency is closely related to multilingualism.
In the context of the free movement of European Union citizens, adjustment to the market requirements involves knowledge of foreign languages.
Moreover, exchanges of pupils and students would be facilitated by multilingual education.
As regards the equity of educational and training systems, I believe that Member States should find the necessary means to increase the degree of access to education and training of children, young people and adults.
Subsidized positions should come as a support for underprivileged social categories, for the purpose of reducing illiteracy, social reconversion, for a better adjustment to the labour market requirements and reduction of unemployment.
This way, the required labour force in third countries will be reduced.
There are enough human resources, yet they are not trained and managed efficiently.
(ES) Madam President, the review of the Lisbon objectives we carried out in 2005 demonstrated once more how important it is to position education and training at the core of future EU strategy.
It is obvious, and this is borne out by Eurostat data, that we are falling short of the ambitious objectives we have set for higher education for 2015: investment in R&D, modernisation of universities, reduction of academic failure rates and the numbers of early school-leavers, more participation by adults in life-long learning, and an increase in the numbers of those who have completed secondary education.
This time lag leaves us behind our international partners, the US, India and Japan, and to add to this we have the huge disparity of situations among European countries.
Not only is making efficient and effective progress in the education systems of our Member States important in terms of international competitiveness and economic growth; it is also an essential component of making progress in terms of social cohesion in our societies.
Investing in pre-school, primary and secondary education is a basic requirement to minimise the risk of social exclusion and ensure higher levels of employment and better pay.
Both the public and private finance allocated to education must be increased, and Member States must seriously consider the need to build on the Bologna and Copenhagen processes.
Likewise, university education ought to be adapted to our societies' increasingly heterogeneous social and economic needs, while not ignoring the fact that education is also the basis for training free citizens capable of playing an active role in society.
Finally, we must update and improve the teaching of vocational training with all due haste, and adapt it to the new challenges posed by the extension of the working lives of Europeans, which increases socioeconomic and educational expectations in adults, without neglecting training on non-discrimination between the sexes at each and every level of education.
(PL) Further to the recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council in 2006, emphasising the need to develop lifelong learning, with particular reference to the unemployed, and the need to adjust to economic changes impacting on the operation of the labour market, I should like to draw attention to the importance of education in achieving greater mobility on the labour market, which represents an opportunity to reduce structural unemployment.
I would like to emphasise the significance of the European Qualifications Framework in terms of increasing worker mobility.
Equal access to education, which is such an important factor in ensuring that all children and young people have equal opportunities in life, is linked to the financing of education in the Member States of the Union.
The differences between the financial resources allocated to education, qualifications and teachers' pay have a significant bearing on the chances of achieving that particular objective of the Lisbon Strategy.
The report entitled 'Progress towards the Lisbon Objectives in Education and Training' adopted by the European Commission in 2005 clearly indicates that progress in that field had been inadequate in terms of achieving the desired outcome by 2010.
That is why it is so important to focus on improving the quality of education, thus preventing social exclusion and increasing the competitiveness of our economy.
I congratulate Mr Zatloukal on his excellent report.
(PT) One of the areas of education which is still lagging behind in certain European Union countries, in particular Portugal, is pre-school education.
It therefore seems essential to me to underline the call to Member States to invest much more in a public network of nurseries supplied with teachers with high-quality training, capable of dealing with all children, as this is one of the most effective means of developing their intellect, establishing the basis for future education, raising overall skills levels, significantly increasing the equity of the education system and combating social inequalities.
Likewise, it is essential to ensure quality primary and secondary education, which must be universal, compulsory and free, in order to provide a basic education and key skills which will contribute to the achievement of fundamental social and civic values and education for peace and equality, thereby reinforcing social cohesion and inclusion.
As for higher education, it should be recognised that this is a fundamental sector in developed societies, which is why lack of success at school and early school leaving must be prevented, as is the case in Portugal where unfortunately around 40% of pupils never even finish their secondary education.
Budget cuts in education, rising costs of higher education and the difficult social situation of a high percentage of families and young people are preventing Portugal from rapidly improving the higher education of its population, resulting in the worst indices in the European Union.
Given that studies show that, for every additional year of average school attendance, productivity increases selectively by 6.2% in an average country of the European Union, we can understand better the difficulties of those countries which do not give their citizens access to high-quality education.
(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, education has played, and continues to play, a key role in the development of the European economy and the personal development of young people.
I fully agree with this and many other statements made in the report, and I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur.
It is also correct to say that education systems are effective when the resources deployed produce the best possible results.
These objectives are pursued by all the EU Member States, in fact, but comparative studies often reveal some interesting facts about the outcomes.
For that reason, pointers and appeals to the Member States, as set out in the report, are more than justified from a European perspective, even though we have no direct powers in respect of the content and structure of education.
The causes of such divergent outcomes can be found in the variations in educational quality and intensity, which result in different levels of performance and therefore also to unequal life chances for our young people.
In my view, it is essential, as a matter of urgency, to make it clear, time and again, that today's generation of school students will be entering an international competition for training places after completing their education.
Equal opportunities for all thus pose a challenge for Member States which they must meet in order to ensure that young people receive the best possible education that equips them with the intellectual skills they need in order to flourish.
However, equality of opportunity always has to do with quality and performance as well.
This, in turn, merits a greater focus on quality and performance in the education system.
In this context, it should not just be about educational equality for everyone, but about giving everyone an equal start, followed up by the best possible education which takes account of individual talents and differences in physical and intellectual abilities.
(RO) Madam President, Mr. Commissioner, by 2010, the European Union plans for the dropout rate for young people between 18 and 24 years old not to exceed 10% and over 85% of the young people over 18 years old to attend post-secondary studies.
9.7% of the children in the European Union aged between 0 and 17 are part of a family with no income.
Many of the children coming from poor families or a rural environment do not attend any form of post-secondary education for financial reasons.
I consider that, in a social Europe, scholarships for pupils and students should be accessible to all those who want to learn.
Disabled children must also have access to education.
The Member States and the Commission must have as a priority the registration of at least 90% of the children aged under 7 in nurseries or kindergartens.
In this way, young mothers will be able to reconcile their family life and their professional activity.
I also request, in order to make education more efficient, ensuring the training and motivation of teachers.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to highlight a number of issues.
First, I agree with the rapporteur that investment in pre-school education brings the most rewards, because that is when the best results are obtained.
It is also important to support modernisation of universities, to emphasise the need for equal access to higher education and to increase its competitiveness.
Second, equal access to education leads to many positive outcomes.
It has a bearing on social development, economic growth, increased innovation, the development of human potential and new technologies, and also on reducing unemployment.
Third, although the return on investment in education only makes itself felt after a lengthy period and requires long-term planning, we should remember that such investment is vital.
Fourth, I agree with the view that it is essential to link policies on vocational training and education with employment policy, economic policy and social integration.
Fifth, we need to invest in our young people, because the younger generation represents the future of the European Union.
It is very important to prevent children from dropping out of school early.
Sixth, we are confronted by a demographic problem; namely that Europe's population is ageing.
That is why we must promote lifelong learning for adults.
And finally, education, education, education.
Madam President, in general I am concerned by the uncritical acceptance by the Commission that Member States are cutting funding for education.
In Ireland it is particularly glaring, with the growth in our population and, indeed, as a result, overcrowded classrooms.
I have long been an advocate of pre-school and primary education as essential for the personal development of every child.
All the evidence shows that the better the education, the better one's life chances are.
It is even linked to a longer and healthier life.
I believe the Commission and Member States must put as much emphasis on quality as on efficiency and equity.
The quality of the school environment and teaching are prerequisites to efficiency.
Children need good teachers with a curriculum that gives a holistic education, one geared to teaching students how to make rational decisions, how to cope with diversity and change, how to communicate with others and, indeed, provide a broad ethical basis for the values they can choose to live their lives by.
These are skills they need to make the most of themselves and their society.
But there is even a more urgent and basic issue - that of hungry children in our schools.
Thousands of children go to school hungry in Ireland and I am sure we are not unique.
It matters not how efficient or equitable the access is, these children cannot do well, and the long-term consequences of that dwarf the savings a state makes by not providing a healthy breakfast for these children.
Member of the Commission. - (SK) I would like to thank you for a convergent debate since it confirms not only the report and the Commission communication on this matter but also the position of the Member States, which expressed their views at the ministerial meeting in November and subsequently in that half of 2007 when the Council adopted conclusions that also confirmed the basic points in the Commission communication.
I would just like to make a couple of comments.
I believe that promoting equity and efficiency in education is both a moral duty and a fundamental financial/economic need.
Logic dictates that we need to make better and greater investment in education: firstly, better because there is scope to use every euro, every crown and every pound more effectively.
Several speakers have stated that skills and the quality of education and vocational training have a decisive impact on the future position of both individuals and social groups and need to be constantly improved.
Those who can improve them primarily are, for example, teachers.
Investment in the quality of teacher training is one of the most efficient ways of achieving an overall improvement since teachers multiply such effects.
In terms of improvement, there is a systematic need, for example, for quality assessment as a basic tool and not as an exception, not as something extraordinary but as a rule, where inputs, outputs and everything in between are evaluated, and quality is assessed and rewarded.
I would like to say that the Commission will, as expected from the report, continue to focus on this matter.
We want to pay more attention to the issue fair and efficient education, for example, in next year's topic on education and migration.
There is presently an ongoing consultation on schools for the 21st century, i.e. what is expected from schools in this new era, and naturally we want this process to culminate in an up-to-date view of the position of schools in European society today.
Another topic that we raised recently was the communication adopted in August on the quality of teacher training and the very important conclusions it presents.
In conclusion, I believe that the processes that have been mentioned, such as the Bologna and Copenhagen process, and matters relating to adult education, pre-school education and lifelong education, must all come together under the topic of accessibility and quality as key factors in the truly fair education system that we require today and in the future.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (ET) Time waits for no man.
It is clear that in 2010 Europe will not be the world's most competitive economy.
An appropriate and well-structured education system would bring that objective within reach.
It is impossible to ignore the academic and financial level of the individual top universities.
According to various data, 20-30 of the world's top 50 universities are in the United States.
A further five or six are in the United Kingdom.
The rest of Europe is in third place with four or five, with Canada and Australia hot on their heels.
Success stories have a habit of repeating themselves.
Unfortunately, this success story owes its existence primarily to the fact that the English-language education market can tap into billions of powerful customers.
The effect of scale does the rest.
As a result Harvard is tens of times wealthier and more famous than its nearest competitor.
Imitating the elite system of the Ivy League and Oxbridge in continental Europe is a hazardous project.
I would even call it a blind alley.
Both in the United States and in the United Kingdom the literacy and numeracy of many ordinary citizens is deemed to be inadequate.
In the desire for success, especially rapid success, it would be more reasonable to rely entirely on those activities which are familiar to us.
The most successful European Union country in terms of education is unquestionably Finland, whose national strategy includes public access to education at an equally high level everywhere.
Education is by nature a strategic area.
The effects of decisions and actions emerge only over decades.
Consequently it would be pointless as far as equality is concerned to sacrifice another quarter of a century in the name of higher summits. Even if it were the right way to go.
A uniformly high level remains Europe's best trump card in international competition.
European strategy for the rights of the child: against "dys"crimination of children and exclusion of "dys" people (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a European strategy for the rights of the child: against 'dys'crimination of children and exclusion of 'dys' people, by Anna ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, Amalia Sartori and Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, Roberta Angelilli on behalf of the UEN Group, Zita Gurmai and Catherine Trautmann on behalf of the PSE Group, Adamos Adamou on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, Hiltrud Breyer et RaÃŒl Romeva i Rueda on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Elizabeth Lynne on behalf of the ALDE Group, and Kathy Sinnott on behalf of the IND/DEM Group - B6-0317/2007).
(FR) Madam President, Rule 173 states that a verbatim report of the proceedings of each sitting shall be drawn up in all the official languages.
I would draw your attention to the fact that this debate on the exclusion of persons affected by 'dys' ability is not to be translated into the official languages of the European Union.
This 'tool' has quite simply been done away with in practice, even though our Rules of Procedure require it.
My point of order is quite a simple one: this evening's debate has to a large extent been requested by numerous schoolchildren, parents' associations, teachers, educators and doctors in different countries.
However, the citizens who elect the Members of this House, since they will not be familiar with all the different languages used this evening, will never be able to know everything that is being said during this parliamentary debate, even though it is intended for them.
Thank you very much for your point, which of course concerns us all on what is the day of European languages.
The matter is being considered and a report is being prepared that will go to the Conference of Presidents, so your point is taken.
We now continue with the debate on the oral question to the Commission on a European strategy for the rights of the child.
author. - (SK) Allow me to begin with the testimony of a young 21-year-old woman in her third year at university.
'When I was 17 my schoolmates laughed at me all year because I looked like an 11-year-old.
In my report the teachers frequently asked when I would finally make up my mind to learn.
Those of us with 'dys'abilities work much more than others and it's very hard to live with'.
End of quote.
Society is never aware of the 10-20% of children with 'dys'abilities because they are never diagnosed.
Their difficulties hinder communication, prevent normal education and unfortunately sometimes lead to mental breakdown and social exclusion.
As far as we are concerned, the European Union can do what it does best, that is to say it can act as a spokesperson and highlight, in a sufficiently varied manner, a problem which in other circumstances might remain taboo and hidden away.
Europe provides an opportunity to identify good ideas and the tried and tested practices of organisations and governments, as referred to in Written Declaration 64/2007, which is currently before the European Parliament.
A 'neuro-dys' programme already exists and the European Union funds projects that may be well suited to those affected by 'dys'abilities too, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the ICT Policy Support Programme, support for research into information and communication technology skills, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research - health, the Lifelong Learning Programme, and the Second Public Health Programme 2008-2013.
These programmes are the subject of amending and supplementary proposals for the 2008 budget, which we have put forward with our fellow Members from the five political groups.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion allow me to express my great admiration, respect, gratitude and encouragement to those who in their lives could have had plenty of reasons to be mothers without hope: 'des mÃšres dÃ©sespÃ©rÃ©es'.
Nevertheless, none of them is giving up the fight.
They are the best defenders of their children's cause, alongside the fathers where they are still part of the same family.
I believe that the debate this evening will show that they will not be alone and that their problem will also become a concern of the European Parliament.
author. - (ES) Madam President, first and foremost I wish to apologise for the absence of Mrs Zita Gurmai, the author of this oral question on behalf of the Socialist Group, who cannot attend this sitting due to unforeseen circumstances, and so with your permission, Madam President, I intend to speak on behalf of Mrs Gurmai and on my own behalf, since I had also asked to speak.
My wish, Madam President, is simply to reiterate what has been said.
We are talking about learning disorders that affect a substantial segment of our population.
Almost 10% of Europe's children suffer from 'dys' problems: children who are usually invisible to our education systems, which all too frequently blame their academic failure on unrelated causes.
The necessary measures must be taken to prevent such 'dys'crimination, and schoolchildren must be treated in a special, timely, intensive and multidisciplinary fashion, preferably at their usual teaching centre.
This requires protocols for detection and courses of action at schools.
For the first time in my country, Spain, a socialist government has introduced an education law to help pupils with specific learning difficulties.
This is a major step, since in our various countries families are usually dependent on the goodwill of teachers and their willingness to make a voluntary effort with the proper training.
Opting for other solutions means a substantial economic burden, which is often impossible to shoulder.
We must remember that boys and girls with these dysfunctions are intelligent, and all they need is a different way of learning.
Academic success is a genuine possibility for them.
All that is required is the political will to implement the right mechanisms that produce genuine solutions.
Making these pupils visible to society means having reliable statistics to allow proper decisions to be taken; it means providing access to clear and truthful information for everyone who seeks it and starting up awareness campaigns extending to all our countries.
Making them visible to our education systems also means that, in addition to providing treatment in good time for all children affected in the early years of school, we must take account of their needs when designing syllabuses at each and every level of education.
A number of universities are now using examinations and tests adapted to university students with this kind of problem.
Community-financed education programmes such as e-learning or life-long learning must also be designed with 'dys' people in mind.
Ladies and gentlemen, we must tackle the needs of this sector of the population.
We cannot continue to turn our backs on a disorder that affects over 3 million Europeans.
author. - (DE) Madam President, I am pleased, too, that this important topic - the increase in dyslexia - is being discussed here this evening.
It is certainly the first time that we have talked about this issue, but it should not be the last.
I want the Commission to do everything possible to drive this issue forward.
We are not starting from zero.
There are already programmes, there are already initiatives, in many Member States.
It is important, in my view, not to talk about dyslexia as an illness or a disability, for that is incorrect.
It has already been mentioned that many children with dyslexia are actually highly intelligent.
We know that these children are quicker at thinking than in their motor skills.
The first step that we need to take, therefore - and this is my urgent request to the Commissioner - is to obtain an overview of what has already been done in the field of research and the programmes and initiatives which already exist at European level, and then pull all this information together.
I think it is important not to confuse dyslexia with ADS.
It would be disastrous to lump the two together.
We know that ADS is closely connected to excessive television consumption and over-stimulation.
On the issue of dyslexia, we should also consider how we can introduce children to books and reading early on.
We know that children who read a lot and have easy access to books are less susceptible to dyslexia.
This might be one way of curbing the alarming rise in dyslexia.
We urge the Commission to compile an overview of the diversity and the different approaches which exist in Europe.
Another option would be to hold a conference to bring together all these people and their different experiences in this area.
We know that children are our future and knowledge is our most important resource in Europe, so we need to do our utmost here.
author. - Madam President, it is estimated that there are approximately 49 million people with some form of 'dys'ability within the EU.
As many as 10% of children are affected by a 'dys'-type disability such as dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, or attention-deficit disorder.
Take the case of Sean in the UK.
The teachers' report described him as stupid, awkward, disruptive and over-emotional.
Because of his problem, he was marginalised and bullied by fellow pupils and teachers did very little to intervene.
Sean's parents were eventually forced to withdraw him from school after he arrived home badly beaten and bloodied, but the local education authority refused to provide tutoring or assistance, so education was left to his parents, one of whom was forced to give up work.
Thankfully, a local support group was at hand and offered help to Sean and his parents.
Other children in the UK and some other Member States are not so lucky.
We must exchange best practice across the EU, and this is where the Council and the Commission have an important role to play.
Information must be made more available.
Steps must be taken to spot, screen, diagnose and treat these disorders at an early stage.
Structures must be adapted to integrate young people with disabilities into the world of work, and it is important that a European charter for people with 'dys' problems is drawn up.
It is also vital that research under the seventh Framework Programme is increased.
There is no point in paying lip-service to disabled people's rights.
We have to continue to fight to ensure that individuals like Sean are treated equally and given the help and support they deserve.
author. - Madam President, there are millions, literally millions, of children who are not considered disabled but who struggle with a significant and disabling condition in the area of learning, movement and communication.
Although the number of children diagnosed with dyslexia, dysphasia, dyscalculation, dyspraxia and similar specific disorders is increasingly dramatically - dyslexia alone is estimated to affect 10% of children in the US - many, if not the majority, of children affected in Europe still remain undiagnosed and therefore largely unhelped.
Often, when parents express concern they are ignored or told to stop imagining things.
Often, children - even gifted children - are written off as intellectually weak or clumsy by well-meaning teachers and education authorities because they do not have the expertise to tell the difference.
Ignoring these conditions does not make them go away.
They just become more problematic for the child, who gets increasingly discouraged and frustrated.
The children's self-image can suffer serious damage and their potential can be squandered.
We have formulated this question and the written declaration to emphasise the enormity of the problem for children with a specific difficulty, for their family and for the community, and to ask the Commission, Parliament and Council to take these children seriously in research programmes, initiatives, guidelines and strategies.
We need to learn more about these 'dys' conditions, how to identify them as early as possible, how to intervene effectively. We also need to learn why a child's developing brain is affected in these ways and how to prevent these 'dys'abilities where that is possible.
We also need to ensure that no-one is considered less important or less valuable because of these conditions.
I would suggest to the Commissioner that many adults also struggle with these specific learning or coordination difficulties but have no name for their condition or real knowledge of it.
Many have come up with elaborate compensatory techniques to get by.
I collected signatures this summer for a citizens' petition supporting persons with disabilities and was amazed at how many adults struggle to even write their names.
People suffer in silence with their gifts and talents hidden even from themselves by these hidden disabilities.
What is the price society pays?
People quitting education and working below their ability because of a problem in one area of learning.
An educational psychologist told me that the tragedy of these children is that many of them would have done very well at university, where they could have worked to their strengths, but failed to get the opportunity as they cannot get through secondary school because the more general nature of the curriculum means that their particular difficulty becomes an insurmountable obstacle to the standard assessment system.
I know one young man who has a specific learning difficulty.
He failed primary and secondary school and had to leave the school system without a certificate but, on the basis of an aptitude test and the recommendation of teachers, he did get into a small college.
Two years later he has proved to be exceptionally gifted in the study of philosophy and has become a popular student leader.
Our education system in Europe tends to be competitive and rigid.
The authorities seem to think this is creating a class of educated, skilled citizens, but this inflexibility - a one-size-fits-all approach - is destroying the potential of countless young people.
This is not good enough and creates social exclusion which can lead many children to become disillusioned and even, in some cases, angry adults.
In Ireland, 76% of the prisoners in Mountjoy Prison have a history of school failure and what are probably undiagnosed learning difficulties.
To ignore these children and adults is clearly discrimination.
I am very proud of this Parliament in the support it has shown for the written declaration, but have one word of caution.
The UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child states that every child is entitled to primary education, but special-needs children are only entitled to the help they need according to resources.
Before we ratify this Convention and introduce it into our strategies, we must examine it very closely.
Otherwise we will bring this fault into our own policies.
Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I thank all those present, especially Ms ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ and the co-authors of the question, because I think it is very important, not only as a question, as a topic for our discussions, but also in terms of action in favour of those who need more specific assistance or treatment or conditions for their life in society, for education, training and so on.
I especially underline what was said at the beginning: that we want to be the voice of those with these difficulties, and I think this is a very strong moral and political commitment.
The Commission is aware of the negative social and health consequences that these problems might have on affected individuals or families raising children affected by 'dys'-related problems.
We agree that measures should be taken to improve the everyday life of children and their access to education, information and culture.
Of course, the main responsibility for dealing with people with 'dys' problems falls on Member States, but the Commission, as well as European institutions, can support the action of Member States.
For example, our Disability Action Plan 2003-2010 promotes access to support and care services for people with disabilities and their families.
The Commission promotes a level of service which strikes an appropriate balance between security, freedom of choice and independence of life.
The Commission Work Plans for 2005, 2006 and 2007 in the field of public health included specific reference to the need for further information and definition of indicators relating to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders, cognitive retardation and disruption of motor, perceptual, language and socio-emotional functions.
Several calls for proposals have been published to support research on 'dys'-related problems.
However, the Commission has so far failed to receive any proposal in these areas.
The Community programme PROGRESS provides support to a number of large European networks, including the European Disability Forum, as you know.
We support the European Agency for Development in Special Needs Education.
The agency provides policymakers and professionals with relevant information on special needs education and facilitates the exchange of good practices.
Special education needs are also one of the general priorities of the Lifelong Learning Programme and, as such, they must be considered a priority for all its actions because it is a general priority.
The Lifelong Learning Programme has a clear aim to integrate people with a range of special needs.
Concretely, this is done through funding cooperation projects to exchange, develop and improve practice in general, including on the design of pedagogical structures in ordinary and specialist education and by offering increased grants to disabled participants to fund any necessary extra support arrangements.
Furthermore, several research projects have been supported by the Commission, including the Neurodys project mentioned in the Oral Question.
The Commission also promotes access to information and communication technology (ICT) and new technology in general for people suffering from 'dys'-related problems.
The ICT part of the sixth Framework Research Programme co-financed projects on e-accessible and assistive solutions.
I just want to mention two projects in this regard: the AGENT-DYSL project, which focused on developing the next generation of assistive reading systems and, secondly, the EU's 'For All' project, which aimed to develop technologies to make education accessible to everyone, including people with dyslexia.
The seventh Framework Research Programme will continue to support 'dys'-related projects or research, including as part of the health priority and as part of the e-accessibility priority.
We recognise the importance of collecting relevant statistics.
This was one of the very strong issues here.
Although the Commission does not currently collect statistics on specific 'dys'-related problems, Eurostat provides EU-wide statistics on disability and social integration.
Following a special disability-oriented labour force survey in 2002, Eurostat is currently in the process of developing an EU-wide survey model.
The survey is part of the European Health Survey System and focuses on disabilities and on various aspects of social integration of people about 18 years old.
We recognise difficulties encountered by people or families caring for people with disabilities, including with those with 'dys' problems.
Following up on our commitment in the Roadmap for Gender Equality, in 2005 and 2006 we launched a consultation with social partners on reconciliation policies.
The consultation covered a broad range of issues, including maternity leave, parental leave, paternity leave, adoption leave and a new type of leave to care for dependent family members.
Having finished the second phase of consultation in June 2007, the Commission is currently engaged in an impact assessment process.
Depending on the outcome, the new proposals might be brought forward, possibly to 2008.
The Commission constantly monitors the transposition of EU anti-discrimination legislation at national level.
Directive 2000/78/EC, which prohibits discrimination in the field of employment and occupation, covers all citizens, including those suffering from 'dys'-related problems.
However, the Commission believes that legislation should offer protection, not only to employees suffering from a disability but also to employees who care for a disabled dependent.
In this regard, we follow with great interest the Coleman case currently pending before the European Court of Justice.
Finally, I really want to say that this is primarily about real knowledge and awareness, and your contribution now is very helpful.
It is a pity that it is so late, just before midnight.
But, after raising proper awareness, I think we could focus more on implementation and concrete actions in favour of those in real need.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for staying so late and for your very thorough treatment of the issue.
I see two other Commissioners in your seat, including the Commissioner responsible for the health sector.
He is responsible for taking action to have behavioural and learning difficulties recognised as health problems rather than disabilities.
He also directs research into early diagnosis and ensures that medical methods for treatment and therapy become specific proposals in research programmes.
This in turn promotes your own education sector by giving special training to staff and parents, and special equipment to schools.
It also promotes new technologies so as to adopt accompanying and assistance measures for pupils with special educational needs.
The possibility of education leads to training and professional reintegration.
I also see in your seat the third Commissioner, responsible for employment.
He ought to take an interest in the measures for access to professional life, social rights and options for social integration.
This is to prevent social exclusion of individuals who are differently able, who have a special characteristic without being disabled.
You have used the word 'disability' many times and have expounded to us all the disability programmes.
Here, however, it is a question of other dyspraxia problems.
We can tackle these without the need for a host of new initiatives; we need no more than a little expense and funding, but mainly just care, organisation and the mustering of best practices already at the disposal of the Member States in a fairly broad sphere.
Legal recognition is a fundamental precondition and allows for access to health and schools as well as to social provision.
The use of technical means and financial aid for parents combine to prevent discrimination against families as well: they suffer from the time when they start to deal with a diagnosis of a dyspraxia problem until its cure.
I hope that our question will give the Commission the opportunity to take action.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is pleasing to see the subject of 'dys'-type disorders, so often ignored, now being raised in Parliament and the fact that this topic has generated a response from practically all the political groups that make up this House demonstrates that for us no citizen of Europe, whatever their problems, should be subjected to discrimination.
Such is the case for 'dys' sufferers, for increasingly sophisticated studies have shown that while this type of disability is still very widespread it is still not being properly identified.
As the only French Member to speak this evening I can pride myself on the fact that France has been fairly active in its efforts to tackle 'dys' problems.
Thanks to the initiative of parents' associations and professional groups, a national day, the first of its kind, is now to be held in Paris on 10 October and it is hoped that this will make the press more aware of the situation of the people, and especially children, who are affected by problems of this kind.
However, the purpose of my question this evening is not to celebrate the positive advances made in one country or another, since there is still a huge amount of work to be done, but collectively to discuss ways in which we might pool the best practices that have been developed at European level, insomuch as certain Member States do not even recognise the existence of this type of disorder.
It appears to me that the call for a European multidisciplinary network to be set up for specific training and learning problems, which is part of the written declaration, goes some way in this direction.
A judicious use of Community actions such as the Seventh Framework Programme would also be beneficial.
In this respect, the initiative that you mentioned, Commissioner, namely the NeuroDys project, which is aimed at highlighting the cognitive, cerebral and genetic origins of dyslexia, and which brings together 15 scientific research groups from nine Member States - and in passing I would like to point out, for this is important, that this body includes practically all the European languages - seems to set a good example because ultimately it appears to me that Europe should lead the world in understanding these conditions and in collecting the biological data that relate to them.
However, it should also set an example in recognising the most effective forms of rehabilitation and therapy so that children can begin to hope again and face life with optimism.
Does the Commission have plans for other programmes of this type in the future?
Commissioner, you referred to a call for tenders that received no response.
It is our intention that the awareness campaign now being waged by the various associations and by the Members who signed the written declaration should perhaps make up for this lack of information and motivation.
We hope that your capacity for mobilising the European funding that is needed to fulfil these expectations will enable the relevant research to be carried out into other 'dys'-type disorders, such as dyspraxia and dysphasia.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, it is quite alarming to learn that 10% of children suffer from dysfunctional disorders.
That means that one child in every 10 either suffers from motor disorders, cannot express their thoughts or cannot do so clearly.
What will the adult population be like in a few years' time?
It will be composed of people who have difficulty undertaking the normal tasks involved in day-to-day living and cannot play a normal part in society.
Can we contemplate treating them as invalids and creating a society of invalids?
That would be unacceptable.
If these conditions can be treated, we must do all we can to treat the children affected, instead of focusing on the prevention of discrimination and social exclusion, because one cannot exclude beings similar to oneself.
I do not think it will come to that.
I believe there are ways to manage the situation.
Finally, I should like to offer my sincere thanks to those who brought this matter to my attention and say that I stand shoulder to shoulder with them.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to start by congratulating the staff and Members who took this initiative of a written declaration and an oral question, and also the Commission for its attendance at this time of night to discuss this issue which, regrettably, not only seems to be a secret issue, an issue for absolute discretion, but also an issue that is completely invisible in certain cases.
Therefore, despite this situation, the fact that we are discussing it today means that we wish to put an end to the invisibility, and so I have lent my support with full enthusiasm not only to the written declaration and the oral question, but to this debate.
I think by and large we all know people who have suffered, and are suffering, from these disorders, which are not illnesses.
Therefore, from that point of view the perception we have in this context is that these are certainly not people who, we might say, require a special service from the point of view of health care for an illness.
All they need is support, specific support, assistance and sensitivity, which must be forthcoming not only from institutions but also from families, teaching centres and especially from society in general.
In my view, the worst thing that can happen in these cases is for discrimination to arise from ignorance in the first instance, from the perception that these people cannot be people who lead absolutely normal lives, although they may need a certain amount of support, and especially from the absence of political willingness and economic resources to implement the necessary programmes to allow these people not just to have, I repeat, a normal lifestyle, but also to allow them as fully capable human beings to contribute their wisdom, their knowledge, their hopes and their dreams to a society that frequently marginalises them and discriminates against them, when they have done absolutely nothing to deserve this.
(PL) Madam President, I should like to congratulate those who have raised the matter of these specific disabling conditions.
The 10% of children affected grow up to become the 10% of the population that has difficulty functioning in society.
Their suffering is greater in adult life.
Today, however, we are concerned with the fate of children detached from society for reasons that are not fully understood.
As children develop, one difficulty generates another, and each complex leads to the next.
'Dys'-type disabilities should be recognised as specific conditions or impairments.
The problems entailed should be explained first to the child itself, and then to those surrounding it, namely parents, friends and schoolmates.
Such children require a special approach and a personalised style of teaching.
The identification and correct definition of these conditions is particularly important when the opportunities for treating them are limited.
Member of the Commission. - (SK) Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the many, very interesting speeches.
I am not an expert on the matter but we need more expertise with regard to this topic.
I am also personally aware of this issue but a much more profound approach by the various institutions and policymakers is necessary to address it specifically.
Many have been put forward here with regard to the fields of social policy, equal opportunities, non-discrimination, health, education, vocational training and others associated with this issue.
The starting point is in fact the interest and desire to change the situation because ignorance breeds intolerance.
That is true of every problem, including this one.
One of the tasks is clearly to align the views on this problem in the Member States and the EU, that is to say in the EU Member States, because no definition exists anywhere, although in some countries there are national days devoted to this issue.
In my view, the definition the United Nations uses in the Disability Convention could provide inspiration for the Member States, but that is a matter for them.
I would like to reiterate what I said at the beginning.
We have several major programmes that can help in vocational and information and communication terms to identify possible solutions.
I am thinking of the education programme, the lifelong learning programme, the research programme and the public health programme.
Allow me personally and on behalf of my institution to thank the team of authors and also others seeking to ensure that people with 'dys'abilities are treated equally and that it is recognised that they are in fact frequently unrecognised and undervalued with regard to their talent, ability and potential.
The Commission has been called upon to be more active on this issue and I would like to say that the Commission is active and willing, in collaboration with Parliament and the presidency, to be even more active than we may have been in the past.
Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that reassurance.
The debate is closed.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (IT) I should like to thank the colleagues who prompted this important debate and the European Commission, in the person of Commissioner FigeÄŸ, with whom I have cooperated on a few previous occasions, for being prepared to note the suggestions put forward by this House.
Even though the health sector is primarily a matter of national competence, I appreciate the efforts being made by the Commission to try and encourage the Member States to adopt strategies enabling people with disabilities to access care and, above all, to lead as normal a life as possible.
The Disability Action Plan 2003-2010 and the PROGRESS programme already go in this direction.
However, it is important to raise awareness among European citizens so as to promote the integration of these people, especially children, into society.
Integration and awareness campaigns against 'dys'crimination in schools, workplaces, sport and everyday life are needed, as is access to the health service, in order that such dysfunctions - sometimes purely physical - do not compromise the personal and working lives of sufferers and their families.

Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 27 September 2007.
Tribute
Ladies and gentlemen, I have the sad duty of informing you of the deaths of a fellow Member and a former fellow Member.
Our fellow Member Fausto Correia died yesterday morning.
He was born on 29 October 1951 in Coimbra and was only 55 years old.
He leaves a wife and three sons.
An illustrious career as a barrister, journalist and then a politician in Portugal followed after he finished law school at university in his home town of Coimbra.
He was for a long time a Member of the Portuguese Parliament as well as Minster of State under Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Guterres.
He had been a Member of the European Parliament since 2004.
Fausto Correia was and remains famous and well-loved in Portugal for his unremitting, life-long mission to establish democracy and his dedication to the core values of fraternity and neighbourliness.
Fausto Correia will be sorely missed by his family, his friends and by us, his fellow Members.
A book of condolences for messages of sympathy from Members and staff of the European Parliament will be open during this week's sitting on Wednesday and Thursday at the front of the Chamber.
It is with great sadness that we learnt of the death of our former fellow Member Christian de la MalÃšne, who was a Member of the European Parliament on two occasions - from 1959 to 1961 and from 1962 to 1994.
Christian de la MalÃšne, who was also a former Minister and Senator under President De Gaulle, died on 26 September at the age of 86.
As a former Chairman of the Group of European Progressive Democrats and the Group of the European Renewal and Democratic Alliance, Christian de la MalÃšne was a convinced European in heart and mind.
He dedicated his long life to a strong and democratic Europe, and a political community.
Christian de la MalÃšne was a colleague and friend who will be remembered for his humanism and his political commitment.
On this note we wish to commemorate him in gratitude.
A moment's silence, please, in remembrance of our deceased colleague.
(The assembly rose and observed one minute's silence).
Statements by the President
Ladies and gentlemen, your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.
Today is not just the International Day against the Death Penalty.
The Council of Europe, with its 47 Member States, and with the support of the European Parliament and the European Commission, has also declared 10 October the European Day against the Death Penalty.
We are very happy that the nurses from Bulgaria and the doctors who escaped the death penalty in Libya a short time ago are with us on this day.
(Sustained applause)
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome very warmly on behalf of the entire House the nurses, Nasya Nenova, Kristiyana Valcheva, Snezhana Dimitrova, Valya Chervenyashka, Valya Siropulo, and the doctors, Ashraf Ahmed Gomma El Hagous and Zdravko Gueorguiev.
Since February 1999 they were forced to spend eight years in detention while awaiting trial in Libya, falsely accused of having deliberately infected hundreds of Libyan children with HIV.
We are opposed to the death penalty.
In the past we have therefore repeatedly called upon the Libyan authorities to release the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctors.
The death penalty is a severe violation of human rights and first and foremost the right to life.
On behalf of the European Parliament, I would therefore like to emphasise our unflinching commitment here to the campaign against the death penalty.
We set great store by it in relations with our neighbours and partners throughout the world.
We thank those states which have just recently abolished the death penalty, particularly Rwanda.
This example shows that even states whose citizens have suffered the most appalling crimes have dispensed with the death penalty as a means of justice.
Another opportunity for promoting the worldwide abolition of the death penalty is the Olympic Games, taking place in Beijing this coming year.
They provide an opportunity to break through the walls of silence, with which China surrounds the exercise of the death penalty.
The European Union has submitted a draft resolution on the death penalty to the United Nations General Assembly.
This initiative, praised on numerous occasions by the European Parliament, is an important step towards the abolition of the death penalty and we appeal in this respect to the Portuguese Presidency of the Council to promote this subject actively at the United Nations in New York.
The European Parliament has held many debates on this issue and only this year adopted three resolutions on the death penalty.
There has been such intensive consultation in the European Parliament on this subject as on no other issue.
We resolutely reject the death penalty, in whatever form and on whatever grounds.
The Member States of the European Union have, on the basis of our common values, succeeded in becoming a community without any death penalty.
The commitment to this is also enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Once the Charter becomes legally binding under the Reform Treaty, we will even be able to say that the death penalty has been abolished in the European Union at all levels.
I am happy and grateful that no Member State of the European Union has questioned the abolition of the death penalty in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or has ever seriously contemplated re-introducing it.
The European Union, as a global player ,is also thereby able to point to this extraordinary achievement in the area of human rights and defend it.
In remembrance of the victims, I would ask you now to observe a minute's silence.
Today, on the European and International Day against the Death Penalty, we, the European Parliament, ask all those states that continue to carry out death sentences to follow our example and abolish the death penalty.
The European Union is ready and willing to offer you its help in doing so.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, I would like to make an announcement and ask for your support.
As you know, our group had decided to hold an Enlarged Bureau meeting in Moscow to discuss the various problems connected with relations between Russia and the European Union with different Russian players - from the government as well as from the opposition.
Unfortunately we discovered that the Russian Government would not be issuing visas to our colleagues and this meeting was not therefore able to take place.
This happened a week after the Subcommittee on Human Rights wanted to hold a similar meeting in Moscow and had likewise not received any visas and therefore this meeting could not take place either.
We find it intolerable that a government described by some Heads of State as a flawless democracy does not allow us to organise a flawless democratic event there in Moscow.
We would ask Parliament to review this and you, Mr President, to support this with a written declaration both to the local ambassadors and to the Russian Government.
(Applause)
Many thanks, Mr Cohn-Bendit.
Out of a sense of conviction and duty I will respond to what you have requested.

Preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government (Lisbon, 18/19 October 2007)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparation of the informal summit of heads of state and government in Lisbon on 18/19 October 2007.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr President, you will understand that, before I refer specifically to the item on the agenda which brought me here today, I should like, on behalf of the Portuguese Government and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, to thank you for such a warm and friendly tribute - so well deserved in my opinion - which you paid upon the such unexpected and sad loss of my fellow countryman and Member of this Parliament, Dr Fausto Correia.
Portugal was shocked at the news because it was news on the loss of someone who was a truly good man and who was, for all of us, an example in the fight for human dignity and for the values we believe in: the values of the rule of law and respect for human rights.
He is certainly a great loss; we should just try, if we can, to follow his example and I am sincerely grateful for the tribute this Parliament has paid to him, which the Portuguese Government of course reiterates.
(Applause)
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, last year I spoke to Parliament about what the Commission saw as the motor of progress in today's European Union and we outlined the so-called 'twin-track' approach - an activist policy agenda and an ambitious approach to the Treaty reform were goals that supported each other.
There was a lot of consensus in that debate, and I think there were three reasons for that.
First of all, it reflects a degree of maturity in the European Union, because Europe today touches on so many areas of people's lives, and this has created expectations.
Retreating into a lowest-common-denominator Europe would be a big mistake.
Second, I think that the challenge of communicating Europe with and to our citizens demanded a fresh approach, with a more profound awareness of how Europe relates to their social needs, their economic aspirations and their underlying values.
Finally, this new approach was based not just on political instinct: it was grounded in the work launched by the Commission in its Plan 'D' for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate, in which so many Members of this Parliament took such an active part.
The informal European Council next week will be the twin-track approach in action.
On the one hand, we should see the heads of state and government concluding the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) and agreeing a new Reform Treaty. On the other, the Presidency has signalled its intention to deepen the debate on how Europe responds to globalisation.
So, to start with the Reform Treaty: we now have a text in front of us and this is a major achievement.
I want to pay tribute to the work of the Portuguese Presidency, as we have to the German presidency, for the way they have moved the process forward calmly and steadily, showing great commitment.
Like my colleague from the Presidency, I also want to pay tribute to Parliament for its constructive role in this last phase.
We have worked well together, and, thanks to Mr Brok, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and Mr Duff, we have a better Treaty, in terms of its provisions on rights and citizenship.
We will also be giving the Charter of Fundamental Rights full status through a formal proclamation.
Remember how many said that an EU of 27 would never be able to agree a treaty text again.
We are on the verge of proving them wrong yet again.
The determination of all of us to reach agreement also points to a Europe with plenty of ideas for the future.
If we agree a deal next week, the agreement to stick closely to the mandate will have been vindicated.
We now have to carry this past the final hurdles.
I am sure that the heads of state and government will be fully aware that an atmosphere of recrimination and dispute at Lisbon would do nothing to help the process of ratification.
Of course, we would have liked to avoid opt-outs, but, if that was the price of making progress with an ambitious Reform Treaty, we have to accept it.
It is the nature of compromise and negotiation.
I would also like to thank Parliament for having responded rapidly and efficiently to the invitation of the European Council to come up with proposals for its future composition.
This is a difficult and sensitive issue for all of you, as it is for Member States, and I would emphasise the need for agreement by both Parliament and the Council.
One last word on the Treaty: political agreement by the European Council is an important step, but, as we all know, it is not the end of the story.
I hope we will be able to work together during the ratification process, seeing it as an opportunity to communicate, to explain and to listen about the European Union.
Where possible, we should coordinate, as the Commission proposed last week in a new paper entitled 'Communicating Europe in Partnership'.
We also need a treaty that is as accessible and understandable as possible, with a consolidated text that should be made available as soon as possible after the conclusion of the IGC.
During this ratification process, leading up to the European Parliament elections in 2009, the delivery of our policy agenda for Europeans will be equally important in setting the mood, and next week, thanks to the Presidency, we will have a debate on Europe and globalisation.
This is very timely: every year it becomes more and more clear that globalisation is central to the concerns of this generation of Europeans.
It touches every citizen in one way or another: the goods and services we buy, the television we watch, the energy we use and the work we do.
The European Union has been successfully developing a policy which recognises the fundamental link between economic success and social security.
But globalisation is not static, as this summer's turbulence in the financial markets showed all too clearly.
We need to adapt constantly to changing circumstances.
Last week, as Mr Lobo Antunes has mentioned, the Commission adopted a paper for this debate that will also set the scene for proposals later this year on reviewing the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.
It argues that Europe must shape up for globalisation in order to deal successfully with the pressure it puts on our economies, our institutions and our citizens, but also to seize the opportunities for greater prosperity, for lifting people out of poverty, for new markets for our products, for closer cooperation and for more sharing of values.
The paper also states very clearly that globalisation is not some irresistible external force of nature, with the EU as a passive bystander.
We can shape globalisation and shape it, to some extent, in our own image.
That is our task: to be confident enough about our values, our vision and the tools at our disposal to ensure that Europe succeeds in the age of globalisation.
