We must commit ourselves to continuing to work towards Johannesburg, in order to fulfil the objectives of the Millennium Summit.
Madam President, as a participant in Monterrey, I too want to say that it was clear that many people are now in no doubt as to how important it is that we in the rich countries should contribute to combating poverty in the developing countries and be involved in securing economic progress in these countries and eliminating squalor.
We must do this for our peace of mind, and we must do this for the sake of world peace.
Efforts must be made across a broad front.
The developing countries must have access to our markets so that they themselves can create the basis for their economic progress.
Sound frameworks for private investment must be guaranteed, but foreign aid in the traditional form of transfer payments is still necessary.
It is disgraceful that, over the last decade, the rich countries have reduced the share of their income that they give to poor countries.
I would therefore praise Commissioner Nielson for the success there has been in initiating an agreement to the effect that the EU countries will increase aid.
This agreement means that the most tight-fisted countries must make a contribution corresponding to the current EU average. The level of ambition must be higher, however.
The objective must in every case be 0.7% of GNP, a figure which most EU countries do not at present meet and which the United States and Japan unfortunately fall still farther short of meeting.
Admittedly, experience shows that there is not always a straightforward proportionate link between the extent of the aid and the results in the shape of development.
That is why it is all the more gratifying that, with Monterrey, a common understanding now seems to have been established that development must take place through interaction between donor countries, NGOs and developing countries so that the developing countries are given responsibility for their own development and so that, as a condition of receiving aid, they guarantee democracy, legal certainty and human rights and combat the corruption that destroys many opportunities for progress.
Madam President, I would like to congratulate the Commission on having persuaded the Member States at the Barcelona Summit to commit to the target for common development cooperation finance for the first time in history.
This is certainly a very modest start to the joint process.
However, I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler how the Commission intends to ensure that the Member States also really commit to this target in legal terms, so that this does not just remain a political resolution, and how you see the Member States sharing the burden.
It is surely the case that the countries that have reached the 0.7% target for GNP - Sweden, Denmark, Luxembourg and the Netherlands - will not pay any more before they see the countries that are lagging behind take responsibility for their share too.
This is all about very large sums of money.
As my fellow Members have already mentioned here today, from 2006 EU countries will need to find an extra seven billion dollars per annum and a total of 20 billion dollars before then.
How do you intend to accomplish this?
It is very important for us to take a longer policy view of the situation already at this stage.
As a result, our group is proposing that at Johannesburg the EU should commit to reaching the 0.7% target by the year 2010.
I would ask other groups to support this target, on which we will shortly be able to vote.
Madam President, like other Members of this House, I too see no reason for excessive euphoria with regard to the results of the Monterrey Conference.
It is true that the Conference produced some small steps forward, especially if we consider the current situation of development funding and if we take account of the very limited prospects that had already been outlined before the Conference.
Amongst these steps, I include, of course, the proposals by the European Union to increase its development aid by USD 20 billion by 2006 and even the annual increase of USD 5 billion that the United States has proposed.
I am also taking account of the fact that the European Union has set, for the first time and in a way that is binding on the Member States, the precise and focussed objective of achieving 0.39% of GDP by 2006 as the Community average and as an interim stage for achieving the objective of 0.7%.
It must be acknowledged, however, that these are excessively limited steps, which fall considerably short of current needs and possibilities.
Moreover, this is the only conclusion that we can draw, given the constant reductions we have seen in the field of public development aid in the last decade, of which all but a limited number of Member States of the European Union are guilty, as if to confirm the rule.
Such a conclusion is also inevitable if we consider the decisions and recommendations reiterated on successive occasions by the United Nations, specifically the objectives of the millennium plan to reduce extreme poverty by 2015, or even the very hopes raised by the commitment given at the Gothenburg Council to achieve the objective of 0.7% as quickly as possible.
It should be added, however, that no measure was adopted on solving the problem of external debt, despite the fact that this is still one of the fundamental parameters of the economic development of the poorest countries, as Mr Mantovani states in the courageous explanatory statement of his report, which we welcome.
In this framework, given the importance of the financial strand, I would say that the results of September's World Summit on Sustainable Development look as though they are going to have a rather more limited scope than we would wish them to have.
Let us hope, nevertheless, that, in this and in other fields, more promising steps can be taken in Johannesburg.
Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work. In particular, I welcome the Community's undertaking to fully cancel the debts of the highly indebted and least developed countries linked to special loans.
Of course, these are only the first steps in what will, of necessity, be a long, major process.
Indeed, genuine debt cancellation is now truly the only possible way to give many of the developing countries the chance to find a way out of the spiral of debt, out of what is known as the debt trap, to give these countries the hope of being able to compete on a global market and the practical opportunity to do so, and to give their people a future in which they can genuinely combat poverty, hunger and illness on a practical level.
Of course, we must demand a commitment from these countries that they will respect human rights, abandon war as a means of resolving disputes and use the funds released by debt cancellation for responsible, monitored poverty reduction programmes, while guaranteeing wider democratic involvement of civil society.
It is therefore worth specifying that the debt cancellation or alleviation measures must not be seen as an excuse to reduce development aid: quite the opposite, development aid does need to be monitored but it must certainly be increased and encouraged.
We must not forget that Europe has a responsibility to provide essential support to the poorest countries of the developing world through a long-term undertaking to help these countries and support them during a process of far-reaching change and economic and social development, in addition to cancelling the debt.
The success of the fight against terrorism, illegal immigration and the trafficking and exploitation of human beings is also dependent on the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and communities achieving a future of peace, progress and economic and social justice.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not really approve of the atmosphere of self-satisfaction that is evident in the wake of Monterrey. Quite the opposite, I feel that Monterrey fell far short of what was required and of the targets we needed to achieve.
We are currently talking of first steps, and it is quite absurd to think that we are still, today, at an initial stage, since the call for 0.7% has been on the table since 1970 and we are now saying that we might be able to achieve 0.3 or 0.31%, and we do not even know when!
Secondly, even more disappointingly, there was not one word at Monterrey about the structural reforms that need to be carried out, from the dismantling of the protectionist policies we apply to our own markets such as agriculture and textiles, to the removal of the US protection of its steel market, not to mention the reforms that need to be carried out in the HIPC countries to facilitate the rule of law and the first steps towards democratic development.
I therefore feel that, from this perspective, Monterrey fell far short of expectations and that we will all suffer greatly for this considerable indifference in the face of such a huge-scale problem, and it will not just be the developing countries that suffer but, I fear, we and our false securities too.
Madam President, I welcome the Commission's decision to cancel the debts linked to special loans but, for the situation in the poor countries to improve, I am afraid that it is not enough for the international financial institutions to adopt initiatives to reduce the debt to what is considered a sustainable level.
They must have the courage genuinely to cancel the debt completely in order to release resources and make economic and social growth possible in those countries, and debt cancellation must on no account be taken as an excuse to reduce development aid.
On the contrary, the principle, established by the United Nations and confirmed by the Brussels European Council last November, of increasing the funds made available to support developing countries to 0.7% of GDP must be converted into a practical commitment, and Europe must proceed in the same way and with the same determination as when it respected the Maastricht parameters and introduced the single currency.
We must establish a precise timetable, stages and monitoring systems to ensure that all the Member States of the European Union respect this commitment, and, alongside this initiative, we must introduce an embargo on the sale of all forms of arms, including light weapons.
This is clear from the Monterrey Conference too.
We need new ways of proceeding: we need to accord the role of the UN due importance and it is right and necessary to extend the G8 to Africa and Latin America, for it is unthinkable that representatives of the countries involved, of the least wealthy countries in the world, should not have a say in decisions affecting them.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall come straight to the point.
We must quite simply cancel the debts of highly indebted poor countries and put in place an arbitration procedure for intermediary countries that are in crisis, such as Argentina.
Most of these debts are illegitimate, as they were arranged by corrupt, even dictatorial governments, and have, in fact, never been used to benefit the population.
The total amount of third-world debt has already been repaid six times over in interest.
What a paradox this is!
Today, the debt repayments made by the countries of the south are higher than the development aid provided by the north.
Having pillaged the raw materials of the south at the lowest possible price, the north is now benefiting from this financial flux and is maintaining its de facto domination, which consequently makes the problem of poverty worse.
We must, therefore, cancel this debt.
However, the money that is saved from doing this must be reinvested, not in arms or in anything else, but in social budgets that will first and foremost improve public services, health and education.
Unfortunately, the Monterrey conference did not tackle this issue in any depth, nor that of introducing a tax on financial transactions.
As for setting the official development aid target of 0.39% of GDP, this is no victory.
We still have a long way to go before we reach 0.7%.
In ten years' time, will we be satisfied with the 0.22% that we have formally committed? No, I think that we must take action now.
We must cancel the debt now. We must grant a great deal more than 0.39% of GDP for aid, and I personally think that the Monterrey conference was a failure.
It was a failure for the European Union, but, more importantly, it was a failure for the countries of the south.
Madam President, although there is eight times as much wealth in the world as there was in 1960, I am sad to say that, even today, one in two human beings still lives on less than a dollar a day, one in five does not have access to drinking water, one in six is illiterate and one in every three children suffers from malnutrition.
The UN development programme and Unicef are responding to these disturbing statistics and they have calculated, for example, that an annual expenditure of USD 80 billion over a period of 10 years could guarantee every human being access to basic education, to basic medical care and to adequate nutrition, to drinking water and to health infrastructures, and, for women, access to gynaecological and maternity treatment: this sum is four times less than the amount the developing world repays in interest on its debt, a quarter of the US military budget, 18% of the amount spent on advertising in the world, 9% of the military expenditure in the world or half the assets of the four wealthiest people in the world.
These are statistics that must make us pause for thought.
In 1999, according to the figures of the World Bank for 2000, the developing countries repaid their creditor northern countries USD 300 billion, the equivalent of at least four Marshall plans.
The European Union must undertake to bring about the alleviation or cancellation of the debts of the poor countries.
The beneficiary countries, for their part, must undertake to establish forms of good government and to channel the money saved through debt alleviation into achieving sufficient standards of fair, sustainable development for their people.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I was not in Monterrey, but I often travel in the ACP countries in Africa, where it is forcefully brought home to visitors how poor countries groan under the burden of debt.
The Cologne initiative on the remission of debt, though, can help alleviate this burden and inject new resources to bring about social benefits.
That is the object of the Council resolution and the Commission communication on the implementation of the HIPC Initiative.
Both of these are covered by the very balanced and excellent report which Mr Mantovani has presented, which sets out the new lines on which we, representing Europe, have to focus.
This, though, will not alter or reform the international financial architecture, for which there is a compelling need, quite apart from the question of how much is available in terms of resources, for there must be a paradigm shift in development cooperation, especially with the poorest countries.
That will not come about if we carry on as before; rather, we too are called upon to change our approach here too.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first, like to express my heartfelt thanks for the constructive contributions that have been made to today's debate, one to which I attach the highest importance, and in which, essentially, two specific issues have been raised, with which I would like to deal briefly.
The first, agriculture, is one that touches on my direct powers.
The observation was made that, in many developing countries, the European Union is killing the farmers.
That sort of comment really cannot be left unchallenged, and I would like to enlighten you a bit about how our import and export situation looks at the moment.
I would like to point out to you that the European Union at present imports more agricultural produce from developing countries than do the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Japan put together.
The other developed states have nothing to reproach us for.
The second point I would like to make to you is that we are a net importer from the developing countries, which means that we import more agricultural produce from these states than we export to them - an immense contrast to the states I just mentioned, which are all great net exporters.
Let me also, finally, point out to you that, in all the major sectors, the European Union's share of agricultural produce exports has declined in the course of the last five years.
I would like to conclude by reminding you that we should at last stop blaming ourselves for things that no longer exist.
If you really must still talk about the massive surplus mountains in the European Union, then I invite you to show me them sometime.
We no longer have surplus mountains.
What we have is balanced production.
The second important issue that was raised had to do with how we intend to ensure that the Member States actually keep to the commitments they make in Council.
On this point I have to draw your attention to the fact that what the Member States have committed themselves to is a general declaration by the Council, no more and no less.
No legal instrument is available to us to actually demand these amounts at law; instead, the only thing we can do when individual Member States fail to honour this obligation is together - the Commission and you in Parliament - to remind those Member States of how important it is that they should do so.
Thank you, Commissioner.
To conclude the debate on the international conference on financing for development in Monterrey, I have received four motions for resolution.
I regret that, due to time restrictions, we were unable to hold a debate on this key report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Community statistical programme 2003 to 2007.
I would like to say, however, that the new statistical programme for 2003 to 2007 is the sixth in its series, which, on this occasion, was submitted to us on time; this was not the case with the fifth programme, which expires this year.
The new programme can therefore enter into force in 2003, because we worked swiftly to give our opinion on the report, and we hope that our co-legislator, the Council, will do the same, that it will not repeat its poor performance on the regulation concerning structural business statistics on which Parliament adopted its position at first reading in June 2001.
The proposal for the programme is good and our committee gave me its unanimous support - it tabled no amendments whatsoever to its content.
We are, however, proposing an amendment which is the same one that we tabled for the fifth programme, namely that in certain areas covered by various Community policies, it is important to have a breakdown of data by gender.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
- (NL) Owing to D66 [Dutch Democrats '66], the Oostlander report on drugs trafficking has been amended in such a way that its scope is now restricted to extensive, cross-border and organised drugs trafficking.
The Dutch soft drugs policy is kept out of the firing line as a result.
Despite this, D66 has abstained from the final vote on the report.
The reason for this is that Amendments Nos 5 and 14 have been adopted by Parliament.
These amendments require the Member States to plough the proceeds from the goods seized in the course of combating drugs back into rehabilitation programmes for drugs users.
However benevolent this goal may be, it is fundamentally wrong in our view to make rehabilitation programmes financially dependent on the results of fighting crime.
We therefore continue to prefer the way in which things are done in the Netherlands, where fines and proceeds from seizures are added to the general resources and where rehabilitation programmes are funded from the general resources.
These amendments contravene the principle of subsidiarity.
Despite the major improvements, we therefore had no choice but to refuse to back the report.
. (PT) Although the joint text that has been adopted contains positive aspects that deserve our approval, it is clearly inadequate.
Nevertheless, if implemented, it could contribute to ensuring greater participation by social organisations and movements and by authorities at local and regional level in formalising and evaluating national action plans for employment.
It is equally important to guarantee, as stated in the text adopted, that a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of the European strategy for employment is undertaken, including a study of its coherence with general economic policy and with other political matters, and a follow-up by the European Employment Observatory.
The most important thing of all, however, is for changes to be made in the European Union's political priorities and for a genuine policy of high quality employment with rights to be pursued with a view to achieving full employment, which is still far from being a reality.
Mr President, you have in front of you a hammer for calling undisciplined Members to order, but you are lucky that it is not a jackhammer!
As you know, jackhammers cause angioneurosis, a serious illness caused by vibrations affecting huge numbers of construction workers.
This document, signed by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, who succeeded in conciliation in winning greater protection for workers who use jackhammers, is acclaimed and welcomed by all the workers throughout Europe who are affected by this occupational disease.
I therefore congratulate you on your good fortune in not being at risk from illnesses caused by using jackhammers and I confirm that I voted for the Thorning-Schmidt report because I feel that it is right for all workers to be protected.
- (SV) We have abstained from voting on Mrs Thorning-Schmidt's report on the proposal for a vibrations directive.
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.
As Swedish liberals, we view European integration as an opportunity to achieve solutions to cross-border problems affecting, for example, the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management.
In our view, worker protection is, however, an example of an area in which the EU should only have limited powers relating to those cases concerning the free movement of people within the EU.
Vibrations in the workplace cannot be seen as a directly cross-border issue.
Each Member State should therefore have complete responsibility in this area, together with the right to set limit values itself.
. Although I voted in favour of this directive I do have some reservations.
Health and safety is of course very important but we must be mindful that we propose texts which are based on sound scientific evidence and research.
Having looked into this matter carefully I could not find any concrete scientific evidence to support the proposal concerning whole body vibrations.
To put an eight hour limit on working on vehicles such as tractors - I am concerned as to the effect it will have on the farming industry by the nature of their work, but am also concerned that this will effect small farmers and those who work in small quarries and mines the most as they will not have the manpower for a workable rota system.
Mr President, this document is on the subject of the European Union Budget: it refers to a considerable sum of money that we did not manage to spend in 2001 and which will therefore be carried over to 2002 for use in the various activities of the European Union.
As I voted for this accounting document, then, a thought and a hope popped into my mind: that this money which has not been used in European Union projects should one day be paid into a European pension fund allowing those who live too long - which is considered to be a drain on Member States' budgets - to receive support from Europe in return for having paid a lifetime's pension contributions.
The Wynn report on the Budget gives me the opportunity to point out that, following our latest debate on the discharge of the Budget, Parliament's services reduced my explanation of vote by 38 words.
My explanation of vote condemned the attitude of Parliament, which now believes that it is powerful enough to renege on any 'gentlemen's agreement' and to interfere in the Council's budget.
The Council would do well to take this warning into account, as the Convention, which is going to discuss the future of the EU, is about to begin.
And I shall end with the sentence that was regrettably deleted: 'Furthermore, it (the Council) would have been well advised to take heed of our warnings, and to appoint representatives of the national parliaments to the Convention, excluding representatives of the European Parliament, or at least, keep them to a minimum.'
As you can see, this sentence was not insignificant.
The first of the two parts of the Draft Amending Budget 2/2002 relates to the budgeting of a surplus carried over from the 2001 financial year, which is the result of considerable underspends of the Community Budget, mainly in the areas of the Structural Funds.
It is expected that the European Union Member States will receive a refund of some EUR 10 billion from the Amending Budget, meaning that France will be reimbursed some FFR 10 billion.
Parliament's Committee on Budgets is proposing to reimburse the States some EUR 5.5 billion; the remaining EUR 4.5 billion will thus cover the various costs incurred during the current year. We can debate whether or not this is a sound proposal, since Parliament is only supposed to give an opinion on the spending proposals envisaged by the European Commission, none of which have yet been made.
It is also understood that, in May 2002, the European Commission will present the definitive balance from 2001 in yet another SAB; the total amount of appropriations to provide for it could therefore be as much as EUR 18 billion.
The second part of the Draft Amending Budget states that, in the light of the Berlin agreements signed in spring 1999 on the European Union Financial Perspective?
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
We have voted against the Draft Amending Budget 2/2002 of the European Union for the financial year 2002.
At the committee meetings on 19 March and 9 April, it was decided that EUR 10 billion of the combined surplus of EUR 14 billion should be paid back to the Member States.
Given that the Budget for 2002 shows a surplus of EUR 14 billion, it is unreasonable that only EUR 5.5 billion should now be transferred back to the Member States.
We do not believe that this decision is rooted in the discussion held earlier in the committee.
Because the Member States are not to get back the sum to which they are entitled, we are voting against the proposal.
We are also conscious of the fact that the sum which is not now being paid out will, in principle, have to be paid out at a later stage.
The Commission has already announced such large payment requirements for 2003 that there is a fear that the figure will far exceed the budget ceiling.
That would entail very high expenditure for the Member States in anticipation of 2003 and 2004 when the budgeting requirements will increase prior to enlargement.
- (NL) My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, champions a high level of care for man and the environment, and is prepared to accept a high tax burden for this.
We are quite prepared to pay good money for high-quality government services in the areas of education, health, public transport and the environment, and these should not be compromised by cutbacks.
On the other hand, we have little or no time for channelling money to military causes, to inappropriate economic growth and to gifts for profit-based businesses.
In general, if tax money is spent close to home by the body which the electorate can influence the most, then this will lead to a much higher quality of services and to greater compliance with the electorate's democratic will than if money is managed by a body which is remote from most people and over which they have no control.
This is why we do not believe that it goes without saying that as much money as possible should be given to the European Union.
In our view, pumping structural fund money around the richest Member States, the current agricultural policy based on large-scale economies, and the ever stronger link with NATO policy are unsound ways of spending money.
Solidarity with the poorest regions, development aid for the developing world and extending care for the environment do, on the other hand, receive our support.
This is why we endorse the distribution of any surplus among existing EU plans and returning funds to the Member States.
Mr President, our group was extremely pleased at the result of the vote this morning.
We now have a much more positive view on reception conditions, in particular, issues such as more rapid and widespread access to education and vocational training, not just education for children.
We welcome the wider access recommended for all forms of healthcare, particularly psychological support for victims of torture and others who have undergone severe trauma.
We are also very pleased that the amendment widening the definition of the family went through.
We are aware that this is something which is very controversial in this House but at long last we are beginning to recognise that the nuclear family is not the only model which is applicable.
We regret that certain Members of this House seem to feel that it is acceptable not to regard those seeking asylum and other forms of protection as having equal rights in terms of social security and other forms of security in the workplace.
I am sure that is something that will also change.
It is a pity that the Council appears to have already made up its mind before listening to the views of Parliament, and that once again we are running to catch up with the process.
I think the Council would treat us with much greater respect if its timetable actually allowed us to give our position before it took its final decision.
Overall we welcome the changes made by Parliament on this particular report and hope that it is not too late for the Council to take account of them.
Mr President, I fully agree with what Mrs Lambert has just said.
It is important for the European Union to concern itself with the asylum conditions of all those who come to Europe seeking assistance and aid.
However, is it right - I ask myself, Mr President - that, as is the case of the southern coast of Italy, for instance, every now and again hundreds and hundreds of asylum seekers arrive and are well looked after by the highly generous people of southern Italy, while no other European Union State supports or funds this aid and assistance activity?
Do you not think that it is time to dedicate a fund to make things easier for the States which lie on the borders of the European Union, particularly the coastal States - Italy, Spain and Greece - which receive more asylum applicants than the other States and which should therefore be supported in this commendable initiative.
Today we are examining a proposal by the European Commission for a directive seeking to lay down minimum standards for the reception of asylum applicants in the Member States.
On the whole, this bureaucratic document is pointless, because if one Member State offered refugees better conditions than another, it would be inundated by applications and would have to cut its benefit payments.
The European system would therefore have automatic self-regulation.
The Commission's proposal also sets high minimum standards, and Parliament has merely made things worse by tabling amendments which, amongst other things, extend the definition of a refugee as well as that of their family.
We fail to deal with some essential questions, such as how much these standards on reception are going to cost the Member States, especially as they will attract a new kind of immigrant.
Have we set aside appropriations and, if so, where?
How can we deter this new kind of immigration, where bogus asylum applicants are working together in structured networks of smugglers and traffickers of human beings?
Given these circumstances, we believe that the Commission's proposal is extremely dangerous, and we voted against it.
We have voted in favour of the report itself because of the clear improvements to the proposal for a directive tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.
We wish, however, to state that political problems associated with asylum must be solved as close to the people as possible and not on the basis of centralised EU legislation.
- (NL) At the height of the Cold War, fleeing from Eastern European countries was something that was encouraged, and refugees were welcome in the West.
These days, an increasing proportion of refugees in Europe hail from the developing world, and we are less hospitable.
Many asylum seekers eventually exhaust every legal avenue open to them and are then excluded from education, income and housing.
This exclusion then becomes an instrument for discouraging newcomers.
Many unfortunate people who have been in the West for a long time are relegated to a life of illegality, as a result of which they have to use criminal means in order to acquire an income, which creates a burden on other people.
It looks ever more likely that the seriousness of the reasons why people flee a country is subordinated to financial and demographic objectives on the part of the receiving country.
As few people as possible needing long-term financial support are received, but more highly trained workers who can fill vacancies for which there would otherwise not be sufficient people available are, in many cases, welcome.
The measures proposed in connection with this item on the agenda would particularly benefit this latter group of refugees.
Despite these restrictions, it is a step in the right direction if children qualify for compulsory education and learn the language of the country, people can find work promptly, the quality of the housing improves and more account is taken of homosexual partners.
.
(PT) The report we have just voted on in some ways improves the proposal submitted to us by the Commission. It is to be regretted, however, that, having decided to create a common asylum policy, the European Union is now confining itself to establishing a set of minimum standards, appearing to ignore the fact that the men and women for whom they are designed deserve all our support, given the wretched conditions that have, as a rule, led them to seek refuge in a Member State.
Moreover, as a matter of fact, we can only reject the aim expressed by the Commission to establish these 'minimum standards' as simply a measure to limit the secondary movements of asylum seekers prompted by the differences in reception conditions between the various Member States.
We are discussing human rights in the European Union.
Is it a violation of human rights to allow an elderly, sick, retired person to live on a mere EUR 500 per month?
Is it a violation of human rights in the European Union - I wonder - that, as is the case in Italy, a widow, after she and her husband have both worked for 40 years - that is a total of at least 80 years - should receive a monthly pension of a mere EUR 25?
Is it a violation of human rights, Mr President, that those - few remaining - war veterans who fought in the Second World War should receive as little as EUR 100 per month?
In my opinion, these too are violations of human rights and we must concern ourselves with these matters in our reports as well.
Mr Van Hecke's report provides an opportunity for us to express our surprise at the press release issued on 22 April by Parliament's President, which comments on the mounting political intolerance in the first round of the presidential election in France.
In law, this press release is an intrusion into the domestic affairs of France and, on the whole, the substance of the press release glosses over the genuine problems.
The far right gained 20% of the votes. This outcome is just one of the symptoms of a profound crisis that political representation in France is currently going through.
This crisis is, in particular, due to the persistent failure, in recent years, of many politicians and institutions to respond to the problems suffered by citizens and their desperate appeals to restore security.
The national institutions and the European Union must, however, be held jointly responsible for this crisis.
So, I call on my fellow MEPs? open your eyes! I have been asking you to do this for years.
We must radically change European politics.
And if you wish to prevent the public from voting as they did on 21 April, we must, at long last, start to give priority to citizens' security and immigration control.
. (PT) We welcome the fact that this report has been adopted.
It opens with the statement that one of the main aims of the European Union must be to uphold the universality and indivisibility of human rights, including civil, political, economic and cultural rights, and, at the same time, acknowledges the responsibility of the United Nations for the maintenance of international peace and security. The report also expresses the view that the European Union must work actively to further strengthen its cooperation with the United Nations and other international organisations in conflict prevention, crisis management, humanitarian assistance, post-conflict rehabilitation and long-term development.
Of equal importance are the report's emphasis that the fight against terrorism must not endanger the protection of fundamental human rights and must be underpinned by international standards in the field of human rights and in international humanitarian law, and its request that the Council and the Member States include State terrorism in their definition of terrorism and its reaffirmation that all forms of forced labour, trafficking in human beings, which amounts to a form of slavery and the sexual exploitation of children are all violations of human rights. The report also demands that the United States of America and Somalia be called on to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Nevertheless, this report contains individual points with which we disagree, specifically the references to the International Criminal Court.
- (NL) I have struggled recently to place Mr Van Hecke on the political spectrum.
From the position of left-wing maverick in the previous Flemish Christian-Democratic Government, he is now on his way to seeking affiliation with the Liberals, which are now Belgium's largest party in government.
Fortunately, I recognise the old Mr Van Hecke in the proposals based on this report.
His unclear political position might well provide him with additional scope to persuade the Right to adopt views which have never been given much priority by the Right.
He does not confine himself to the subjects of child labour, forced labour, sexual abuse and the need to abolish capital punishment in countries governed by authoritarian regimes, such as the United States, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Attention is also focused on terrorism emanating from the developing world and on America's primitive and brutal response to this.
He rightly expands on removing the breeding ground for terrorism and states that the fight against terrorism should not adversely affect human rights.
President Bush's military decree, which allows a secret military tribunal to sentence prisoners, is denounced as contravening the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, while Afghanistan's so-called illegal fighters who are imprisoned on the military base of Guantanamo Bay are recognised as prisoners of war.
This approach receives my support.
. The British Conservative delegation is strongly supportive of Human Rights, properly defined, but abstained on the Van Hecke Annual Report on human rights in the world in 2001 because:
it makes no mention of the need for good governance, nor of the fact that corrupt governments in failed states are often the prime source of human rights abuse;
while we strongly support a ban on the horrendous exploitation and abuse of children as child soldiers in countries such as Uganda and Sierra Leone we cannot support a ban on the recruitment of soldiers under 18 in our own countries;
we cannot accept the incorrect interpretations of the Geneva Convention or the excessive criticism of US actions in its handling of prisoners at Guantanamo when rights of all those held in custody will be respected;
many of our members support the death penalty, moreover decisions on this matter should be a national responsibility;
we do not share the enthusiasm for an International Criminal Court which might so easily become a political instrument and whose jurisdiction over real human rights abusers such as terrorists is unclear.
We often say, Mr President, that we want to promote human rights in third countries.
That is right and we are doing what we can, but I feel that we are not doing enough.
We must turn our words into actions; we must move on from written documents like Mrs DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez' report to action.
To set an example, I call upon all the pensioners who travel throughout the world not to go on holiday to countries in which the human rights of the inhabitants are violated.
Let us take some practical action at last! Enough of words, words, words!
The DÃ­ez GonzÃ¡lez report gives me an opportunity to point out that the last paragraph of my explanation of vote of 20 March 2002 on the outcome of the Barcelona European Council was deleted by Parliament's services.
This paragraph read as follows:
'Point 55 of the conclusions of the Barcelona Council states that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is due to be completed in all the Member States by the end of 2002, but it does not debate whether the people of Ireland are likely to say 'yes'.
Indeed, the new Irish president of the European Parliament, Patrick Cox, has recently stated that he personally intended to conduct a 'yes' campaign, thus placing the code of ethics relating to his position under significant strain.
In this area, however, we have left this code of ethics far behind.'
I do not believe that I could have put it any more accurately, since the President of Parliament has just repeated the same offence in his press release of 22 April regarding the presidential elections in France.
The political interventionism of the European institutions is rapidly taking hold.
First it happens in one country and then in another.
In my view, the next French Government should be concerned by this.
- (NL) Europe is wealthy and powerful.
This wealth and power have been built up over centuries at the expense of countries where hunger, poverty, chaos and lawlessness now reign supreme.
Europe is partly responsible for these problems.
Colonial power has shown how countries can be governed without taking account of the interests, the wishes and even the survival of the population.
A style of government has been passed on for which profit for those in power was the only aim, not the solving of problems experienced by the majority of the population.
This is why interference by Europe can now be experienced in the countries of the developing world as disingenuous, arrogant and neo-colonialist.
It is precisely because of past mistakes, however, that Europe has obligations.
Moreover, precisely thanks to the power and wealth improperly obtained, we are now in a position also to do good deeds.
The proposed code of conduct, in which human rights in developing countries must take priority over economic and other relations with these countries, in which requirements are prescribed for cooperation treaties and in which capital punishment is opposed, is an important step in the right direction.
This also applies to the overview of the human rights situation for each country via an EU agency.
This overview, however, should not stop short of making demands, but should have consequences for trade relations and the reception of refugees.
Mr President, last night I had a dream.
I dreamt that three Members of the European Parliament were enjoying having dinner together.
They were Mrs Maria Martens, Mrs Mercedes Echerer and Mrs Miet Smet.
I suppose there is something in each of them that I admire.
In this dream, Mrs Martens said: 'God and DNA have laid down through the law of nature that there should be complete equality between men and women.'
Indeed, as you know, Mr President, equal numbers of men and women are born into the world: the world's population is made up of 50% men and 50% women.
This is a divine law and a law of nature.
Therefore, what is stopping us adopting a law which makes it a statutory requirement for equal proportions of men and women to be elected, for equal proportions of men and women to be employed and for women to have exactly the same rights as men?
. (PT) Although it is important that we approve the five-year action plan (2001-2006) to put into practice political good intentions in the field of equality policy and of Community development cooperation policy, thereby following on from the Beijing Declaration of 1995 and from its Platform of Action, it is regrettable that this proposal is so late in coming.
Since we know that eliminating inequality between men and women and strengthening the role of women are crucial to social justice and to the effectiveness of development efforts, it is important that we insist that integrating the promotion of equality is not seen simply as a means of promoting the effectiveness of development cooperation actions, but as part of a much broader fight to uphold human rights and the roles of women and men, whose differences must be acknowledged, but whose rights must be equal.
It is equally important that we insist on increasing the financial and human resources to support the actions that have been planned, given that, in 2001, only EUR 2.02 million were earmarked for integrating the promotion of gender equality into development cooperation, as compared with EUR 5 million allocated in 1998.
Reading this report, Mr President, I was unable - I do not know why, it is a rare occurrence - to avoid thinking about an injustice, a form of discrimination against women pensioners which is common in Europe, particularly in the country, so beautiful in so many respects, that is our own, Italy.
Indeed, there are many women pensioners who receive a pension which is an eighth of the size of their husband's pension, of a man's pension, for there is a particular law of the Italian Republic which lays down that if a woman has worked for fewer years than her husband she is to receive a pension which is much, much lower than EUR 100 per month and, indeed, is very often no greater than EUR 25 per month.
This happens because, under a number of different laws, the people who have worked for less time receive tiny pensions.
Well then, I feel that we should do something to combat this discrimination against women.
To draft a report on the Annual Report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union 2000, which the Commission has submitted to us on an annual basis since 1996, could effectively be seen to be closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.
But to enable us to prepare properly for the future, we must be familiar with the past and our history.
That is why our report on the report from the Commission does indeed have a purpose.
As you would expect, I voted in favour of this report, despite the fact that I would have preferred to have some of my amendments approved by the rapporteur and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, in order to set the record straight.
Everyone in the House knows that, in the area of equal treatment and opportunities for women and men, nothing is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.
But in this area, we must not throw out the baby with the bathwater either.
We have an acquis communautaire in the area of equal treatment and opportunities and we, as well as the Commission, are saying loudly and clearly that the adoption of this acquis by the candidate countries is a condition sine qua non for their accession to the European Union.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
. (PT) In the first four years of MAGP IV (1997-2001) the Community fleet was reduced by 2.5% in terms of tonnage and 5.9% in terms of power.
Despite the fact, however, that the targets set in MAGP IV are already relatively modest, some Member States have not managed to achieve them and others have even increased their capacity.
In other words, this report demonstrates the perennial problem: some Member States, such as my own, have met the targets that were set, whilst others have not.
Worse still, these countries have not been penalised in any way for failing to meet their targets.
At a time when we will very shortly be seeing the European Commission's proposals for the future of the common fisheries policy, it is becoming crucial to rethink the MAGPs, because the issue of stock conservation will continue to be one of the fundamental aspects of the CFP, since without fish, there can be no future for fishermen.
It must be stated, however, that all Member States - and not just some of them - will have to contribute to achieving this objective.
This is why the MAGPs - or other measures that have a similar effect - still have a role to play in the common fisheries policy, as long as they contain a minimally effective system of sanctions.
Unless this happens, this or any other system seeking to match the size of the fleet to existing resources will be condemned to failure.
.
(PT) In general terms, the report addresses the issue of the implementation of the MAGPs in a positive way. It highlights the way in which compliance varies enormously from country to country and makes the observation that maintaining the current forms of aid for the modernisation and renovation of the fleets is crucial in order to make the multiannual guidance programmes operational.
Consequently, we will be able to achieve our prime objective of achieving a sustainable balance between current stocks and their exploitation. This issue is particularly important at a time when the Commission wishes to substantially reduce or even eliminate aid for the modernisation and renovation of fleets.
Regrettably, however, the report does not state which countries are failing to comply with the objectives that have been set.
Portugal, as everyone knows, has already exceeded the planned reduction by more than 40%, which is also regrettable, since there are countries that have not only failed to achieve reductions but have even increased their fishing capacity.
It is, therefore, crucial to demand that, in future, countries are not all treated in the same way.
One point with which we cannot wholeheartedly agree concerns the policy of reducing crew numbers, since what we are advocating is renovation, not reduction.
- (SV) Parliament has today adopted a report on the multi-annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleets.
In this connection, Parliament regrets the fact that quite a few Member States have not been able to comply with the commitments made to reduce the fleet.
Inconsistently enough, continued support for measures designed to modernise and renew the fleet are, at the same time, being proposed.
The depletion of fish stocks in our seas is at present one of the most serious and most obvious problems in the ecological system.
The European fishing fleet, which is estimated to have an over-capacity of 40%, naturally contributes to this depletion.
If the objective of reducing the fishing fleet is successfully to be achieved, policy must be radically revised.
It is not possible to continue with the generous subsidies at present being provided, in spite of the fact that it may appear commendable to improve working conditions and improve safety.
The Commission has, on a number of occasions, demonstrated that modernisation and renewal of the fleet also leads to increased fishing effort, which is quite the opposite of what is needed to ensure 'a sustainable balance between the available stocks and their exploitation? which, as the report very rightly points out, is the principal objective of the multi-annual guidance programmes.
Since we were unable to support Parliament's position in this area, we have chosen to vote against the report.
As the Kindermann report shows and as Commissioner Fischler has just acknowledged, the era of MAGPs is now in the past; we will, in future, no longer be able to operate using this harsh, short-sighted and authoritarian method of regulating the fishing effort.
In the new common fisheries policy, we no longer have to implement instruments which prevent modernisation, which are harmful to safety on board and which deter young people from entering the fishing industry.
Yes, we are all aware of the need to manage, through measures implemented by the governments, the finely-balanced biology of fish species. This is the purpose of TACs and quotas, the effectiveness of which we must further enhance by improving the estimates of available resources.
Yes, the fleet capacity must remain stable overall but the current situation must be flexible.
State aid must be made available to carry out fleet modernisation.
Yes, we call for controls that are fairly and generally applied.
We can only express our surprise, however, at the contradiction between the Commissioner's claim that the era of MAGPs is now in the past, and the draft regulation which aims to scrap almost 6 000 vessels, and nearly 1 000 of which will be from France alone, during the 2003-2006 period.
(Explanation of vote cut short pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
It is fortunate that the message sent out by the Barcelona European Council regarding the increase in official development aid gained widespread support in Monterrey.
This message is acknowledgement of the fact that ODA is today one of the few regulatory mechanisms for the financing of public investment, which is necessary so that people can have access to basic services.
However, in addition to questions such as amounts and overall percentages, the European Union must continue to give special treatment to this geographical area, in which we have specific responsibilities for reasons of history.
By making our action more focused, we can only improve its effectiveness.
The EU must not allow the specific nature of its cooperation with the ACP countries to be weakened in the name of a uniform globalisation, in which some would like to see its action to be lost.
It is also evident that the local authorities and associations are developing many privileged contacts with these countries.
We must, in particular, jointly combat the destructive effects of emigration, which is draining these countries of their human skills. We must also restore state control and combat bureaucracy and corruption.
In the area of development, the national element remains wholly relevant and is essential if we wish to establish public policies on sustainable development and the general interest.
- (NL) As a legacy of its colonial past, the developing world has largely become reliant on the sale of cheap raw materials to rich countries.
Agriculture, cattle farming and mining provide the foreign currency to buy expensive industrial products from the EU, the US or Japan.
This exchange is to the detriment of the poor countries and gives them little opportunity of narrowing the gap.
This is why free trade and exports do not solve their problems as long as the former are offset by expensive imports.
Moreover, the flow of profits from the poor countries to the rich countries has always been greater than development aid from the rich to the poor countries.
Under pressure from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, many countries have had to greatly reduce their expenditure in the areas of education and health care and to reduce their taxes on foreign businesses.
Much of what they earn is not spent on further development but on paying back old debts.
The rapporteur and the Committee on Development and Cooperation are right to note that the capacity of poor countries to maintain the most necessary provisions has declined very considerably and that the events of 11 September have only aggravated the situation.
That is why it is necessary to cancel the debts and increase the amount that rich countries provide to poor countries to, at least, a standard figure of 0.7%.
That concludes the votes.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 25 April 2002.
Colleagues, on 6 May Pim Fortuyn, a Dutch politician and candidate in this week's general election in the Netherlands was shot dead in Hilversum.
The same day, on my own behalf and on behalf of this House, I condemned this murder unreservedly and expressed our profound solidarity with the Dutch people and with the victim's family, friends and colleagues.
Freedom of expression is one of our most fundamental and cherished rights - a core value of our democracies.
As democrats we defend the right of every person to participate in political life freely and to exercise his or her democratic right.
That includes the right to express one's ideas, whether or not we like these ideas.
That is precisely the basis of our democratic system.
In condemnation of this, and all acts of political violence whenever, wherever and by whomsoever they are perpetrated, I would like to ask you to observe one minute's silence.
(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)
President.
On behalf of the European Parliament I should also like to welcome the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest.
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is a laureate of the Sakharov Prize of this House in 1990 and a Nobel Prize laureate of 1991. She has always been a figurehead for the fight for democracy, freedom and human rights in her own country in particular.
This release and her right to again lead her party political life is a significant step forward to the establishment of democracy in Burma.
I hope it will soon be followed by the release of Burma's remaining political prisoners.
I heard the call of Aung San Suu Kyi last week for a European Union common policy on Burma.
I expressed the hope on behalf of our House that this release will be followed by the development of such a policy in active cooperation with the European Parliament.
We look forward to welcoming her in the not too distant future in this Chamber to take her place and to speak on her own behalf where, in the past, it was her husband and others who spoke so eloquently for her.
Mr President, I had hoped that we would have the opportunity for an urgency on the subject of the plane-spotters (12 British and two Dutch nationals) who were convicted on 26 April at a court in Kalamata in Greece.
They were given very severe sentences.
I am speaking especially on behalf of my constituents, Paul and Lesley Coppin.
They were found guilty of offences which were not an offence in their own countries.
The sentences were totally disproportionate.
This throws doubt on any ambition to develop an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union based on mutual trust between judicial systems.
It certainly reveals potential flaws in the European arrest warrant.
Mr President, I should like to ask you to express our concern to the Greek authorities and urge them to expedite the appeal process for the plane-spotters with a view to quashing their convictions.
Mr President, I subscribe wholeheartedly to your opinion that we need to be careful as to how we intervene when a case is sub judice, as in the plane-spotters affair.
And I am sure that it is sub judice, that appeals will be lodged and that, whatever people feel about the suffering of members of their constituency, the principle of the separation of powers is too serious a principle for us to call lightly for it to be challenged.
As far as the European arrest warrant is concerned, I really would be terrified if it were a question of Mr Van Orden's arresting me.
I regret that due to the pressure of the agenda, there is only time to discuss three urgent matters.
I endorse the view that Mr Katiforis and yourself have put forward, namely that when we talk about the plane-spotters, we should not interfere in national criminal law policy, but this does indicate, however, that there is good reason for better harmonising the penalty for crimes at European level, particularly in the light of the measures that have been taken in the wake of 11 September.
The Liberals wanted to submit an urgent motion on this matter, but this was unfortunately overtaken by other priorities.
In the case of other urgent business, an urgent motion or resolution is submitted more or less every month, and in this connection, I regret that we do not put a European issue on the agenda.
I will take up this matter while at the same time bearing in mind the need to recognise the separation of powers between the political and judicial authorities.
Mr President, you will be aware of the great sense of shock at the fatal rail accident which took place last Friday at Potters Bar station in Hertfordshire, claiming the lives of seven people and injuring some 70 people.
While the accident investigations are still taking place, this is not the time to draw conclusions, but I hope that, on behalf of Parliament, you will send condolences and sympathy to the families of the bereaved by the way of the British authorities, and also encourage the Commission to continue its liaison work with the rail administrators in safety matters.
This is an extremely busy commuter line; literally thousands of people travel on it each day.
I, with many others, travelled the exact route the evening before.
A few miles up the line is the site of the fatal accident which took place in Hatfield only 18 months ago.
Therefore I believe your initiative in this regard would be greatly appreciated.
I shall do that on behalf of the House.
Mr President, on a point of order, you will be aware that almost one third of the Irish people sent in excess of 1 million cards to Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, calling for the closure of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.
Time and time again this nuclear plant has been found wanting, and most independent experts have clearly spelled out that it is highly suspect and unsafe.
Mr Blair was generous enough to acknowledge these concerns in the House of Commons.
In view of the concerns expressed by the Irish people and the evidence already available to us and the frequent concerns expressed by me and many others to this House, I should like to ask you, Mr President, whether you would undertake in a personal capacity, or as President of this Parliament, a visit to the Sellafield site in Cumbria.
Should you agree, perhaps you might be accompanied by an independent expert who would undertake a detailed examination of the installation and subsequently report back to Parliament.
You are fully aware of the concerns of the Irish people and particularly the people of the east coast in my own constituency of Dublin.
Mr President, I rise in defence of Sellafield British Nuclear Fuels and the workers in that establishment who maintain the highest possible standards in their work.
We are rather tired of our friends across the Irish Sea not remembering which way the prevailing winds blow and having no respect for the vast body of scientific and other evidence which supports the good work that Sellafield does.
I wish our Irish friends would concentrate on their own affairs and not seek to interfere in the internal affairs of another Member State.
Mr President, I just want to remind Mr Chichester, apropos of the earlier exchange on Sellafield, that my constituents along the east coast of Ireland, and in particular County Louth, are very concerned about emissions from Sellafield, especially marine emissions in Carlingford Lough which are rising steadily.
BNFL were present at a hearing in the European Parliament in April and had to confirm under cross-examination from me that emissions were currently rising from Sellafield.
This has a serious impact on another Member State.
Indeed, we heard at the hearing of the impact on the Isle of Wight of emissions from Cap de la Hague.
My own constituents and European citizens generally are right to be concerned at the impact of such nuclear technology on their own Member States.
We heard in detail from, amongst others, the UK nuclear inspectorate chief Lawrence Williams, who attended the hearing.
Mr President, during her period of office, Mrs Fontaine introduced a rule, at the express wish of this Parliament's plenary, according to which speeches designated as points of order are to be made after the vote on the agenda.
Must I conclude from the practice you have introduced that you are again changing this rule and that, before every future plenary, I shall have to worry about what matters raised in my constituency I am to talk about here at 5 p.m.?
I believe this issue is of great interest to countless other MEPs assembled here who do not come from a certain part of the world.
Perhaps you could let me know.
(Applause)
Mr Kuhne, your point is well made that we should deal with the agenda first, which is precisely what I did.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure do not allow further proposals for the topical and urgent debate to be tabled at short notice.
Our delegation for cooperation with Georgia was in Georgia last week.
Since local government elections are taking place there on 2 June, we have enquired as to whether these elections are being conducted correctly.
We have learned that two parties have already been denied permission to take part in the elections, and we have also learned just now that a further party, namely that of the former president of the Parliament who left the Shevardnadze Party to found a new one, is also not being allowed to participate in the elections.
We should simply like to state the fact openly here and then, naturally, discuss the matter with the Commission and the Council.
We consider this a matter of great urgency, even though our May part-session does not allow any more urgency debates, for the local elections will already be over in June.
We are of the view that a reminder needs to be given about this.
We should like, however, to be given still more precise information by the Council and the Commission, for we are extremely concerned that elections are being held but are not being conducted democratically.
We should like to support Georgia's cause, but the bottom line is that democracy must prevail there.
I should like to have this recorded in the Minutes.
The Minutes will so record.
Mr President, I rise to request that you write to the Indian authorities again about the case of Ian Stillman, the British deaf charity worker who was imprisoned in India, convicted of drug smuggling.
As you are aware, he was not provided with sign language interpretation at his trial.
I am grateful that you wrote in the past, but last week his leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was turned down.
The lead judge remarked that disabled people and deaf people are prone to carry drugs, which I thought was absolutely disgraceful.
I would be grateful if you could write again, and also use your good offices in relation to the plane spotters.
The issue here is one of the government and the judiciary, but of the government and the security services.
Mr President, thank you for ensuring that Parliament respects its precedents. In line with these precedents, I feel that it would be appropriate to pay tribute to the victims of terrorism, especially since they came from one of the Member States of the European Union.
It would appear appropriate for this House to pay tribute to the victims of the attack in Karachi, who were from Cherbourg, although that is not my constituency.
It would appear appropriate for us to pay tribute to those victims and to the wounded, and to send our condolences and a message of support to their families.
You are right, Mrs BerÃšs. We will do so.
Mr President, I would like to say - in relation to your intention to deal with the agenda in a moment - that it really does seem inadequate to dedicate only one of the items on the agenda for the debate on topical and urgent subjects to the situation in Madagascar.
What is happening in Madagascar is something much more serious which warrants much more than fleeting attention.
As you are aware, Mr President, President Ratsiraka's position was confirmed following the political elections, but all attempts to reestablish democratic relations with his opponent, Marc Ravalomanana, are being thwarted.
What is more, civil strife has led in recent days to the ports and transport coming to a total standstill and food supplies being completely cut off.
Many children and elderly people are already dying of starvation.
I know that the resolution we are to debate on Thursday afternoon - that will inevitably be an intimate conversation between a few friends, as is always the case - will focus mainly on politics and the economy.
Mr President, this is a question of respect for human rights.
The alarm has been raised by a community of sisters - Italian and French nuns - who have been the object of a disturbing increase in unwanted government attention, not least, in recent days.
In other words, there is a danger that a climate of oppression and suppression of human rights will develop: this is a question of more than just economic issues.
I would therefore urge you to give this issue a more appropriate slot on the agenda.
Mr President, I understand that a bill to amend the Criminal Code has been tabled in the Slovakian Parliament, introducing imprisonment for anyone expressing sympathy with Communist ideas.
We condemn outright this attempt to criminalise Communist political action and, what is worse, in the run up to elections in which the Communist Party of Slovakia is expected to win seats in Parliament.
Obviously the immediate objective is to terrorise voters.
We also condemn outright the parallels drawn between Communism and Fascism in this amendment, the way in which criminals and victims and tyranny and resistance are all painted with the same brush, especially at a time when far-right forces with Fascist tendencies are gaining ground in Europe.
Given that Slovakia is a candidate country, I should like to call on you to intervene and put a stop to these developments.
Mr President, on 24 April, during the Brussels part-session, our fellow Member, Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen was prevented from holding a press conference inside the European Parliament; two of our fellow Members were hit in the face by a pie.
Well then, I am not, of course, defending Mr Le Pen, who I expect is quite capable of defending himself; I am not, of course, saying that I support or do not support his political ideals - if there is anyone in this Parliament who can be counted on to vote differently from the rest of the House it is precisely the radical Members - but that this is a question of upholding Parliament's dignity.
According to the European Union's Voltairian principles of enlightenment, we should fight to the bitter end precisely for ideals which we do not share.
It is therefore unacceptable for those Members of Parliament who might be considered by some of us to be fascist, communist or radical not to enjoy rights which are available to other Members.
This is a serious incident and we must respond to it with specific measures and, I would advocate, an internal inquiry as well to find out how this can possibly have happened. This is for the good of us all, certainly not just the good of Mr Le Pen.
Mr Cappato, for your information and that of the House, on the evening on which the incident to which you refer took place, I asked at the Bureau that an inquiry be made into the matter.
The results of that inquiry will be considered today at the next available Bureau meeting.
The next item is the report A5-0125/2002, by Hanja Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on supplementing the Rules of Procedure by a list of Parliament documents directly accessible through the register (2002/2055 REG).
By 3 June next, the Council, the Commission and Parliament are required to have fully implemented the European Government Information Act, in other words the Regulation that grants access to documents.
For the European Parliament, this means that the list of Parliament documents which will be directly accessible via the register, will need to be appended to Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
This additional Annex requires approval by a regular majority of the Members. The debate on this will take place today and the vote will be held tomorrow.
The list that is before us is for the most part the result of an accurate and legal application of the Regulation.
A team presided over by Parliament's Deputy Secretary General has drawn up the initial list.
In the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, a small number of documents have been added whose public access is not compulsory, but desirable.
I would mention the working documents, recommendations and statements of parliamentary delegations - which did not feature on the original list - the attendance lists of the plenary and committee meetings - which are, in fact, included in the Minutes and are, as such, already accessible to the public indirectly - and the list of staff of the MEPs.
As rapporteur, I support these additions, which are also partly my own.
As far as public access to the staff list is concerned, I take the view that this will, moreover, need to be in line with the Bureau's decision of 11 June 2001, in other words Members and staff will need to take it upon themselves to add their names to the public list.
I hope that the entire list can be approved in that way.
Restrictions that do not comply with the Regulation, however, cannot be accepted, because otherwise the European Court of Justice will be instructing us to add to the list again and Parliament will have lost face.
With this list, the European Parliament has met all the obligations concerning the Regulation's implementation.
Does that make everything shipshape?
Unfortunately not yet.
Neither the European Commission nor the Council have, in our opinion, met all the conditions for implementing the Regulation.
Especially where documents of third parties are concerned, for example documents of Member States or of external organisations, things could be arranged more effectively.
As far as foreign and defence policies are concerned, although the Regulation has precedence over the Solana decision that was taken at the time, no final solution has yet been found for confidential and secret documents.
This too will need to be provided for.
In general, public access to third-party documents still poses a major problem, because in this respect, particularly the Commission and the Council are more rigid than required.
In fact, Member States that still have no proper legislation in the field of public access are urgently required to lay down legislation in this area themselves as soon as possible.
Objections which are still being raised by some Member States will then become redundant.
It is unacceptable for public access vis-Ã -vis citizens in one EU country to be far greater than in another, and it is wholly unacceptable for a lack of public access in some EU countries to undermine the implementation of this Regulation.
I therefore call on the Commission to produce a directive which obliges all EU Member States to apply more transparency and allow public access.
And I will certainly make this point at the Convention on the future of Europe, of which I am a member.
Finally, it strikes me as important that we should not wait too long before this Regulation is evaluated.
We have made huge progress with this Regulation, but quite a few aspects still need defending. The initial evaluation will take place at the end of this year, and I hope to be involved in this again.
Those ultimately reaping the benefits of this Regulation, however, are our own citizens.
They will, especially via the Internet as well, be able to call up much more information than before. This will benefit Parliament's reputation and that of the European institutions, and it is also particularly valuable for the democracy in Europe in general.
Mr President, a key role of this Parliament is to put the spotlight of parliamentary scrutiny on the dim recesses of the Commission and the even dimmer nooks and crannies of the Council of Ministers.
Our credentials for doing so will be immeasurably enhanced if our own house is in order, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, on her very open approach to this issue.
We must ourselves be as open as possible.
I would like to draw attention to two particular issues from my perspective as vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions.
I support the report when it says that petitions should only be made publicly available with the consent of the petitioners.
For most petitioners that is no problem, since they want as much publicity as possible, but there are occasions when they need confidentiality.
For instance, if I may cite the Lloyds of London petitions, one of the so-called Names was told that if he complained to Parliament or the Commission, then any financial compensation being paid to him by Lloyds could be withdrawn - a very serious threat indeed.
I cite that as an example in the public domain, but there are others.
That we have to push for more transparency with other institutions remains clear.
Again to quote the example of the Lloyds petitions, the Commission last December announced that it was considering infringement proceedings against the British Government.
The British Government responded to the Commission's letter of intent on 30 April, the very last day available, but still the Commission and the British Government refused to allow Parliament or the petitioners to know their response.
I condemn that secrecy on the part of the British Government and the Commission, and I want them to be absolutely transparent, which is why we must shame them into transparency by being open ourselves.
Mr President, in the discussion on the topic of democratic deficiency in Europe, transparency is one of the crucial concepts.
The European population has an image of a non-transparent and undemocratic Europe, where decisions are taken behind closed doors.
With the establishment of the European Convention, a very important step was recently taken towards an open and democratic Europe, partly thanks to the open dialogue which that forum enters into with organisations from civil society.
It is hoped that the Heads of Government will take the Convention's recommendations seriously at the forthcoming IGC, and that a break can be made with a long tradition of backroom politics when treaties are established.
After all, we want to move towards a transparent form of European decision-making.
Access to documents forms an essential part of this transparency.
Indeed, the exchange of information is the driving force behind the public debate in the media, public control and contributions by public organisations.
This is why we, as the European Parliament, have been fighting for some time for public access to documents - not only documents from the European Parliament, but also from the Council and the Commission.
My fellow MEP, Mr Cashman, in tandem with Mrs Maij-Weggen, has done a great deal of sterling work on this during a previous phase, and we are now in the follow-up phase.
It is important to continue this fight until those documents of the European institutions which are currently still considered non-public are available to those who are affected by them or those who are simply interested in them.
Mrs Maij-Weggen was right to refer to a number of aspects surrounding the Solana decision which have not yet been translated effectively into a wholesale replacement.
She rightly pointed out that we want to extend the list to include a number of aspects, such as the attendance list, and that we do not want any restrictions, and we support her in this.
In addition, the idea to lay down a directive - probably by adopting the minimum approach, for subsidiarity must be recognised as such and each country is to define this for themselves, so that each citizen in their own country has a minimum level of certainty with regard to access to documents - could be a very useful contribution.
At the same time, we know that the Council is still finding it very hard to take its legislative decisions in public, and this would fit in very well with this continued struggle.
I am speaking at a time when we in Europe should all be acutely aware of the importance and power of our democracy, but also of its vulnerability.
We must vigorously respond to the anti-European currents which are pervading many countries, and we must do so with one voice.
This is only possible, however, if - for a change - we opt for actually reducing the distance between ourselves and our electorate.
The citizen must be informed more quickly and more comprehensively of legislation that applies to them, particularly the entry into force of legislation, so that their interests can be taken into consideration in good time.
For example, I would suggest placing adverts in major newspapers in every country, in which the citizen is informed in clear terms of the significance a decision has for them, and which provides them with information on where they can express their protests.
What will actually help the European project and our work as parliamentarians along is not only information and documents that are available passively and remain within the circle of experts, but a European citizen who is informed directly and pro-actively.
I would thank Maij-Weggen for her contribution, and I look forward to a fruitful cooperation, also in the follow-up phase on this score of providing information to citizens across Europe.
Mr President, what we are discussing now may seem like a dreary, formal list, but it is in actual fact incredibly important and is a crucial prerequisite in the constant battle for increased transparency in the European institutions.
Transparency is the area in which Mrs Maij-Weggen manifestly excels, and I wish to congratulate her on her work.
It may be observed that Parliament takes the lead when it comes to efforts to open up our institutions.
Our documents and activities are openly available to the people of Europe.
We are an open institution with open meetings.
I believe that we are one of the world's most transparent parliaments, both through our conscious commitment to formal decision-making and through unconventional methods such as the 'Open Up Europe' initiative taken by a number of liberal MEPs or the decision to put MEPs' financial interests on the Web in accordance with the name and shame principle.
Through methods such as these, transparency can be achieved.
What is happening in the European Parliament can now be followed on computers from northern Finland to the Greek islands.
There is, of course, a lot more to be done, however.
It is also a question of ensuring that there are clear rules so that access to documents is not dependent upon discretion or the sympathetic interpretation of an application.
The register is therefore an important tool for ensuring that people know what applies and how they can appeal.
The document should perhaps make clear what further increased openness it is leading to.
How in fact are documents from third parties or Member States or those forming part of an official correspondence to be dealt with?
There is scope for interpretation in these areas.
I hope that Parliament's employees in general will interpret all applications generously and that we shall soon have reports on how many applications are rejected.
Access to documents and across-the-board transparency are prerequisites for confidence in the EU's activities.
I really do hope that the Commission and the Council will have their registers in order by 3 June and that, shortly after that, we can begin the evaluation which is prescribed by Article 255 and which is to be ready in a year and a half's time.
Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen for having drawn up a complete list of those documents the European Parliament must make directly accessible to the public.
I want to say that Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m is absolutely right when she says that transparency can and must extend from Finland to Greece; this really is no longer just a Nordic concept.
I would, however, like to say that our new regulation on transparency perhaps incorporates just one feature which is a very Nordic tradition, which is that there are registers of documents.
For a long time, people in Finland, Sweden and Denmark have been able to go, for example, to the municipal registrar's office, the public register, and see what sort of documents were held there - and, obviously, they still can.
Now we have the Internet and we can introduce this process in the European Parliament.
We can only hope that all the institutions agree that we should endeavour to create one single document register in which documents from all the institutions are indeed directly accessible for as long as possible, and in this way we really will be making decision-making more transparent.
We must, however, realise that this will still be a great struggle for us.
This week we are having another very important debate on this subject, as we are discussing with Mr Solana the issue of Council reform and transparency, where we will have to defend, for example, the broad definition of legislation.
We cannot settle for a situation where only documents connected with the codecision procedure would be accessible to the public, but must try to ensure that all documents that relate to different decisions binding on Member States are accessible.
I particularly want to thank the rapporteur for having included a list of Members' assistants, as they carry out public duties in their capacity as assistants to the Members of Parliament.
It is high time we pointed out that these names are not secret; they are not secret individuals, and their names may indeed be made known to the public.
Parliament thus also takes the view that, while, on the one hand, the protection of privacy is obviously important, on the other hand, the common interest and the right of access to information also require names to be made public, subject to certain conditions.
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen.
However, as regards the future, there may be something missing from the list of documents to be made public, for I feel that the question of audiovisual recordings is fundamental and that we should make increasing use of them in Parliament.
In my opinion, we should make it compulsory for audiovisual recordings to be made of committee work as well - the costs are not excessive - and then treat the recordings as documents to be made public and made available on the Internet.
This is a key point.
Our meetings have to be public under the Rules of Procedure.
However, this is only the theory: we know that, in practice, a European citizen walking into Parliament off the street would not be allowed to attend our meetings without an invitation.
Publishing audiovisual recordings of our work on the Internet is a key form of publicity for our institutions.
Moreover, with the Stenmarck report which we are going to debate tomorrow, we are already addressing the issue of budget cover from Parliament's point of view.
I will tell you now that, tomorrow, together with 55 Members of all the political groups, we are going to table a resolution calling, not least, upon the members of the European Convention to introduce a Treaty reform enshrining the right of access to all the public meetings of our institutions in the Treaties: the right of access, including access via the Internet, to all the meetings and democratic instruments of the European Union.
I feel that this is the way to go, for it will enable Parliament to fully exploit new technologies to publicise its work.
Mr President, the word 'transparency' already has a noteworthy career behind it.
If, today, you go into modern search engines, you find 223 000 examples of its German equivalent in less than ten minutes.
No one would confuse the words 'transparent' and 'perspirant'.
'Transparent' is what your shirt may be, while 'perspiration' is what is sometimes seen under the arms.
If you search for 'transparency' and 'European Parliament' you find just 908 examples and, if you ask people out and about what they associate with 'transparency', they say it is what we still do not want to make transparent.
Moral: transparency which does not also bring the right people out in a sweat is worthless.
If this report now talks in terms of a milestone's having been reached on the road to more transparency in the European Union, that is something I would contest.
It is more than just nothing, but it is not much more than a pebble.
What we really need is transparency that is actually experienced.
A European transparency initiative - of the kind I have talked about on a number of occasions in Parliament - is in the process of being developed.
It goes beyond the self-congratulation syndrome of the European institutions and is aimed at making, if at all possible, all documents - even those in which people are really interested - publicly accessible.
On the basis of Regulation 201/204, we urgently need this examination that has already been talked about.
If we are concerned to be credible rather than hypocritical, I think our aim must be to do everything we can to copy the freedom of information act in what will hopefully be a future United States of Europe.
We can also learn more from Sweden in this area.
We all of us know that there is no democracy without transparency.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission, like the European Parliament, generally attaches great importance to the transparency of its activities and therefore to the rules on access to documents laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.
The commitments made by the Commission in this area support this statement and, of these, I would like to remind you of the commitment relating to the communication to this House of the so-called commitology documents, a commitment which goes further than our obligations laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001. This confirms our will to move forward and make greater progress, both in terms of transparency and in terms of interinstitutional cooperation.
I am sure you will agree with me that this cooperation is particularly important in the field of access to documents, given the complexity of our working method and the interaction of our activities; and it is precisely within the framework of this interinstitutional cooperation, organised by means of the already established interinstitutional committee, that the essential mechanisms must be agreed for consultation with the institution originally responsible for the documents whose disclosure is proposed.
Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, turning to the specific issue which is the subject of this debate, the Commission welcomes and supports Parliament's initiative in relation to direct accessibility of documents.
Nevertheless, insofar as the report presented by Mrs Maij-Weggen proposes the disclosure of a list of documents from other institutions without including any mechanism for prior consultation of the other institution, the Commission prefers that it make a general reference to documents communicated by the other institutions in relation to the rules in force and the procedures agreed to provide a framework for communication, instead of establishing a list of communicable documents.
In our opinion, this sufficiently guarantees both the objectives of Parliament and the Commission in the field of transparency and compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 in relation to which - as I pointed out before - we are already taking steps which go beyond what is required.
In any event, I would like to thank and congratulate Mrs Maij-Weggen on the work she has done as well as all the other speakers.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken at 12 noon tomorrow.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading A5-0134/2002 by Jacqueline Foster, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security (15029/4/2001 - C5-0033/2002 - 2001/0234(COD)).
Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States gave new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security.
The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA, instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed.
The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and was amended at first reading.
However, the attached technical annex, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference, ECAC, Document 30, was not amended until second reading due to the fact that the high-level group had been updating the annex which was only finalised last November.
Whilst Parliament responded speedily to that challenge, and I thank colleagues from all parties for their support, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position.
Throughout this process, I have met with representatives from the Council and the Commission and consulted widely with the industry.
The draft regulation principally concerns access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement.
The scope does not extend to onboard security which may need to be addressed at some future date.
The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in its Document 30 part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 which, as already mentioned, has recently been updated.
ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States.
It is worth pointing out to Parliament, and perhaps the Council, if there is anybody there, that this agreement reached by the 38 countries, will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties.
Document 30 previously had been used for general guidance only.
The outcome of the Council of Transport last December was more than disappointing, as all the amendments supported by Parliament were rejected in the common position.
Nevertheless as rapporteur, I took a decision to re-table all amendments which had been adopted and shall touch on five areas which are fundamental to Parliament's position.
Firstly, Member States must assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks and recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens.
These attacks were against the Nation States.
I have submitted an amendment to this effect, and I am now pleased to say that there is cross-party support for this measure.
Secondly, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected in real operating conditions, as is currently the case in some Member States.
Thirdly, whilst recognising that some Member States and indeed a minority of MEPs reject the measure of 100% screening of staff, I insist that this is a pivotal point in this legislation.
It should be said that some Member States already implement this measure.
Terrorism has taken on a new dimension.
It is misguided to believe that there should be lower standards of security for staff working in restricted areas in airports than for passengers.
History has shown us that, over the last 30 years in the vast majority of cases of terrorist acts, such as hijacking and incidents such as Lockerbie and 11 September, lax security measures and personnel who have had unfettered access in airports have played a significant part.
I am pleased to say that the majority of MEPs in committee overwhelmingly supported this amendment.
Fourthly, it is vital that, as is the current practice in IATA and ECAC, the aviation industry itself is involved in the implementation stage of this regulation, not least because it would ensure that measures are practicable and operationally viable.
Fifthly, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes.
Finally, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects of 11 September on the aviation industry and tourist sector.
Around a quarter of a million directly related jobs were lost worldwide and some fifty thousand in the EU alone.
Not only big businesses were affected, but thousands of small businesses as well.
This report is not the sole solution, but it is an enormous step in the right direction, providing that Member States recognise their obligation to protect their citizens by accepting their responsibility to contribute financially to these additional security measures and taking urgent action to restore public confidence, which would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole.
I urge the Council to listen to Parliament.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, on behalf of my group, to express my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur who has not only done a vast amount to familiarise herself with this complicated material - indeed, she is a veritable expert on it now - but has also tried as far as possible to make some excellent proposals.
We are very disappointed with the Council, though.
When, in December, we tried to find a common approach at first reading, it proved incapable of talking with us at all.
In the last two weeks as well, when, following the committee discussions, the rapporteur again tried to reach agreement with the Council, the latter was again unable to oblige.
I have to say that it is shocking that, in a situation following 11 September when passengers are in danger, the Council is unable to quickly reach an agreement with us.
We have a counter-example.
Just a few weeks ago, the Council and Parliament together took no more than three months to find a practical solution to the issue of restrictions on airport operations due to noise.
The fact, however, that, on as important a matter as that of passenger safety, the Council is unable to reach an agreement with us is disgraceful, and we need to say so in no uncertain terms.
I also hope that, if we vote as one tomorrow, the Council will have second thoughts and will want to join with us in finding a solution through the conciliation procedure.
I would also appeal to the Commission too to tell the Council that we have done everything to reach an agreement with it.
The Council was unable to oblige, and I now expect the Commission to support the vast majority of our amendments at least.
The Council must see Parliament and the Commission acting together.
Allow me to make two observations.
Firstly, it is very important that the Member States acknowledge that they have to bear some of the costs of the increased security measures.
It is simply not acceptable that, at public expense, the police in my country patrol and oversee every football match, from which the professional clubs do not earn such a bad living, while the Member States do not wish to make their contribution to the cost of increased security measures at airports, which are in the interests of everyone and not only of the airports.
That is simply not on.
We expect the Council to accommodate us on this crucial point.
The second, somewhat critical question - and one addressed by Mrs Foster - is that of whether employees really need to be vetted 100%.
My group shares the rapporteur's opinion, but I for my part take a different view of this issue. Allow me again to point out that, unlike passengers, employees are in principle vetted before they are taken on.
If they were then to be checked up on five or six times a day, then that would be a bit too much of a good thing.
We have to realise that, important as security is, there must also be practical arrangements at airports and for the passengers and airlines that use them.
I therefore hope that we take a different decision tomorrow.
Those who committed these criminal acts on 11 September were not airport or airline employees.
My group also regrets the Council's obstinacy in finalising legislation concerning the establishment of common rules for security in aviation.
Everyone is agreed that it is of great importance that this matter should be brought to a prompt close.
The events of 11 September represented a very pressing reason for this.
The same strict rules must now apply across the Union.
It is therefore beyond belief that the Council should be reluctant to accommodate the wishes of the co-legislator, the European Parliament, and that as a result, we should be forced to table so many amendments at second reading.
My group supports the rapporteur, Mrs Foster, and we too believe that the central issue concerns a transparent and coordinated system that funds the necessary security measures.
Distortion of competition must be avoided.
There are at the moment still too many discrepancies between the Member States where security measures are concerned, particularly the funding thereof.
The Commission should promptly develop proposals in this respect.
In these proposals, it should aim for the highest possible level of security.
Additional expenses which the new rules entail, if they put the operation of certain airports at risk, should be reimbursed, whereby, however, the principle applies that in the medium term, the costs must be borne by the users and the sector.
The measures to be drafted should be based on the ECAC recommendations.
In our view, following existing practice will promote streamlining.
We also support the principle of random inspections.
These have a preventive effect. And this is in line with the view that, with regard to security, as few compromises as possible should be made.
Exceptions should be kept to a minimum.
This is why we support the rapporteur's proposal to delete item 4 in Annex 3.2, where it is made possible not to screen all staff.
Needless to say, we do not consent to the creation of this exception.
So far, the Council has appeared unsympathetic to our requests to strike better deals on security as well as security measures with third countries too.
This is rather strange, for leaks in the new system can be sprung in precisely those areas.
In Europe too, countries can be found where it is possible to escape security measures in flights to the EU.
It happened to me twice that I stepped onto a plane in an Eastern European country without any security or bomb control.
Finally, a point that we have mentioned many times and also have to repeat on this occasion, is that we fail to grasp why the Council is opposed to granting the competition authority the possibility to carry out evaluations.
It is, in our view, important that an amendment is once again tabled on this subject.
Mr President, on behalf of the ELDR Group, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Foster, for the excellent way in which she has drafted the proposal with regard to this important matter.
We still have a number of unresolved issues before us on which we should try to achieve a balanced result which suits everyone.
As has already been said here before, the Council, for its part, has not done its homework sufficiently well and has not considered or discussed Parliament's proposals at all thoroughly.
It is therefore reasonable for our committee to propose that some key amendments be revised even though we are now on the home straight.
Our group has tabled Amendment No 34 to Article 4, which concerns legal provisions for small airports. Flexibility is needed here.
The amendment makes the wording more specific in such a way that at the same time it increases flexibility with regard to the types of aircraft being used.
I would also ask Members to consider whether that form of wording achieves a compromise that suits us all with regard to solving the problem of small volumes of air traffic without incurring enormous costs.
Secondly, I want to emphasise the importance of Amendment No 8, which concerns announced inspections.
It is important.
If there is a constant threat of an EU inspection, standards tend to be kept up.
However, if an inspection had to be announced, everything necessary to improve security for air travel would not be done beforehand.
In addition we have to ensure that matters drawn attention to after the inspection are actually put right.
Our group has worked on the assumption that it must be taken into account in dealing with these matters what it is reasonable to do at EU level and what it is better to leave to the Member States' own discretion, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.
For that reason we are not very keen on amendments that mean increased costs without, however, significantly improving security.
Action taken must be in proportion to what is reasonable for each country.
The same goes for monitoring, where it is only sensible to take account of the particular circumstances that apply.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Foster for her magnificent work and the professionalism she has shown throughout these months.
As you all know, less than a month after the tragic events of 11 September the Commission proposed, through this initiative, to toughen the security requirements applicable to civil aviation in a harmonised manner and, when this proposal was sent to Parliament and the Council, it was considered urgent to reach an agreement in relation to it.
Parliament agreed with this urgency and therefore acted by focusing on the main provisions of the Regulation and left aside the technical annex which was based on the work of a specialised body, the ECAC (European Civil Aviation Conference) and particularly on its document No 30 on air security.
Now that the text has been analysed in more detail, the Commission understands that the Committee on Transport is proposing 33 amendments to the common position.
Last week we attempted to reach a compromise on the issue between Parliament, the Council and the Commission and, as Mr Jarzembowski and Mrs Foster pointed out a moment ago, unfortunately that has not been achieved.
The Commission insists on the urgency of this document.
If an interinstitutional dispute arises, I fear that we could find ourselves in a deadlock.
I would therefore ask once again for a spirit of compromise, both on the part of the Council and on the part of Parliament, so that, before the summer, we can finally resolve this issue.
I would like to stress something that I have said on other occasions, and that is that the Commission will always carry out its work as a mediator, seeking agreements.
I would classify the amendments in four categories.
The first category, which is aimed at tightening the rules on air security, is the one containing the greatest number of amendments and we can accept practically all of them.
Furthermore, Amendment No 8, which requests surprise airport inspections, is acceptable in principle.
It proposes that airports should not be warned of inspections, but the Commission would like the inspection to be carried out with the knowledge and cooperation of the national regulatory authorities, as happens in the case of competition inspections or agriculture.
That is to say, the national regulatory authorities would be informed but not the specific airports.
We believe that that would provide the appropriate balance.
Amendment No 16, which has the Commission's support, deserves a special mention.
It deals with the requirement that all staff should be subject to controls on accessing security areas.
The Commission agrees that air staff should be subject to the same controls as passengers and not to lower levels.
We should remember that many terrorist incidents have resulted from a lack of security within airport installations.
The aim of the rapporteur's Amendment No 20 is to increase security.
In this case the Commission believes that it would very much complicate things without really yielding concrete results and, for this reason, we must reject it.
The Commission generally rejects the amendments in the second package, which try to reduce security standards.
I am talking about Amendments Nos 6, 13, 17, 27, 30 and 31 and in particular No 6 and No 13.
The first is aimed at increasing the number of airports exempt from harmonised Community rules, by raising the threshold for the size of aircraft.
Since the Commission has not been provided with any indication of the number of additional airports which would be exempt from the Regulation if this amendment were adopted, we reject it, since it introduces a legally unknown situation.
We also reject Amendment No 13, which proposes delaying the entry into force of certain elements of the Regulation by twelve months, since all of the security rules in the Regulation are based on rules approved by the ECAC, which all the States of the Union belong to.
We believe that its application should not be delayed even more, but that, on the contrary, it is urgent that the Regulation be applied as soon as possible, as Mr Jarzembowski said a moment ago.
The third group of amendments is aimed at extending the scope of the Regulation, which explicitly lays down the obligation for Member States to fund additional security measures and be responsible for them.
The Commission is sympathetic to these arguments - I would like to make this very clear - and in particular Amendment No 7 on the equitable funding of additional security costs.
But these amendments are not appropriate in this Regulation, and do not fall within the scope of Article 80 of the Treaty, which is its legal basis.
Furthermore, in the event that it were possible to include rules on additional funding in this Regulation, those rules would not invalidate the superior Community rules on state aid which are still applicable.
Therefore, the Commission formally rejects Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12, although it is willing to examine the issues raised from a broader point of view, including the need for greater organisation in the field of the funding of investments in air security.
If necessary, after carrying out a detailed study, the Commission is willing to present a legislative proposal, but in a separate form and not within this Regulation.
Finally, the Commission completely accepts all those amendments aimed at improving the Regulation from a grammatical point of view, while maintaining its content.
Therefore, Amendments Nos 16, 19, 21 to 26, 28, 29, 32, 33 and 34 and Amendments Nos 14, 15 and 18 could be accepted after certain textual changes.
The Commission and the European Parliament generally share a very similar position in this field.
Both of us believe that good basic harmonised standards are necessary for security in civil aviation and that particular emphasis should be placed on this Regulation.
Once approved, the proposal will represent a very important step towards guaranteeing a high level of air security throughout the European Union.
Parliament, and in particular Mrs Foster, through her magnificent work throughout the production of this report, is making a very significant contribution towards achieving this result.
What we also need now is a cooperative attitude on the part of the Council and to finally achieve amongst all of us a compromise which allows us to move forward and which prevents the blocking of an issue which we must resolve as soon as possible.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is urgent that we apply harmonised rules as soon as possible in order to guarantee greater security in all airports and throughout the European civil air transport system.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0122/2002), by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position of 19 December 2001 for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services and amending Council Directives 90/619/EEC, 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC [12425/1/2001 RIV.
1 - C5-0697/2001 - 1998/0245(COD)]
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is, for me, a much longed-for day.
As long ago as the middle of 1999, I was appointed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market as rapporteur for the second reading of the directive concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services.
We in Parliament were conscious of the urgency of this directive.
We wanted to be prepared at any time for the common position.
We then had to wait almost three years, however, hoping that the many attempts by several presidencies would at some point prove successful and that the Council would be able to come up with a common position.
If I now propose that Parliament make only minimal changes to the Council common position, then I do so not because the long wait for the common position has worn me down but because I am deeply convinced that the Council common position is a good compromise and that the Council has moved a long way from its original starting point and done a lot to accommodate Parliament and its objections to the content of the draft directive, raised at first reading.
I must also take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for the first reading, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten.
I think that her report has significantly improved upon the draft directive.
Many of her changes also had to be adopted by the Council and the Commission.
In the explanatory statement forming part of my report, I provided a very comprehensive list of the points on which the directive has now been changed following the first reading in Parliament. I should like here just to list a few important points, as follows.
The relationship to the directive on electronic commerce was clarified. The relationship to the Brussels II Regulation and the Rome Convention was clarified.
The text might perhaps have been further improved, but the relationship is now clear from a legal point of view.
The directive applies to all consumers. The restriction to consumers 'resident in the territory of the Community', criticised by Parliament at first reading, has been dropped.
The list of information to be provided prior to the conclusion of the contract - a central point in the directive - includes all the points called for by Parliament and, in some cases, goes further than the latter.
As a lawyer, I have attached particular importance to the fact that the compulsory cooling-off period originally provided for has been dropped.
The right of withdrawal is now a general right and does not now exist only under specified conditions.
The directive provides for a period of fourteen days. Previously, in the Commission's draft, it had been seven, whereupon Parliament requested thirty.
These fourteen calendar days seem acceptable, however.
The consequences of withdrawal have also been determined in line with the European Parliament's requests at first reading.
The biggest discrepancies, here in Parliament too, naturally revolve around the issue of principle concerning whether we should harmonise on a maximum or minimum basis.
This is, of course, not the first time that we are arguing in Parliament about these two principles.
Albeit by a narrow majority, the European Parliament opted at first reading for the concept of maximum harmonisation.
In the Council, there was, on the other hand, originally a very large majority in favour of the universal application of minimum harmonisation.
If, in theory, maximum harmonisation now forms the basis of the common position and the Member States can only apply additional regulations in specific, precisely defined cases, that seems to me to be the only realistic compromise.
In a legal environment in which, for example, we still do not have full harmonisation either in contract law or in the substantive European law governing financial services, no other decision can be made in this directive.
If it is then to be determined upon whom, either the consumers or the suppliers, the risk of an alien legal system is to be imposed, I think it is still the consumer who has more difficulty bearing this risk, more difficulty, certainly, even than smaller suppliers.
The directive now provides for a situation in which the risk borne by smaller suppliers and the costs incurred by them are reduced through the Commission's providing them with information concerning additional stipulations in the Member States.
When it comes to all those of my fellow MEPs who, through their amendments, have signalled that they are not prepared to compromise and are insisting that maximum harmonisation and the country of origin principle be put fully into effect, I should like, finally, to appeal to them also to consider what would happen if we were to end up in a conciliation procedure in which we would probably not succeed in finding this politically very sensitive and very elusive balance.
In the end, we might possibly have no directive, and we should then be in the situation in which we are at present, in which the country of destination principle directly applies.
We should then be very far, in terms both of content and of timescales, from the goals which, both independently and in conjunction with the Commission, we have set ourselves in the Financial Services Action Plan.
In conclusion, I would therefore again appeal to you possibly to withdraw further amendments by way of a compromise or, as far as possible, to refrain from agreeing to amendments.
Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Klaus-Heiner Lehne, who is the shadow rapporteur for our group.
It was important for him to attend the meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that is taking place now.
It is unfortunate that those clashes cannot be taken into account in scheduling these debates, because this is a major piece of legislation from our committee.
I wish to thank Mrs Berger for a very comprehensive and thorough piece of work and for being very persistent in presenting her arguments to us.
It must be said that our group - and I hope many colleagues will agree with us - has tabled a number of crucial amendments to this directive.
We believe they reflect the overall balance of opinion in this House about the importance of maintaining an entirely consistent approach to our work in this absolutely crucial area, and a consistent approach to the work of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in the areas of electronic commerce and in creating the internal market as a whole.
I suggest that we in this House have been entirely consistent.
It is the Commission and the Council that have moved away from the direction that my colleague Mrs Oomen-Ruijten established at first reading.
In the e-commerce directive we established the principle of country of origin as being crucial to e-commerce transactions.
In our work on distance marketing of financial services, where we robustly supported the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we followed that line as well.
The whole project of creating a single market - an internal market for financial services - is one of the most important projects we are working on at the moment in terms of meeting the Lisbon objectives and creating the sort of dynamic economy that we must have across the European Union.
The distance marketing of financial services directive does not just apply to e-commerce but is crucial in terms of moving to a single cross-border market.
But what do we find?
We find in the proposal from the Council that the 15 Member States will be able to vary requirements on two crucial elements: prior information given to consumers and aspects of the right to withdrawal from contracts.
What sort of single market will we create?
What sort of signal will we be sending to the Council and to the market outside if we accept a proposal from the Council that allows 15 different sets of conditions to go forward?
I suggest to you - and I hope this House will take forward our recommendations - that when we vote tomorrow we should not accept this compromise.
It is not satisfactory.
Conciliation is the only way to resolve it, but we must be consistent with the principles of this House.
I ask you, on behalf of the group, to support those amendments.
Mr President, Mrs Berger has produced an in-depth piece of work and has, I think, got to grips with this subject.
The purpose of the directive is to set up a single legal framework for distance marketing of consumer financial services by supplementing existing sectoral regulations and plugging the gaps in the general directive on distance marketing of consumer goods.
This directive will improve the working of the single market and offer consumers greater protection.
The question of maximum or minimum harmonisation is still a bugbear and naturally voices have been raised in disagreement.
My impression is that the problem could be resolved by adopting or at least allowing for specific regulations to be adopted on certain matters.
Maximum harmonisation, taken together with the Commission's obligation to tell providers about various national regulations is helpful in a way, especially to small and medium-sized financial service providers, because it cuts providers' information costs and increases transparency.
This principle has also been retained on the important issue of the right of withdrawal, with the exception of life insurance and old-age pensions.
The 14-day period represents a compromise between the seven days initially proposed by the Commission and the 30 days for which Parliament lobbied.
There are also uniform rules on the method for calculating such periods.
This uniform approach to the right of withdrawal reinforces transparency and legal security in the internal market.
One crucial point which needs to be highlighted is that the common position clarifies the fact that this directive needs to take account of Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce, at least as far as the transactions regulated by it are concerned.
I think that recognition of the country of origin is vital and should not be overlooked.
In all events, despite its remaining shortcomings, the common position will fortunately go a long way towards satisfying the positions of the European Parliament.
I agree with the rapporteur that the directive should apply immediately, which is why we need to avoid time-consuming amendments to individual regulations.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mrs Berger, whom I should like to thank for the large amount of work she has done, has once again clearly regenerated the traditional fight in this Parliament for more or less harmonisation.
It might be useful to remind ourselves of the fact that in the original Commission proposal, maximum harmonisation was very much the main objective in terms of distance marketing of financial services.
The Council, on the other hand, took a completely different view.
Needless to say, a great deal can be said for the Commission's original position.
It was undoubtedly the best solution, both for providers of financial services and for the consumer.
The division in Parliament, however, makes it impossible to secure this best solution.
Moreover, in its common position, the Council would like to introduce exceptions to the principle of maximum harmonisation. This is unfortunate, for national provisions can indeed constitute barriers to the establishment of the internal market.
Only complete harmonisation guarantees equal competitive conditions between the institutions and instils consumer confidence in services that are offered by other Member States.
The exceptions to the principle of complete harmonisation can seriously hinder e-commerce because service providers are thus obliged to take account of provisions enshrined in the fifteen different legal systems.
I should also like to emphasise that the principle concerning the right of the country of origin will on the whole apply when there is no complete harmonisation.
This will be extremely detrimental to some institutions because the legislations are very different in the area of restrictions.
By way of conclusion, I can therefore state that maximum harmonisation is still the preferred solution, but it once again appears that politics is the art of the possible.
And a bird in the hand might be worth two in the bush.
To put it more clearly: it is better to have a second-rate solution than no solution at all.
Mr President, our rapporteur, Mrs Berger, has very convincingly shown that the Council common position contains a considerable number of Parliament's demands from the first reading.
I would now just mention here that any directive, for example, in response to Parliament's demands, would apply to all consumers and not only those that live in the Member States.
Furthermore, the demands for information that service providers must make available correspond very closely to Parliament's demands, and this and other things mean I am quite prepared, on behalf of my group, to appeal to Parliament not to commence legislative conciliation regarding this matter but adopt this common position, which in many respects is very satisfactory.
It might be said that we have now made a good start with regard to guaranteeing consumer protection in the internal market in financial services, and we can definitely go further in this at a later date.
It is quite proper that the principle of minimum harmonisation is now being applied. That provides a guarantee that, as no Community act has yet been introduced to cover all the issues and considerations involved, Member States may deviate from it and go a little further.
I do not believe that the internal market will come to any particular harm as a result.
The cross-border sale of financial services is now definitely under way, and in the early stages this will represent a very good level of consumer protection.
Mr President, it is very difficult to sum up this topic.
It is a course of events that baffles me.
Why?
Because it is not Parliament that has adopted different positions on different occasions, but because the European Commission and the Council have suddenly moved from maximum harmonisation to minimum harmonisation.
And I would invite Mrs Hautala and Mr Beysen to change this topic too.
Politics may be the art of the possible, but if this way of going about things does not benefit the financial services sector nor the consumers, then I think that we should make a different choice.
Allow me to give you another rundown of events, for you will then be able to judge for yourself.
And I would ask you to bear with me.
In May 1992, the draft directive on the marketing of financial services was submitted.
This original draft included financial services; so it comprised all distance marketing plus financial services.
This met with a great deal of resistance.
Eventually, the common position was drafted, from which the financial services were deleted.
This happened in 1995.
The European Commission was in agreement with this.
Parliament attempted at second reading to reverse this situation, but unfortunately lacked a few votes to do so.
Then, a Green Paper was published in 1997.
Parliament once again opted for incorporating financial services in this directive.
We voted in favour of this.
The Commission subsequently presented a draft directive in which it rightly proposed maximum harmonisation.
Why maximum harmonisation?
Because the consumer, wherever he may make his purchases in Europe, should be able to do so subject to the same rules, and must be given the same guarantees.
Moreover, this also benefits the financial sector.
What transpired?
In the common position, minimum harmonisation was all of a sudden opted for.
This minimum harmonisation will create a great deal of frustration within the market, as fellow MEPs have already pointed out.
I therefore call on you, all of us, to revisit very carefully the first reading of this proposal in Parliament - for which I happened to be rapporteur - and to vote on this proposal after all and also to present it to the Council after all.
I have understood that the Council too may have changed its opinion in the mean time.
What is now before us, despite the heartfelt concern displayed by Mrs Berger, will, in my view, not lead to anything.
And I have the feeling that a huge number of fellow MEPs, not only in this group, but also in other groups, will join me in voting out anything that is cloaked in minimum harmonisation, allowing us to start proper negotiations with the Council.
Mr President, Mrs Berger, I think that your work is outstanding and I can only urge you to pursue it. I hope that Parliament will have the wisdom to stay close to and, to all intents and purposes, in line with the Council's position.
I feel that it is a sensible position and that we need it urgently.
I do not share Mr Harbour's point of view that conciliation would be the best path to take.
Every day, we see further progress in the development of distance financial services, and we see the positive and negative effects of this in terms of cost to the economy but also the risks to which consumers are exposed as a result.
From this point of view, the common position adopted by the Council is sensible; I feel that it takes Parliament's position into ample account and maintains a satisfactory balance in dealing with the principle of the country of origin, which enhances consumer protection.
The crucial point is clearly Article 3(4).
I feel that, if Parliament were to upset the balance achieved by the Council, we would be doing more harm than good, if only because we would be delaying the potential entry into force of this urgently needed directive.
The solution found concerns the potential conflict between pre-contractual information and the information contained in the contract, specifying that the pre-contractual information must comply with the provisions of the contract itself.
This is a sensible requirement and we support it.
This article does not cover all pre-contractual information: it relates purely to the information regarding contractual obligations and its sole purpose is to ensure conformity between the two sets of information.
Once again, this is a sensible step which we fully support.
Lastly, I believe that the Commission itself has fully acknowledged that the agreement achieved by the Council is compatible with the previous texts on e-commerce.
We support the Commission's point of view, of course, and we trust that Parliament's wisdom will prevail.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem we are discussing is not Mrs Berger; the problem is the Council, and the discrepancy that we experience so often, between that which is aimed for and what actually results.
The Commission and the Council have set themselves and Parliament the goal of creating a coherent legal framework for electronic commerce, which is intended, over the coming years, to substantially push forward the integration of Europe's financial markets and enhance the capacity of Europe's financial services sector to compete across the world.
It is my - and our - opinion that this Common Position by the Council on the proposal for a directive on the distance marketing of financial services does insufficient justice to the endeavour to create a single European internal market.
The great gulf between what we ask for and what is implemented is to the detriment of all parties concerned, including, I believe, the consumers.
The objective that this proposal for a directive has in view - the guaranteeing of a high level of consumer protection in order to safeguard the free movement of financial services - means that the Member States should not be given the option of implementing other - perhaps more extensive - provisions in the areas harmonised by this directive.
I will give one reason why I call for this.
Recognising the possibility of withdrawal from contracts with effect from the moment they are entered into is not compatible with the provision of immediate cover, which is much in demand on the part of customers in the field of non-life insurance.
The regulation envisaged could have adverse effects on the services on offer to consumers.
An internal market requires harmonised regulations, and the objective must not be undermined by means of regulations which differ from one country to another.
We therefore ask you to adopt our amendments.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Berger for having done a great deal of meritorious work, and also my fellow MEPs for their contributions.
Much that has been said has been very much to the point, and, in order to avoid repeating it, I wish to limit myself to just one aspect of the directive.
The attempt is being made to make consumer protection a reality principally by the means of two instruments, rights of cancellation being one and extensive requirements to provide information, advice and guidance the other.
It is immediately apparent that consumers are protected by rights such as these.
On the other hand, this does have its drawbacks - as must of course often be the case.
Do consumers read the information?
Do they take it on board?
Do they understand it?
Do they really cancel, or is it not possible that they are led by it to too free a use of their signatures and a consequent inability to extricate themselves?
On the other hand, it is in the interests of the business world and of the legal profession for contracts to be durable, and - to take the example Mr Karas has just given - their becoming immediately effective may be in the interests of the consumers themselves.
The reason I say this is that, from these points of view, consumers are afforded better protection where provision is made for the statements they make to be authenticated by a notary.
The procedure itself includes a warning in that the consumer has time to think things over, but, secondly, it involves advice from a third party, one outside the proceedings and obliged to be neutral, and, indeed liability if - as may of course happen - the right advice was not given.
At the same time, though, it combines these points with the advantage of the durability of a deed or contract, and the provision of legal certainty.
In these respects, as a whole, I see this as affording the consumer better protection where - as I have said - provision is made for this.
That is of course not always possible, and certainly not in the day-to-day retail market.
That is why, in my opinion, you should follow the principle that, where national legislation makes provision for consumer authentication, this must suffice, being the better way to protect consumers.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has requested the floor.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, please let us not re-open the debate!
I expect you will, however, wish to put a question to the Commissioner.
Mr President, you have just said that this is a debate, but this was not a debate.
For fourteen minutes, I have been listening to a virtual speaking dummy that stated why certain amendments are to be welcomed or not.
The Commissioner has not in any way explained why he calls for maximum harmonisation four times over, but has instead taken fourteen minutes to tell us that a number of amendments that seek to establish exactly that, need not be adopted.
He has not responded to what has been said here in the plenary session.
Good.
We will vote on the matter tomorrow and each Member will, as a number of Members have said, act wisely.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0143/2002) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer [14854/1/2001 - C5-0070/2002 - 2001/0006(COD)]
The next item is a directive that is known as the insolvency directive, but it naturally concerns a directive on the protection of employees, the social protection of employees in this case, when the employer becomes insolvent and when there are insufficient financial resources, or none at all, to pay outstanding wages.
The insolvency directive offers employees valuable protection when their employer is in financial difficulty.
The existing directive is Directive 987 of 1980.
Clearly, the insolvency directive prevents employees from having to do battle with creditors for outstanding payments.
Instead, they can avail themselves of the provisions afforded in this insolvency directive.
It is a revision of a directive, which, in this case, means that two very important changes have been made, the substance of which we are satisfied with in any case.
The changes mean that part-time workers, employees on fixed-term contracts and temporary workers will fall within the scope of this new directive.
This is based on directives that have been in existence for these employees for some time and that have been brought about in a social dialogue.
They cater for a new category of employees and it is important that we pay attention to this, certainly against the background of what is developing in the field of more flexible labour and the need for this, given the processes such as those in the framework of Lisbon, etc.
Secondly, with regard to situations in which businesses carry out activities in various countries, it is made clear where and in what way the directive is applied and in what state.
The significance of this is obviously considerable, because, slowly but surely, we can see the impact this has on employees, not only in Spain, such as last year in the company Telefonica, but also in German firms, such as Holzman and Kirch.
In 2001, the number of unemployed in Europe rocketed on account of insolvency cases alone.
In total, 1.4 million people faced these problems due to bankruptcy sustained by their employers.
Needless to say, this is linked to many other factors.
A number of the European Parliament's amendments were already adopted at first reading - we are now discussing the second reading.
This was particularly true of those concerning limiting the possibility of excluding categories of employees and of no longer applying thresholds in the form of a minimum duration of the contract of employment, whereby remuneration in accordance with the directive would not apply until expiry of the contract.
In addition, it was already acknowledged that the chapter on the organisation and financing, Article 5 in the old directive, would be accepted.
Subsequently, in consultation, the Council added that agreement was also reached on the de facto situation of insolvency and it was also agreed that an employee can lay claim to unpaid wages from a fund, insofar as this is provided for in national legislation.
Eventually, further to this second reading by the Council, and its common position in particular, agreements were also reached about whether or not ceilings should be set per se.
In the light of ever-changing labour market developments, it is important for us to have enquired about all kinds of new categories of employees which have been referred to in discussions for some time and in respect of which we would, in fact, like a definition of the terms employer, employee, self-employed, self-employed without staff, etc. Accordingly, we had asked for this directive to be applied to a number of self-employed that had not been mentioned before, such as self-employed without staff, employees with a training contract, home workers, etc.
We wanted to avoid conciliation if in this respect, we received the assurance from both the Commission and the Council that this entire process, which relates to the legalisation of this situation, would be accelerated. Eventually, it was agreed that the Commission will carry out a study into what are referred to as 'new forms of work and labour relations' in the Member States and the candidate countries alike.
This is a huge step forward in my view.
In addition, we agreed that, if this study is published, which will be the case any time between now and six months' time, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the European Commission will be jointly organising a hearing to discuss the study and subsequently to examine whether, and to what extent, directives, framework directives and suchlike need to be drawn up in order to settle these issues.
I would like to repeat that I have clearly indicated that we refer to the need for new and extensive European labour legislation, certainly against the background of a more flexible labour market.
I would like to make one brief comment on Amendment No 6 that we have withdrawn, for the very simple reason that, in the light of the Council's common position, it is not central.
I would once again like to thank the Council, the Commission and my fellow MEPs for the cooperation that has helped us avoid ending up in the follow-up procedure - the conciliation, and managed to reach sound agreements nevertheless.
I look forward to statements by the Commissioner.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Bouwman, ladies and gentlemen, in the majority of normal cases, the main - and often the only - source of resources necessary to sustain the salaried worker and their family is the income generated through their work, that is, their salary.
Therefore, with the salary protection system, as well as the mechanisms to facilitate, in a privileged fashion, the payment of salaries from the real assets of the debtor employee, the legislator creates a specific guarantee of the payment of salaries under the responsibility of the public system, often structured around a public administration body, in cases of employer insolvency.
This was the main objective of Directive 80/987/EEC: to guarantee within the Community a minimum level of protection in the event of employer insolvency.
It is true that the application of this directive met with very many difficulties, both in relation to the definition of the concept of insolvency for the purposes of the directive, the need to set limits in relation to the time period and amount of responsibility and the increasingly frequent consequences of transnationality - as the rapporteur has said - and globalisation, as well as the need to adapt this directive to other previous directives and the need to simplify the rules relating to the payment of salaries owed, and all of these are difficulties which the modification is intended to overcome.
The modifications of the text of the common position strengthen the objective of worker protection, laid down in the directive, and I believe that they represent considerable progress.
We still need to define, with the necessary clarity, certain concepts which need to be more precise - possibly due to the fact that social reality is almost always a step ahead of legal reality - such as the concept of the worker, so that it includes all real forms of employment, the problems resulting from productive decentralisation or externalisation, the concept of the role of salary or work dependence in relation to economic dependence, and also that of the proper use of the guarantee institution.
However, on the whole, we should be pleased that we have reached this point.
I believe that the concern of the Commission, Parliament and the Council during the Spanish Presidency demonstrate that it is possible and feasible to create 'more Europe' and furthermore shows the candidate countries the direction they must take in order to achieve a more social Europe.
I therefore believe that I should end by congratulating the rapporteur, despite the fact that, strictly speaking, not all the desirable objectives have been met in theory.
Nevertheless, surely the possible is the enemy of the ideal and, now that we are so close to the 52nd anniversary of the date on which we can say that Europe began to be built, perhaps we should say that Europe is being built slowly, step by step, but we should also stress, Commissioner, that the social dimension is finally taking the place it deserves in this Europe we want to see.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on the excellent way in which he has handled this piece of work.
It was adopted unanimously in committee and, thanks to his adept handling of the matter, it seems set to be finalised through an informal conciliation under the Spanish presidency.
That, as he has said, depends upon a clear commitment from the Commission that a declaration will be included in that informal conciliation to cover the situation of economically dependent or subordinate workers - not a very elegant description, but we all know which workers are meant.
We all know the problem: full-time permanent workers, the core staff in many enterprises around the European Union, are becoming less and less numerous, with concentric circles of less formal employment relationships surrounding that core.
The current directive will extend insolvency protection to part-time and fixed-term contract workers, but what about temporary agency workers?
What about self-employed workers who are in a position similar to employees but who do not have an employment contract?
What about workers working zero-hour contracts which are becoming more popular in certain parts of the European Union?
This is all part of a broad approach which, for us, is about balancing flexibility for work places, enterprises, and a degree of security for the workers working within and moving between those enterprises.
We, in the PSE Group, firmly believe that only in that way will all working people embrace the process of change.
Otherwise a barrier will be put in the way of that process of change.
The recent agreement on a directive on working time for long-distance drivers, which will include self-employed workers, shows us a possible way forward.
The Commission, as the rapporteur has said, must commit itself to completing the study it has under way, a joint hearing with Parliament and then legislative or other action to follow that hearing.
For us as well this is about an overall proactive and socially responsible approach to the management of industrial change.
We in the PSE Group have called since the beginning of this mandate for a modernisation of the law governing transfers and insolvency and, indeed, consultation in the form of the European Works Council Directive.
We hope that the remaining elements of those changes will be introduced as soon as possible by the Commission.
I had a recent example in my own constituency where a company called Viasystems registered offshore before declaring insolvency, thereby avoiding the application of certain aspects of insolvency law.
The subsequent Phoenix company which arose from the wreckage through a management buy-out shed over 500 jobs.
Those people were made redundant, some of them with more than 30 years' pension and other entitlements which they lost completely.
Clearly we still have a lot of work to do.
This is a step in the right direction.
Mr President, Mr Bouwman has been extremely sensitive in his approach to this question and has successfully brokered a compromise for which he deserves our congratulations.
Parliament adopted the Bouwman report by a large majority at first reading.
The European Parliament responded positively to this initiative by the Commission because it rounds off the three basis reforming directives, the other two of which cover protection for employees from mass redundancies and during corporate restructuring and all of which aim to reduce the insecurity of workers as a result of structural changes.
This common objective cannot just be confined to these initiatives.
If we want to bring about reform in the European Union and achieve the Lisbon objective of a more dynamic economy, we need to take an equally acute interest in work-generated insecurity and we need to deal with these fears in our reforms, not fly in the face of them.
It is the only way to prevent the renationalisation of social policies and prevent far-right movements from gaining a stronghold.
Parliament proposed a series of amendments, many of which were accepted by the Council, such as a definition of the notion of 'employee', application to the liberal professions and other categories and protection for wages across the board, irrespective of whether they are basic wages, bonuses or various pay rises.
The question was raised of including compensation if the employee is made redundant.
The Council's explanation that it does not refuse to include these relative guarantees but considers that they come under insured benefits in that they derive from the contract of employment is of course tantamount to acceptance.
However, in my personal opinion, there should be an express reference to the term 'compensation', just as there is in the international contract of employment and just as the experts of the International Labour Organisation have recommended.
Another positive point is the extended understanding of the term 'insolvency' which has been retained.
The big question which remains unanswered, and which concerns not just the present directive, is if and to what extent the protection offered to workers will cover all those engaged in new forms of work and if we intend to communitise the relevant definitions.
The compromise solution of an in-depth study of the question is one we agree with, as long as a specific deadline is attached to it.
Mr President, I welcome the proposal before us tonight.
I welcome the compromise reached between Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
We are still left, however, with the ongoing difficulty of so-called self-employed workers who do not have the protection of social legislation which people covered by this amended directive will have.
We all know that many companies use so-called self-employment as a means of avoiding their social responsibilities.
That is not acceptable.
It is a false flexibility.
Those companies and those Member States which support this position with regard to self-employment are impeding the modernisation of our labour relations, the modernisation of our labour market and the development of a single labour market across the European Union.
It is my view that it is a false saving and a false protection of flexibility.
I welcome the agreement to have an in-depth study into the legal, economic and social situation of people who are self-employed in this way.
I suggest that it would be worthwhile also to examine the impact that this kind of self-employment is having on the development and modernisation of the single labour market that we aspire to.
It seems to me that what is happening is that more and more workers are resisting change precisely because they fear this form of flexibility, because they are then left without the protection of social legislation which generations of workers have fought for.
Mr President, today's agreement is a major step forward in addressing the new transnational, increasingly complicated problems facing both companies and workers.
I would like to start by congratulating Mr Bouwman on the commitment, the conviction and the great determination he has shown in dealing with this very difficult directive through the co-decision procedure.
I have realised that it would be impossible to have a positive product without the cooperation and the strong support of the members of the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs and I would like to thank all the members of the committee.
I believe that this excellent cooperation, not only in the Committee, but also between the three institutions, will soon lead to the final adoption of the insolvency directive, probably without the need for the conciliation procedure.
I am pleased to announce that the Commission is willing to accept all the amendments to the common position of 18 February in their entirety.
It takes the view that all the amendments which have been tabled supplement and improve the text of the common position.
With regards to the concerns which have been expressed by Members concerning the new forms of employment, I would like to confirm to Members of this House that the Commission is aware of the problem and is dealing with it in a new way and in a much broader context than in the directive with which we are dealing today.
Indeed the forms of the employment and the way in which work is organised are undergoing rapid and far-reaching changes.
New types of employment are emerging.
There are new types of worker, half-way between the traditional models of the employee and the self-employed worker.
Various terms have been used to describe or designate these workers.
The terms used most often are economically dependent workers or para-subordinate workers and persons who perform work similar to that of an employee.
What these workers have in common is that they resemble self-employed workers in the autonomy they have to organise their work and/or the fact that they take an economic risk.
At the same time, they are economically dependent in the sense that they depend more or less on just one client firm and are very often highly integrated into the internal organisation of the company.
The Commission raised the problem of these economically dependent workers with the social partners.
There was a consultation with the social partners, and they revealed their sensitivity to the problem, but it was obvious that they did not have a concrete approach or a concrete proposal.
It was clear that there was a need for further information about the phenomenon in all Member States.
I must reassure you that in the existing text we take into account the concrete forms of employment which have already been legislated for - I mean part-time work, temporary employment contracts and fixed contracts.
But there are other forms of employment, to which I have already referred, that cannot be covered by this directive.
In order to take into account your concerns, and after our consultation with the social partners, I confirm that the Commission has launched a study which should provide an overview of the legal, social and economic position of economically dependent people in the 15 Member States.
Once this study has been finalised, the Commission will organise a joint hearing with the European Parliament for three reasons: to exchange views and practices, to evaluate the results of the study and to raise the awareness of all concerned.
Consideration could be given to inviting representatives of the accession countries to participate in this joint hearing.
After this joint hearing, the question is whether we will go further: is the Commission going to propose concrete Community action?
After all this information and the reactions, the Commission will consider the forms of Community action needed.
We will propose them to establish a broader framework and then see how it might be done.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0152/2002) by Mrs Torres Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Working together for the future of European tourism (COM(2001) 665 - C5-0077/2002 - 2002/2038(COS)).
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tourism is one of the most important economic and social sectors of the European Union in terms of the wealth it generates, in terms of the jobs it creates and in terms of its essential contribution to preserving Europe's cultural and historical heritage.
It is also a sector that is crucial to achieving full employment in the European Union, a goal laid down at the Lisbon Summit, and is also fundamental to regional policy, through stimulating growth and employment in less developed areas, especially in Europe's peripheral and outermost regions.
Europe is still the most popular tourist region in the world and the potential of this sector, especially following the planned enlargement of the European Union, is immense.
Nevertheless, major debates on tourism are rarely held in this Parliament.
I therefore congratulate Commissioner Erkki Liikanen and his staff on having given us this opportunity.
I also wish to thank the draftsmen of the opinions for this report for their contributions, the majority of which were voted for by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, thereby adding value to this report.
Europe has a historical and cultural heritage and a diversity and density of tourist attractions that make it the most visited region in the world. This means that we can expect the volume of European tourism to double in the next twenty to twenty-five years, bringing a net benefit in terms of expenditure and profits of the order of 3% per year.
Employment will grow at a rate of around 15% in the next ten years.
This incredibly rich historical and cultural heritage of Europe is a crucial factor in attracting tourists, and has the advantage, in comparison with other industries, that it cannot be relocated.
One of the most important factors in the growth of tourism in the next few years will be the trends in the demographic structure of the population: in twenty years' time, the population aged over 65 will have increased by 17 million.
Individuals in this age group, who will enjoy better health, a longer life expectancy and greater resources, will feel much more inclined to travel than in the past.
At the same time, demand for tourism will evolve: cultural and heritage tourism will increase significantly.
What is crucial, however, is that tourism has become a social right for workers and, where young people are concerned, the entire European Union has become their territory.
Other factors boosting the tourist sector, such as the liberalisation of transport and the development of transport networks, the progress of the single market, particularly the reality of the single currency, and the considerable developments and outcomes of the Information Society will continue to promote mobility and the internationalisation of tourist flows.
Many measures adopted by the Commission have been crucial to the development of tourism.
I would mention, in particular, the free movement of persons, the removal of borders, and the creation of the single currency.
A new and very important step will be taken on 1 July of this year, when the 'euro' zone becomes the domestic market and electronic cards will mean that we could just as easily be in our own countries.
I think that this is a very important step in terms of European citizenship.
Since tourism is so important, we call on Commissioner Erkki Liikanen to include all measures concerning tourism in his presentation of the raft of measures to be proposed for next year or which are already underway. I say this because one of the fundamental problems is that so many sectors have an impact on tourism that, unless we look at them as a whole, much of the impact, the importance and the coherence of these proposals will be lost.
I think that his proposal to create a European tourism forum that will meet annually and which will include representatives of the industry and of the European Parliament is a very appropriate measure and is of the utmost importance.
The idea is that we must listen to what the tourist industry has to say and find out what its needs are, to which we can then respond.
Another idea that I consider to be very important is that of a Community-level programme to promote tourism in Europe.
One of the factors that we have been most frequently asked to remedy and which I feel is of the utmost importance, is for the European Union's fiscal policy to consider labour-intensive sectors such as tourism to be entitled to pay the lowest rate of VAT.
Lastly, I ask Parliament, in the Convention on the future of Europe that is now under way, to approve strengthening the legal base so that Europe can develop a genuinely strong tourism policy, which is what we need.
Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of my colleague, Mr Bradbourn, who was the rapporteur for our committee, though I was very much involved in drawing up the opinion.
I should like to say first of all to Mrs Torres Marques that she has produced an extremely comprehensive report with a lot of good ideas in it.
I would say to Mr Liikanen, whom I am pleased to see here in a different guise from when we normally engage in debate, that I read his proposal with great interest.
I want to emphasise that the line taken by my committee in our opinion is that we are looking for areas where the Commission can add value.
We are not looking for new Treaty competences.
We are not looking for new layers of bureaucracy in an industry which, as Mrs Torres Marques has rightly pointed out, is characterised by the very large number of small- and medium- and owner-operated businesses.
The last thing we want is lots of bureaucratic information collection and even ideas like new observatories.
