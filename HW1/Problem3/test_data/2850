Today, the concern is certainly not to wait for pupils to fail, at the end of their schooling, before showing some imagination.
They need to be offered appropriate teaching.
No child is devoid of talent.
Every system creates its own type of failures.
The criteria for identifying failure are essentially subjective.
Success is judged according to pre-established standards.
What are those standards?
How have they been established?
Depending on the circumstances, politicians may even find it in their interests to exaggerate or minimise things that are going wrong, especially as the problems of education occupy a growing place in the political debate and the media.
Any pupil in difficulties is a young person whose future is compromised.
Any child who is failing is expressing his unease in the educational institution, but also in society.
A young person who is not recognised as an individual with his own experiences and his own knowledge is a rejected human being.
In rejection he will give vent to his despair; he will give vent to his hatred.
The fight against failure at school, in other words, against failure in society, is and must be a major concern for anyone with political responsibility.
So it is time to regard the young person as a developing being, wishing to train himself rather than being trained.
Perhaps we should change the way we approach knowledge and review the operation of our educational systems, but we must be careful not to seek uniformity because the multiplicity of cultures is a source of personal enrichment and a condition for successful human development.
There is no miracle cure, but there are battles to be fought.
And that means that all those who believe it must combine forces to do so.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is almost midnight already, and I do not wish to extend this sitting unnecessarily.
I agree with what Mrs Roure and Mr Perry have said and, of course, with the content of Mrs Sanders- Ten Holte's report.
I should like to confine myself to a couple of points, and I shall begin by referring back to Feira and Lisbon.
This report is really a follow-up to the thoughts of the European Council meetings in Lisbon and Feira.
When we contemplate the information society and globalisation, when we consider the speed at which technology is changing our society, it becomes obvious that we must guarantee a school education that enables young people to stay abreast of these developments.
We must create the basis for the essential establishment of lifelong learning.
For that reason, I approve of the measures that are proposed here.
They will probably help us to deal more effectively with this challenge.
Let me just come back to a point that I raised myself in an amendment.
It must be possible to work with the existing resources, with the available networks and databases.
There is no need for us to keep reinventing the wheel.
We should use what we have, comparing the knowledge we each possess and then operating on the basis of that knowledge.
I shall move on now to a technical point. In recent days we have heard that Mrs Sanders has been trying to make the first reading suffice.
But of course there is a price to pay for that.
Whoever wants to shorten the legislative process to one reading by making use of the scope for interinstitutional agreements has to conclude a deal.
This deal does not involve a decree from the gentlemen of the Committee of Permanent Representatives, who have no say; they must simply declare their acceptance of the sound parliamentary proposals.
They have not made such a declaration; they did promise us something, but we set no store by promises.
We shall vote on our report tomorrow.
Thereafter, if the gentlemen of Coreper feel able to accept our amendments, we are prepared to expedite the matter very swiftly in the autumn - there is no rush.
We should not buy a pig in a poke; we should vote on our report tomorrow and give these gentlemen the opportunity to think again.
Mr President, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what has been said already, with which I can only concur, may I reiterate that the foundations for the future prospects of the youth of tomorrow are laid in the classrooms of today and that brainpower will be the key asset of the future.
Among the basic skills we now have to learn is how to teach young people to cope with the rapid changes that are taking place in the present era.
These basic skills also include the ability to motivate individuals to engage in lifelong learning, to arouse their curiosity, to foster their willingness to be mobile, flexible and open-minded and to accept responsibility and to train them to be independent.
Let me just cite one example of this motivation and support. In my own country of Austria, this type of benchmarking, in the form of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Pop 3 study, in which we did not perform particularly well, has led to the establishment of a programme known as QualitÃ€t in Schulen (Q.I.S - Quality in Schools).
At the heart of this project is the school curriculum.
It contains a model for schools to follow and statements relating to the present situation and enumerates specific aims and measures for the promotion of quality in various areas.
It is a fixed-term agreement with an impact inside and outside schools, providing guidelines for educational practice as well as information for the public and serving as a planning instrument and a yardstick against which the development of a school can be measured.
Comparison creates competition, and competition promotes individuality among schools and hence a variety of models for guidance.
This is the path we must pursue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been, as always, great harmony between the views of Parliament and those of the Commission.
The quality of education, and quality evaluation, are indispensable, as you have said, essential to being able to improve educational systems.
Of course, it is not always easy for ministers to look at comparative results because those at the top of the class are very proud and show their pride, but the others have to answer difficult questions before their national parliaments.
So we have to recognise that accepting quality control can sometimes be very difficult for education ministers, but it is indispensable, as everyone has said this evening, if we want to improve school systems.
Let me first thank your rapporteur, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, for producing such an excellent report in a very short time.
She has been supported by Mrs Marie-HÃ©lÃšne Gillig, who championed the issue in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and she has also been supported, of course, by the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, who have tabled some very interesting amendments.
I must also stress the very positive attitude of the Portuguese Presidency, which has moved this issue forward, and I join you in regretting that it has not been possible to complete matters at first reading.
But it is Parliament' s decision, and Parliament' s alone, to complete at first reading or to go further.
You will probably decide to go further and the Commission will follow you down that road, hoping that, with lots of goodwill on both sides, we can reach agreement as soon as possible.
The proposal for a recommendation which you have before you relates to one of the key questions at the heart of our priorities: how can we ensure, and how can we improve, the quality of education?
You are aware that during the last few years the Commission has initiated several activities in this connection.
First, there has been a vast pilot project on quality evaluation, launched in 1997, and the proposal for a recommendation is based largely on the conclusions we have drawn from that pilot experiment, of evaluation as instrument of improvement of the quality and role of European cooperation in this domain.
Quality evaluation is essential if we want to make progress in the future, because improving basic skills will allow us to make a success of, and profit fully from, the opportunities offered our young people in the new knowledge society.
As you have said, the Lisbon European Council emphasised the importance of modern systems of education.
We must breathe life into those Lisbon declarations. They are revolutionary declarations, because it was the first time a Council really concentrated on what is important, beyond economics and finance, that is, the foundation of our society, knowledge.
You know I have already started work on the eLearning programme and we are now following up with the quality programme as I have already presented the first report on quality, based on sixteen quality criteria drawn up by the Member States and OECD specialists.
Mr President, some Members have asked me to return here frequently to discuss these issues. That too has already been decided, because quality control has become a priority in the Council' s new cooperation framework, the 'rolling agenda' ministers have agreed on.
This means it will come up at almost every Council of Ministers and will not be a overnight project. It will be quite apparent to everyone that it is an extended project and progress in the Member States will be evaluated regularly at intervals of a few months
Let me now come to the amendments Parliament wants to make to our proposal.
The Commission will accept all the amendments tabled, in full, in substance or in part.
A number of amendments in fact seek to strengthen the follow-up measures which have already been recommended by the Commission.
For example, Amendment No 40 invites the Commission to define a plan for a follow-up in close cooperation with the Member States.
That is already the case.
In the same vein, I am delighted with Amendment No 42, which allows the Commission to submit new follow-up proposals three years after the adoption of the recommendation.
Everything evolves so rapidly that I do think this is a logical course of action.
Other amendments aim to extend the political range of the recommendation and I am very pleased with them.
So that is the sense in which I accept Amendments Nos 17 and 18, seeking to associate the candidate countries, as of now, in European cooperation as regards quality evaluation.
I recently met the ministers of those countries at the Bucharest Conference, and they expressed a strong desire to be included in that cooperation.
Besides, I have to tell you that on examining the evaluation that has been done, it was found that the candidate countries are often well ahead of European averages in terms of educational quality.
We should not imagine that we are the best at everything: education in those countries is sometimes remarkable.
I also accept Amendments Nos 1 to 14, which propose new recitals.
Similarly, I agree in principle with Amendment 36 which refers to the Eurydice information network.
I share the opinion of Parliament that we should base ourselves on existing networks wherever possible.
It is certainly true that the Eurydice network, and in particular European unity, can support European cooperation as regards evaluation by making a common platform of basic knowledge available to the various players.
However, I think it is difficult to entrust responsibility for coordinating experience in this area to the networks.
Amendment No 36 could therefore be accepted by the Commission subject to rewording to take account of the capacities and characteristics of the Eurydice network.
Besides, I think the reference to Eurydice would be better placed in the invitations to the Commission rather than in the part relating to the Member States.
Anyway I could agree to a reworded Amendment No 36.
I am also delighted with Amendments Nos 21 to 35, which clarify the invitations to the Member States.
Amendments Nos 27 and 31 seek to introduce a reference to benchmarking, but I have to tell Parliament that the benchmarking system still gives ministers problems because the definition is not yet perfect.
So ministers and the Commission were very pleased to be able to accept a Dutch initiative to bring experts and ministers together, in the autumn, to find a better definition.
Naturally, Parliament will be informed of the results of that conference.
In conclusion, I want to stress that we are on the right road to arriving at a positive decision.
I hope with all my heart that the Council will rally to that decision, which is the result of a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission.
I hope the Council can adopt its common position as soon as possible, and if there are controversial points they could be the subject of compromise at second reading.
I want to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, its rapporteur and its members once again for the quality of their work.
Quality is not confined to school; it is here in the European Parliament too. That is something that needs to be said more often.
Many thanks, Commissioner Reding, especially for the fact that we shall now be able to go home before midnight.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for staying the course!
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
(The sitting was closed at 12 midnight)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, on Monday I made a point of order about President Nicole Fontaine's reported comments in the British press regarding her recent visit with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
A British Labour Member of this House, Mr Miller, repeated what were purported to be the Queen's remarks, not once but three times, on Monday, on Tuesday and on Wednesday.
He sought to drag the Queen into a political controversy and to use her name to score cheap political points.
Mr President, it may be that President Fontaine was unfamiliar with the British rules of protocol which obtain in such matters, but Mr Miller has no such excuse.
He knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political Head of State.
He knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues.
He knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this House to set the record straight.
His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal.
Mr President, I am proud to be British but today I am ashamed to share my nationality with that man.
Has he no shame?
Has he no respect?
Has he no decency or honour at all?
Mr President, well, how can I respond to such an attack as that?
When I raised the point on Monday, and on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, I asked Mr Helmer for his comments on the euro.
So far, he has refused to comment.
Can I also say that when Mrs Fontaine spoke to Her Majesty the Queen and obviously put certain questions to her the Queen, in her response, was representing her government, which is a Labour Government.
That might not suit Mr Helmer, but I am sorry to say that is the way it goes.

Can I also say yes, I am Scottish, yes, I am British, but, Mr Helmer, I am European as well and proud to be.
Mr President, I wish to use this point of order to speak in my capacity as chairman of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico.
As you will be aware, elections were held in Mexico last Sunday.
Yesterday the delegation which I chair met and discussed a report drawn up by our fellow Members who had been to Mexico to act as observers at these elections on behalf of this Parliament.
We finally approved a three-point statement.
The first point was to recognise and welcome the dignified and civic-minded conduct of our Mexican friends during these elections. Secondly, we welcomed the election of Mr Fox and expressed our hope that relations between the European Union and Mexico would continue to make progress under the general agreement approved and ratified in March.
Thirdly, we wished to congratulate President Zedillo on having enabled Mexican institutions to make this change to democracy.
Mr President, I would ask you to see if the President of this Parliament could forward our resolution, the complete text of which you will receive today, to the Mexican authorities.
Very well, Mr Seguro.
I will certainly inform President Fontaine.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to draw your attention to something really annoying in connection with the Minutes.
The "Texts Adopted" also form part of the Minutes.
I pointed out yesterday during the vote on the directive to combat money laundering the English translation of Article 6(3) needs to be corrected to bring it in line with Amendment No 26, because the English translation is wrong.
In the middle of the second paragraph of the English version there is only a reference to representation in legal proceedings, but no reference to legal consultants, as there is in the German text.
That is a key point in this directive and since the Council working group is working on the basis of the English text it is quite crucial to correct this text.
I had already complained about this in committee vis Ã  vis the language services.
At the time the committee decided not to table an amendment because the German text is the original version, as drafted by the rapporteur.
I complained about this yesterday - the situation was not remedied - and today is the third time I am complaining about it!
I do think the services of this House should work more carefully on such key questions and it really is intolerable that despite my criticism yesterday the Minutes have got the text wrong again!
I would ask you get to the bottom of this matter, to sort out this most important aspect of the directive and to please correct this in the English translation!
Certainly, Mr Lehne.
You gave ample clarification of the matter yesterday. We will certainly ensure that the necessary correction is made.
Mr President, yesterday we received a communication on yellow paper from the vice-president, with some nuts attached to it.
This note was about supporting the export of products from Vanuatu, a developing country in the Pacific.
I think that is a very good idea and quite right.
And I am quite happy to support it.
But what rather puzzles me is that in it the vice-president quite explicitly stated that it is illegal to import these nuts into the European Union.
So I must ask this vice-president to explain how these nuts came to be illegally imported, since it was he who delivered them to us!
That in itself is a contradiction so would he please clarify the matter.
(Laughter and applause)
(The Minutes were approved)
Welcome
Committee on Petitions - European Ombudsman
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled on behalf of the Committee on Petitions:
(A5-0162/2000) by Mrs Lambert, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 1999-2000;
(A5-0181/2000) by Mrs Thors, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1999.
Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to address the European Parliament concerning the results of my work as European Ombudsman in the year 1999.
The Annual Report for 1999 covers the last year of the first mandate of the European Ombudsman.
Last year the Ombudsman's office received 1,577 new complaints compared to 1,372 in 1998, an increase of nearly 15%.
The number of inquiries opened rose from 171 in 1998 to 206 in 1999, an increase of over 20%.
As well as becoming better known, the European Ombudsman is also attracting a higher proportion of serious complaints which require full investigation.
You may be interested to know that the same trend has continued to the present year.
During the first six months of this year, the number of new inquiries rose by 32% over the same period in 1999.
Inquiries are the most resource-intensive aspect of the Ombudsman's work.
It is therefore a great challenge to deal with this increase, whilst maintaining the quality of our work and meeting our target of closing most inquiries within one year.
I do hope that the European Parliament will support the Ombudsman in seeking the resources needed to carry out the work effectively.
During 1999, we continued to receive a quite high proportion of complaints, over 70%, which lay outside the mandate of the European Ombudsman.
The proportion of the complaints outside the mandate even increased slightly, probably because we received a growing number of complaints by e-mail.
We gladly accept complaints by e-mail and many of them contain well - presented allegations of maladministration.
However in all, more of the e-mail complaints are directed against authorities of Member States.
During the campaign for the election of a European Ombudsman last year, some critical voices suggested that the Ombudsman's mandate should be broadened to include complaints against Member States in cases where a question of European Union law is involved.
I am not sure whether they understood that this would mean the European Ombudsman carrying out tasks currently belonging to the European Commission as the guardian of the Treaty, and to the European Parliament as the democratic forum to which citizens may address petitions.
We study carefully all the complaints we receive, especially if they involve rights under European Union law.
In 1999, we managed to advise the complainant, or transfer the complaint to a competent body, in about half of the cases.
Of these, we transferred 71 cases to the European Parliament to be dealt with as petitions and advised a further 142 complainants of their rights to petition the European Parliament.
In many cases, complaints against national, regional or local authorities could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman in the Member States concerned.
In every Member State there should be a non-judicial body which can assist European citizens in conflicts with Member States' administration concerning their rights under European Union law.
As a believer in subsidiarity, I remain convinced that the most effective way to achieve this result is through the development of a network of cooperation with these Ombudsmen as similar bodies such as petitions committees.
We organised jointly with the French Ombudsman, Mr Stasi, a seminar for national Ombudsmen and similar bodies.
In Paris in September 1999, Mr Perry, the first vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions, represented the European Parliament.
A further seminar is planned to take place in Brussels under the Belgian presidency of the Council in the year 2001 in cooperation with the Commission and with Belgium federal and regional ombudsmen.
The regional Ombudsmen and similar bodies were invited to a meeting in Florence last year in which Mr Gemelli, the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, also attended.
The regional Ombudsmen and similar bodies will also be invited to Brussels next year.
The Ombudsmen and similar bodies in the Member States have shown a positive attitude towards cooperation with the European Ombudsman.
I strongly believe that cooperation with them on equal terms will achieve the best results for European citizens.
At the beginning, great doubts were expressed as to whether the European Ombudsman had sufficient powers to achieve anything for the citizen.
These doubts were unjustified because the Community's institutions and bodies have responded properly to the Ombudsman's work.
Since the beginning, they have themselves settled the complaint to the satisfaction of the complainant in over 180 cases.
For example, they have replied to unanswered letters, made payments that are due and reversed previous unfavourable decisions.
This indicates a spirit of responsiveness and flexibility superior to those national administrations of which I have experience.
Sixty-two of these settlements occurred last year, reducing the scope for friendly solutions to be proposed by the Ombudsman.
However, we did achieve one friendly solution in 1999 in a case where the Commission and the Council agreed that the complainant should be paid the amount due him for his work as a European Union regional coordinator monitoring the Palestinian elections.
If the institution or body concerned will not correct the maladministration itself, the Ombudsman's ultimate weapon is to draft a recommendation followed, if necessary, by a special report to European Parliament.
Five years ago, there were many people who said that the Community institutions and bodies did not pay much heed to European Parliament.
Even if they might have been right then, things have clearly changed since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the fall of the Santer Commission.
In 1999 we made ten draft recommendations.
In seven cases the institution concerned has accepted a draft recommendation.
In two cases the Ombudsman has made a special report to the European Parliament.
One case remains ongoing, since Europol needs more time to comply with the draft recommendation that it should approve some public access to documents.
I believe that the European Ombudsman's activities have reached the level that one has the right to expect of a body which is new and consists of 25 persons working in a fairly complex legal environment.
We are achieving results for European citizens, and this is what matters above all.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the Community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation.
I would especially like to address the Commission and its responsible Member, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, and thank her for continuing her predecessor's commitment to an honest and constructive attitude towards cooperation with the Ombudsman.
I would also like to express my warm appreciation for the helpful and cooperative attitude towards the Ombudsman's office shown by the Committee on Petitions and especially its vice-chairman, Mr Gemelli, and also thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Petitions Mrs Thors, for her important work on her comprehensive report.
Thank you for your attention.
Mr President, the report that I am presenting this morning is effectively a dual report which reflects the work of the committee itself and the work of the office of Parliament's Mediator for Transnationally Abducted Children, Mrs Banotti.
I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr SÃ¶derman, the Ombudsman.
I should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break-down which is provided there which, I must confess, is not my own work.
I would urge Members who are not familiar with the Committee on Petitions to read these reports.
It might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent.
I would also draw their attention to the website mentioned, set up under the Europe Direct initiative, which could provide useful information and possibly avoid the need for a petition or indeed confirm it as an appropriate vehicle.
There is a growing need for such information as people become more aware of the importance and relevance of the European Union level.
The aim of the Committee on Petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the European Union and for civil society generally.
Any individual, citizen, resident or group may petition Parliament if they feel that Community law or principles are not being properly applied at whatever level.
Last year we received 958 petitions of which 492 were considered admissible.
I will mention just two of them to demonstrate the range of the topics and the potential effectiveness of the mechanism.
We had one British petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the French authorities, presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects.
In another case a petition from a Spanish citizen, acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the Spanish authorities in relation to the Habitats Directive, a frequent cause of complaint - the directive, not the authorities - with lasting national effect.
It is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the European Parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society, or not, as the case may be.
We could not do our work effectively on this committee without the support of numerous Commission officials who investigate cases and instigate proceedings where necessary.
I wish to express our thanks.
We know we could provide a more rapid and effective service if Member States could provide an equally committed response in replying to requests for information and explanation.
In one case we are currently dealing with it has taken 14 months to get a reply to a letter.
That is not unusual.
That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively.
I would draw the Council's attention to points 8 and 10 of the report - if it was here.
The aim of the committee is to improve the overall quality of our feedback mechanisms.
Some of our ideas are mentioned in this report.
Others will appear in a further report in September from Mr Perry and Mrs KeÃler.
We are proposing, as we did last year, a database mechanism so that petitioners and Members can track the progress of reports and see where the problems lie.
We trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal.
There are various points concerning our relations with other committees.
We would ask them to call on the Committee on Petitions more often to express an opinion on certain areas where concern has arisen.
We would like to be involved in preparing joint reports on areas of particular concern such as the environment, social security, consumer protection and so on. We would also wish to use the experience of our committee members through their work on other committees of Parliament to institute a rapporteur-style system for specific topics.
We are also keen to establish links with petitions committees in other Member States, with a view to exchanging good ideas and understanding.
We consider as a committee that petitions are a valuable and empowering tool for democracy in what can often feel like a remote and anonymous institution.
We need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent, as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole.
I commend the report to the House.
Mr President, Commissioner and Mr SÃ¶derman, the rapporteur' s and the committee' s understanding of the Ombudsman' s report for 1999 - the year characterised by crises within the EU institutions and by an immense distrust of the administration - is that the citizens will only view European integration as legitimate if they have rights that mean they can actively participate in a political dialogue with the institutions.
The political dialogue is not, however, a real dialogue if the citizens do not have the right to receive information and to have access to the documents that they ask for and if the opinions they express are not paid attention to, discussed or taken seriously.
What has all this got to do with the Ombudsman' s task?
The Ombudsman' s task is, of course, according to the Treaty, to investigate cases of maladministration within the Community institutions and within the public bodies.
At the request of the European Parliament, the Ombudsman gave a definition of the term "maladministration" in the annual report for 1997.
These cases occur when a public body fails to act in accordance with a rule or principle that is binding upon it.
During the Ombudsman' s last period of office, the institutions agreed to apply this definition, and it is now, and will be in the future, the basis for the Ombudsman' s activity.
In the report, the committee stresses that this jointly approved definition of "maladministration" also involves the right to inspect how the institutions have interpreted Community law.
Irrespective of the legal form the Charter of Fundamental Rights will take, it will, in any case, be an expression of the Member States' common constitutional traditions which, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty, shall be respected by the Union and therefore also by the institutions and public bodies.
The committee observes, therefore, that the Ombudsman ought to play an important part in implementing a future charter of citizens' rights.
The committee has also expressed its clear support for the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights ought to contain rules which give citizens the right to expect good administration within the EU.
"Good administration" is the opposite of "maladministration" .
The right to good administration, both with respect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour which Parliament and the Ombudsman have sought, should at least contain: the right to have one' s case heard, the right to inspect documents, the right to prompt answers from the administration and the right to receive replies supported by reasons.
All these aspects have been central to the Ombudsman' s work.
These rights are prerequisites for the active citizenship that is necessary if the EU is to regain the confidence of its citizens.
It is these rights that make citizenship active instead of passive.
Good administration can create conditions for active citizenship, whereas maladministration can undermine these conditions.
What are the most common complaints to the Ombudsman and into which categories do they fall?
Incomplete or refused information, delays that could have been avoided, discrimination, lack of the right to defence.
Citizens want to see good administration.
They want to be active citizens.
These conclusions can be drawn from the ever increasing number of complaints to the Ombudsman and from the nature of these complaints.
The Ombudsman has become renowned for his work for the wider public.
This is something he should receive a lot of praise for.
An investigation that he completed a few years ago resulted in most of the Community' s institutions and public bodies currently having legislation that allows the public to have access to documents.
He has tirelessly continued the work for real transparency and for its no longer being possible for data secrecy and personal protection to be used to prevent the public' s scrutiny of the activities of the authorities.
Step by step, the Ombudsman has developed his work, endeavoured to obtain better administration and gained the trust of the citizens.
His cooperation with the national ombudsmen is also important, as will be his future cooperation with the corresponding bodies in the candidate countries.
This is substantial work that Parliament has reason to support.
It ought to do this by making sufficient financial resources available to the Ombudsman so that he can carry out the necessary investigations which the mandate requires.
We should in the future also make sure that we support an Ombudsman who is independent in his decision making.
I would like to address a big thank you to the Ombudsman and his office, as well as to the secretariat at the Committee on Petitions which, as we know, is currently working under difficult conditions.
Mr President, the European Parliament' s Committee on Petitions is a very special body.
It receives complaints from citizens, as the two previous speakers rightly said, who believe their rights as EU citizens have been restricted.
As draftsman of an opinion on the right of residence, I would like to make a few comments on the specific problems in this area.
The free movement of persons is one of the basic freedoms achieved through European integration.
Since the Maastricht Treaty there is a general right of residence, provided the individual concerned has adequate means of subsistence and adequate health insurance protection.
Freedom of movement and right of residence can be restricted only for reasons of law and order, security or health.
Experience has shown the Committee on Petitions that in practice the right to freedom of movement comes up against a great many problems because: (a) Member State authorities are slow to transpose the rules of Community law, (b) problems arise with the recognition of diplomas and qualifications in the case of specific professions, (c) the rules on social security have not been standardised, e.g. complicated forms for the refund of medical costs.
An analysis of Treaty infringement proceedings between 1996 and 1999 shows that in 97 cases there was a direct link between the petition and the Treaty infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice.
Unfortunately, the Council often ignores the communications from the Committee on Petitions about serious violations of Community law by Member State authorities.
That reflects a negative attitude towards the European citizens' right of petition.
In future the Council should devote the necessary attention to the rights of EU citizens.
Mr President, the right to petition and to complain is not some recent invention.
Even 2000 years ago petitioners could put their concerns before the Roman emperor.
But this right was always in danger of being changed, restricted or abolished.
Yesterday' s petitioners have become today' s responsible European citizens.
No administration or institution is infallible.
Many petitions point to a discrepancy between the legal provisions and European integration.
So petitions are a gauge for the relations between the citizens and the legislator and there are many levels of petitions.
A population of hamsters in an industrial area is of just as much concern to us as the ban on silicon implants or the introduction of a heavy goods tax.
I turn now to the Ombudsman.
My group congratulates the Ombudsman on the work he accomplished in 1999.
It was, and is, to Mr SÃ¶derman' s credit that he has done so much to create greater transparency and openness within the European administrations.
Since most of the complaints in the Ombudsman' s remit relate to the European Commission and concern a lack of transparency, work needs to be done to improve this situation.
That includes access to documents, not only for the citizens of Europe but also for the Ombudsman.
New office technologies cannot be used as grounds for the lack of transparency either.
Comprehensible, substantiated replies to the citizens create trust, the opposite gives rise to distrust and a rising number of complaints that need to be dealt with, which therefore in turn creates costs.
The Ombudsman' s proposal for a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour is particularly welcome.
The citizens have a basic right to an open and responsible administration geared to providing services, since after all it is paid for out of their taxes.
In my view it is most important for the European Ombudsman to play an independent role, which can serve as an example for the introduction of national ombudsmen in the candidate countries and in my Land of ThÃŒringen.
Mr President, Mr SÃ¶derman, we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and myself personally, are proud that our Ombudsman is courageous, enterprising and able to act.
It is extremely important that we have someone with such integrity who has dared to stand up for openness and transparency and against the culture of underhandedness, secrecy and, unfortunately in certain cases, of cheating and corruption, which also exists in the European institutions.
Only an open and public administration can win support among those who are working here amongst the politicians and among the citizens whom we represent.
The line the Ombudsman is pursuing has a lot of support amongst the citizens of all Member States.
It is an indisputable fact, and there are several international scientific reports to prove it, that there is a crystal-clear connection between a high level of openness and transparency in the administration and a low level of corruption.
The opposite is also true: a closed and secretive administration tends to foster a higher level of corruption.
That is, of course, also true in the European institutions.
That is why it is so important for us to have a completely independent ombudsman who can act independently and without being subject to any lobbying whatsoever or to interested parties attempting to influence him.
The increasing proportion of complaints coming from citizens also points to the need for our Ombudsman, who really acts in the interests of the citizens.
The only criticism that can be directed at the Ombudsman is probably that, unfortunately, the institution is still far too little known in many Member States and that far too few citizens are aware of this right.
This is probably something which I would like to see concentrated on in the future.
To summarise, the Ombudsman fulfils a very important function.
I would like to congratulate him on the work he has carried out during the year and wish him luck in the future.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr SÃ¶derman, it may be well to remember that just a year and a half ago there was a debate in this Chamber over whether we needed a Committee on Petitions in general.
I am very pleased to be able to say that the Committee on Petitions has again shown its indispensability, especially at a time like this, when we wish to enhance the status of the ordinary citizen in the European Union.
I genuinely hope that the Commission on Petitions succeeds in establishing good levels of co-operation with the other committees in the coming year.
I believe that we will be able to draft joint reports on the most important problem areas.
With regard to the Ombudsman, he has truly established his position and independence.
The growing number of grievances is an indication that the public have found him, and we members of the European Parliament have often been able to guide people in his direction to have their problems solved.
Public access to documents is an issue that will occupy us in the future, and we have already had some valuable advice on the matter from the Ombudsman.
Mr President, in one minute one cannot say much, so I am going to take this opportunity to summarise.
Firstly, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lambert, for taking up all our proposals in the debate.
There are therefore not even any amendments.
Secondly, I wish to say that at this stage nobody doubts that the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman make an extremely important contribution to compliance with Community law.
We see this every day in the Committee on Petitions.
Like Mrs Hautala, I am therefore very happy that the Committee on Petitions has survived the attempts to remove it, since, as well as demanding compliance with Community law, it is the committee which is closest to the citizens.
It is the committee which makes the institutions most visible to the citizens.
The greatest problem is probably the long procedure which follows a complaint by a citizen.
The citizen has to study Community law in order to present a petition, and then any response is delayed month after month.
The most important petitions deal with social and environmental issues, which are the matters of most concern.
On some occasions, Mr President - and I will end here - when a complaint involves the eviction of a citizen or the destruction of a natural area, the response arrives when it is too late to deal with the matter.
The speeding up of the process is therefore an important issue which has been taken up by Mrs Lambert.
Mr President, the Radical Members of the Bonino List will support the two reports, and they value and support the work of the Ombudsman.
However, we would like to ask the Ombudsman a very specific question regarding the fact that it is still not possible for complaints to be signed electronically.
In our opinion, this issue is relevant to all the institutions, having a bearing on Parliament's own work as well.
However, in particular, precisely because the Ombudsman wishes there to be as much focus as possible on his work, we feel that the possibility for the Ombudsman to attach an electronic signature could be the first step towards introducing the use of this vehicle within the institutions.
I would just like to comment on an important statement which has not received due attention.
Seventy-seven per cent of complaints received concern the Commission.
The Ombudsman has told us that the Commission has made no progress this year in the area of transparency. Transparency is an effective weapon against fraud and corruption.
In particular, on 7 December last, President Prodi undertook to find and propose legal and organisational solutions to give both internal and external candidates to Commission competitions access to their examination papers.
Would the Ombudsman please inform us, in the same way that he has informed us that Europol needs more time to comply with the recommendation, whether the commitment made by President Prodi on 7 December to making papers available by 1 July 2000 has already been implemented or not.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I gather from the Ombudsman' s Annual Report that, as we have now heard, the main complaint of the citizens is about lack of transparency.
But it appears that not everyone concerned is aware of this problem.
The Commission has submitted a proposal for a regulation on public access to documents which you, Mr SÃ¶derman, rightly criticised in public as not going far enough.
Indeed there has been quite a lot written on the subject.
The spirit underlying this proposal can be gauged from the statement by the Advisory Committee of Independent Experts.
According to the experts' second report, like all political institutions the Commission needs room to consider, to formulate policy before it becomes public, because policy that is made directly before the public eye is often bad policy.
As a representative of the European public, I find this approach to questions of transparency and of policy-making in general unacceptable.
So I firmly support Mr SÃ¶dermann' s justified criticism!
Mr President, I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to the Ombudsman for the report which he has presented this year and also to Mrs Thors and Mrs Lambert for their reports to the Parliament.
All these reports, particularly that of the Ombudsman, show the very reliable, dependable work that has been done over the year.
The European citizens undoubtedly need somebody to whom they can turn if they have problems with the administration and in Mr SÃ¶derman I know that we have an Ombudsman upon whom we can depend.
I saw that at first hand when I attended the seminar in Paris.
It was very good to see the respect in which the European Ombudsman is held by his colleagues, the national ombudsmen.
On this side of the House we certainly believe the Ombudsman should have all the powers that he needs to discharge his responsibilities.
On access to documents, we happen to think that the views of the Constitutional Affairs Committee are important, but that should not be taken to mean that we have any doubts at all about the principle that the Ombudsman must have access to documents.
In that he has our full support.
It is surprising that last year the Petitions Committee was at some risk and the report by Mrs Lambert shows the very good work that has been down by the Petitions Committee.
With our chairman Mr Gemelli we are now looking at ways of making the Petitions Committee more effective and more efficient in the work it does on behalf of citizens.
One of the important things that we will be bringing forward to the Parliament is a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour.
It is important that citizens and the officials of the institutions know what is reasonable behaviour so that all have a standard to which they can refer.
I would also like to thank the Commission for the support we have received in the Petitions Committee. That has been very good and very effective through the year.
I hope under the French Presidency we will get the same support from the Council but that unfortunately has been lacking in the past.
Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their interesting comments.
With its ever widening circle of activities, covering a broad range of citizens' interests, the European Union is turning into a modern Leviathan, complete with the inevitable high-handedness which accompanies every administrative mechanism; from certain points of view, it is becoming even more dangerous than the equivalent national government services.
That is because control mechanisms have not kept pace with the increase in activities.
There are three ways of blocking the dangers which result from this extensive administrative mechanism in the European Union.
The first is to have more direct and more frequent involvement by European Parliament in controlling the individual activities of the institutions of the European Union.
The proposal by the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, that the Commission include a section on reports and complaints in the annual report on Community law and the proposed organisational agreement making it easier for complaints to be examined quickly need to be followed up here.
If the tenet of these proposals is extrapolated, the suggestion is that the European Parliament should, in the future, devote more time to these matters, which are equally important if it is to enhance its status and its right to aspire to codecision with the Council.
In more general terms, it is time to see parliamentary control exercised on a different footing.
The second way is to introduce the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a binding charter guaranteeing European citizens immediate rights, both adjectival and substantive, which protect their interests fairly and which convert to the right to compensation in the event that their interests are attacked.
The increasingly likely prospect of a Charter which amounts to no more than a declaration will obviously damage the credibility of the European Union which, while abundantly eloquent on the importance of transparency in the operation of its institutions as a basic policy objective and accessibility to European citizens as a basic factor in achieving it, shies from recognising the rudimentary mechanism needed in order to achieve these objectives.
The third way is to strengthen and improve the role of the ombudsman, mainly by giving him easier access to all the documents needed in order to conduct an efficient investigation.
At the same time, the wealth of material in his report should be closely studied and taken as the starting point for the changes which need to be made to the modus operandi of the Community institutions.
I wish the ombudsman courage and good luck for the future.
Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the European Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, the two rapporteurs, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors, all the members of the Committee on Petitions and the Secretariat.
We started from the premise that the purpose of the institutions is to serve the citizens and that, therefore, any breach of the citizens' rights will lead to a loss of confidence in the institutions.
We are currently required to create a complex, comprehensive, harmonious, functional legal framework, and we must therefore also create judicial mechanisms such as the Charter on Rights, a body of law establishing criminal, civil and administrative law, the agreement procedures for the mutual recognition of judgments passed by Member States, Europol and the sectoral agreements, the establishment of the European Fraud Investigation Office as a tool for investigating abuse of the law, the likely institution of the office of European Public Prosecutor which should be the investigating office of the Court of Justice, the separation of the careers of judges responsible for giving rulings and investigating magistrates, and the separation of criminal, civil and administrative responsibilities: all these are instruments which advance the progress of the European Union.
Yesterday's framework agreement is a milestone in this sense.
Finally, we would like to request that, in a similar way to Parliament in the codecision procedure, the Committee on Petitions may be permitted to present its own justification for certain decisions, and we call for amendment of the Treaties in order to streamline the entire legal system and existing legislation.
Mr President, Mr SÃ¶derman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their hard, thorough and excellent work.
The Ombudsman controls power and solves disputes between those who hold power and those over whom power is exercised, and last year there were almost two thousand such cases.
I would like to state seven principles.
The bigger a union is, the greater the need for transparency.
The newer it is the greater this need is, and the more complex it is, the greater the need for better transparency.
The more oriented it is towards the information society, the more open it has to be, and the more civilised it is the more public it must be.
The more multi-cultural it is the greater the transparency, and the more democratic it is the more open it likewise is.
We are used to reading instructions for use with all equipment, down to how to use the whisk in the kitchen.
The principles of good administration, which have been worthily established by the Ombudsman, are our citizens' instructions for use with regard to Eurobureaucracy.
And, goodness me, these instructions certainly are necessary!
There is no democracy without good administration, and that is why the Union Charter must contain the principles of good administration.
I would like to make one more important point.
Public access to documents in the information society and the principles concerning them must be upgraded in line with the new technology; in other words, a grievance must be able to be made over the Internet and precedents and associated documents must be available in real time.
My suggestion is that we need an Ombudsman' s portal on the Net.
Thank you for your work!
Mr President, as a member of the Committee on Petitions, I would particularly like to congratulate my fellow Member, Mrs Lambert, on her excellent report and I thank the European Commission for its valuable assistance in handling the petitions we receive.
Petitions are a recognised right of European citizens and residents of the European Union, enabling them to take advantage of the rights given to them by the Treaties.
Few citizens, however, are aware that they may submit a petition.
The files that we handle, moreover, show a lack of understanding of the rights conferred by European citizenship.
This, unfortunately, results in 50% of petitions being inadmissible.
Admissible petitions usually raise problems with freedom of movement, setting up businesses, social benefits, recognition of diplomas and qualifications and taxation.
Furthermore, we are receiving more and more collective petitions concerning subjects relating to the environment, and with the extension of the competence of the European Union, it is conceivable that the number of such petitions and the number of areas handled will increase.
In order to respond to citizens' expectations, adequate coordination between the Committee on Petitions, the European institutions and national authorities is essential.
Greater account must also be taken by the other parliamentary committees of the work carried out by our committee.
The chronic absence of the Council from our committee meetings is detrimental to the correct handling of petitions.
Indeed, the national authorities are the first to apply Community law and it is indispensable for them to work in coordination with the European institutions, and in particular Parliament and the Commission.
We are currently waiting too long for responses from the national authorities, sometimes even several years.
We are fully aware of the extent of this task and the difficulties to be overcome.
First of all, it cannot be denied that this committee is not very well known, although its work is indispensable in strengthening the link between citizens and the European Union.
Furthermore, the structures and means of this committee must be strengthened in order to make it more effective, and a closer relationship with the petitions committees of the national authorities would be desirable.
Finally, one of the strong points of the French Presidency' s programme is a Europe that is closer to the citizens.
The work of our committee falls within this sphere and it is up to us to make this expectation a reality.
Mr President, I want to welcome Mr SÃ¶derman this morning and to congratulate Mrs Lambert and Mrs Thors for their reports.
The reality of our society is that if governments and administrations had their way they would never appoint Petitions Committees or Ombudsmen.
By nature they tend to be secretive.
They are only there because the citizens and their public representatives demand them and defend them when they are there.
Therefore, it is important that we continue to demand that the Ombudsman's office and the Petitions Committee of Parliament are adequately resourced.
One way of choking off the effectiveness of the Ombudsman's office and the Petitions Committee is to deny them adequate resources.
In Parliament it is disgraceful that the Petitions Committee, the single most important direct contact that the citizen has with this institution and with the other institutions of the European Union, is treated the way it is treated.
It does not have adequate secretarial assistance.
It is treated abominably in relation to translations, which are down at the bottom of the list.
It is simply not good enough.
I would appeal to the Commission and to the Council if they were here - they ignore the Petitions Committee, as well as ignoring Parliament - to give the resources that are necessary for these bodies to do their job.
The Petitions Committee in particular is an important mechanism of access for the people of Europe.
It is important that we ensure that it can do its work effectively.
The two most important issues that come before the Petitions Committee are the recognition of people's qualifications to work in other Member States and the environmental impact of construction development.
In particular, people are concerned that environment impact studies, which are required under EU law, are treated as having no more worth than the paper they are written on.
They are either ignored or they do not address the real issues.
Mr President, I would personally like to congratulate Jacob SÃ¶derman on the good work he has done, which resulted in his re-election on 27 October last year.
At the same time, I would like to praise the Ombudsman for a model annual report which is easy-to-read and, at the same time, comprehensive.
It can be seen from the report that it is the Commission that is the subject of the majority of the investigations that have been undertaken, 77 percent to be precise.
It should certainly be emphasised that this is mainly due to the fact that the Commission is the institution that makes the most decisions directly affecting citizens.
In the report on individual complaints, it emerges, however, that there is insufficient transparency.
Insufficient and inadequate information was also the most common cause of complaint.
Openness is important if citizens are to be able to have more opportunity to influence how the EU operates and if tendencies to corruption, cheating and fraud are to be checked.
I would like to highlight the fact that this report emphasises that all EU institutions and bodies must establish a Code of Good Administrative Behaviour.
There is a risk, however, which is also evident from the Ombudsman' s annual report, that the significance of such a code would vary considerably from one institution or body to another.
The PR side of the Ombudsman' s activities has already been brought up by other speakers and can never be underestimated.
I would like to close with some questions: What would be the consequences of a Charter of Fundamental Rights for the Ombudsman' s work?
Are there sufficient resources for the work to be carried out well?
What are the main reasons for the institutions' shortcomings in relation to the citizens?
Is there a lack of will, are the resources insufficient or is there unreasonable bureaucracy which is preventing and delaying the handling of this issue?
Mr President, on the basis of the Ombudsman' s report and that of Mrs Thors, we may say that the institution of the Ombudsman is well established.
The Committee acknowledges the work done by Jacob SÃ¶derman, and the public too have discovered the Ombudsman.
The basic pillars of the work of the Ombudsman are independence and transparency.
It is just as pertinent to emphasise the importance of good administration for the public and for the authority of the EU in the eyes of our citizens.
It is good that the committee supports the Ombudsman in his efforts to create regulations for good administration.
The principle of good administration must also be included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights which is being drafted.
From the report it appears that only around 30% of the complaints to the Ombudsman fall within his sphere of responsibility.
For that reason there has to be closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and national and regional ombudsmen.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to participate in this debate today, together with Mr SÃ¶derman, the Ombudsman, whose work in the service of the citizens of the Union is very important.
The Commission takes a very positive view of this work.
I wish to say that the Commission believes that the citizen should always be the focus of our concerns.
The citizen is ultimately the beneficiary of our activities and is our raison d' Ãªtre.
In this respect, both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman play a key role, on different levels and with different purposes, but they are both nevertheless essential to the improvement of the operation of the institutions.
The Committee on Petitions deals with the specific concerns of the citizens and, in this respect, as has been pointed out by Mrs Lambert - who I warmly congratulate on her report - the petitions presented to Parliament illustrate the problems of the citizens in relation to European administrations and also, in many cases, national administrations, at the same time highlighting the legislative vacuums which exist on both European and national levels.
The Ombudsman, as indicated by Mrs Thors - whom I also warmly congratulate on her report - deals with complaints against institutions and bodies of the European Union with regard to the deficiencies of its administrations.
He urges us to improve the management and quality of services by indicating the weak points to us, the points which need improvement and greater attention.
However, nobody wants a more effective and transparent administration as much as we do. It is we who are responsible for this administration and to this end any criticisms of our defects are welcome.
We can only confront our defects if we know what they are.
I must insist that this is why we give such importance to the work of both the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions; so that the institutions may work properly.
With regard to Mrs Lambert' s report, I would like to deal with two specific issues.
One of them, relating to cooperation between institutions, is essential to the improvement of the operation of the Committee on Petitions and its capacity for action.
In this regard, I would like to express my satisfaction because the report highlights the constructive role of the Commission in the examination of petitions and because it considers it to be satisfactory on the whole.
It awards us a sort of 'pass' , and I thank you, but we will try to improve.
We see this is as a stimulus to make a greater effort, to work better and cooperate more.
Secondly, it proposes a review of the examination procedures of the Committee on Petitions.
It seems to me a great idea to rearrange the examination of petitions by themes, to give specialised rapporteurs the task of examining these petitions with greater care, and, where necessary, to draw conclusions which will allow the deficiencies to be corrected, take decisions to resolve possible vacuums in legislative texts, or counteract the unwanted effects of these texts.
Furthermore, the Commission is prepared to consider a review of the interinstitutional agreement on the processing of petitions which would amend the one currently in force, from 1989, with Parliament and the Council, especially with regard to something that seems to me to be essential, which has been pointed out by some of the speakers, that is, the problem of the periods prescribed for reply.
It is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply.
It is not always the Commission' s fault. There are times when we are relying on responses from national administrations, but it is true that in this respect we have to make an effort to improve and make an even more satisfactory contribution to the work of this committee.
I would like to highlight the importance of cooperation with other administrations. We wish to improve this cooperation as far as possible.
The Commission is open to dialogue, both with Parliament, and with the Council itself, in order to reduce the time taken to produce replies and increase transparency and communication with Parliament and the Committee on Petitions.
With regard to the Thors report, I wish to say that we agree with the need to consolidate the independence of the Ombudsman as an institution and support his work towards transparency and openness.
Clearly, we consider that the principle which motivates decisions affecting the citizens is essential and we try to apply it in a systematic way.
We also accept the definition of maladministration as being when a public body does not act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it.
Nevertheless, I wish to say that, as Mr SÃ¶derman has pointed out very well, the Ombudsman is a non-judicial body, and in that sense, it can in no way substitute judicial bodies.
Its tasks are different from those of law courts.
I believe that it is very important, in the relations between the Commission, the Ombudsman and other institutions and bodies, to systematically respect the institutional balance laid down in the Treaties.
It is true that the increasing reality of the institution of the Ombudsman, which in some ways is a younger institution than some of the other European institutions, requires some time to mature so that the citizens may become aware of it.
The Ombudsman, in his report, has indicated that the number of complaints, investigations and inquiries over the last year have increased considerably, and this is simply the result of greater awareness of the institution on the part of the citizens.
We also need time for the relations between the Ombudsman and the other institutions to mature in order to establish the desired balances and resolve the obvious tensions which may occur until things are working properly.
However, I must say that, so far, the cooperation between the Commission and the institution of the Ombudsman, represented, of course, by Mr SÃ¶derman, has been wonderful.
I would like very briefly to point out that these institutions are important because any action by an administration may at some time display a lack of transparency, a lack of efficiency, a violation of basic rights or even corruption.
However, I wish to say that in no way can we portray the Community administration as particularly laden with defects.
If we compare it with other administrations, I believe that it compares very favourably and that we score highly in these areas.
Ladies and gentlemen, finally, I would like once again to congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, on the work which he is doing, on the significant increase in his actions and his work, on his cooperation, although he sometimes makes criticisms, but that is his job and his role, and we in the Commission understand that.
The drawing up of a code of conduct applicable to the relations between Community officials and the citizens is a priority, and work is being done in that area by Mr Kinnock and the Commission in general.
With regard to the amendments of the Statute of the Ombudsman, the competent parliamentary committee must issue an opinion in accordance with Article 195 of the Treaty, and when Parliament takes the initiative, we will analyse all the relevant issues.
I would like once again to congratulate the two rapporteurs, and of course congratulate and thank Mr SÃ¶derman for the magnificent work which he is carrying out with independence and rigour.
Mr President, I am grateful to you for giving me the floor to answer questions.
Mr Turco asked about the right to complain by e-mail.
This has been possible with the European Ombudsman's office for some years now, since Mr Dell'Alba made us recognise that this would be important.
At the moment about 20% of the complaints we receive are by e-mail.
If you look at our website you will find a form which can be sent directly by e-mail.
Mr Paasilinna said the website could be developed in that direction.
We already have direct access to all national or regional ombudsman websites, but this could be further developed.
Mr Raschhofer spoke about the draft regulation on public access to documents, which has been debated.
I should like to stress that this draft regulation is now before Parliament.
The committee work can start.
In the discussions I have had with Mr Prodi he told me that he is ready to consider favourably all well-founded proposals to improve this regulation.
This is now before Parliament.
Mr MalmstrÃ¶m mentioned ignorance about the Ombudsman's office in some Member States.
Our difficulty has been that, if we make too much propaganda about ourselves, we get too many complaints falling outside our mandate.
So we try to find those citizens who have a problem with the administration and might have reason to complain.
Members of Parliament are a very important source of information for many citizens.
I would be very glad if you would take part in the work of making the opportunities for submitting petitions and complaints better known to the citizens.
Thank you kindly, Mr SÃ¶derman.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Single European sky
The next item is the report (A5-0141/2000) by Mr Atkins, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the creation of the single European sky [COM(1999) 614 - C5-0085/2000 - 2000/2053(COS)].
Mr President, we meet at a time when congestion in our skies has never been greater.
According to the statistics, the incidence of a 15-minute delay has risen from 12.7% in 1991 to 30.3% in 1999 and is still rising.
We are worried not only about the effects that congestion has in terms of inconvenience and the implications for the economic stability of our Union, but we are also concerned first and foremost about threats to safety that may result from it.
It is a fact that there is a shortage of air traffic controllers.
It is a fact that there has been a lack of investment in air traffic control systems.
The demand for air transport is rising almost daily because of cheap fares, the desire of people to travel abroad on holiday and on business or even to be able to take a few days' break at the drop of a hat has added to this pressure.
Whilst this pressure has been growing, we owe it to those working in the system to congratulate them and thank them for what they have done.
Unfortunately - and this is not entirely their fault - they are not coping with the pressures as well as we would wish: we have all had experience of that only recently, as a result of the delays caused by the strike in France.
All this, then, has a detrimental effect upon the mobility of our citizens, and in terms of the economic and financial and social costs for our businesses and a wide variety of other people affected on a day-to-day basis by what is going on.
I would like to congratulate Commissioner Palacio for having the initiative to bring this to our committee in the terms that she did, and with the force and verve that she has shown, initially, in setting up the high level group, and also in the leadership that she has given to addressing this problem.
What has been produced by the Commission is a major contribution to dealing with the saturation of airspace.
The Council of Transport Ministers needs to take a political decision to address this.
We cannot put it off any longer.
It needs attention now.
We need a single sky over a single market but at the same time we have to recognise that individual nation states have views about how these matters should be addressed, particularly insofar as they affect the livelihoods of the workforce and also the use of national airspace for military purposes.
Military airspace and its abuse in some countries is something that we also have to address not just in terms of the space that is taken up by military aircraft, but also on occasions the abuse of the civil air corridors by military aircraft not abiding by civil air procedures.
This too is an area which need to be addressed.
In this report I have proposed - and the committee has broadly accepted - a suggestion that Eurocontrol should be a regulatory body with more powers, more effective sanctions and with the right of appeal for those who are affected by it.
By the same token, we think that the provision of air traffic services should be open to liberalisation, subject to what each individual country decides is appropriate for itself.
As Members may well know, in the United Kingdom we have addressed the subject by introducing a principle of privatisation.
That may be right for us.
It may be wrong for others.
It is up to individual nation states to decide, but they must decide to address this problem of the division between regulation of their airspace on the one hand and the air service management provision that could be offered by others or other organisations.
We do believe that there should be objective and independent criteria on how the system is managed, with incentives offered for the achievers and penalties offered for those who do not meet the desired levels.
We think that passengers should be compensated for unjust delays and that their rights in these cases should be clear and well known.
But above all we wish Commissioner Palacio, with our support, to press the Council of Ministers and all those associated with this to take urgent decisions.
If there is one across-the-board criticism of the report from the industry, it is that perhaps it does not go far or fast enough.
This cannot last any longer.
We must address this issue now.
Mr President, I would like, if I may, to deliver very briefly a few comments on this report.
It seems obvious that we need to completely rethink the organisation of air traffic control in the European sky.
In this respect, the Commission' s initiative is commendable.
A re-think is one thing, it is also obvious that everything must be carefully reviewed, but I think we should beware of a certain number of preconceived ideas found in reports, communications and speeches on this topic.
It also seems obvious that the political division of the European sky no longer corresponds to the technical requirements and market requirements.
I was extremely surprised to learn that in today' s Europe, political boundaries still prevail when it comes to the organisation of air traffic control.
A European air traffic control space must be created, but must this area be completely unified, and according to which criteria?
I have many doubts as to the conclusions of the report.
It seems obvious to me that there are a number of advantages to dividing up air traffic control, as air traffic control involves segmenting the territory and technical security limits, but also human limitations mean that each air traffic controller, each control tower can only have a limited territory and a limited number of flights to monitor.
In this respect, the cellular, segmented organisation of the European territory must be retained and, in a way, improved.
I am therefore in favour of an increase in the number of air traffic control centres as, not the unification of the whole control system, but the unification of the legal system and also technological unification takes place, as this report, and the research behind the report, have highlighted the absence of European will...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to give very warm thanks to my colleague Robert Atkins for drafting such an excellent report.
He took great trouble not just to comment on the Commission' s proposals but also to outline them.
I regard the broad line of separating the regulatory from the operational function as the right one.
Indeed in paragraphs 4 and 5 we note again that our Parliament has now decided on two occasions that the regulatory function is to be transferred to the European Union.
That brings me back to the last speaker.
Of course we have to distinguish between possibly having several or many service providers in the operational field, but the regulatory function must remain with, or more to the point go to the European Union.
Nor is that in any way a problem.
Today we have 15 Member States in the European Union, and 12 more have applied to join.
If we start to proceed according to the EEA system even at this point - defining the common rules and then asking the candidate states their opinion - we can integrate them.
That is why I also think it is a good idea in the present situation for the European Commission to pool Member States' interests in regard to the regulatory function in the framework of Eurocontrol.
We do not need multilingualism, we need unanimity on the question of the regulatory function.
I really would strongly urge the Commissioner to refer the proposals Parliament will be deciding on today back to the High Level Group and to continue ensuring that this working group produces very sound practical results.
We have great respect for the vice-president, for she set up this group of military and civilian experts and the work is progressing well.
There may still be some resistance in individual countries.
We wish the vice-president much luck and success, so that come October we can submit an excellent programme.
Mr President, can I first of all, on behalf of the Party of European Socialists, welcome the Commissioner's initiative.
We share her objectives, we support her aims.
However, we do perhaps regret the lack of integration with other initiatives that she is pursuing, which is apparent if one reads her communication.
We also note the lack of political will that exists within both the Commission and the Council, although it is worth perhaps reminding ourselves that this initiative started with the Council in June last year when it requested the Commissioner to bring forward this communication.
Indeed in March of this year, the Council in Lisbon sought further progress, progress which I am sure we would all endorse.
The Party of European Socialists also supports and indeed welcomes the rapporteur's carefully judged position.
It is subsidiarity in action: European where necessary, national where possible.
I would like to thank him personally for taking on board many of our concerns, not least in the area of safety, which I acknowledge is now the number one priority for him in his report.
The key concerns of the PSE include a regret at the lack of analysis of the real cause of air traffic delays.
Airports' runway capacity, airline planning, passenger behaviour, airport infrastructure, as well as the shortage of controllers which was mentioned by the rapporteurs.
A second concern of ours is this key principle, which we support and which needs to be developed further, namely the separation of regulation from service providers.
That has to be a key building block of our new approach.
Eurocontrol too must be reformed and revamped and relaunched.
The third principle we support is liberalisation but not privatisation; and fourth and finally we want to see these proposals developed in conjunction with the proposed European Aviation Safety Authority.
Indeed, above all, safety first should be our guiding rule, and I am sure it will be our guiding principle in the months to come.
Between 1986 and 1996 air traffic in Europe doubled.
It will double again in the coming ten years.
We need to tackle this issue urgently and swiftly but in a coherent way.
What we want to hear perhaps from the Commissioner today is a clear timetable from her as to the speed at which she will be acting in the months to come.
We all know there will be people waiting in airport lounges this summer asking, why their plane is delayed, not for minutes but for hours.
Hopefully the Commissioner today can bring forward a timetable for when those delays will cease.
I look forward to her comments, particularly bringing this Parliament up to date on the conclusions last week of the Council which received the interim report of the high level group.
I urge colleagues to back the rapporteur's proposal and I urge the Commissioner to bring forward a very clear timetable.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Sir Robert Atkins has, in my view, compiled a sound report.
He clearly indicated the direction we need to take, because we find ourselves in an absurd situation where we have a unified market for aviation but over and above that, we have an airspace, which has been divided up in an illogical manner.
A number of MEPs have already described the effects of that.
It is obvious that, if we want a single sky, we need to make investments, as the report clearly states.
Thousands of people need to be recruited and investments made in technical infrastructure.
As such, it is clear that money has to be earmarked for this.
It also means, and I believe that this aspect is more complex, that political decisions need to be taken very quickly. And in reality, these can only go in one direction.
We need to tackle the issue at European level.
We are all agreed that Member States need to finally decide for themselves what they want do.
National airline services also need to realise that their time is up, that we need to lift services to European level rather than national, as this is the root of the evil, if I can put it that way.
Needless to say, services need to come first, because air-traffic control does not exist in isolation. It is a service to airline companies and its customers.
People sometimes overlook this aspect and only focus on their own patch.
If we talk about services within a unified market, this means, of course, that monopolies are then a thing of the past, that we need clear European legislation and that we must move away from monopolies in the service industry.
We are all agreed on this, and I therefore hope that we can make good progress.
An important point, as Mr Watts has already pointed out, is safety.
Nobody should compromise on safety.
As such, Commissioner, what matters more than anything is that once the high-level group has published its findings in October, we need to receive proposals from yourself as quickly as possible. I do not think that this will cause any problems for you.
Then, everyone will need to put pressure on the Council of Ministers, Member States will need to take decisions that need to be taken and take the course which we have indicated a few times in the European Parliament and which is once again highlighted in Sir Robert Atkins' report.
Mr President, the report deals with the problem of increasing air traffic.
I want to focus on just one aspect of this report or, more specifically, on a major omission from it.
A number of proposals are put forward but for me the problem with this report is its main thesis that congestion can just be solved with the liberalisation of the air traffic management and control system.
What the options are doing is focusing on technical fixes, not the underlying trends.
Certainly a single European sky would increase the efficiency with which European air space is used.
Improvements in air traffic management would make more space available.
Restricting the use of military air space would also make a significant difference.
But none of these technical fixes are going to make a long-term impact unless we address the underlying problem, which is the unsustainable growth of air traffic.
By failing to link the issue of congestion with air traffic reduction the report misses out on a vital strategy.
It can be compared to rearranging buckets under the tap to stop a flood without considering the possibility of at least turning down the tap a little to reduce the flow of water.
Consider the facts.
The Commission's recent report has already said the growth of the aviation sector is unsustainable and must be reversed and that growth is forecast to double in the next 15 years.
That causes major congestion problems but it also causes major environmental problems as well - not only the noise and pollution for people living around the airports but also the impact on global climate.
Air transport is already the world's fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions and could account for up to 15% by the year 2050.
Unfortunately this report fails to make the vital link between congestion and air traffic reduction and therefore misses a vital opportunity to address these problems in a lasting manner.
Mr President, Commissioner, I think there is some ambiguity regarding the expression "single European sky" , because air traffic control is in fact, as you are well aware, already a European field of activity.
There is already a European system for controlling the air space with Eurocontrol and there is already a body, the Central Flow Management Unit, based in Brussels.
This is not perfect, of course, but they do already exist.
The situation must therefore be improved starting with the statement, which is patently obvious, that delays have increased and that with traffic on the rise, they will become worse.
It is recognised that there are many causes of delays but, in the end, I find that we are facing an offensive presenting air traffic control as the only reason for delays.
I believe it would be sensible also to concentrate far more on the problems of types of plane, types of flow, stopovers and of course the continuing defence-related problems.
I feel as if we are involved in a headlong pursuit to implement solutions that seem obvious, but that do not take account of the specificity of air traffic control.
Mr Zimeray said this earlier: yes, a plane journey is divided into different areas and the denser the traffic, the more divisions there are.
Why?
Because dividing things into different areas is the human way of controlling or managing a number of aircraft.
Therefore, in my opinion, thinking that there would be too many control centres is nonsense.
Why not say in that case that there are too many aircraft?
In addition, as far as I know, there are no specific air traffic control hold-ups at borders either.
The great proposal that is put to us for improving traffic consists of separating regulatory and control functions.
But what is the value of such a measure?
It may well be necessary to consider more relevant divisions, why not?
But that is not what is being proposed.
The separation of functions would lead to the liberalisation of air traffic service provision, establishing, as indeed the Atkins report states, a liberalised internal market.
Air traffic control is not an airline, nor is it a market sector.
Let it not be forgotten that its main function is to ensure safety.
I believe, however, that it is contrary to the interests of safety to subject aircraft control and monitoring bodies to market pressure.
The ability to invest in new technological tools and training must therefore be safeguarded.
In France - and I am not trying to make France a model - there is a general directorate that governs everything and, in the past few years, investments have been made and air traffic controllers have been recruited.
The system is highly effective.
On what grounds would you want to break...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, this report takes as its starting point an observation which is familiar to all Members of the European Parliament, as frequent users of aircraft as a means of transport: the skies are becoming more and more congested as a result of the growing demand for this form of transport.
This surfeit of aircraft inevitably goes hand in hand with delays in air traffic, causing frustration for passengers, for companies, for business and for tourism.
We share the rapporteur' s opinion that air transport must be seen as a coherent system of operators, airports and air traffic control services, the component parts of which are directly interlinked and that only a study of this system as a whole will solve the problems of airspace capacity.
We therefore welcome the creation of the High Level Working Group, comprising both civilian and military representatives and chaired by Commissioner de Palacio, who has committed herself to studying the issue of flight delays with a view to minimising the problems they cause.
She will in due course be submitting a report on this issue to the Council.
Our hope is that this final report will focus on drawing up viable proposals and practical, realistic and effective solutions to the problem of air traffic delays in Europe. We also hope that this report will abandon controversial suggestions that contribute very little to achieving this, such as advocating unrestricted competition between providers of air traffic management services.
We fail to see the connection between this so-called liberalisation and the issue of delays, which must be resolved as a matter of urgency.
Furthermore, any proposed solutions must respect the national sovereignty of the Member States and restrict the centralisation of regulatory action to absolutely essential matters. Any proposed solutions must also safeguard the particular requirements of defence and the specific military needs of each country and honour the commitments that all countries have made in the framework of international organisations.
This does not mean that those countries are not obliged to make air traffic in high air space as flexible as possible and to seek more efficient ways of linking this with military operational needs.
The European air management programme, whose purpose is to achieve complete coordination and integration of ATM systems at European level, must also continue to be expanded under Eurocontrol. The programme must be continued, because the problem lies not so much in the way air space is divided up, which could perhaps be justified in terms of ensuring that there is an appropriate number of aircraft and routes for each controller, as in the technical harmonisation of ATM systems.
Mr President, this is a valuable report: it deals with a very sensitive and, I would say, extremely technical issue, although the problem is essentially political.
There has been talk of the fact that there are too many aircraft in the sky, that one controller has too many aircraft to deal with, etc., but we need only look at the United States of America, which is the most advanced country in the world in terms of aeronautics, where these problems are dealt with and, although they may not be completely resolved, adequate solutions have been found.
One basic fact stands out in particular: the United States only operates one central air traffic control system while in Europe there are still 15 separate control systems.
We also have to take Switzerland into account as well as the border countries. All these factors are difficulties which we will have to overcome.
It is therefore right to call for a single air traffic control system, at least for the whole of the European Union, which clearly needs to include Switzerland for technical reasons.
This is the basic point and it will enable us to resolve a number of difficulties as well as promote technical development, and here I am referring to the TCAS, GPS and GNNS systems, which clearly facilitate a more even flow of air traffic.
I would like to finish by expressing some doubts regarding the application of the principle of subsidiarity: it is a fundamental principle but one which is not always easy to apply.
Along with shipping regulations, air transport and air traffic regulations could genuinely be described as the most international rules in existence, and it is therefore difficult to break the matter down into different areas of responsibility.
One last thing: I see that the report principally targets the large air carriers and airlines.
Let us not disregard other air space users such as air-taxis, private companies and private users flying club aircraft.
Mr President, Commissioner, securing a place in the transport market is an uphill struggle.
This is certainly true if the competition is fierce, the pressure is on, there are worldwide cooperatives and external cost items are considerable.
This is the situation which the aviation sector currently faces.
We need to consider the future of the sector for the reasons set out above.
In my opinion, we should not accept unlimited growth as a fait accompli.
It is true that certain freight cannot be transported in a way other than by air, but the vast majority of freight can.
We should tailor our policy accordingly.
This, however, requires long-term efforts and specific, effective investments in alternatives.
We are not that far advanced yet. Indeed, the development of the Trans-European Networks has been a mixed success.
We now need to look for alternative solutions in the short-term.
In my view, what matters most is using the available space in the most effective way, both in terms of airspace and aircraft, which requires both personnel and organisational measures, as pointed out by the rapporteur.
By creating one single European sky, we will provisionally have enough airspace to allow us to come up with structural measures to impede the unbridled growth of aviation, based on the current state of affairs.
After all, this is what needs to be done if we want to realise the ambitions of a sustainable transport policy.
It is important not only to facilitate, but also to restrict where necessary.
Although the rapporteur' s initiatives are sound, it is early days and we should not rest on our laurels.
We should keep thinking about the future of the transport sector and aviation, in particular.
Mr Atkins' report addresses an issue which is perhaps the most important issue which either Mrs de Palacio or we in the European Parliament will have to deal with over the next four or five years and I must start by congratulating Mr Atkins on his approach in this specific report.
Despite which, there is clearly a huge problem here.
Overall delays in flights have risen from 12.7% in 1991 to 30% in 1999.
By 2010, the number of flights will have more or less doubled, resulting in wasted time, financial loss, saturation and, hence, safety risks.
Eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic.
It is therefore absolutely essential that Vice-President de Palacio take decisive action, as she has done so far, in order to establish a real single European sky.
The Member States must overcome their perhaps justified anxiety as regards the management of their airspace and, at some point, must take a longer-term view of newly-emerging needs which goes beyond their borders and beyond the present situation.
We need to take immediate action and to regulate the myriad technical details, such as relations between civil and military aviation.
In the meantime, however, passengers must be compensated for delays by airlines and must, of course, be apprised of their rights.
I should like to close my intervention by reminding the House that, when the European Parliament voted on the report for the Intergovernmental Conference, it took view that the regulatory operation of air traffic in Europe, in our Member States, should be taken over by the European Union.
Mr President, I thank Mr Atkins for his report and also for his willingness to cooperate and work with not only my group but other groups in coming up with this document.
There is no doubt that air traffic control delays are a problem.
A visit to any of the major airports at this time of year will make that obvious.
I hear that the average delay is said to be 20 minutes.
All I can say from my experience is that somebody must be picking on Manchester very badly because I have not yet flown with Sabena from Brussels to Manchester when we have ever got anywhere near a 20-minute delay.
I can safely say that the timetable now is just a mere guide, not a definitive object, when planning travel.
It is a clear problem that we need to address.
The report must consider all the issues involving air traffic and adopt a twofold approach as proposed by the Commission.
But not all delays are due to air traffic controls.
It is the greatest cop-out in the world for airlines to say to passengers that the delay is caused by air traffic.
There is never anybody from the air traffic controllers in the airport to turn around and say that is not true.
Frankly, a lot of the delays are caused by the inefficiencies of some of the airlines themselves.
Passengers go missing.
It never ceases to amaze me the number of passengers that go missing in airports!
What do these people get up to, I ask myself?
Invariably they cause delays as much as air traffic.
The issue of Eurocontrol is important.
We support the compromise that is made in point 8 with regard to Eurocontrol.
We also support the need for the military to give up some of their air space.
Finally, there are some TDI amendments with this.
I am particularly interested in Amendment No 24.
I can only assume that the TDI group must...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report.
Experiences from last Monday reconfirm that this is a very important report indeed.
Many Members of Parliament had a journey here to Strasbourg of up to fifteen hours.
Flights were cancelled, and many were severely delayed.
This situation is absolutely intolerable. Airspace is badly congested, flights are continually late and the rights of air passengers are totally non-existent.
The report proposes relevant action that must be put into effect right away.
However, I do not believe that it will be sufficient, as air traffic is expected to double over the next ten years.
Short flight routes must be withdrawn in favour of rail, leaving room for longer flights, as there are simply no alternatives to these.
Reports aimed at improving the competitiveness of rail transport are, from this point of view, very important.
Environmental levies, which are being planned for air traffic, should not constrict long flights unfairly, but should work as an incentive to withdraw short flights in favour of rail.
Mr President, Commissioner, with globalisation we have discovered with pleasure that, above all, aeroplanes can take us from our own city to any corner of the world, and we have enjoyed this so much that we can no longer live without flying.
However, just as we discovered the congestion of our cities by motor vehicle, it is now airspace which is becoming clogged too frequently. We regularly suffer delays, we lose our luggage and we have suffered all kinds of work-to-rule or trade union strikes.
We passengers believe that we must establish and defend our rights and manage our airlines, airports, flight timetables and air traffic control better.
However, we often also think that we have to share the sovereignty of the air more amongst all the Europeans and that there is a large section of the airspace with is reserved which we do not take social advantage of in the way that our times demand.
Therefore, as well as reforming Eurocontrol, increasing the number of radio communication frequencies and implementing new and better technologies for tracking so that more air corridors and more planes can be fitted in, in these days of normality it is necessary for civil commercial aviation to be able to use the reserved spaces, especially in the highest quotas and highest altitudes, which do not usually have too much military use.
The citizens demand it and I believe that it is possible to find a solution which is perfectly valid for all, sharing - I insist - sovereignty and the reserved space used by military aircraft.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, like the rapporteur and the previous speaker I think we urgently need to take the appropriate measures to tackle and eventually put a stop to the constant increase in delays in European air traffic.
The discussion in committee and again here in plenary today keeps centring on the best ways and means of changing air traffic management.
Sir Robert Atkins, for whose expertise I have enormous regard, and a majority in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism believe the prime way to achieve this objective is through liberalisation measures.
Liberalisation will without doubt increase the number of providers, but it will not resolve certain problems and will even create new ones.
Firstly, so long as the Member States give precedence to their justified national interests over the general European interest in regard to the coordination and use of European airspace, we will see no radical changes.
Secondly, that is another reason for Eurocontrol' s poor efficiency.
No matter whether the regulatory and control bodies are separated or not, whether you liberalise or privatise, so long as there is no political will to accept that European airspace issues can only be approached on a pan-European basis, another ten reports will not help either!
Thirdly, priority must be given to the civil use of airspace.
In a peaceful and united Europe there is not one logical reason for reserving a large part of airspace for the military.
Fourthly, do you not agree that if we make a kind of fetish out of liberalisation, it is highly likely that there will be fewer and fewer service providers for less lucrative routes and that there cannot be fair competition unless we lay down binding, uniform, social and security standards?
Fifthly, we do not need the Commission to use its influence on national governments in the event of domestic industrial disputes, as called for in paragraph 14 of the report; we need a smoothly running social dialogue between all the players involved in air traffic!
Mr President, Mr Atkins' report raises a number of real problems in the development of the air travel system in Europe.
First of all, the matter of safety.
The strikes that sometimes disrupt traffic take thousands of passengers hostage without proper warning.
Increasing numbers of intolerable delays are not, as has already been stated, solely due to overcrowding in the sky, but to also the airlines' attempt, for reasons of cost-effectiveness, to rotate their planes with excessively short, unreasonable and ultimately impossible turnarounds.
The report, however, omits to bring up one fundamental issue: the issue of traffic rights.
At the present time, it is extremely difficult for a European company with a line serving, for example, Paris, Houston and San Francisco, to board passengers in California, as this is legally considered as cabotage, whereas an American company serving New York, Madrid or Paris, may board passengers in Spain for disembarkation in Europe.
It is in the international negotiation of traffic rights that this concept of European air space...
(The President cut the speaker off)
Mr President, it has been noted that air transport is increasingly accessible to a greater number of our fellow citizens.
This democratisation is admittedly welcome, but raises important questions for the future: increased traffic, overcrowded airports, congested skies and lack of respect for the environment, in particular in terms of noise pollution.
The desire to create optimum air traffic control in Europe is based on good intentions, but why should the Commission challenge the air policies of the Member States and their bilateral agreements through a single air space?
Of course, I agree, on the one hand, with the goal of rationalising the movement of aircraft and, on the other hand, with the goal of aiming for improved traffic flow, while fully respecting consumer protection and passenger safety.
I would like to believe Mrs Palacio when she assures us that, and I quote, there is "no reference to creating competition between air traffic control services or their privatisation in the works of the Commission" .
But in that case, the staff concerned would have no justifiable need of trade unions?
The Commission is demanding the advent of a proper air traffic management authority, a strong regulatory authority. I say no.
No to a complete overhaul of Eurocontrol.
No to a new regulatory structure - after all, the current system effectively organises, particularly with regard to safety, a balanced flow of traffic while respecting the national systems which all states are entitled to. No to the Commission representing the Member States with regard to external States, thereby destroying any political decision-making power in the field of air transport.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, both the Commission' s communication and the rapporteur' s report, which is magnificent, are in line with the European Council of Lisbon, which asked the Commission for a series of specific proposals as soon as possible.
It is now for the Council to take the necessary and urgent political decisions which will allow the single aviation market to be supplemented with a single air traffic control system.
The growth in demand currently stands at between 5% and 7% and it seems that it will follow the same trend over the next few years. This makes it even more difficult for the European air management systems to do their work, since they have shown themselves to be incapable of dealing with this development and they are the cause of 50% of delays, although it is true that there are other causes, such as the limitations of the airports and flight schedules which do not take account of the limitations of the infrastructures.
Another cause which makes the current system ineffective is the different organisation of the civil system and the military system, as well as the different standards of technical equipment on the ground.
The airspace must be accessible under the same conditions for general, commercial and military aviation, which does not mean that we should not give priority, or indeed exclusive access, to the military in the event of crises.
However, the mere fact that a crisis may occur does not mean that certain Member States can justify maintaining the conditions which prevailed during the cold war.
It is necessary for the civil and military controllers in the control centres to work in close cooperation.
There is a clear need to achieve more effective cooperation between the different users of the airspace, and I believe that that cooperation and a joint approach should be sought at European level.
I congratulate the rapporteur and the Vice-President of the Commission for the opinions they share on an issue which is so important and so sensitive in the daily lives of our citizens.
Mr Atkins' report is detailed and balanced, and it presents the current and correct position of this House.
Lastly, Madam Vice-President, please take note that we are aware of your efforts and we will support you in the line you have taken.
Mr President, I must express major reservations with regard to the Atkins report as it bears the stamp of commercial interests concealed behind the best of intentions.
In actual fact, the airlines would like the air traffic control sector to be completely liberalised, not so much for reasons of safety, interoperability or reducing delays as to be able to access a market of air traffic control services that would enable the more powerful among them to purchase more expensive, secure slots and leave the problem of delays to other airlines and private aviation.
Under cover of a single sky, such liberalisation would actually offer us a multispeed sky.
I have no other way of explaining the witch hunt undertaken in this report with regard to civil air traffic control alone.
We all know that this only represents 30% of delays, which admittedly are worth combating, but which essentially depend on military constraints.
This is a political problem that depends first and foremost on politicians.
We all know that the considerable increase in air traffic is the main underlying cause of overcrowded and saturated skies.
We all know that the number of runways and landing platforms would have to be reduced in order to have any chance of a break, a simple break in the saturation.
Finally, in my country, the airlines have chosen to set up shuttles that send a dozen low-capacity aircraft from each provincial French town every morning between 6.00 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. to Paris alone.
Is it the fault of air traffic control if they refuse to allow all these flights to land simultaneously in Paris?
These are the fundamental causes of air delays.
Naturally, the single sky must be set up through a reformed Eurocontrol and harmonised control services at European level.
However, personally I cannot imagine collective safety services that are dictated by profit alone, controlled by shareholders.
In addition, I cannot imagine tomorrow' s single European sky becoming an sky shared unfairly between airlines.
Commissioner, I hope that, in preparing the future directive on the single sky, the Commission will be able to handle this matter by taking a calmer and more impartial overall view.
Mr President, I am acting as the representative of the air traffic controllers protesting against the European Commission proposal which, in the name of the attractive slogan "single European sky" , will clear the way for the privatisation of air traffic control.
The Atkins report clears the way for the monopoly of private groups that have their eye on air traffic control which, with the increase in traffic, is likely to make money.
This reports mentions delays, which are, apparently, increasingly frequent.
But how would subjecting air traffic control to the requirements of private profit possibly put an end to delays?
It is precisely the airlines' quest for profit that has led them to make the choices that cause these delays.
It is in the interests of passengers and their safety, and in the interests of employees in this sector for air traffic control to remain a public service, dedicated exclusively to ensuring the smooth running of air traffic.
Competition and the quest for profit in an area as sensitive as air traffic control will inevitably lead to disaster.
If it is necessary to put an end to national peculiarities with regard to air traffic management, and if it is legitimate to unify the European air space, this must be achieved by rejecting any idea of privatisation, competition, or quest for profitability, and we will vote against this report.
Mr President, I really must congratulate my colleague, Sir Robert Atkins of the British Conservative Party, on his most excellent report on the Single European Sky.
This proves beyond doubt that the overarching ambition of the European Union is a single nation with its single national flag, its single national anthem, its single legal space, its single national borders and now the citizens of Europe will soon be able to breath single European air.
However, after the failure of the single land policy, known as the CAP, the single sea policy, known as the CFP, we can now look forward to a similar failure of the single sky policy.
Not least, given the number of strikes in air traffic control, I suppose we can now look forward to the single European strike.
But you have struck a real blow for the Eurosceptic movement in the UK, Sir Robert, I congratulate you.
Mr President, It is quite true to say that air traffic delays need to be urgently addressed.
However, it is also worth noting that 33% of ATM delays recorded between January and June 1999 were mostly due to temporary capacity reductions associated not least with the Kosovo crisis.
The real problem lies in the sectors straddling areas north and south which include Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, parts of Germany, Maastricht upper-air space and these are responsible for 44% air traffic flow management delays and 30 bottlenecks.
At one time, Greece was part of that problem.
However, the impressive results by the Greeks goes to show that the improvements can be made if there is strong action and real cooperation by national governments.
All too often Eurocontrol is used as the scapegoat and is blamed for the present situation, but the real blame must lie with the inaction of national governments in the areas that I have outlined.
It is quite clear that the European Transport Council must take immediate action to ensure that the air traffic control decisions are applied by all Member States Europe-wide.
It should be remembered that Eurocontrol is the only pan-European institution in the air traffic management domain and must be supported.
Finally, one issue that was raised - the critical shortage of manpower to the tune of 1,000 air traffic controllers throughout Europe - needs to be urgently addressed by national governments.
That in itself will go a long way to improving flow control.
In addition, both airports and airlines need to look closely at their practices, as they too are responsible far too often for the high percentage of delays incurred.
Mr President, allow me to begin by offering my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Atkins, for a powerful presentation, to the Commission for making this issue one of its priorities and to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs De Palacio, for daring to translate words into action.
This has meant that the question of a single air traffic control has, in a short time, come closer to a solution perhaps than ever before.
Of course, there still remains much to be done.
In particular, a number of reluctant Member States need to be convinced, but that is precisely why it is so incredibly important for the European Parliament to give the Commission its full support today for the continuation of the work.
We are, of course, in the middle of yet another chaotic summer for flights.
The development we are now seeing will result in a doubling of air traffic in the years following 2010.
This assumes that we have had the necessary political decisions.
Otherwise we not only run the risk of congestion in the air leading in the future to 15, 30 or 60 minutes' delay, which we can perhaps put up with, but are also in danger of no longer being certain of ensuring safety.
This is something we must never put up with.
It is in this light that Mr Atkins' report and the Commission' s presentation must be seen.
The EU has spent a considerable amount of time and energy on tearing down borders and creating a single market.
Everyone who travels a mile up in the air - and we are there quite often - can nevertheless see that there are borders everywhere.
The report lays down an extremely tight timetable.
I share this ambition.
Let us together ensure that the summer of 2000 is the last summer with chaos in the skies over Europe.
The Commission can actually achieve this with the help of the Atkins report.
Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, there has hardly ever been such a topical report as this one.
Just in time before the summer break, when everyone goes on holiday and more and more people also travel by plane, today Parliament is considering questions of air traffic.
A tiresome subject, as we all know, and as every air traveller finds out.
We all suffer from delays that often last hours.
It has now become a daily scene at airports to see every passage-way overcrowded with bored, irritable or even aggressive passengers.
It happens to us MEPs very frequently, as it does to much of the population during the holidays.
Let me remind you of another aspect.
When aircraft cannot land on time, that not only creates a great many personal difficulties for people on business trips who have to keep to their schedules but also produces extra costs and environmental pollution.
So I welcome the fact that the Commission has submitted a report on these important subjects and that a High Level Group was set up to consider the problems of establishing a single European sky.
I hope we will have the final results of its inquiries before us in good time in the autumn so that we can then really move on to taking concrete measures jointly with the Commission.
The safety aspect comes top of the list for all passengers, but especially for frequent fliers.
Safety standards must on no account be endangered.
That is why we need better airspace control and protection.
Eurocontrol must satisfy all these safety requirements, but that means we also have to create the necessary framework conditions.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 12 noon.
Health and safety of pregnant workers
The next item is the report (A5-0155/2000) by Mrs DamiÃ£o, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the report from the Commission on the implementation of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding.
The legislative instrument that we are considering today in the evaluation report referred to us by the Commission has run its course as far as contractual rights and social security systems are concerned.
Thousands of female workers in various countries in the Union have benefited from it, but it is now out of date.
It is out of date because the 1952 ILO convention has just been revised and there is an expectation that most countries in the world will substantially improve their maternity protection.
It was and still is, of course, hoped that the Union will continue to be in the vanguard in social terms, in this area as in others.
But not everything is out of date, because in terms of organisation of work, there have been shortcomings in transposing the directive and even greater shortcomings in implementing it.
In most countries, the three stages of job organisation are not being respected. These stages are: the employer should adjust the working conditions and/or hours of the worker to avoid exposure to risk; if that fails, the worker should be moved to another job; only if neither option is possible should the worker be granted leave, as this reduces the worker' s income and also her career opportunities.
By way of example, I must tell you that in some countries, not even a minimum period of recuperation is allowed for the mother, which the experts say should be around 45 days for a normal birth for a woman working in a normal job.
Nevertheless, there are countries that are not complying with these rules at all, on the pretext that they are guaranteeing women a choice.
We think that women must be guaranteed the option of enjoying an appropriate period of maternity leave, which they can share with the father, but that the leave should be assessed and guaranteed according to the risk to her own health.
Furthermore, this directive does not provide for a link between its own risk assessment provisions and other directives, particularly the framework directive on risk assessment and information for workers.
Since there is no such link, employment of women is subject to unfair criticism because the costs of maternity-related risks apply exclusively to young women of childbearing age.
These risks are being underestimated and should not be a matter for the employer or constitute an obligation on the employer only when the woman' s doctor informs the employer of her condition.
Firstly, because this is too late: risks from radiation, chemically-charged atmospheres and poor working posture are well known now and all have harmful consequences for the health of the woman and her baby, particularly in the first few weeks.
Secondly, these measures do nothing to protect the reproductive health of men and women. There is a considerable degree of infertility in the Union today: over 11% of European couples suffer from such problems, which result from lifestyles shaped by the economic structures within which we live, and also by the fact that measures are not in place to provide protection against these dangers.
An example of this is the extreme temperatures that cause infertility in women and men.
The Union, which is today in a position to do so, should draw up and implement legislation to this end. With regard to maternity leave, we are aware of the costs to economic activity of proposals to extend this leave.
We also know that these costs are much higher when employing women, but health specialists recommend that a baby should remain at home for at least five months, protected from the outside world and, above all, growing up in a suitable psychological and emotional environment, which will provide it with the necessary balance for growing up with a sense of security, because it needs its parents.
Parental leave should therefore be extended, and, if healthily divided between the parents, will benefit them both.
The directive should also take the informal economy and atypical employment contracts into consideration.
Finally, I hope that the Commission will tell us what it is intending to do in this area, now that it has an extended legal basis, which includes Article 13 and ex Article 118. This means that it can certainly cover other aspects mentioned in the report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs DamiÃ£o has drafted a very good report and taken good account in it of my opinion for the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities.
It is most important to everyone to improve the health and safety protection at the workplace for women who are pregnant, have recently given birth or are breastfeeding, both to protect the woman and to protect the unborn child.
This is a general social issue and must be treated with the greatest care.
The Commission' s report on the 1992 directive is only concerned with the technical transposition of the directive and does not look at the situation at the workplace, which has to some extent changed, or at the changed role of women in society.
The number of single parents has risen and women are more concerned with achieving economic independence.
The Commission must submit a proposal for revision of the directive that takes account of all these changes, and it must do so as quickly as possible, this very year.
There is a considerable need to improve the legislation.
That applies to preventive health protection measures at the workplace for the mother and for the unborn child.
Here we must avoid any risks.
Any activity that puts their health at risk should without exception be prohibited.
Periods allowed for breastfeeding should be regulated and there should be facilities for breastfeeding at the workplace.
Maternity leave after the birth of the child should be at least eight weeks.
There must be clear rules on financial support, both for the period of pregnancy leave and for maternity leave.
The question of reinstatement also needs to be clarified.
None of these necessary provisions must lead to discrimination against women or to a reduction of their chances of access to the workplace.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating the implementation of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992, which is one of the most important directives in the field of the technical and health protection of workers.
I well remember its genesis and the problems that were discussed at the time.
A positive aspect is that at that time, irrespective of the dispute about the legal basis, its importance to women workers in the single market was recognised and a first step was taken towards establishing minimum standards for the protection of pregnant workers and new mothers.
The Commission report before us continues to show up weaknesses in the implementation of the directive, which means we must increase our efforts to establish the protection of women during a special period of their life in law and in practice.
Really it is very sad for a society to find we have to pay much greater attention to this area in particular.
So I support the call to revise the directive as soon as possible.
However, we will not manage it by the end of the year 2000.
Some of the demands that will have to be incorporated in a proposal for a revision of the directive are set out in the draft amendments before us, and the PPE Group can therefore support at least some of them.
First and foremost, they include the call for a strict prohibition on dismissal during pregnancy and maternity leave, safeguards to ensure that on expiry of their leave the women will be reinstated in their job or given a comparable one and effective penalties for those who infringe that prohibition.
For women who want to or have to reconcile working life and motherhood, anything else would mean penalising or unjustifiably discriminating against them in their occupational and private life.
Seen in these terms, the effective protection of pregnant workers and new mothers is one of the most important contributions to an active family policy.
With a view to eastward enlargement and protection in those countries, let me also point out that the single market must not lead to discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers.
Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her thorough, responsible and unreserved report.
This is an extremely sensitive issue which is closely related to other matters which are regularly referred to such as the ageing population, the demographic trend, the low birth rate, the right to health, the right to work, the right to motherhood and the social value of motherhood. This matter cannot be viewed as affecting women alone: they must be protected and supported by society.
The 1992 directive, whose implementation in the Member States we are assessing today, is intended precisely to introduce minimum measures to encourage the improvement of the health and safety of pregnant women and women who have recently given birth and are breastfeeding.
The Commission's evaluation report shows that the directive has proved its utility in that it has been of some benefit in a number of Member States in certain areas of the issue, such as leave on grounds of health and safety, etc. However, apart from these points, which are of a general nature, we share the rapporteur's criticism of the Commission's report.
This report was overdue and limited almost exclusively to dealing with legal and technical transposition.
There is a lack of concrete statistics and data on vital aspects of the directive, such as the monitoring of workplace risk assessment for pregnant workers and the frequency of work-related accidents and illnesses, and satisfactory information is not provided on the coordination of legislative adaptation of specialist inspection, penalties or scientific research for the detection, prevention, elimination and recuperation of professional hazards relating to pregnancy.
We feel that there has been a lack of serious monitoring on the part of the Commission. There has been a lack of coordination between the health and safety directorate and the equal opportunities unit, and the ambiguity of the directive itself in this area has become apparent.
The delay in the production of an evaluation report - and I would remind you that, precisely because of the low minimum standards set, Italy was only persuaded to approve the directive on the condition that its implementation would be monitored very soon afterwards - should have led the Commission to put forward a proposal to revise the directive, particularly in relation to certain aspects referred to by the rapporteur: the length of maternity leave, the increase in the duration of maternity leave where risks are involved, a more precise definition of the concept of an adequate allowance, the prohibition of dismissal of women during pregnancy or maternity leave with effective penalties, the prohibition of any form of discrimination with regard to women's careers or the improvement of working conditions, the implementation of all the measures necessary to safeguard the health and safety of woman and unborn child, without prejudice to the woman's right to work or her career and encouraging breastfeeding through diverse measures.
In addition to taking all the necessary compatibilities into consideration, when they revise the directive, the Commission and the Member States should be motivated by the principle of non-discrimination and the recognition of motherhood and fatherhood as fundamental rights which are essential for a balanced society.
Mr President, it is important that women have good and secure conditions during pregnancy and childbirth so that mother and child have a good start, and it is important that pregnancy and childbirth do not reduce women' s opportunities in the labour market.
We have a directive from 1992 which establishes minimum rights for maternity leave and women' s entitlements to financial compensation when they are absent from the labour market due to childbirth.
The Commission has now investigated the Member States' implementation of this directive and, in her report, Mrs DamiÃ£o quite correctly points out that the Commission' s report contains only a technical and factual assessment of the directive' s implementation and does not provide an evaluation of whether the directive in practice provides pregnant women or women who have just given birth with better conditions.
She does not, therefore, think that the Commission' s report provides an adequate basis for carrying out a review of the directive.
I very much agree with the rapporteur about this.
I am, therefore, also opposed to our requesting a review of the directive now.
I do not think we should demand a new draft directive which contains the right to a longer period of leave, together with demands for longer enforced leave, and which lays down more detailed requirements for financial compensation in a way that does not take the necessary account of the differences between the Member States' social systems.
The existing rules make for great flexibility, and most countries guarantee women better conditions than the common regulations require.
It might be wondered whether new regulations would mean very much in practice.
In any case, maternity leave and financial aid ought to be given priority in the individual countries.
However, I think it would be a good idea to obtain a better overview of what the circumstances are in the different countries so that governments can learn from each other' s good and bad experiences and inspire each other.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is required to submit a directive proposal on measures for workers during pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding by the end of 2000.
The assessment of the existing measures, which was intended to lead to change, is four years behind schedule and fails to meet the requirements which the European Parliament prescribed at the time.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calls for an increase in the level of protection.
The report mainly focuses on institutional aspects.
In our opinion, this report should also embrace the right to return back to work to the same or an equivalent job after maternity leave.
We are asking for the rights of pregnant and breastfeeding women to be extended.
In practice, women are often discriminated against during this period, despite rights on paper.
This is why we call for a reversal of the burden of proof.
Employers will need to demonstrate that any dismissal or change of job is not linked to pregnancy.
Finally, we would like the Commission to explain why at the recent ILO conference, the Member States failed to adopt the common positions.
How is it possible that the United Kingdom abstained from the final vote, which, in view of the procedure, is tantamount to voting against?
We would like to close by thanking Mrs DamiÃ£o for the work she has carried out.
Mr President, at a time when Europe, with the Beijing +5 Conference in New York, is emphasising its pioneering role in the implementation of the principle of equality between men and women, it seems equally important to guarantee their freedom.
This freedom is achieved through a right to specific protection for women, a right that is always related to their bodies, in particular to maternity and, more specifically, pregnancy.
We are therefore pleased with Mrs DamiÃ£o' s excellent report, which highlights the urgent need to revise the 1992 directive.
Her request for a formal ban on dismissal during pregnancy is essential, and I will dwell only on this point.
It seems to me to be dangerous to allow employers any leeway in this field, as they will always use it to their advantage.
Today, with the revision of Convention 103, the ILO is levelling down the protection of pregnant women, by accepting certain dismissals that are said to be unrelated to pregnancy.
Europe, with Mrs DamiÃ£o' s report and the revision of the directive, has a duty to be a political reference for women' s rights world-wide.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs DamiÃ£o on the magnificent job she has done on this report. We were happy to contribute to this in committee, not only by giving the report our total support, but also by adding some amendments that were accepted in the final version.
We consider the approval of this report to be a significant event as we approach the summer recess, for four fundamental reasons.
Firstly, we think it is unacceptable that women should suffer social prejudice or discrimination because of pregnancy or maternity issues;
Secondly, because we must more vigorously tackle risks to the health of mother and child associated with working conditions;
Thirdly, the idea of reconciling personal and professional lives, the family and work, in modern society is becoming increasingly important to those of us concerned about people' s day-to-day lives.
This is precisely one of those key areas in which a responsible approach to reconciling these interests is called for;
Fourthly, because maternity policies must be consistent with family and childbirth policies generally, particularly at a time when the crisis resulting from Europe' s ageing population is increasingly drawing Member States' attention to this issue.
We shall also be discussing some of the amendments and our position will be based on the balance that we feel has been struck in the report.
Nevertheless, we will not support all of the amendments, because we feel that this balance is actually preferable to some of the steps suggested in the amendments.
We shall support the amendments suggested by our British Conservative colleagues, such as Mr Bushill-Matthews, who drew our attention to the issue of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which we feel must be taken into account when legislation is adopted, whether at Community or national level.
On the other hand, however, we hope that the British Conservatives will back the report, because although it is true that some of the Portuguese Presidency' s conclusions highlight this issue, I must emphasise that paragraph 36 of the final Feira Summit text stresses the importance of companies' sense of social responsibility.
For us Portuguese Christian-Democrats and Conservatives, this is a very important idea. We believe that companies also have a certain social responsibility, which they should build upon.
I would just like to add that we wish certain votes to be held separately, as a means of improving the report, some points in which strike us as rather obscure.
We do not view pregnancy as a social resource and there is one other point on which we would like to see a separate vote in order to improve the report.
Lastly, I would urge all Christian-Democrat Members to endorse this report by my Socialist colleague.
Mr President, I wish at this point to express my disappointment at the Commission' s failure to adopt any position on the revision, assessment and notification of Directive 92/85 on maternity protection as yet.
Nevertheless, although I wish to highlight the considerable harm that this omission has caused to mothers, every cloud has a silver lining, and this report, which has been brilliantly drafted by Mrs DamiÃ£o, is proof of that such silver linings exist. This report will enable the European Parliament to move ahead now.
The report clarifies concepts, harmonises legislation at Community level, establishes shared responsibilities, takes account of new risks in the way work is currently organised, looks for incentives to increase the population in an ageing Europe and considers pregnancy to be a natural condition for women, and one which should be respected and protected.
It specifically notes the rights of women working independently or as teleworkers, and highlights the growing concern about single parents, who are becoming increasingly common in Europe.
The aim of extending maternity leave to twenty weeks is an ambitious one, which is recommended from a technical point of view, and must gradually be implemented. We must therefore prepare ourselves for this in economic terms, by sharing out responsibilities through cooperation between states and employers' and workers' organisations.
In order to achieve the aims that are being proposed, it is also crucial for us to encourage greater dialogue, collaboration and coordination between specialists in health, hygiene and safety at work, so that a more suitable working environment can be provided for pregnant women.
The European Community must strive to gain the support of applicant countries to ensure that awareness is raised as rapidly as possible, so that the measures recommended in this report can be adopted, since there may be greater resistance in those countries, which could be difficult to overcome.
Lastly, I wish to sound a warning about point 9 of this report, because measures for protecting new mothers, such as very long maternity leave, may have unwanted effects, as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women, and they may consequently prefer to take on men.
The Commission must therefore create a system for detecting fraud and for applying harsh penalties to companies practising this kind of discrimination.
Mr President, adopting a directive does not necessarily mean that reality is as we would wish it.
We have a good example of this here.
According to the Commission' s assessment, the situation regarding the health and safety of pregnant women looks fine, but that is certainly only on paper, for is that also the way it looks in reality?
I am not so sure.
The pace in the labour market is more hectic than ever. Great efficiency is demanded, and women are supposed to work as if they were not pregnant, even if they are.
It is stressful, and it is unhealthy both for the pregnant woman and the foetus.
We know this, because investigations have proven this to be the case.
The European Parliament and ourselves as representatives of the people are entitled to know whether the legislation we adopt also actually works in practice.
I think we have an example here of the Commission' s doing all too little in this area.
The message from Parliament to the Commission should therefore be that the work which has been done is not good enough.
It needs to be re-done.
We must know whether the legislation is working.
The Commission' s purely legal analyses now already show that there is a need for further protection.
I think there is a greater need to discover what suitable protection consists in, and there should be stricter rules governing dismissal during pregnancy.
The Commission must go back to the drawing board, set to work again and table the necessary proposals.
The European social model is characterised by the fact that we have a high level of protection.
This should be an area - and this remark is aimed at the Liberal Group which has adopted a very different view - in which the EU should have a big influence.
It should not be left to the individual Member States.
Women' s participation in the labour market is a prerequisite of our achieving the ambitious goals we have set ourselves regarding employment and the modernisation of the European social model.
Modernisation and efforts in this area are therefore important.
They cannot be left to the Member States. Europe as a whole needs to attend to these issues.
Mr President, many women are discriminated against today in their workplaces.
We know that many lose their jobs when they become pregnant.
This is completely unacceptable!
The DamiÃ£o report contains many good proposals, but we in the Swedish Liberal Party still have fundamental objections to the report.
I would like to say to my predecessor, who spoke just a moment ago, that, in this Parliament, we ought more often to ask ourselves the question: What should the European Parliament actually be doing?
How much detail should we go into?
We believe in the subsidiarity principle, i.e. that decisions should be taken as close as possible to the people they affect.
Social policy is an area where the EU ought to have limited jurisdiction, except when it is a question of free movement for citizens within the Union.
Every Member State should have full responsibility and the right to make its own decisions regarding its social security systems.
Maternity/paternity leave and maternity/paternity benefit are examples of issues that are not directly transnational.
We do not believe in detailed common European social legislation.
This does not, however, prevent Member States from cooperating and sharing ideas concerning social issues.
The DamiÃ£o report contains an amalgam of legitimate demands for proper security for women workers throughout Europe, demands for greater freedom of movement and a better functioning single market and demands for the national right of decision on the details of the socio-political system.
In this connection, the report contains an imbalance.
My final question is: Why should the European Parliament decide that every woman in the whole of Europe must have eight weeks off work when she has had a child?
I know several women who have gone back to work earlier - there must be freedom of choice!
Mr President, Mrs DamiÃ£o, the author of this report, is justified in her criticisms of the Commission as regards the delay in revising the current directive.
The report quite rightly laments the Commission' s failure to comply with the timetable set by the directive and the fact that there has been no assessment of how effectively the directive has been implemented. The report stresses the need for a proposal for an urgent revision of the directive, and suggests inclusion of various measures, which we essentially support and agree with.
As a matter of fact, in the discussions held in the Parliamentary committees, we tabled various amendments designed to guarantee the statutory right to take breaks from work for breastfeeding, to ensure non-discrimination in the workplace against pregnant women and women who have just given birth or who are breastfeeding, particularly in terms of salary, and to guarantee career progression and employment, with particular emphasis on the situation of working women who have temporary or atypical contracts.
In general, the amendments were accepted, with the exception of the amendment on the payment of allowances during time off work and maternity leave, which must be equivalent to 100% of the previous salary and be taken into account for the purposes of calculating pension entitlements.
