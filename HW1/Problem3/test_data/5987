Sweden' s action in the settlement regarding genetically modified crops, which was recently finalised, was disappointing.
Sweden actively opposed public registers of GM crops.
We hope that Sweden will mend its ways and refrain from working towards revoking the de facto moratorium which exists on the issue.
From an environmental point of view, EU legislation in this area is still inadequate
Unfortunately, it seems that the Swedish Presidency does not want to do anything to essentially change the EU' s irresponsible refugee policy which, with the Schengen Agreement as its instrument, every day gives rise to new tragedies.
Instead, we have seen how Sweden accepts deterioration, most recently by increasing the responsibility borne by transporters.
This involves a kind of privatisation of the screening for asylum purposes, where the fate of many asylum seekers is in practice decided by airport personnel outside the European Union.
The greatest disappointment among Sweden' s actions is probably, however, the militarisation of the EU.
Not only does Sweden give up its policies of non-alignment and independence, but it is now also going to work actively towards implementing the militarisation of the EU.
The EU army will even include Turkish troops.
Troops that one day can commit acts of cruelty in their own country or occupy a neighbouring country are allowed to serve in the EU army the next day.
As a NATO country, Turkey also demands influence over EU policy in this area in order to make NATO' s military resources available.
Consequently, my third question to GÃ¶ran Persson is the following: Can you promise that Turkey will not be given any such influence?
I am looking forward to the responses to my three questions. These concern the possibility of no longer discriminating against Hungary and the Czech Republic under the Nice Agreement, what you are going to do to make the Tobin tax a reality, and how you view Turkey' s participation in, and influence over, the EU' s military forces.
With these words, the United Left would like to wish the Swedish Presidency every success.
Madam President, firstly, I wish the Swedish Presidency every success in the knowledge that their success will certainly be Europe's success as well.
I want to welcome the Swedish Presidency's presentation here this afternoon as one that appears to be extremely constructive and pragmatic.
I also welcome the comments made by the Commission President, Mr Prodi.
The Swedish government has made it clear that it intends to prioritise what is known as the 3 Es during its presidency of the Union, and this relates to addressing the key problems of enlargement of the Union, employment matters and promoting environmental issues.
I would certainly welcome the intensification of the enlargement negotiations between the applicant countries and the European Union.
We should recall that the accession negotiations are broken up into nearly 40 different chapters of talks, covering every ambit of social and economic activity that is carried out by the European Union.
Presently, many of the more difficult chapters of discussions still remain unopened, and these include agricultural issues, the free movement of persons, the implementation of EU social and employment legislation and the incorporation of many EU directives and regulations in the field of environmental matters.
This is the core of the problem when it comes to the issue of enlargement of the European Union.
Applicant countries want the EU leaders to give a fixed date for the next enlargement of the Union.
However, the EU governments are seeking the conclusion of the more difficult chapters of talks between the applicant countries and the European Union before such a date can be announced.
However, the fact that EU leaders were able to agree a reform of the decision-making procedures within the EU institutions at Nice before Christmas is certainly a step in the right direction.
Applicant countries can now take solace from the fact that the EU has reformed its internal decision-making procedures so that the mechanics of the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner.
I welcome the fact that the Swedish government is going to ensure that employment and environmental matters stay at the top of the agenda during its presidency of the Union.
It is imperative that the European Union guarantees that the benefits of new information technologies are incorporated across all sectors of European industry.
Equally, it is important that there is an intensification of support for employment initiatives in urban and rural blackspots.
Finally, I hope that the European Union and the United States of America can come to an agreement in Bonn in May of this year so as to guarantee that environmental targets to reduce the effects of global warming can be reached.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, I would like to thank you for attending and for your substantial speech.
If you will allow me, I would like to ask you a brief question on an urgent matter.
In a few days' time, the Union is due to make a statement on Afghanistan.
It will have to adopt a common position. in recent weeks, the Security Council imposed an embargo on just the Talibans. Mr President, I would like to know if the European Union will also adopt this position.
As to the future of the European Union, we have given ourselves over to a certain amount of posturing, trying to make an impact.
Some forecast that we will vote against the Treaty of Nice, a perfectly legitimate action, I feel.
There has been no response on democracy, no response on the rule of law; the programmed destruction of the Commission was consummated in Nice.
Many members and, I hope, the majority, will legitimately come out against this Treaty.
Having said that, we are used to a great deal of flexing of muscles in the House and we will have to see what will happen when Parliament enters the ring to vote.
Mr President-in-Office, I am not sure if you should be too concerned, since the past has many things to teach us.
I am not, of course, Mr President, asking you to make a statement against the Treaty of Nice, I am merely asking for your understanding.
At the signing of the Treaty of Cologne, the Council, of which you were a member, threw Parliament a bone in the shape of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in order to keep it quiet.
A little too late, Parliament realised that this was indeed its intention and, this is the important point, that this was what you decided at Nice in the way you decided it, in other words, the weighting of votes in the Council and the membership of the Commission.
Having said that, at Nice, it was no bone that was tossed to Parliament, Mr President-in-Office, but a poisoned chalice.
Suggesting an Intergovernmental Conference in 2004 to Parliament and the Commission is like offering a poisoned chalice because there will be no Parliament in 2004.
We will be busy with the pre-election campaign for the preliminaries in January and February 2004 and then with the election campaign proper in March, April and May.
The elections will be held in June, then we will have a well-earned rest in July and August.
There will be the low-level preparatory meetings in September, the great budget issue in October and November and finally the Intergovernmental Conference in December.
Mr President, from now on, if you could show a little understanding and ask your colleagues in the Council either to bring forward this conference to 2003 or to postpone it until 2005, you may be able to salvage the honour of Parliament, which very often does not seem to know the meaning of the phrase.
Madam President, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would like to congratulate Sweden on the Presidency.
We think it is a good custom for the presidency to alternate.
We are looking forward to the Gothenburg Summit and hope that a great many citizens will be there under the alternative arrangements.
We call upon the presidency of the Council to re-open the negotiations on the Treaty of Nice so that this can be scrutinised democratically.
At present, the outcome is more centralism and less parliamentary democracy.
It is also startling that the negotiations ended with a decision to hold all summits in Brussels, with the Swedish Prime Minister' s not knowing about this decision when we believed he was involved in making it.
It is provocative that Czechs and Hungarians can be treated as inferiors and be given fewer seats in Parliament than countries with fewer inhabitants.
It is unwise to introduce majority voting for the purpose of appointing the individual countries' Commissioners. In that way, they of course become the EU' s representatives in the Member States instead of the Member States' representatives in the EU.
With an EU government formed through majority voting, an EU State is on the horizon instead of the electorate' s preferred vision of a Europe of nations and democracies.
We call upon Sweden to introduce genuine flexibility in the negotiations on enlargement so that the majority of the countries can be involved in the collaborative work and participate in the next elections to the EU Parliament in 2004.
The Treaty of Nice has been called an enlargement treaty, but it is a non-binding declaration which specifies the seats and weighting of votes in Parliament, while the binding enlargement protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam is to disappear.
We call upon the Swedish Presidency to ensure that an improved Treaty of Nice only comes into force when the EU admits new countries. Otherwise, we shall in fact end up saying yes to a treaty of enlargement, without obtaining any enlargement.
We run the risk of the Treaty of Nice' s becoming merely a treaty for deepening the Union, with more Union and less democracy, and that is something I am sure would not be to the taste of the new Swedish President-in-Office of the Council.
. (DE) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I may happen to be wearing my Nice hat today, yet I cannot get away from the fact that in Nice, as before in Amsterdam, we once again found that as an instrument the Intergovernmental Conference is finished.
On the other hand, I do not believe the much-praised Convention is fully developed yet as a procedure.
It could, however, serve as the blueprint for a workable procedure.
So in regard to the distribution of powers between the Member States and the Union, a question addressed both by the President of the Council and by the President of the Commission, let me outline my idea of an effective procedure.
During a first stage, parallel to the discussion begun under the Swedish Presidency, at the invitation of the European Council and in fact as early as possible there should be a discussion and opinion-forming process at the level of the national parliaments, which would then, just like the European Parliament, have to submit a proposal by, say, Spring 2002 on this distribution of powers.
Only on that basis should a Convention be convened, with the participation of constitutional experts, experts in European law, representatives of the national parliaments, of the European Parliament, of the national governments, but also of the governments of the candidate states and, of course, of the Court of Justice and of civil society. They would be charged with drafting a proposal for a inventory, and to do so by around Spring 2003.
On the basis of that proposal, the Commission in turn would be instructed by the European Council, in stage 3, to submit a proposal to it on the distribution of powers which could conceivably happen by the end of 2003.
In stage 4, I am envisaging rather more stages than the Commission President before the Intergovernmental Conference is convened, this proposal would have to be submitted for fresh discussion at national level, which would have to conclude by mid-2004.
Then, in stage 5, the Intergovernmental Conference would be convened, which should be brief and efficient.
In that way, we will ensure that we have a procedure that effectively includes the national parliaments, which has not been possible so far with the Convention, and that an agreed proposal is submitted to the Heads of Government.
Instead of the institutions acting side by side, as they have done in the past, they would therefore be acting together.
. (DE) Madam President, in order to remove all doubt I would now like to make a clarification.
On Sunday, 14 January Austria had its first suspected case of BSE.
Allow me to inform the House that the institute in TÃŒbingen informed us yesterday that the results were negative.
I hope the same will apply to all future suspected cases in Austria.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, it is so pleasant to see Sweden holding the presidency of the EU for the first time.
We Moderates have always fought for Sweden in Europe, but unfortunately we have to point out that Sweden is only responsible for 'half a presidency' since it is Belgium, instead, which will be responsible for the issues relating to the euro.
On the other hand, we hope that Sweden, as the country holding the presidency, will be able to achieve the success required in the work of enlargement.
The common security and defence policy has to be made more concrete during the Swedish Presidency.
Development in this area has been surprisingly rapid, but the ambitions must now be given some substance.
Relations between the EU and NATO will be of the greatest importance.
Commitment and the ability to solve outstanding problems are required if we are to avoid confusion and if we are to give the EU a complementary role in NATO' s military power.
I hope, therefore, that the fact that NATO does not even get a mention in the Swedish programme is more of a chance occurrence than part of a strategy.
In ten years' time, the EU will have the most dynamic economy in the world.
Sweden is one of those countries which have made the furthest strides in the development of the new economy.
We have companies which are world leaders in telecommunications and the Internet.
This is mainly due to the series of deregulations which took place under the Moderate-led government between 1991 and 1994.
The markets for telecommunications, mail, electricity and rail traffic, as well as agriculture, were liberalised.
At the time, Mr Persson was mainly opposed to these initiatives, but he seems to have changed his views.
I am delighted about this and I hope that Sweden, encouraged by good experiences, will be able to push through this kind of development.
The Stockholm Summit will provide an excellent opportunity.
May it become a deregulation summit for jobs and prosperity.
The debate surrounding globalisation and free trade has received increasing attention.
The time has come to get rid of the EU' s final protectionist barriers.
The EU, together with the new administration in the USA, can remove customs barriers for agricultural products and the textile industry.
That, if anything, will show solidarity with the poor of the world.
Unlike the Left Party which supports the Swedish Government, I find it gratifying that the Swedish Presidency states in its Programme that one of its main priorities is to devote itself to making the EU force the pace of development within the WTO towards tangible liberalisations.
This declaration is totally in line with Sweden' s tradition of free trade and openness towards the surrounding world.
The Minister of Commerce in Sweden, Mr Pagrotsky, has, however, described the Tobin tax (as it is called) as a nice idea, and the Prime Minister has expressed his sympathetic understanding of those who, by organising riots and disturbances, sabotaged the WTO meeting in Seattle.
The Tobin tax is a threat to the poor of the world.
A Tobin tax would only serve to undermine the efficiency of the market.
I would therefore like to ask the following question: Could the President-in-Office of the Council, here before Parliament, give a clear statement as to whether the Swedish Presidency is for or against the introduction of a Tobin tax?
Madam President, Members of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr GÃ¶ran Persson to Parliament.
I usually look forward to all Presidencies, but this presidency is something quite special, and my expectations of it run particularly high.
In my opinion, the priorities stipulated by Sweden, the three Es, are sound priorities.
They concern a limited number of important areas well in line with the EU agenda.
The most important one is, of course, enlargement.
It is a task of historic significance to unite East and West on our continent after years of Cold War.
I myself cannot imagine being able to participate in the completion of any greater or more important task in the whole of my political life.
Sweden' s ambitions of speeding up the process in this area are entirely legitimate.
I hope that the negotiations with the first countries can soon be brought to a successful conclusion and that a target date can soon be set for the accession of these first countries.
I realise that this is going to be difficult.
I also realise that it must be based on realism and that false hopes should not be created.
But, at the same time, it is important for the populations of the applicant countries not to give up hope, but to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
The second priority concerns jobs.
Sweden has been pressing on with the issue of employment.
In Stockholm, the intention is to combine employment, social policy, knowledge development and economic policy into one integrated policy.
The method applied is the open coordination method.
What we in Parliament would like is to have a part to play in this method - just as we have in the case of legislation - since it is becoming increasingly important.
I would like to receive some indication to this effect.
The third priority concerns long-term sustainable development.
This is not only a question of economic and social sustainability but also of environmental sustainability.
The EU is, after all, fairly successful where environmental policy is concerned.
This is partly due to the fact that those with the least ambitions are unable to block decisions, but it is also due to the fact that Parliament has the right of codecision on environmental issues.
What is missing in the strategy is a link between environmental policy and the previously mentioned areas.
Such a link must be made before the meeting in Stockholm and must be one result of the meeting in Gothenburg.
It was important, especially for the enlargement process, that there was agreement in Nice.
All was not entirely well, however - for example, when it came to the complicated rules concerning codecision making.
The way in which decisions were made behind closed doors was not good, either.
Sweden has openness on its agenda and will push the issue of making documents available to the public.
I trust that Sweden will also actively pursue the goal of a more open decision-making process.
I sincerely hope that Sweden can make a contribution to this issue.
I would also like to say a few words about crisis management.
Active crisis management and military non-alignment is not the same thing as passivity, nor has it ever involved passivity.
Active crisis management is about trying to prevent conflicts.
Sweden and Finland have been the trailblazers in applying civilian methods to crisis management and in resorting to military action only as a last resort. This is good and will be developed in the future.
There is a large majority in favour of this.
Once again, I wish to welcome Sweden as the country holding the presidency.
Madam President, Prime Minister, I too would like to welcome the Prime Minister here.
It is not quite the same as at home in the Swedish Parliament, but you get used to it fairly quickly.
Many issues revolve around the three Es.
Allow me to highlight a fourth one, namely E for Empathy.
We were all deeply shocked after the Christmas celebrations by the image of people struggling for their lives off the coast of Turkey in their attempt to get to Europe.
Many people died in their fight for a better life.
I know that you, Prime Minister, expressed your dismay after the awful tragedy last year when 58 Chinese people were found dead in a container in Dover.
Europe must not be transformed into some kind of fortress.
The European asylum and refugee policy must be characterised by dignity and humanity - that was your message at the time.
But what has happened since?
Well, the development in Europe has taken a wrong turn.
It has been proposed that the penalties for trafficking in human beings be made more severe.
This is necessary, but the proposals are unfocused in their effect.
Non-profit-making organisations - churches, religious orders, asylum organisations and private networks which support asylum seekers - are threatened with penalties.
These proposals must be stopped.
In Sweden, protection against the violation of the sanctity of churches has prevailed since the Middle Ages.
European leaders should reflect on why trafficking in human beings to Europe is dramatically increasing.
Europe is being closed.
To impose a visa requirement on 130 countries is not worthy of a democratic Europe.
The basic rule must be that people have the right to travel freely to the EU.
Is the Swedish Presidency prepared to work towards making the list of countries from which visas are required considerably shorter?
I am an ardent supporter of the EU and have for a long time now wanted to see common rules within the asylum and refugee policy, but we Liberals are not prepared to accept any kind of 'cordoned-off' Europe.
This, Prime Minister, is an opportunity for the new presidency to make an important contribution towards humanity and human dignity in the spirit of Raoul Wallenberg, whose memory you have so commendably honoured.
Empathy is the key word.
Mr President, as representative of the people and the regions, we regard Sweden as an ally in our defence of things that are dear to us, such as linguistic and cultural diversity, but if you are going to talk about involving the national parliaments more we would want the same amount of attention to be devoted to the institutions of our constitutional regions, and of our governments.
We would like our regions to be able to engage in direct dialogue, so as to remove the disparity in employment levels that can exist between different regions and one Member State.
We welcome Sweden as an environmentally friendly presidency, but Sweden would be acting completely out of character if it were to send MOX fuel to Sellafield.
This would be in direct contradiction with the signing of OSPAR, under the terms of which all parties are called upon to defend the non-processing option.
Finally, enlargement.
Not only is it fundamental to the enlargement to see the acquis communautaire adopted in the material sense prior, more than anything we want attention to be given to the ethical dimension.
I am talking democracy, respect for human rights and minorities, so that Europe is able to become a real community of values, in short, a Community with a capital 'C' .
Mr President, the programme of the Swedish Presidency is a fine piece of work, but there is still no indication as to how it is to be executed at a practical level.
How does the presidency propose to implement this ambitious programme?
As well as the Swedish priorities, there are all the matters left unresolved by the French still to be dealt with.
This is the first time that Sweden has held the presidency of the European Union and it has rightly made enlargement an important priority.
But is it not taking a rather over-optimistic view of how much willingness there is within the European Union to admit the candidate states?
The decision not to quote statistics in relation to accession speaks of a healthy sense of realism, given that this is determined by the accession criteria.
It is important for the candidate states to be offered a brighter future, in freedom, necessitating an increase in employment levels and the promotion of sustainable development through environmentally-friendly technology.
The goal of closing as many negotiating chapters as possible with the candidate states over the next six months, is a worthwhile one.
However, we would do well to consider that the internal market must be able to continue to function efficiently in the enlarged Union.
When it comes to the enlargement negotiations, how does the presidency propose to deal with the directives that have not been correctly implemented in the current Member States for some time?
On a final note, the proposal to integrate environmental aspects into other policy areas, such as taxation of energy, is to be welcomed with open arms.
This integration is an excellent point of departure for the sixth environmental action programme, as are the concrete goals and indicators that are to be included in this programme.
However, it is still unclear to me as to how this is to be combined with the proposed liberalisation of the WTO.
Mr President, Sweden has every right to be proud of its policy of making equal rights for men and women a reality.
You can imagine that I was rather surprised to see just how male-dominated your own retinue is.
A key aspect of your line of argument is that the people of the European Union should be our first priority.
Now I come from a country that sets great store by the expression: 'not words but deeds' and you will soon have this opportunity.
For example there is a regulation on the table which regulates access to documents from the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
There are five questions I would like to ask you.
Firstly, what do you propose to do with the heavily criticised Commission proposal in this sphere?
My second question is this: are you going to radically adapt the current French Council proposal with a view to achieving greater transparency?
Thirdly, are you prepared to get off to a flying start in bringing the Council working groups together, so as to be able to reach an understanding with Parliament as quickly as possible?
Fourthly, will you grasp the nettle of radical change and make the Council documents available on the Internet now, thereby putting transparency into practice?
My fifth question is: do you consider that European citizens are less entitled to openness with regard to the Brussels administration than American citizens are as regards their Washington administration?
Lastly, a final question: do you have the courage to initiate your own process of openness in relation to the post-Nice era, of precisely the kind put forward by the President of the Commission?
What would your answer be to that?
I think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that it is extremely important for us not just to hear fine words, but above all, what will your deeds be?
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish Sweden good luck in its first presidency.
The three Es are three good priorities that we share.
I would like to talk briefly about enlargement.
We support this as much as you do.
It must be successful.
We must never forget that success is largely dependent on our ability to manage our internal affairs properly as well.
The legacy of Nice is not a good legacy.
You will have to deal with it.
However, to move on to your second priority, employment, which relates to my temporary position in Parliament.
In the course of its development, the Union had five years to prepare for the external market, but with binding legislative instruments.
It was the same for the euro.
We are currently taking on the new challenge of improving employment and even achieving a return to full employment, as some dared to say at the Nice Summit, with our approval and we have all seen what could be achieved without binding legislative instruments.
This means, however, that we should reinforce convergence and incentive instruments.
This primarily means better coordination between macroeconomic, especially, in our case, macrofinancial policy, and employment policy in the European Union.
Mr President, you will be chairing the new European Council in the spring, which will be the first Council to deal with general macroeconomic objectives along with employment objectives.
You will set a precedent by forcing discussion and by forcing governments to compare results, rather than merely intentions.
We also need coordination of all the various aspects of European policy in order to promote employment.
Our competition policy is one of the best-defined policies and one that works the best. Should its only goal be to achieve healthy economic competition?
Mergers and restructuring are frequent occurrences.
What is their added value in terms of employment and growth?
The Commission applies the current criteria.
The Council would probably be well advised to adjust the balance of these criteria.
Competition should also work in favour of employment.
We have the same need for internal policy coordination in the Union reforms of public procurement contract procedures or in the regulations for services of general interest.
I did have more questions but I am out of time.
Mr President, Parliament is a place where we do not actually debate very much.
You will get used to it and you will find it does not sadden you too much.
It certainly saddens me.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I should like to congratulate Prime Minister Persson on an ambitious and results-oriented programme.
I hope it means that the EU will take several steps forward and that it will also reinforce the image of the EU in Sweden.
Among the issues closest to people' s hearts, one of the most important nowadays is that of food safety.
I have noted that the Prime Minister has expressed his hesitancy about eating meat in view of the ways in which animals and meat products are treated.
Despite the fact that I am an old farmer and an inveterate meat-eater, I can nowadays understand people who feel like that.
Parliament will be adopting positions on some eighty food safety directives.
We are now beginning to discuss the proposal for a European food authority.
I would be interested to hear what the Prime Minister' s attitude is to such an authority.
In a common market, common rules and regulations as well as common controls, and - if the rules are not followed - a common system of sanctions are required.
Such an overall solution requires more than the proposed food authority.
My opinion is that it has to function in cooperation with the EU' s Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin and with the Commission.
Within the sphere of influence of such a triangle, advice and consultation, risk assessment, risk management and sanctions could be dealt with within the framework of existing regulatory mechanisms and could provide an identical level of food safety throughout the Union.
I hope to have the support of the presidency for this idea.
Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is very gratifying that the Swedish Presidency has accorded the environment a high priority. This is vitally necessary, and it also entails responsibility.
To reverse the deterioration in the living environment requires radical political decisions - a break in the trend.
Expectations are high in view of the statement of Mr Persson, the President-in-Office of the Council, to the effect that sustainable development on the EU' s agenda will lead to a green strategy for the 21st century.
This involves providing the economy with ecological ground-rules, integrating environmental issues in all other policies and introducing the necessary means of control.
It is therefore incomprehensible that the Swedish Government is acting in opposition to such environment-related taxes at EU level as minimum levels of carbon dioxide and energy taxes.
Why was a negative decision made on this in Nice?
Another question of great immediate interest is how the Swedish Presidency is planning to assume the task - which it has inherited from Nice - of formulating a strategy for the political future of the EU.
You, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - along with a large proportion of the population of the Member States - are, of course, opposed to a federal development of the EU.
What is your vision and how do you envisage subsidiarity and the division of powers in the future?
How is the President planning successfully to maintain a Swedish policy of non-alignment and neutrality while, at the same time, his task during the presidency is to continue to develop the EU' s military capacity?
Finally, I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency.
Mr President, I would firstly like to wish the Swedish Presidency of the European Union luck.
As the President-in-Office of the Council knows, the work of a presidency does not consist solely of defending its national interests, but also of seeking consensus so that European integration may move forward.
And the only way to move forward is to establish harmonious cooperation between the three institutions: the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
We are therefore reassured to receive the offer of cooperation you made Parliament today, especially in view of the statements to which Mr Poettering referred just now, in which, apparently, you declared that the Commission is an institution suffering from a serious democratic deficit and that, following the 1999 elections and the low turnout of citizens in your country, the European Parliament should be dissolved.
I do not know whether these reports are true or not, or whether they have been denied or not, but I believe, Mr President, that these statements require some explanation.
Having said that, when discussing the Europe of values, you referred to the need to export the system of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to third countries.
I do not know exactly what you meant by that.
If we are to expect third countries to adhere to certain values, to which we have not ourselves been capable of adhering, then perhaps the most logical interpretation is that you have now become a fervent supporter of making the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding in nature and perhaps even including it in the Treaties.
In opening your speech, you referred to the European Union project, which you defined as an association of welfare states.
The welfare interpretation of a Europe with emphasis on the tangible, on cash, the net beneficiary and the net balance, is a legitimate but incomplete vision of Europe.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the Europe of welfare must be subordinate to a Europe of values, since the essence of the European Union is an ongoing appeal for peace, understanding, harmony and solidarity, and we would appreciate your continuing to bear this in mind.
Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is, of course, not possible for me to comment on all the views, but I can discuss some of the main features of several of the speeches.
Naturally, I will not go into questions relating to Swedish domestic policy, since we can deal with such matters in other contexts.
Instead, I will concentrate on the major European issues.
I sense a strong desire on the part of several of the representatives - not least on the part of the representatives of the large political groups - to work together with the presidency towards greater transparency.
This is an issue on which, as you all know, there are different approaches within the Union, which is why we are going to have a difficult and complicated task on our hands over the next few months.
Nevertheless, we think that one of the essential prerequisites for building confidence in the European Union, in its policies and its institutions is that there be transparency; that it be possible to follow the way in which an issue is dealt with; that accountability can be demanded; and that debate can be engaged in.
In that way, a European political space can be created for conducting a debate, which in turn is the prerequisite for building institutions which will go on to create increased democratic legitimacy.
What has been said by Mr Poettering, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and others on this subject is, of course, excellent and something to which I subscribe.
Many have referred to enlargement, especially Mr BarÃ³n Crespo in his powerful visionary speech.
I have also been asked by Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m whether we can specify a date for when the first applicant country will gain accession to the Union.
This is something which I - which we - wish to see, but we are not going to give that indication.
We will not conduct that debate until we know that the substantive negotiations which will have to be held are also to be successful.
I think we would be giving the wrong signal if we were to indicate a certain point in time when the first of the countries currently negotiating membership were to join the Union.
It would be the wrong signal because we would first like to see the difficult negotiations with which we are faced result in a breakthrough.
Such a breakthrough can take place during the Swedish Presidency and we may then very well be able to specify a date in Gothenburg.
I hope that this will be the case.
I would like it to happen, but I am not sure if it will.
When we talk about the major issues and enlargement, it seems that we are more or less in agreement.
There is no firmer support for enlargement than that offered by the European Parliament.
This is more a project of the European Parliament than of any other institution.
It is Parliament that has been responsible for enlargement.
Naturally, I am extremely anxious that it should also be possible for the Treaty we signed in Nice to be approved, because that in turn is the prerequisite for its being possible to implement enlargement.
I hope we can resolve the differences on factual matters which exist between the Commission, the Council and Parliament so that we can make some progress on the issue of enlargement.
Enlargement is our common responsibility, an historic opportunity to put an end to the division of Europe into East and West.
I agree with what Mr Andersson said in his speech, to the effect that the Treaty of Nice - despite its flaws and shortcomings - nonetheless opened the door to enlargement, something which it is important to mention.
In their speeches, several Members have also talked about the environmental issue.
I attach great value to the statements of Mrs Hautala and others.
In my opinion, the environmental issue should not be seen as a brake on economic development but, instead, as a driving force.
All the major environmental problems we see at present will be resolved by new technology.
This is something of which I am convinced.
I am also convinced that we, in practice, already have the technology. It is available.
We know what, in all likelihood, needs to be done.
When our citizens see what is happening, for example on the climate issue, and that we cannot get together and produce some kind of joint response, that is naturally something which will undermine confidence in our institutions.
I therefore believe that the Gothenburg Summit will be an important point of departure, enabling us to show that there is a path to success whereby new technology, research, development and faith in human ability are in actual fact promoted through political investment.
If we place the emphasis on this, we shall also be at the cutting edge of the technological development which is a prerequisite for a competitive Europe.
Look at environmental concern as a driving force and not as a brake and as nostalgia for a time which has passed.
Look at environmental concern as a visionary contribution to a better and more modern Europe.
We ought to be able to adopt that approach alongside the creditable work Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m is doing with her environmental care programme for issues relating to chemicals and the way in which the use of these is regulated.
Add all this together, and we should be able to obtain a promising outcome in Gothenburg.
I take note of what you have said about the environmental issue and I share your views to a great extent.
Employment is, of course, largely a policy which already is, and for the foreseeable future will remain, a responsibility of the national parliaments.
In the open coordination which is a feature of the Lisbon process, we have found a way of jointly pursuing the development of employment in the Union.
I fully share Mr Rocard' s view that, if we are to come closer still to full employment, the macroeconomic discussion is going to become ever more central.
To put it more simply: how can we make use of the fact that we are cooperating within a European union in order, for example, to provide more stimulation for economic growth?
Our situation is such that we are not vulnerable to outside influences.
An isolated country is vulnerable, but not so a union of countries.
This is something we should discuss, and - I freely admit this - it is particularly important in the case of those countries which are already cooperating over the euro.
They have more opportunities of taking advantage of their situation or of stimulating more robust economic growth and, in that way, increased employment.
I am quite sure that discussions of this kind will take place in the group of euro countries.
After all, the work which forms the core of the European Union has to do with the internal market and that method of working in terms of community legislation that is in the spirit of Monnet.
That core has, of course, already been built.
What has now been added is cooperation within another field, something which we, for instance, call the Lisbon process.
There are different expressions.
Irrespective of which form of cooperation we choose, the same requirements for openness and transparency apply.
I do not wish to see a situation in which States and governments hold discussions between themselves which could be considered as being closed and secret and which make public control impossible.
Irrespective of which methods we apply, openness is of fundamental importance.
Many other things have been said which I feel strongly about, but let me just say that there are two contributions which I find to be of a special and exceptional nature, but which are of central political importance and which, I want to emphasise, I have subscribed to.
What Mr Olsson says about food policy, food quality, the interest of consumers in their right to protection and the renewal of consumer confidence is very much in line with my own thinking regarding the presidency' s approach.
Mr Olle Schmidt talked about policy on refugees and about a generous attitude on the part of the European Union towards those who turn to us in search of safety and protection.
The Geneva Convention must, of course, form the basis of any thinking about this subject, but we should also have ambitions over and above this.
As a wealthy section of a global community, we really should be able to afford such a policy.
Together, not individually.
These are ambitions we could very well have arguments and discussions about, and it is an area in which we could take the Union forwards.
I am very sympathetic to what Mr Olle Schmidt said in his speech about a humanitarian refugee policy.
In conclusion, I would like to say that those of us involved in the Swedish Presidency will frequently be in your beautiful building to conduct talks and discussions, but we would also like you, for your part, to get in touch with ourselves.
We will also be happy to receive you as guests in our somewhat cold and distant country, a country which, however, will be full of warmth and fellowship on such occasions. Of that I can assure you.
You are all very welcome.
I am looking forward to cooperating with all the political groups in Parliament with a view to developing the European Union.
. (DE) Mr President, I want to thank the Presidency of the Council for taking such a positive approach to the Stockholm summit and aiming at economic sustainability, which lies in the interests of full employment, economic reform, innovation and the future viability of the European Union.
What we need in Stockholm is not a deregulation summit.
We need a summit that makes it clear at what European Union level we can regulate everything best, so that we really can make progress in using the single market in the interests not just of the economy but also of the people, of the workers.
So I would like to make a request to the Swedish Presidency. If you want to show greater transparency and greater democracy, specifically in relation to coordinating economic policy, make a start by involving the European Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, in every initiative and in elaborating the basic features of economic policy.
We will first submit our proposals in the framework of a legislative procedure.
We will see whether the Swedish Presidency really is taking this issue of overcoming the democratic deficit on board and is proceeding pragmatically, by small steps.
That is a very cordial request by the European Parliament, which has been calling since 1994 for an interinstitutional agreement of that kind to be reached.
I would ask the presidency to pursue the Lisbon process consistently, ensuring that all policy areas referred to in it keep the same status.
That means we really do implement an appropriate and adequate policy mix, by pursuing a policy of social integration, full employment and economic reforms based on clear timetables together with quality benchmarks.
The same applies to financial policy, for we must begin by making it clear through our investment policy that the people of Europe can achieve added value through cooperation at European level, through investment in people, but also in infrastructures.
Let me address one last comment to the Swedish Presidency: we place our hopes in you to ensure that the citizens of Europe, most of whom are very worried, can face the introduction of the euro without fear.
Please work very closely with the Belgian Presidency and call on all the players in the villages, towns and capitals to cooperate. For the euro is a bold historic project that can only succeed if we all pull together.
Mr President, Commissioner, as you heard from our Group chairman earlier in the debate, the EPP visited Berlin last week.
Before leaving, I and some colleagues were able to visit Potsdam where of course the conference took place where President Truman, Prime Minister Churchill - bizarrely replaced by Mr Atley mid-conference - and Marshal Stalin agreed to confirm the Yalta division of Europe.
The Swedish Presidency, as we have heard during the debate, has raised high hopes that we may achieve over the next six months the restoration of a unified Europe, but I believe the time for rhetoric has passed and what we are all looking for now are results.
I wonder if four questions could be transmitted to the Swedish Presidency.
First of all, does it intend to convene a council or a special meeting to which the government representatives of the candidate countries would be invited, not only to facilitate the negotiations, but to give the important signal to the public that enlargement is not merely a political exercise, a mirage, a constantly distant objective, but that we are genuinely making the progress which is required?
Secondly, could the bureaucratic negotiations be tempered by an understanding of the past?
It does seem cruelly difficult in a sense that the way the enlargement process is presented is merely a question of conforming to some technical acquis, ignoring, perhaps, the specific difficulties that the Baltic Republics and other Central and Eastern European countries faced under the Soviet system.
With the timetable which we have set ourselves: does the Swedish Presidency agree that this necessitates transitional periods, and, finally, can we confirm that no new hurdles will be placed in the path of the candidate countries.
Clearly today it has been Sweden's day.
We all very much hope that in six months' time in Gothenburg, once again, it will not only be Sweden's day, but Europe's day.
Mr President, I warmly welcome the Swedish Presidency, although the situation in which they find themselves as they assume the presidency may not be a very enviable one.
We have recently had perhaps the most confused Summit the EU has ever seen.
Problems are being thrashed out right up to the time the agreement is about to be ratified, and that does not, on any account, give a good picture of summits generally or the work of the Council.
For that reason, it is very satisfying to note that Sweden, as the country holding the presidency, has indicated its desire to help steer the work of the Council in a specifically more transparent direction.
The programme of the Swedish Presidency is full-bodied and ambitious, and it really is time environmental issues in their broadest context were finally taken to the core of any debate in the European Union.
The programme of sustainable development drafted for the EU, which has been agreed will form part of the Rio Plus process at the Gothenburg Summit, must contain all those elements of sustainability that have been prioritised for the presidency of the EU.
In my opinion, all three E' s are a guarantee of this sustainability.
But I am nevertheless slightly worried, and I will now address my words to the Commission, about the timetable for drafting the subjects for debate, for example, for the Gothenburg Summit.
How will this timetable make it possible for the European Parliament to be fully involved in the drafting of the programme relating to sustainable development, for example?
However, I would like to thank the country holding the presidency for including the issue of the northern dimension on the agenda.
And I would once more like to address a question to the Commission, which is how adequate resources - staffing resources, for example - can be guaranteed so that this northern dimension policy also receives the go-ahead for an extension from the Commission.
Mr President, I too should like to welcome the Swedish Presidency and its programme which contains many good priorities.
Just like a whole succession of speakers here today, I am worried about the tendency to frequently and stridently emphasise the intergovernmental model at the expense of the model we commonly call the 'Community approach' , i.e. one which involves the Commission' s being given a greater role and importance.
I note the Prime Minister' s assurances of openness, irrespective of which model is chosen, but the question is, of course, more far-reaching than that.
The interesting contribution by Commissioner Prodi confirmed the challenges we face.
I listened with interest to the Prime Minister' s comments on the environmental issues.
They sound fine, but there is a problem in that the majority of today' s environmental problems are directly linked to energy consumption, and the problem is that Europe at present has no energy policy.
The Member States have not even managed to agree about a common charge on carbon dioxide.
The Swedish Government has stated that it wants to see such a charge, but only if a unanimous decision on this can be reached which, however, is the same thing as no decision at all.
For ten years, this question has been blocked by individual governments.
What makes the Prime Minister and the Government think that it could be resolved at this present time?
Without a charge on carbon dioxide, the EU will not be able to meet the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Furthermore, the strategy for sustainable development, which is going to be taken up for discussion in Gothenburg, will be severely compromised if the EU does not take a coordinated grip on these energy issues.
Commissioner Prodi raised the issue very creditably, and many other speakers have done the same.
The question is whether the Swedish Government will be prepared to think again.
Finally, I wish to say that I, just like Mr Olle Schmidt, would have liked to have seen a fourth 'E' , standing for empathy and relating not only to the refugee issues but also to relations with the Third World.
Reference has been made here today to the Tobin tax, but I think that this will be impossible to implement.
One way of accumulating more money for global issues would be to encourage all Member States to fulfil their commitment to giving 0.7 per cent of their GNP in aid.
In addition to this, as Mrs Carlsson said, the rates of duty on products from developing countries should be reduced.
Is the Swedish Government prepared to act in this spirit?
Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has made it very clear that the majority of Members of the European Parliament is disappointed by the outcome of Nice.
The real reason is as follows. In Nice, transparency and democracy for the European Union fell by the wayside.
What happened?
We find the Council applying the qualified majority principle in more and more areas.
That prevents any scrutiny by the national parliaments, whose decisions can, of course, be outvoted by the respective majorities in the Council.
But this democratic scrutiny has, unfortunately, not been replaced by democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament nor, unfortunately, by codecision by the European Parliament.
Here, I am convinced, lies the crucial weakness of what was decided in Nice.
Mr President of the Council, Sweden has a great tradition of democracy and transparency.
I expect the Swedish Presidency to support us in our endeavour to remedy these weaknesses of Nice and to strengthen the legitimacy of democratic decisions in the European Union again, and I am convinced it will do so.
I want to address a second point.
During its term of office the Swedish Presidency must prepare for the introduction of the euro, i.e. of the notes and coins, in 12 European Union countries.
The question we keep asking ourselves is this: who actually represents the euro externally?
I am persuaded that the European Commission ought to undertake to do more here than it has to date.
The French Presidency gave us clear information.
Accordingly, the president of the 12 EU countries represents the euro externally.
That in turn leads to a paradoxical situation.
The Swedish Finance Minister represents the European Union externally for general economic policy questions, while when it comes to the euro, to the euro currency, this job goes to the Belgian Finance Minister.
If even we in the European Parliament cannot understand that, how are the citizens of the European Union supposed to understand it?
How are the markets to understand it?
We must do our outmost to return to a sensible situation here.
You, Foreign Minister, can make a major contribution here.
If you manage to persuade your fellow-countrymen that the euro is a good project, that it is stable from within, that its external stability is also constantly improving; if you can persuade them to support this great project of European integration, you will also help ensure that the citizens gain a better understanding of this aspect of the European Union.
The debate is closed.
Question Time (Council)
Question No 1 by (H-0952/00):
Subject: EU-China Summit In a new report the IOM reveals that the Chinese white slave mafia is very well organised and that women are being sold on markets throughout China.
The profits are comparatively high (often over EUR 30 000) and the IOM fears there will be a dramatic increase in trafficking in Chinese women both internally and to Western Europe in particular.
At the EU-China meeting on 23 October 2000 the European Council and Commission discussed the question of responsibility for the repatriation of illegal Chinese immigrants.
Did the Council also bring up the problem of the widespread trafficking in Chinese women and girls?
The Council felt that it was a very positive development to be able to open a dialogue with China concerning migration issues, particularly those concerning illegal migration and repatriation of Chinese citizens who have been found residing illegally on Member States' territory.
Prior to the summit meeting with China, a meeting was held in Brussels with officials from the country holding the presidency, the Commission and a Chinese delegation in order to identify and establish areas of possible future cooperation.
Particular emphasis was placed on the exchange of information between authorities and organisations working on issues concerning trafficking in human beings and illegal migration.
There are plans for further meetings of the same nature, and the next one will be held in Beijing in a few weeks' time.
Preparations for the meeting are currently under way at expert level.
As Mrs Theorin undoubtedly is aware, the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira expressed its concern regarding the tragic events in Dover last year and condemned the criminal acts committed by persons profiteering by such smuggling of human beings.
The European Council gave the Union the task of intensifying cooperation in order to combat such cross-border crime.
The French Presidency responded to the urgent request by the European Council and put forward several initiatives as elements in the fight against the criminal networks which organise smuggling and trafficking in human beings.
Even if the specific problem mentioned by Mrs Theorin was not discussed at the EU-China meeting on 23 October of last year, the Council is very much aware of the problem concerning trafficking in women and girls.
It is about trafficking not only from China, but also from certain other countries not far from the EU.
As the country holding the presidency, Sweden has, in the autumn of the year 2000 and in the context of the ASEM collaboration (in which China also takes part), raised the issue of trafficking in women and children.
The first step was an experts' meeting at the end of November last year attended by experts in the field from both Asia and Europe.
The recommendations from this meeting will be presented at ASEM' s meeting of Foreign Ministers in Beijing in May of this year.
Swedish Presidency, I am very pleased that this issue is being treated seriously by the Council, because it is extremely serious.
Tens of thousands of women and girls are bought and sold in China every year, many of them to the West.
The most popular areas are the poor provinces.
In a new report, IOM has stated that the authorities in the West have met with quite serious difficulties when they have tried to get to grips with trafficking in women from China, and that this trafficking will increase dramatically if forceful measures are not employed.
Trafficking in women is also rife within China.
As a direct consequence of the one-child policy and the preference of Chinese families for sons, there are currently 70 million unmarried men in China.
The International Coalition against Trafficking in Women reports on town councils buying hundreds of women who are then distributed to the single men in the town on the grounds that they are to be pitied.
It is a very good thing that you formed this council after the Dover scandal.
I wonder whether the expert organisations, for example IOM and the International Coalition against Trafficking in Women, will be included in this Council.
In what way is the Council prepared, by using its contacts with China, to bring the matter of trafficking in women in China to the fore?
There is every reason for the working parties which have now been appointed to quickly and effectively make contact, within the framework of the Union's work, with other international organisations working with these issues.
IOM is probably the organisation with the most expertise in the area.
I assume that such contacts will be established very quickly.
Allow me also to point out that the fight against trafficking in women is in general underlined as an important issue in the programme of the Swedish Presidency.
We will gladly work towards combating this dreadful phenomenon on a broad front, that is to say, not only with regard to China, but globally.
Question No 3 by (H-0956/00):
Subject: Facilities for EU citizens in Mecca In accordance with Article 20 of the EC Treaty, every citizen of the EU is entitled to protection in third countries by the consulate of another Member State if the citizen' s own country is not represented there. What facilities are provided by the EU for EU citizens in Mecca during the Haj?
The honourable Member should be made aware that two decisions have been adopted in application of Article 20 of the EC Treaty.
The first concerns assistance for citizens of the European Union from the diplomatic and consular representations.
The second relates to implementation measures for the aforementioned decisions.
The annex to this decision states the conditions under which the Member States' diplomatic representations may assist each EU citizen.
The United Kingdom is providing consular services in Mecca during the Haj pilgrimage.
There are several consulates in Jeddah which can assist EU citizens during the pilgrimage.
Mr President, I thank the Swedish representative for his reply but it does not satisfy my enquiry.
He is quite right to say that certain types of consular services are provided in Mecca during the Hajj by the UK Government for British Muslims.
However, those consular services are not available to Muslims from other EU Member States who would be there under the same terms and conditions operated by the Saudi authorities as UK Muslims.
It seems a little bizarre that whilst we are supposed to have equal representation and treatment for all EU citizens, in circumstances like the one I have described, there is unequal treatment and unequal representation for EU citizens.
Could the Swedish minister please assure us that he will take up this matter and examine circumstances in which this kind of unequal treatment takes place, to ensure that regardless of religion or nationality people receive the same treatment from consular services by individual Member States?
I can not only assure Mr Bowe that the matter will be taken up, I can even reassure him that his concern is somewhat unfounded.
The decision that I referred to previously stipulates that if the person seeking consular help is a citizen of one of the Member States of the European Union, the diplomatic or consular representation from another Member State shall treat the person seeking help as if he were a citizen of the Member State represented by the embassy or consulate.
There is therefore no need for the discriminatory situation feared by Mr Bowe to arise. Instead, an EU citizen will be treated equally.
I am convinced that, in this case, the United Kingdom's representation is acting with solidarity and treating all EU citizens equally.
This is at least stated in the decisions that have been taken.
The Council is very keen to have effective market monitoring so that it is possible to be sure that the fundamental requirements of the directives relating to EC labelling and drawn up on the basis of the 'new approach' are complied with.
This approach is a new way of harmonising technical requirements for products in the directives.
The monitoring of how this EC labelling of products is used is a common concern for the Commission and the Member States.
It is primarily the Member States' responsibility to ensure, by means of approval or in some other way, that these bodies comply with the requirements for competence and that they operate effectively.
The Commission has been assigned a central role for ensuring uniformity and a high standard with regard to the monitoring bodies.
The supervisory bodies are national, and the Member States notify the Commission of which national bodies are to carry out the control.
In turn, the Commission sets up programmes to ensure that the market monitoring is organised in a uniform way between the Member States.
In order to monitor the new approach, the bodies whose names have been notified by the Member States will, for example, establish collaboration groups for each directive.
. (DE) Mr President, the EC label is an important factor of consumer protection.
But it is a purely quantitative measure.
All that is necessary is to prove compliance with existing European legal provisions.
That is certainly not enough for the consumer.
Consumers also want quality testing and certification procedures so that they can find out whether a product is of above-average standard and therefore also meets their requirements.
That is why third-party certification is quite crucial, especially for safety components.
We saw from the rail accident in Eschede that very serious accidents can occur if the railways only do their own monitoring, without any third-party certification.
Do you think that in future we should place more emphasis on third-party certification in the European Union?
As I said earlier in my initial reply to the honourable Member, in the first place it is the Commission which is to ensure uniformity with regard to the assessment of so-called compliances.
I would therefore like to propose that, in the first instance, the honourable Member turn to the Commission for any further information concerning this matter.
Question No 5 by (H-0965/00):
Subject: Hunger strike by political prisoners in Turkey The spectre of death is haunting dozens of political prisoners in Turkey who have been on a hunger strike to the death for the past two months in protest at the inhuman conditions in Turkish prisons.
At the same time, the Council of Europe has announced that torture continues to be standard practice in Turkish police stations, while Amnesty International has denounced the torture, the impunity and the general violation of human rights by Turkey and called on the European Union to demand an immediate end to torture and not in 2002-2003, as provided by the procedure for Turkey's accession to the Union.
Will the Council make representations to the Turkish Government to take measures to improve the situation in Turkish prisons so that the prisoners also end their hunger strike?
Will it adopt Amnesty International's call for an immediate end to torture in the context of the procedure for Turkey's accession to the European Union?
The Turkish Government is, in all probability, well aware of the Union's firm conviction that the situation in Turkish prisons needs to be improved and torture abolished.
The Council welcomes the fact that Turkey has begun a reform of the prison system and that the country is also willing to cooperate with the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
Torture is one of the most pressing problems in Turkey.
The Council has also given the issue priority in the draft partnership agreement that exists for the accession of Turkey, specifically by referring to strengthening legislation and taking all measures necessary to strengthen the fight against torture and to ensure that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture is obeyed.
This means among other things that the Council expects Turkey to make significant progress in this area before the end of this year.
With regard to the standard of Turkish prisons, the EU has repeatedly demanded a prison system in Turkey which conforms to international standards.
Therefore, in its medium-term priorities in the draft partnership agreement for accession, the Council has included the requirement that conditions in Turkish prisons be changed to conform to the UN's rules as regards minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners.
With regard to the lives which have unfortunately been lost during the recent riots in Turkish prisons and the report on torture and abuse during the transport of prisoners, the European Union has raised the issue in bilateral contacts with Turkish authorities.
Naturally, the EU does not tolerate torture and abuse of prisoners.
In their contacts with the EU, the Turkish authorities have denied all allegations of torture and abuse.
The Council will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely.
I too am one of the members who have huge hopes of the Swedish Presidency on the question of human rights, because it is the presidency of a country which has shown through its deeds that it has tremendous compassion and that it is revolted by opportunism when it comes to human rights issues.
And I should like to say that the President-in-Office's "yes, but" stance worries me somewhat saying that the Council will continue to monitor developments, that there may have been some unfortunate incidents, but Turkey has given its assurances that nothing is amiss.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office if, in the wake of this tragedy which we have watched unfold, with over 60 officially dead, with maltreatment, with people who may be in prison because they spoke in their mother tongue, with some 200 prisoners continuing their hunger strike, the Swedish Presidency will publicly take an initiative and demand explanations and undertakings from the Turkish Government and, likewise, if the Swedish Presidency will finally take an interest in securing the release of Leyla Zana, the MP awarded the Sakharov prize by this Parliament;
Allow me just to remind you that, according to the Council, the partnership agreement with Turkey, which currently exists in draft form, offers an excellent opportunity for continually 'keeping a tight reign' on Turkey when it comes to torture, the conditions in prisons and human rights in general.
The Council naturally intends to use all opportunities that exist within the framework of this agreement to ensure that developments in Turkey head in a direction which is compatible with the common values we hold in the EU.
A large proportion of the prisoners in Turkish prisons must be regarded as political prisoners.
In Turkey, people are also still being convicted on political grounds.
I was present myself at a trial on 21 December last year in Djarbakir in south-east Turkey where a Syrian priest was threatened with three years in prison for simply talking about the genocide committed against the Armenians and Assyrians in 1915.
This was his only 'crime' , and for this he was to be convicted.
Will the Council demand changes to Turkish criminal law and raise specific cases like this one, involving people being imprisoned on political grounds?
In actual fact, I can answer Mr SjÃ¶stedt's question in the same way as I answered the previous question.
In declaring Turkey an applicant country for membership of the EU, which was done at the Helsinki Summit, the EU now has completely new opportunities of closely following developments in Turkey and of pointing out every deviation from the standards which should apply to a candidate country.
I therefore see it as a very urgent task, also under the Swedish Presidency, to ensure that developments in Turkey proceed in such a way that we can gradually see the country draw nearer to the European family in a more concrete way than we have seen up to now.
Question No 6 by (H-0967/00):
Subject: Open Council meetings The Swedish Presidency has declared openness to be tremendously important to the work of the European Union.
How many of the Council meetings to be held during the Swedish Presidency between 1 January and 30 June 2001 will be completely open to the public?
As has undoubtedly also emerged from the presentation of the work programme by the Prime Minister a short while ago, the Swedish Presidency attaches particular importance to the work of the Council' s being open and accessible to European citizens and to legislative work' s being open to public scrutiny.
The Swedish Presidency is actively working towards making as many debates as possible open within the formal frameworks which apply.
The Council's Rules of Procedure do not permit completely public Council meetings, which is something Mr SjÃ¶stedt is also aware of.
However, public Council debates can be held.
In Helsinki in December 1999 the European Council decided that, on a half-yearly basis, the General Affairs Council and the Ecofin Council should hold public debates on the Council's work programme.
This decision has now been incorporated into the Council's Rules of Procedure.
Other Council constellations are also holding public debates.
One of the first priorities of the Swedish Presidency was therefore to draw up a list of public debates which were to cover as large an area as possible of the Council's work.
Therefore, we have now presented a list of the public debates which are to be held during our presidency.
Nine such debates will be held in what could be regarded as the important and central Council constellations beginning this Friday when Ecofin is to hold a debate on its work programme.
Following this, the debates continue during the first half of the year up to the last public debate in the Council (culture) which, in June, shall discuss the protection of minors against damaging content in the media.
With these measures, we have taken transparency in the work of the Council a step further.
There are undoubtedly further steps to be taken, but, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, do not allow the best to become the enemy of the good.
No, I shall not allow the best to become the enemy of the good.
It is just that if we continue at the pace of the Council of Ministers it will be a hundred years before we have public meetings for real.
Nine debates are actually not particularly impressive, if I may say so.
I think that it should be a matter of course in a democratic society for the citizens to have the right of access to their most important legislative body, and in the European Union that is of course largely the EU's Council of Ministers.
It is quite simply a fundamental demand for democracy.
If it is now the case that the Council's Rules of Procedure prevent even the voting and the entire Council meetings where the Council is, so to speak, legislating from being open, we ought to change these antiquated Rules of Procedure immediately.
Will there, therefore, be no such initiative from the Swedish Presidency, which is pursuing the issues relating to openness so intensely - which is something I regard as immensely important and positive?
As Mr SjÃ¶stedt is undoubtedly aware, the Swedish Presidency intends to use all the energy imaginable to try to move the situation forward with regard to the question of transparency during Sweden's half-year of holding the presidency.
We think that we are probably doing this with the increased number of debates that are open.
We can draw parallels with most national parliaments.
Take, for example, the Swedish Parliament.
The legislative work in the committees in the Swedish Parliament is not public but closed, and there are reasons for this.
There is a need to be able to agree politically, but there is of course also a need for maximum transparency.
I can assure you, Mr SjÃ¶stedt, that we will do all we can to move the situation forward, but Rome was not built in a day.
Even a long march begins with a small step.
Question No 7 by (H-0970/00):
Subject: Democracy and human rights in Belarus On a platform of shared values, the EU regards it as its duty to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Belarus, a neighbour of the applicant countries of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, is a country in which none of the above three principles can be said to be upheld in an acceptable manner and there is clearly a risk that the effects may spread to the surrounding countries.
On 16 October 2000 in Minsk, the parliamentary troika of the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE delivered a sharply critical report on the lack of democracy in Belarus in connection with the elections held there.
The many people who have disappeared include former Interior Minister Yuriy Zakharenko, former Deputy Chairman Victor Gonchar, and the Russian film-maker, Dmitriy Zavadskiy.
What practical initiatives does the Swedish Presidency intend to take to promote an improvement in democracy in Belarus and what measures and steps will be taken to clarify what has happened to those who have disappeared?
Unfortunately, the honourable Member is absolutely right in saying that democracy, human rights and the principle of the rule of law are not respected in an acceptable way in Belarus.
The Council is well aware of the situation that has prevailed for a long time in that country and is following the developments very closely.
The EU has repeatedly appealed to the authorities in Belarus to respect international standards in these extremely important areas.
At the same time, the European Union has made the most of every opportunity to encourage the development of a healthy civil society in Belarus.
The Swedish Presidency will, with great resolve, continue the efforts of the previous presidencies to encourage improvement in democracy in Belarus.
The Council feels that it is only through such improvements that the people of Belarus can fully exercise their power over the future of the country.
By voting in a new president, the people will get the chance this year to take a crucial decision on what their future will hold.
Within the relevant frameworks, the Council will offer the democratic powers every encouragement to guarantee that voters have a real and credible choice of candidates.
The EU' s support of civil society, individual organisations and media is an important element in furthering democracy.
As a neighbour of Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, Belarus will soon border an enlarged EU.
Therefore, the Council is particularly keen that, in the long term, Belarus is established as a partner and it is also keen to ensure stability in the region as a whole.
Naturally, the Council has complete confidence that the new democracies in the applicant countries will more than cope with the challenges they may come up against.
The three countries mentioned have all played an important and active part through their bilateral diplomatic relations with Belarus.
Furthermore, they can serve as valuable examples to Belarus when it comes to success with regard to reforms and democracy.
Like these countries, the EU has maintained that a policy which aims to isolate Belarus would militate against its own objective.
Therefore, the EU has striven to keep the communication channels with the authorities in Belarus open and offer them incentives to improve relations.
At the same time, the Union has continued to exert pressure for the country to honour its commitments and to give the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group the freedom to act when it attempts to legitimately fulfil its task.
During the coming weeks, the Union will once more present its point of view directly to the authorities in Minsk.
The Union will, of course, also take this opportunity to raise the issue of people who have recently disappeared.
It is a great pleasure and honour to be able to welcome here Lars Danielsson and the Swedish Presidency.
The Swedish language, the language of honour and heroes, has probably never before flowed in this House as it is doing today.
My warm thanks for your reply.
At this point I would like to take up some attendant issues.
They concern the political union which exists in reality between Belarus and Poland and the extent to which the Swedish Presidency is also putting pressure on Russia, as part of a political union with Belarus, to realise the democratic implications, and the implications for its status in the international community, of being in a union with a country which can hardly be described as a democracy.
You mentioned the presidential election in Belarus in 2001.
But 20 percent of the candidates in the so-called parliamentary election last autumn - I was there myself as an observer - were dismissed.
I would also like to emphasise the value of the EU taking action so as to avoid a proliferation effect.
We are, of course, noticing a disturbing development, Mr Danielsson, in the neighbouring country of Ukraine.
We cannot underestimate the possibility of what is happening in Belarus spreading, for we should never forget that the regime in Minsk in fact has blood on its hands.
I think that it is absolutely right to see the development in Belarus, as Mr SacrÃ©deus does, in conjunction with the development in Russia and the development in Ukraine.
In the work programme concerning the cooperation between the EU and Russia which the presidency will present in the General Affairs Council on Monday next week, there is much talk of the need for discussions with Russia concerning the situations in the neighbouring countries of Belarus and Ukraine.
We hope that we will encounter rather more understanding on the part of Russia, also with regard to Russia's responsibility when it comes to actually being able to influence the development in Belarus in a positive way.
We will then combine this with the urgent efforts that I described earlier in my initial reply.
We think that it is important to influence Belarus, which is of course closer to the rest of Europe perhaps than many people think if they have not looked properly at the map.
It is absolutely essential that we take every opportunity, on the part of the Union, to bring about a development towards democracy in Belarus.
Question No 8 by (H-0974/00):
Subject: Women persecuted without asylum or refuge In some countries women suffer cruel persecution and punishment, basic human rights violations which may involve mutilation and may cost them their lives.
In many cases, this is a consequence of the application of fundamentalist laws or the carrying-out of ancestral practices and traditions.
The European Union says that it intends to protect women from such unacceptable persecution and punishment, but it has not yet found a way of translating its declarations into political actions and decisions offering grounds for hope.
Would the Council be in favour of the adoption of measures whereby such situations afflicting women might be considered grounds for granting asylum and refuge, in political terms, in the European Union?
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether he is in favour of women being treated as individuals, for the purposes of visas and asylum requests in the European Union, without having to be dependent on a husband or guardian.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are you in favour of our treating women asking for a visa or for asylum as people in their own right?
I would appreciate an answer, one I hope will be yes.
Naturally, I am in favour of such a scheme.
Each individual will of course be treated precisely as an individual.
We must also remember that in many asylum cases we are dealing with family reunions of different kinds.
In that case it may mean that if part of a family has been granted asylum, that will affect the consideration of asylum for other members of the same family.
Then we are, of course, deviating slightly from the principle of individual treatment, but the basic answer to the MEP' s question is: yes.
Question No 9 by (H-0976/00):
Subject: Iraq and the lifting of sanctions Will the Council, under the Swedish Presidency, indicate what level of priority it attaches to the situation in Iraq and, in particular, will it make a clear commitment to press for the lifting of sanctions affecting the health and welfare of men, women and children?
The living conditions of the Iraqi people, together with the endeavour to achieve lasting security and stability in the area, are the most important issues for the Council with regard to its policy towards Iraq.
The Council is at present examining the possibilities open to the Union for making a contribution in the humanitarian and cultural sphere within the framework of existing resolutions concerning Iraq from the UN Security Council.
This concerns in particular the resolution on the oil for food programme.
But it is also important for the Iraqi Government to cooperate in order for such a programme to be implemented.
Of course, the European Union will also in the future fully apply the resolutions drawn up by the UN Security Council against Iraq.
Resolution 1284 from 1999 provides the opportunity to lift the sanctions, provided the Iraqi Government cooperates fully with the UN inspectors responsible for disarmament in Iraq.
In this connection the Council also notes and welcomes the establishment of a working party within the UN which will draw up general recommendations on improving UN sanctions, on how they are to be better directed and on how to avoid unnecessary human suffering.
I should like to thank the President-in-Office for his answer and also to wish him well for the Swedish Presidency.
However, as a follow-up to what he has already stated, does the presidency feel that the operation of the Compensation Commission on Iraq, which is based in Geneva, should continue?
As you know, this commission also deals with the question of reparations in the aftermath of the Gulf War.
We have already seen the negative effects in publicity terms of the sanctions and how they are being used by Saddam Hussein to beat Western Europe, as well as the Americans and the UN, and to rally his people back.
The statement last night was that this was a victory of good over evil and that Saddam Hussein was good and the rest of the world was evil.
We are playing into his hands by ensuring that people are denied access to medicines, food and the other necessities of life.
I think it is important to remember that the fundamental prerequisites for being able to lift the sanctions against Iraq are that the Iraqi regime cooperates fully, in particular with the UN's inspectors, with regard to the control of whether Iraq still has access to weapons of mass destruction.
This is also the decisive point for the Union when it comes to discussing possible changes to the sanctions.
As regards the UN Compensation Committee based in Geneva, which, as you know, has been working since the Gulf War to settle claims resulting from the war, I think it is sensible to wait for an assessment from the UN of how this work is continuing before we in the Union take a stand on whether or not this activity will continue.
Allow me to stress that I believe it to be necessary for us in the Union, from a general point of view, to contribute to this discussion of principle on the sanctions instrument itself and its effects.
We have many examples today of good political grounds for introducing sanctions against a particular country, but we have difficulty in ensuring that these sanctions actually affect those we want them to affect, i.e. the governments in these countries.
I think that, on the part of the Council, there is every reason, both as regards Iraq and in general, to continue the discussion on the form the sanctions instrument should take.
As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses.
Mrs Ferrer asked me to take over her question and said she would inform the relevant service accordingly.
Mr Van Hecke, according to the Rules of Procedure, a written note should have been sent to indicate that you were taking over the question, as has been done in the case of Mr Crowley.
I must apply the Rules of Procedure.
My hands are tied in this matter.
I am very sorry.
Since they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 11 and 12 will be taken together.
Question No 11 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0983/00):
Subject: Burma
Could the Council give an assessment of the progress, or otherwise, being made through their policy of 'constructive engagement' with the military regime in Rangoon?
Question No 12 by Richard Corbett (H-1004/00):
Subject: ASEAN and Burma
What is the Council' s reaction to the ASEAN meeting of 24 November 2000 at which the ASEAN leaders reportedly insisted that EU meetings with ASEAN must involve all ten ASEAN member states, including Burma?
Does the Council agree that repression in Burma has actually worsened since the strengthening of the EU common position in April 2000 and that it remains inappropriate to engage in cooperative ministerial discussions with representatives of that regime?
The Council shares the honourable Members' concerns regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar, including the new restrictions which have been introduced against the National League for Democracy during recent months.
The Council also notes the recent relatively positive development thanks to the endeavours made by the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Burma, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, and the opening of a channel for dialogue between Aung San Sui Kyi and the military junta.
The Council has on a number of occasions expressed its concern in statements and initiatives and in the EU's Common Position of 1996.
The Council has also repeatedly demanded that human rights be respected and specific measures taken towards democracy and national reconciliation.
The Council would hardly describe its policy as constructive engagement, but rather as an attempt to achieve change by applying pressure by means of sanctions and through dialogues.
As the honourable Member, Richard Corbett, reminded us, the EU's Common Position was tightened significantly in April of last year in the light of the Council's concern over the worsening situation in Burma/Myanmar.
At the same time, the Council agreed to send another troika mission to Rangoon.
It seems now as if the mission will be undertaken later this month.
The Union has made it clear, including at the last ministerial meeting between the EU and Asean in Vientiane in December of last year, that they are expecting the EU troika to be given the same opportunities to meet all the parties involved, whether they are from the Government, the National League for Democracy or ethnic minorities.
The ministerial meeting in Vientiane, which Burma/Myanmar participated in, presented an appropriate opportunity not only to strengthen the bonds which unite the EU and Asean but also to express the Union's concern regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar directly to the Burmese foreign minister.
The Council also welcomes the fact that, in the Common Position which was agreed on in Vientiane, both the EU and Asean undertake to support the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Burma, Tan Sri Razali Ismail, in his efforts to bring about positive change in Burma.
Mr President, may I also welcome the Presidency-in-Office.
I appreciate the answer but I do have to ask, with the knowledge that of course Aung San Suu Kyi has been under virtual house arrest now for about 120 days: how can you suggest that a prisoner is able to carry out a meaningful dialogue or negotiation with her jailer?
That is my first question.
Secondly, should not she and the NLD actually be offered basic freedoms before we are prepared to embrace the SPDC in this way?
You say that the troika will have access to areas and to as many individuals as it wants.
Are you imposing conditions on this troika visit, which would mean that they are absolutely obligated to give that kind of access?
Finally, just one last sceptical comment: in 1994 Aung San Suu Kyi did have some negotiation with the SLORC, as they were called then, and they said all the time that she was being far too inflexible, this woman is impossible to deal with because she keeps asking us to respect the results of the 1990 election.
I wonder whether you are concerned that they might be still playing games with the European Union and the international community and they will again say: "look, this woman is impossible."
Firstly, allow me say that I naturally fully share the concern expressed by Mrs Kinnock regarding the situation in Burma/Myanmar.
The Council has the same basic opinion as that expressed by Mrs Kinnock in her question, namely that it is obvious that we must impose stringent conditions on Burma/Myanmar with regard to human rights.
I would like to remind you that the European Union is active in several areas with regard to the fight for human rights in that country.
The Union is active within the ILO, in the UN Human Rights Commission and in the UN General Assembly.
A condition for the contacts I have described and those which we hope to be able to make at the planned visit with the troika is of course that we receive full access to all so-called parties in Burma/Myanmar.
This goes without saying, but unfortunately we can now see that the situation in Burma/Myanmar is also getting more unsettled for other reasons.
There are obviously border conflicts going on now between Bangladesh and Myanmar, which could also affect the situation within Burma/Myanmar.
So, allow me to assure you that the Council fully shares Mrs Kinnock's concern with regard to the situation.
This does not in any way mean that we should dance to the tune of the Burmese Government.
We are making strong demands for complete accessibility, with regard to both the NLD and ethnic minorities.
The latter must not, of course, be forgotten in this connection.
Thank you for that very comprehensive answer.
As you know, the next ministerial meeting between the EU and the ASEAN countries is due to take place in Europe.
At the moment we have a ban against travel into any of the EU Member States by any member of the military regime in Burma and their families.
They will, therefore, not be able to take part in that meeting.
ASEAN countries are pressuring the Union to lift that ban.
Can I have your assurance that you will not give in to such pressure?
The Council does not give in to pressure.
The Council has still not made a decision regarding Burmese participation in the forthcoming ministerial meeting between the EU and Asean which Mr Corbett referred to.
The Council will eventually make a decision on the basis of the Common Position approved by the Union concerning relations with Burma/Myanmar.
I can assure Mr Corbett that we probably have exactly the same opinion regarding what is necessary for the Council to be able to accept Burmese participation in this ministerial meeting.
Question No 13 by (H-0985/00):
Subject: Fisheries and Swedish Presidency Will the Council, under the Swedish Presidency, outline what level of importance it attaches to the fisheries sector having regard, in this connection, to the extremely difficult situation being experienced at present by fishermen in Ireland and other EU countries and will it outline its priorities with regard to the next development programme for the fishing fleet for the period 2002 - 2006?
It is not clear from the honourable Member' s question whether it is directed at the Council or the Swedish Presidency.
Nevertheless, I am pleased to be able to take the opportunity, as also requested by the honourable Member, briefly to mention a few priorities with regard to the future policy for the Community's fishing fleet.
Firstly, allow me to say that the presidency attaches great importance to the common fisheries policy and that we are fully aware of the difficult situation faced by the fishing industry after the drastic cuts in quotas etc. at the Council's meeting in December of last year.
However, the cuts were necessary in the light of the situation regarding fish stocks, particularly with regard to cod and hake, and which also affected a number of other species.
As the Council sees it, the obvious remedy for this situation in the long term is to establish a lasting balance between the fishing capacity and the available resources in order to enable a lasting and sustainable utilisation of living marine resources and to safeguard the future livelihood of the fishermen.
The presidency therefore intends to arrange a general debate in the Council on the follow-up to the development programmes which have been taking place over several years once the fourth of these development programmes has been completed on 31 December 2001.
The Commission will table its proposals in the near future.
We are well aware that a balance has not been achieved by the present programmes and that they have been controversial in certain quarters.
In addition to the structural problems which were specifically mentioned in the question, the presidency's priorities also include starting work on the Commission's green paper on the future of the common fisheries policy and drawing up a proposal from the presidency on fishing and the environment, i.e. the integration of environmental issues and the principle of sustainable development in the common fisheries policy.
This is part of the Cardiff process, and the Council is obliged to present such a document at the meeting of the European Council in Gothenburg.
The presidency does not consider there to be much scope for taking support measures to the advantage of an individual Member State. Rather, the common fisheries policy ought to be developed for the benefit of the fishing sector throughout the Union.
It has surely not escaped the attention of the honourable Member that the drastic cuts in fishing opportunities will be followed by plans for the restoration of the threatened stocks.
In this connection we have invited the European Parliament to cooperate by submitting its opinion in January on the proposal for a recovery plan for cod in the Irish Sea, and these measures can come into effect as early as 14 February 2001.
We appreciate the work the European Parliament has done in this regard but we are still not convinced that this will actually become reality.
I hope, therefore, that Parliament is willing to cooperate with the Council on this point.
Thank you for your response and also for giving us a few more moments.
I am delighted that you have been so realistic as to describe the cuts as drastic, because that is all they can be described as.
However, I also realise that it is necessary to have cuts in order to ensure that we have sufficient resources for this generation and, indeed, future generations.
I refer to your comments on recovery plans. I would ask you to assure us that you will make every effort to ensure that when the recovery plans are being discussed it is not only the scientists but also the stakeholders and the fishermen who will be involved in these discussions.
All the fishermen I know are realists and they realise that it is necessary to have closed areas to protect the breeding grounds.
In short, can you give us an assurance that you will make an effort to have the fishermen involved in any recovery plans?
I fully agree with the honourable Member' s view.
When we discuss such important issues, it is important that all parties concerned are able to take part in the discussion in an appropriate way.
I think that it is quite obvious that this type of discussion should have a scientific basis, but all those involved, including representatives of the fishermen, should of course have the opportunity to participate in it.
I can therefore assure you that, as far as the presidency is concerned, we will do all we can to ensure that there is a thorough discussion with as many of those involved with these important issues as possible.
I should just like to ask the President-in-Office if there will be compensation available because of the cuts and what effect this will have on the livelihoods of fishermen?
Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen?
The question raised by the honourable Member is, of course, very important, particularly for the fishermen who are affected.
However, I am afraid that the question has been directed to the wrong person, i.e. the President-in-Office of the Council.
This is, as we see it, a question which should preferably be directed to the Commission, which is responsible for this area.
Thank you very much, Mr Danielsson, for having done more than your duty in this first Question Time.
Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 22 will be answered in writing.
Questions Nos 23 and 24 will not be taken since their subject is included in the agenda for the current part-session.
That concludes Questions to the Council.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.43 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)
Civil aviation
The next item is the report (A5-0393/2000) by Mr Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation.
. Mr President, I have been given a very generous eight minutes on my report here in front of this packed Chamber this evening - I suspect that is because many people find this report quite technical and detailed.
Whilst drawing up the second liberalisation package in 1989, the Council and the Commission agreed that Community air transport policy had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation.
Subsequently, Council Regulation 3922/91 was established in which the technical requirements, known as Joint Aviation Requirements, formulated by the JAA, were given the force of law within the Community.
It is against this background that the Joint Aviation Requirements, known as JAR-OPS, agreed by the JAA in 1995, are now being transposed into European Union law.
This in itself has proved to be a difficult exercise.
But the Community has committed itself to adopting harmonised safety requirements for the operation of aircraft.
In this regard, the JAR-OPS 1 Regulation constitutes a good basis from which we can work, with minimum changes, in order to amend the appropriate regulations.
However, there are areas in which Parliament needs to act.
Firstly, in regard to cabin crew.
Operators should have the responsibility for training, but this should be done on a harmonised basis, with a distinct, uniform, European-wide certification system which would be accepted by all Member States.
There is no doubt in my mind that in most cases the operators are best qualified to organise training.
But this should not preclude other qualified organisations from having the possibility to do training, providing, of course, that all training is approved by the National Civil Aviation Authorities.
In addition, the cabin crew directive should now be incorporated into this regulation.
Secondly, the difficult issue of flight time limitation was not addressed by the Commission.
The relevant part, known as Subpart Q, is missing.
This is nonsensical, because you cannot have a directive which purports to have safety as a major part of it leaving out the issue of duty time for cockpit crews.
In this area, the social partners have been trying to reach an agreement for ten years.
Ten years and no agreement must be a failure by any measurement you wish to adopt.
However, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism recognise that the best people to deal with this problem are indeed the trade unions and the airline operators and, in a spirit of compromise, have agreed to give all sides until 1 May 2001 to reach an agreement that will form the text of a new Subpart Q.
However, should they fail in their endeavours then, at the second reading stage, Parliament, through the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, will act and legislate in this area.
I am hopeful that the relevant social partners will reach an agreement.
I am grateful to them for their current efforts.
Amendments have been proposed that also look at the problem of cabin baggage.
Sadly, airlines at present do not strictly enforce cabin baggage regulations, which has led to passengers bringing more and more bags into airline cabins.
Amendment No 16 addresses this problem, which was highlighted to me by the cabin crew themselves and even some airlines.
I find it totally amazing that groups in Parliament will vote against this amendment.
This is a safety issue, and as their rapporteur I would ask them to seriously reconsider their opinion.
This amendment is totally acceptable to all airlines and cabin crew and it in no way stops passengers having cabin baggage.
What it does is stop the excessive cabin baggage which has led to passengers being injured from luggage falling out of overhead bins; to passengers having restricted access in case of emergency evacuation procedures and, which I know from my own experience, to aircraft toilets being used to carry bags.
Whilst I appreciate that MEPs are amongst the worst culprits for excessive cabin baggage, I would hope their sense of responsibility would enable them to recognise that a problem exists, that this problem compromises safety and that Amendment No 16 should be supported.
I believe that the report before us is worth supporting.
However, in conclusion, I feel I must reiterate the warning I made earlier that we need an agreement on flight time limitation before 1 May from our social partners.
If they can deliver that agreement for us, then I believe we will have a document that we can rightly be proud of.
I have to say that if they fail in their endeavours, I am sure Parliament will feel obliged to act on their behalf.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Simpson, we have to agree with much of what you said.
It is true that it became clear in 1989 with the liberalisation package that the European Community must not only ensure fair competition but must also ensure safety in aviation.
The present amendment of the regulation aims to do that and I think it is right for the European institutions to clearly assume their responsibility.
That means that if we are responsible for regulating aviation safety in Europe, we must also take the appropriate action.
But at the same time we must also make it clear that Parliament and political bodies such as the Commission and the Council should not disregard the vote of experts.
So I very much welcome the fact that we held a very pragmatic debate in committee and nobody really tried to enter into the details of the technical rules or, so to speak, to put political knowledge above the knowledge of the experts.
You quite rightly also pointed out, and I think that is quite clear, that we need rules on duty time, and I myself am surprised that in spite of this long process the social partners have still not managed to put rules together.
That is why I also think it is right for us as Parliament to make it clear once again that we expect the social partners airlines and employees' representatives to fulfil their obligation.
We are prepared to introduce this into the regulation too, at second reading.
On the other hand, we are equally prepared to put our own rules in place if the social partners do not fulfil their obligation. For one thing is quite clear: safety in aviation must take priority.
Yet safety in aviation cannot be ensured just by having rules, especially not overarching rules.
That is why I also say quite plainly: however much we can agree with large sections of the report, we do not consider it appropriate for Parliament to introduce its own detailed provisions into this regulation in certain areas under the heading, for instance, of "one cabin crew member operations" or length of experience, i.e. how long someone has already served as a cabin crew member.
So unfortunately we will not be able to vote for your Amendments Nos 9 and 10, which concern such proposals.
I was somewhat surprised to see how intently the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered and discussed the question of hand baggage.
In my view that is not an issue for a parliament to discuss and I can only say to Mr Simpson and my other colleagues: let the airlines regulate that; it is not the job of Members.
Mr President, Mr Simpson, Commissioner, I hoped for a moment, just after seeing the news - and in fact things were looking a bit that way - that we would start with a debate on fox hunting, which will doubtless prove to be an extremely lively debate in Britain' s House of Commons this evening.
We are also going to be discussing dangerous matters here.
We highlighted one particular aspect recently at any rate, that of the flight time of pilots, and we also put questions to the Commissioner on the subject at an earlier stage.
I am delighted that a situation has arisen in the meantime in which the partners have had it pointed out to them once again that they still have the chance to enter into consultation or reach agreements.
If they do not do so then, as others have already said, this will automatically mean asking the Commission to draw up legislation in this area which will at least prevent accidents from occurring as a result of pilots spending too long at the controls.
Research from which we once obtained answers now takes too long, and these negotiations could speed this up, and perhaps in time we will gain an even better understanding of what all the important factors might be.
One aspect that we did not raise during the discussions, because it only came into play later on, is the one that we have also tabled an amendment on, namely that of long haul flights.
It is becoming increasingly apparent - and claims to this effect are now being made not only in Australia, but also in England, concerning British Airways - that long haul flights can cause people to develop thromboses.
We cannot yet be completely certain of this, nor do we have all the relevant facts in our possession yet, but we recognise the seriousness of the situation all the same, and wonder if it would not be sensible to request the Commission - via an amendment in this case, otherwise we will do so using other means - to come up with some initiatives on this front.
Finally, and this is something we have given no thought to hitherto, there is the fact that some aviation companies with large aircraft are starting to fly at a higher altitude, which also produces symptoms of illness.
We will revisit this issue at a later stage.
Mr President, Mr Simpson's report is truly excellent, and I am qualified to say so for I consider myself to be one of the few people who are familiar with the technical as well as the political side of the sector, having recorded almost 10 000 flight hours precisely as a member of a flight crew before devoting myself to politics.
I would point out that safety is the priority in air transport. Safety can be considered to be based on two elements: the technical element, such as the resources, aircraft, airports, radio aid, air traffic control and so on and so forth, and then the human element, which is extremely important and, although not the principal cause, has been found to be a contributing factor in an extremely high percentage of aircraft accidents.
The human element is, of course, extremely complex and, for simplicity's sake, can be divided into two main categories.
One of these is training, and in this area all the appropriate controls and checks must be carried out.
I can say from my own experience that flight crews are properly trained for, apart from anything else, there are no substandard pilots. As a general rule, substandard pilots do not fly: they are all resting in peace underground.
The other category is workload.
The problems here are enormous: on the one hand, there is the need to make both aircraft and staff fly as much as possible, and on the other, there is the need to avoid pushing human beings, especially, beyond their physical and mental limits.
Sleep, the disruption of circadian rhythms and so on clearly influence flight safety as well as the personal health of the members of the flight and cabin crews.
Here, then, is the gap in the regulation, for it considers primarily the technical aspect of the resources - aircraft load factors, loading operations, length of runways, screen heights etc. but it is effectively lacking in any provisions on the workloads of the staff.
I am not talking as a trade unionist here but precisely as a user of air transport who would dearly like to have a guarantee - although I regret that a 100% guarantee is impossible - which is as high as possible and avoids excessive exploitation of the human element which is liable to have serious or even fatal consequences.
Another factor to be taken into consideration is competition.
If there are no standard rules, some of the airlines who exploit their staff will be able to reduce their costs and therefore offer more competitive prices, distorting what ought to be fair competition in a sector which is now almost completely liberalised.
However, we could even go so far as to talk of unfair or irregular competition if this factor were not taken into account, and I wonder at the fact that neither the Union as a whole nor Parliament, specifically, has succeeded in regulating the matter satisfactorily.
Parliament should feel truly ashamed at not having managed to express a clear opinion or produce an effective definition of all aspects of the issue.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I consider this regulation extremely important and after all the European Parliament has been calling for an improvement in aviation safety since 1987.
That means we must also regulate the flight and rest times of the cockpit crew as of the cabin crew.
I agree with the previous speakers that we should give the unions and the airlines a last chance to settle this issue between themselves, working jointly and pragmatically.
Of course we have agreed that they must reach an agreement by May next year.
Madam Vice-President, please tell your services that if they have not done so by the end of May we will no longer play the game that has been played for six years, namely with the Commission waiting for the parties to reach agreement.
But they have not reached agreement.
The Commission behaved very politely and did not make any proposals of its own.
Either the parties agree by May, or we expect the Commission to put forward a proposal that we can incorporate in the second reading. For it is unacceptable not to regulate a question that is crucial to passenger safety, namely whether the captains, the crews, have had enough rest to be able to carry out their duties.
These issues must be settled.
Let me address a second point that caught my attention at the December Council meeting.
If we adopt a position at first reading, in fact at Parliament's final vote tomorrow, then I insist as I am sure my colleagues will also do on the Council deciding a common position.
It can wait till May, till the two parties have reached agreement.
But in the interests of passenger safety in Europe we cannot accept no decisions being taken on aviation until the supposed settlement of the Gibraltar conflict.
The Commission and Parliament should jointly see to that.
Mr President, as mentioned in 1989, the Council and the Commission agreed that they had to address the harmonisation of the regulatory framework applicable to civil aviation in order to maintain a high level of safety and to ensure fair competition in the internal market.
Hence, the Community adopted Council Regulation 3922/91.
This regulation listed a number of technical requirements - JARs - produced by the Joint Aviation Authority.
It was not the purpose of this regulation to re-open a debate on the substance of JAR: the purpose was to ensure harmonisation.
In addition, it should be recognised that JAR-OPS has been implemented on a national basis and is applicable to European countries outside the EU.
Therefore changes must be kept to a minimum as there cannot be two different sets of operational regulations in force across Europe.
The Commission's original proposal highlighted four areas which were found to be incompatible in EU law: exemptions, leasing, registration and cabin crew training.
Unfortunately, the debate so far has centred on cabin baggage and flight time limitations for flight crew.
On the first point - cabin baggage - the amendments are anti-competitive and cannot apply to third-country carriers.
Sufficient regulation is already in place, which does not allow on board hand baggage which cannot be safely stowed - I can vouch for that as a cabin crew member for 26 years.
On my second point - flight time limitations, which are already highly regulated and agreed through national governments - civil aviation is now included in working time regulation.
Irrespective of the decision taken on 1 May, this issue would have to be referred back to national governments for further discussion.
It is not for Parliament to legislate on flight time limitations.
Finally, I believe that in future safety and highly technical reports such as this should be subject to a simplified procedure in order to process necessary changes more speedily.
Mr President, Commissioner, there are some things that are not quite as we would wish them to be in European aviation.
Last year, in particular, showed us repeatedly that it is high time to find more common European solutions to ensure that flying in European airspace follows orderly lines again, not to speak of the great dream of limitless freedom above the clouds conjured up by Reinhard Mey.
But first and foremost, flying must be safe.
We all want flying to remain safe, to see further improvements here in the forefront the rapporteur, Mr Simpson, to whom we owe thanks for an excellent report.
There are, however, different views on how to achieve greater safety.
I and luckily I am not alone in my view would hope that we leave the practical task of regulating the safety provisions, especially in regard to cabin crew and the accompanying provisions on crew training, to the European Aviation Safety Authority.
Surely it should be enough for the European legislator to set out the objectives, rather than getting bogged down in too much detail.
Unfortunately, this position did not gain consistent majority support in committee.
As a result the text we will be voting on tomorrow includes some rather too detailed provisions, for instance on the kind of training course required and so forth.
Perhaps less would be more in this case.
Be that as it may, Europe still has a great deal to do on the question of aviation.
As we saw in Nice on a very general basis, here too on a more specific basis we could plead for fewer national solutions and a more European approach.
The Simpson report is a good step along this road.
Let us take that step tomorrow and then pursue it further in a politically convincing manner.
Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, in the past, Parliament has continually demonstrated its commitment to the harmonisation of safety standards at the highest possible level for the Union.
Now it must continue to do so, and to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that this is clearly visible to the European citizens, who every year continue to suffer the problems of the European area.
We all agree that the objective is to successfully do away with national discrepancies in order to arrive at a set of common safety standards at the highest possible level.
Air safety cannot be confined to European Union territory, and it is important for European citizens who travel or live near airports to be confident that aircraft from third countries fulfil all the necessary safety criteria.
The Union must therefore have control methods to ensure that, in accordance with international regulations, third country aircraft arriving at our airports comply with international safety regulations.
This means common control methods and technical and administrative organisation and support.
It is therefore inevitable that safety in this sector should become a matter for international cooperation within the framework of the different instruments for technical assistance and support for investment in third countries.
Mr President, I will end by pointing out the need to assist the Commission in its work in this very complicated field and the priority which must be given to creating the European Air Safety Agency, as well as the need for independent regulations, which we are currently considering, on issues relating to rest periods for aircrew.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Simpson for his magnificent work as rapporteur on this proposal.
I believe that his work has contributed a considerable amount to this Parliament' s understanding of a very technical and complex proposal and it is of course no easy task to translate it into a language which is accessible to the average citizen.
In this respect I believe that he has been very successful.
Having said that, the amendment we are proposing to the Regulation currently in force has twin objectives: firstly, it intends to move forward with the harmonisation of the regulatory system in the field of safety in civil aviation by extending it to the harmonisation of the operational requirements for aircraft; secondly, it intends to establish procedures which will allow the Community to manage the variables and exceptions which the Member States are obliged to adopt from time to time as a result of operational needs.
With regard to technical requirements, the report mainly deals with two aspects.
In accordance with JAA regulations, which lay down the requirements, the Commission' s proposal does not contain any provisions on flight and duty times or on rest periods.
This is a very controversial issue and the reality is that no agreement has been reached in this regard within the JAA.
Of course, the Commission hopes that the negotiators representing the operators and the crews will be successful, and Mr Simpson has urged them to reach a voluntary agreement on safety systems relating to flight and duty times and rest periods.
If they are not capable of reaching agreements by May, we will then have to consider whether or not we should act.
In any event, of the relevant amendments, the Commission accepts the spirit of Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 17, but with a different wording.
With regard to Amendment No 1, the Commission shares Parliament' s desire to regulate the safety of flight and duty times and rest periods, but prefers that compliance with this objective not only be pursued by means of the specific proposal that we are debating today.
There are other possibilities, such as amending the Regulation after the adoption of the present proposal.
I would like to add that any proposal presented by the Commission in the future will have to guarantee the high level of safety that we all wish to see.
Therefore, if the Commission makes use of the voluntary agreement between the negotiators, to which I have just referred, to produce a proposal, it would amend the agreement where necessary in order to achieve the necessary high level of safety.
With this reservation, I repeat, the Commission accepts the spirit of Amendment No 1.
Various amendments have also been adopted on the requirements applicable to cabin crews.
While this proposal deals with the operational requirements of cabin crews, the training and professional qualification requirements are the subject of a separate and supplementary Commission proposal.
We must take care to ensure that the two texts are in agreement and compatible with one another.
Amendments Nos 9 and 10 can be accepted without changes, but the wording of Amendments Nos 6, 7, 8 and 11 will have to be modified, as well as Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 17, which we now accept only in principle, and their wording will also have to be modified.
Finally, the amendments on technical requirements, specifically Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 16, are acceptable, although the final text of Amendment No 4 will reflect the solution to the problem in question as found by the Council.
In relation to the procedures for the approval of temporary variables and exceptions, the Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 2, 14 and 15.
The Commission is already under institutional obligation to carry out the consultations laid down in the amendments.
Likewise, Amendment No 3 must be rejected, since derogation of the Regulation is envisaged once the European Air Safety Agency has been created.
Lastly, with regard to Amendment No 18, the two issues it addresses are concerned more with the health of passengers than the operational safety of flights.
As was mentioned in the Communication on the protection of air passengers, the Commission intends to establish groups of experts to examine the risks to passengers' health, including those resulting from cosmic radiation, with the aim of determining what these risks are and proposing the necessary measures.
With regard to the specific issue of arterial thrombosis - which has been raised by some of you - the Commission has written to the airlines to request that they provide passengers with information on the risks, on factors for predisposition and on what they can do to minimise those risks, specifically in relation to the problem of thrombosis and in relation to health problems in general.
The Commission considers that such information would be a very valid precaution and that it would be appropriate in terms of improving passengers' rights.
Thank you, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Priorities in road safety
The next item is the report (A5-0381/2000) by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament resolution on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Priorities in EU Road Safety - Progress Report and Ranking of Actions.
, rapporteur.
(SV) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all my fellow Members in Parliament and in the Committee for the support they have given me in my work on this report.
Safety on our roads is something which concerns us all, whether we ourselves are road-users or whether someone in our family or a friend has been killed or injured.
Transportation by road is the most common and the fastest growing means of travelling and of transporting articles and goods, but also the most dangerous.
Each year, over 42,000 people are killed on our European roads.
This means more than 800 people a week and over 115 people this very day.
Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of death of children and young persons - indeed, of all persons under the age of 45 - in the EU today.
Millions of people are also seriously injured each year, and many will end up handicapped for life.
This is a matter of great human suffering and of heavy social costs.
We would never tolerate such mortality figures in aviation or on the railways, where our approach to safety is totally different.
So, if we are to minimise the number of fatalities on the roads, we must adopt the same philosophy with regard to roads, since this also involves a complicated man-machine system which must incorporate tolerance of human error.
The objective in the long-term should be that no-one should be killed or seriously injured.
To attain this objective, we must take a comprehensive view in which the ultimate responsibility lies with those who design the roads and the surrounding infrastructure.
It is the responsibility of road-users to follow the rules and laws which have been laid down.
The Commission' s communication contains a list of priorities for measures for the remaining period of the Programme.
I agree with the Commission concerning the significance of several of these measures such as the aid to EuroNCAP, information campaigns, legislation on speed governors for light trucks, and - especially - legislation on safer car fronts.
In my report, I went on to concentrate on the forthcoming period of the Programme, which would have to cover a longer period - let us say, the period 2002-2010 - to enable a more long-term strategy to be adopted.
But if the Commission is really serious about its ambitions to reduce the number of fatalities, we will first of all have to give higher priority to the whole question of road safety, because this matter requires powerful measures
First of all, a credible strategy for combating death on the roads must, over the next decade, include concrete numerical targets for reducing the number of fatalities.
The Committee proposes those targets which were already established by Parliament three years ago.
But objectives at EU level are not sufficiently concrete for the Member States where, as we all know, a large part of the work is done.
Each Member State must therefore devise its own roadsafety programmes (which not all Member States have at present), including strategies for attaining the national targets.
These can of course differ between the various countries, depending on tradition and culture.
However, after that, the Commission should follow up how the Member States comply with their strategies and should take part in the exchange of experiences and best practice.
We also need European legislation in certain important areas.
Alcohol kills approximately 9 000 people on the roads each year.
Furthermore, the trend indicates that more and more young people are driving with alcohol in their blood.
An estimated 1 000 lives could be saved by introducing a directive with a maximum blood alcohol limit of 0.5 mg/ml.
Unfortunately, the Commission has withdrawn its former proposal for a directive - one which was supported by Parliament in 1997 and which the Committee supports even now.
According to the Commission, drink-driving is a question that falls under the principle of subsidiarity.
But how can that be?
Surely it cannot be any less dangerous to drive with alcohol in the blood in Great Britain, Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg, where an 0.8 mg/ml limit applies, than it is in the rest of Europe.
We have powers in the EU when it comes to issues concerning road traffic safety.
In my opinion, we should use these powers precisely in those areas where they have a real effect, and they do have a real effect where alcohol and driving are concerned.
I expect the Council and the Swedish Presidency to take the initiative in this matter.
I cannot understand how we can possibly gain credibility as European politicians if we, on the one hand, say that traffic safety is important but, on the other hand, are not prepared to take important decisions.
I understand that the Commission has today issued a recommendation for a limit of 0.5 mg/ml, but I must say that it is remarkable that it should be issued today, just when Parliament is about to discuss the issue and before Parliament has voted.
The Commission should have waited for Parliament to have held its discussion.
In addition to this matter, and the matter of safer car fronts, the report contains a number of other important proposals for traffic safety measures.
I raise issues such as dipped headlights in the daytime, driving education and telematic systems.
To conclude, one question which I consider to be of the utmost importance but which, unfortunately, was not passed by the Committee is that of the need for better working conditions for professional drivers.
The European Parliament has always been a force for the promotion of improved road safety, and we have to continue in this direction.
It is a matter of the life and health of numerous people - but, above all, those of the young citizens of Europe.
Mr President, 40,000 fatalities on Europe' s roads is 40,000 too many.
This Chamber reacts with sensitivity to all the events taking place around the world, but we do not give sufficient attention to the Grim Reaper at work on the roads of Europe.
Without in any way underrating the significance of mad cow disease I am nevertheless asking for a sense of proportion.
Thousands more of our fellow creatures die in traffic accidents than from BSE.
This should be a cause for panic.
I would like to thank the Commission for its outstanding analysis of the situation.
EU cooperation is needed more than ever, as there are dramatic differences in the levels of road safety within our Community.
Four times as many people die in road accidents in Portugal than in Britain.
However, there is plenty more scope for improvement in every country.
The traffic environment must be made to become as safe as possible, but drivers are always responsible for their own safety and that of others on the road.
A car in a garage is completely harmless, but when it is being used wrongly it is like a deadly weapon.
Traffic regulations are not cookery book recipes that everyone can adapt to their own taste.
The time for individuality on our roads is past: we need just as strict compliance with the regulations on the roads as we do with air travel.
I will mention three important ways of reducing the number of road fatalities.
Firstly, there is compliance with speed restrictions.
I often drive in the Mediterranean countries, and, believe it or not, close to within the speed restriction, and I am constantly being overtaken.
And it is no wonder, because only very rarely do I see any speed controls in operation.
The accident statistics for these areas speak plainly.
This laxness is paid for in human life and the tears of those left behind.
Around two out of every three drivers in Europe go over the speed limit in built-up areas and half break the speed limit on the open road.
If mad cows should be removed from pasture land, mad speed merchants should be removed from the roads.
An effective, if not very popular, remedy is automatic speed controls and heavy penalties.
Certainly in my country, Finland, the EUR 100 000 fines paid by some amount to just routine fare collections.
Secondly, in vino veritas: there is truth in wine.
It is also true that alcohol plays a part in no less than 9 000 cases of death a year.
I think it is important that Member States switch to an alcohol limit of 0.5 per mil, which can also be monitored.
If Member States lack the courage to do this, the matter must be dealt with through decision-making at European level.
People sometimes have to be protected from their own governments.
In repeated cases of drunken driving, or when the driver is well over the limit, there should be a long ban and the car should be confiscated by the state.
The third point has to do with taxation.
High taxes on cars lead to old and unsafe cars on the road.
My country is a sad example of this.
Finland is the Cuba of Europe when it comes to the age of cars.
Cars that fulfil stringent safety standards should also benefit from lower taxation.
In general, taxation should focus on a car' s use and not its purchase price.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish you a safe trip.
Remember to fasten your safety belt in the back too.
Mr President, first of all I thank the rapporteur for her splendid work on behalf of us all and also thank Mr Vatanen for his contribution, speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.
I fully endorse many of the points he made, not least in respect of blood-alcohol limits.
In fact there are only two points that I wish to make this evening.
They relate to safer car fronts and the very important issue of blood alcohol.
On safer car fronts, I think it is worth pointing out how clearly the rapporteur has made the case for the Commissioner to come forward with a directive.
In fact this Commissioner pledged to this House in January last year, a year ago, that we would have a directive on safer car fronts.
A year on there is no directive.
What we have in February is a hearing.
More talk. No action.
Meanwhile, two thousand people in the last year have needlessly, unnecessarily lost their lives because the Commission would rather talk than act.
I hope tonight and tomorrow the Commission listens to the vote of this House and decides to proceed with its commitment to have a directive on safer car fronts.
No more talk, please. Let us see some action.
And, indeed, the same is true for blood alcohol.
We have had talk on this issue, year in, year out.
We all know that ten thousand people a year in Europe are killed in drink-related crashes.
We must tackle that particular problem.
But I find it highly ironic, and I am sure the timing is not coincidental, that on the very day that we are debating blood alcohol, drink driving, road safety, the day before this Parliament is to vote on drink driving, the Commissioner has already made her mind up.
She has issued a recommendation on drink driving.
It would have been nice, would it not, for the Commissioner to have at least listened to the debate, learned what the outcome of the vote was tomorrow, before she decided to pre-empt the parliamentary procedures and issue this recommendation.
We know a recommendation, alas, is simply not worth the paper it is written on.
Member States need and support clear guidance.
We believe it is time for the Commissioner to get tough on drunk drivers and drink driving, to come forward with a directive to reduce the limit to 50 mg.
In the United Kingdom, which has traditionally had a good record, we have sadly seen over the Christmas period a rise in the numbers of people drinking and driving.
In my own region, in some parts of my region, 17% of drivers tested were above the UK legal limit of 80 mg.
It is quite clear that we need action.
Indeed the British government is asking for a solution at European level, in a European context.
So all I make is a very simple request to the Commissioner tonight to listen to the debate and to heed the vote tomorrow.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding report on a subject which touches the daily lives of every citizen, wherever he or she happens to be in Europe, namely our own safety on the roads and that of our children.
I would like to address three particular points.
Firstly, I would advocate drawing up European legislation with regard to a European pedestrian test and the four associated crash tests.
After 22 years of EU subsidised research, it is clear beyond all doubt that these tests are of value and that hundreds of lives can be spared every year as a result.
This is absolutely paramount for many pedestrians and cyclists, particularly in a densely populated country such as the Netherlands, but also elsewhere of course.
Of course it is very nice of Commissioner Liikanen to allow the car industry more time to make their own arrangements, the bottom-up approach, again giving them time until June, but now in 2001, but it is all taking too long for my liking.
Managing also means making choices, and the time is ripe for this.
A second point I would like to raise relates to alcohol limits in the blood.
Some members of my group will support the rapporteur' s proposal to produce an EU regulation setting an alcohol limit of 0.5 per cent. We do not wish to extend this limit but we do think that harmonisation of this limit will enhance people' s legal certainty in a Union where many citizens cross the internal borders daily, and where the mobility of employees is precisely what we want to promote.
I am not in favour of setting lower limits for certain categories of young road-users though.
The signal we send out must be clear.
Either a standard is safe or it is not.
And 0.5% is a socially responsible, easily measurable and enforceable quantity to my mind.
Now, Commissioner, I would just like to unburden myself of the fact that I think it is extremely discourteous towards Parliament that the Commissioner evidently already decided, in advance of this evening' s debate - in which, when all is said and done, people are calling for a regulation on the alcohol limit - that a recommendation to the Member States will suffice.
This will encourage a non-committal attitude and will certainly do nothing to increase transparency from the citizens' perspective.
My final point relates to the long-term 'Vision Zero' objective.
I have a problem with this.
An objective must be realistic and achievable, that is what motivates and stimulates.
Naturally we can reduce the number of victims, but it would be wishful thinking to believe we could eliminate road accidents altogether.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to express my thanks for the magnificent work done by Mrs Hedkvist Petersen.
There are many reasons for the accidents and the extremely high number of victims on European roads.
The causes are many and varied, and the report has been able to mention and summarise the most important ones.
Furthermore, the Commission communication on priorities in road safety contains six points detailing the aspects on which we can have the greatest impact in order to achieve better results.
I am going to focus on the aspects which refer to the management of the black spots on the roads and the reduction of the effects of impacts on road infrastructures.
A high number of accident victims are users of two-wheeled vehicles, motorcyclists and cyclists, for which roads are also intended.
For cultural and climatic reasons, there are an extraordinary number of these accidents in certain Member States.
Serious studies have concluded that the majority of serious accidents or deaths amongst these groups result from impacts with crash barriers, that is to say, against roadside protective barriers or against vertical road signs, both of which are designed and created for four-wheeled vehicles.
The majority of these accidents happen at the black spots which some Member States are indicating and identifying.
My amendment of the legislative proposal on the design and placing of these soft protective barriers at these black spots is not therefore gratuitous.
We must not be satisfied with a mere recommendation to the Member States or leave this simply to be dealt with through subsidiarity, which would greatly affect its implementation.
We must now be bold.
Let us legislate, let us seek a greater degree of harmonisation, let us promote measures for the rational and safe use of roads by pedestrians and cyclists, and let us seek formulas to reduce heavy traffic, at least in populated areas; let us harmonise the speed limits by means of an ambitious legal framework, as the Commission recommended in 1986, thereby removing the Member States' inertia.
Let us be vigilant of the environmental impact of traffic, such as noise and environmental pollution.
