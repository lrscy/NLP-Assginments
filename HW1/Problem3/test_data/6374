It is never easy to broker an agreement and that is why it is taking time to enact a new European treaty.
These negotiations should not detract from one particular fact, namely that the enlargement of the Union will take place on 1 May 2004.
Â Â  MrÂ President, my Irish friends, congratulations on your victory over England in the rugby, but remember: EU citizens must not be vanquished; they must decide.
Instead of arranging re-matches in Ireland and Denmark when we vote against a new treaty, it would be better if the Presidency were to use the Brussels Summit to say: we shall not sign any new EU Constitution if it has not been voted on in referendums in all the countries.
The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will recommend the voters politely to reject a Constitution that would give the EU legislative power in 15Â new areas instead of limiting the EU to cross-border issues; that would abolish the right of veto in approximately 40Â areas instead of giving the last word to voters and their elected representatives; and that would demand recognition of the EU Constitutionâs priority over the national constitutions instead of respecting the Member Statesâ constitutions.
We would especially warn against the prime ministers being able to alter the constitution without asking the voters.
Use the Brussels Summit to decide that the Constitution must be debated and voted on in referendums in all the EU countries before it can come into force.
Why not have the draft Constitution subjected to advisory referendums at the same time as the elections to the European Parliament in June?
We could then debate our possible common future jointly and choose representatives according to our view of the Constitution.
We could then ourselves decide whether we wish to transfer more power from the voters and elected representatives in the Member States to EU officials and ministers.
Now, a question: will the Presidency say what is happening regarding the secret negotiations concerning the Constitution?
Who is involved; who is being excluded; and who, for example, was present in Berlin?
Is the Presidency fully informed?
Is there agreement as to a compromise draft that can be presented when Chirac thinks the time is ripe?
Finally, a brief question to MrÂ Watson: if the Treaty of Nice is death for enlargement, why, then, did the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party recommend it?
Â Â  â Mr President, on the eve of the Spring European Council, opinion polls indicate that a majority of those questioned are indeed â as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said â in favour of a European constitution, but it has to be added that they say so without having the least conception of what the legal definition of a constitution is, nor of the precise content of the one that has been drawn up.
We can therefore draw the conclusion that these people are in favour of the idea of clarifying relations between the EU and its Member States, but there is certainly nothing more that we can learn from this.
On this basis, and following the statements just made by the Council and the Commission, as well as those made by Mr Giscard d'Estaing to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday, we can perceive the outlines of a federalist strategy, which I would regard as repugnant, and which can be described in the following terms.

A principled compromise is announced just before the European elections; this makes a favourable impression on the electorate, who will go to the polls without having had any real debate on a written draft; finally, if the outcome of the elections appears to be sufficiently favourable to the advocates of a constitution, it is announced that these elections would be seen as equivalent to a consultation, and that such consultation made a referendum unnecessary.
Paradoxically enough, this strategy would end up distorting democratic debate at the same time as it was declared that the old Monnet method had become obsolete for lack of transparency.
The European elections cannot function as a substitute for a referendum; they combine far too many different issues and their results would be far too confusing to allow any message to be validly discerned from them.
If the Heads of States really had, immediately prior to the European elections, agreed on a draft derived from the Conventionâs version â which would be too rigid a model for an enlarged Europe, and something that I would not welcome â then the only way forward, in France at any rate, would be to call a referendum on it.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe that the President-in-Office identified one of the main issues here when he rightly pointed out in his address that it will be very difficult to finalise the adoption of the constitution at a later date if the process is delayed now, because our collective awareness will diminish as new players take the stage and because the political agenda develops in such a way that it is well-nigh impossible to resurrect a project after a year and a half.
For this reason, I believe that the Irish presidency has been pursuing the right approach by probing for potential compromises in a host of bilateral talks.
With Mr HÃ€nsch, Mr Duff and others, we have visited a great many other capitals over the past few months and have been given the impression that everyone wants the treaty to be concluded.
Only on one particular point did it prove impossible to reach an agreement.
It seems to me, however, that views have begun to converge and that those who stand in the way of the agreement are now fewer in number.
For this reason, and because it will become more difficult as time goes on, the Irish presidency should be encouraged to propose at the summit on 25Â March that an extraordinary summit be convened even before the first of May so that an agreement can be reached.
What we stand to lose if we cannot reach that agreement on the Constitutional Treaty is the chance to link enlargement with a more efficient European Union and to anchor the European Union to a bedrock of common values and transfer more power to the people, who would elect the President of the Commission through their vote in the European elections and, by virtue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, enjoy a wide range of legal entitlements and safeguards.
I also believe that we must not jeopardise the achievement of this aim by perpetuating the myth that there is a crucial difference between the large Member States and the small ones.
In all my 24 years as a Member of this House, I have never once experienced a vote in the Council or the European Parliament in which the representatives of the large Member States lined up against those of the small Member States.
Voting is based on interests â whether countries produce wine or not, and so on. That is how things are, and this myth must not stand in the way of decisions.
The Heads of Government must clearly acknowledge their responsibility for ensuring that this myth does not obstruct progress and must not use it as a pretext for stalling.
That is why I wish to make this one point: with this draft constitution, we have a truly unique opportunity to bring the whole of our united Europe together on the basis of the equality of nations and governments.
If this endeavour should fail, Europe will relapse into groups advancing at different speeds with all sorts of barriers between them â not overnight, but at a steady pace.
Responsibility for taking this opportunity lies with the 25 Heads of State or Government, and they must accept it.
Let me conclude by drawing a comparison with the present situation.
In my country, the parliamentary assembly that met in St Paulâs Church in Frankfurt in 1848 adopted a democratic constitution that would have paved the way for a united democratic Germany, and that the King of Prussia declined to accept.
We are all well aware of the consequences of his decision for my country and for Europe.
Todayâs monarchs are the Heads of State or Government.
I hope that they will not make the same fateful error that the King of Prussia committed in 1848.
Â Â  Mr President, there is a need that we have to pursue with determination: the need for the matters concerning the Intergovernmental Conference, or rather the draft constitution, to be addressed in a transparent way, with an approach which can be understood by public opinion, the citizens and by Parliament itself.
You see, MrÂ President-in-Office of the Council, we all appreciate â I think I speak for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which has discussed this a great deal in recent weeks â the determination and delicacy with which the Irish Presidency is acting.
It is a fact, though, that we have been in darkness for three months.
Following the strong element of transparency provided by the Convention for 16 months, we are now in the dark.
You talked of a range of important issues, both institutional and non-institutional, which have been raised with the Irish Presidency.
What issues?
Raised by whom?
By how many and which governments?
We do not know.
You used â and I also acknowledge this â a confident tone, and said that it will be relatively easy to find consensus over the vast majority of outstanding issues.
We can only try to guess at these.
With regard to the most well-known issues, the only ones which have been openly discussed, we set great store by what Mr Giscard d'Estaing said yesterday to our committee: on no account may the double majority criterion be called into question for the calculation of qualified majorities.
Furthermore, Mr Giscard d'Estaing called for us not to âtortureâ, on the one hand, the double majority figures, and on the other, the range of subjects for which decisions can be made by qualified majority.
In this regard, I would like to reaffirm, since you spoke of papers presented by the Italian Presidency ahead of the December Council, that those documents, in our opinion, contain serious reversals precisely in this respect, and are therefore not acceptable to the European Parliament.
Lastly, you were absolutely right when you claimed that the key to early agreement is political will.
We hope that an awareness of the importance and gravity of this time for the Union will prevail among the Heads of State or Government at the forthcoming summit: not adopting the Constitution would amount to a real leap in the dark for the European Union.
Nevertheless, if the path to the Constitution should still appear blocked during the occasion of the forthcoming summit, with all the consequences that we can easily imagine, the positions and responsibilities of the individual governments must in that case be clear to Parliament and to the citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to make four proposals to help the IGC reach a successful conclusion.
Firstly, as regards the qualified majority formula, we need to raise the number of states needed to form a majority, while at the same time raising the population threshold needed to form a blocking minority.
That should please the smaller states and not frighten those larger states which are genuinely committed to making it simpler for the Council to reach a decision.
The sensible equation which seems to be commanding greater support is 55-55.
Secondly, the IGC needs to drop from the constitution a specific number for the size of the Commission, a college which needs to grow and shrink according to supply and demand like any national administration.
We should also drop the principle of equal rotation.
Frankly, having a Commission without a representative from France would be fairly implausible.
Mr Giscard d'Estaing himself concedes that the Convention's formula for the Commission was not the most glorious of our many achievements, and Commissioner Kinnock agrees.
Thirdly, the IGC should be convened at summit level, preferably before 1 May, to enable a genuine political debate with a European dimension to be held.
So far, unfortunately, this has simply not taken place.
Fourthly and finally, our leaders need to find the moral courage to shape Europe politically.
If they fail to do so they will be consigned to history as foolish cowards.
Â Â  Mr President, we are all familiar with the socio-economic problems facing the European Union, which are creating misgivings amongst the citizens of most Member States, and this is particularly true for my country, Portugal, where unemployment continues to grow, where we are in the midst of economic recession and where the gulf that separates us from the EU average is still increasing and the Commission is providing no investment to solve the problem of the deficit.

This is why it is crucial to revise the policies responsible for this situation, and consequently the Commission and the Council need to clarify three issues that I believe are fundamental and require immediate resolution.
First of all, are these institutions willing straightaway to set about making the necessary adjustments to the economic and monetary policy guidelines, with the aim of replacing the Stability Pact with a Social Progress and Employment Pact, in line with the aims of full employment, economic development and economic and social cohesion, in order to guarantee further public investment, more and better employment and greater social inclusion?
Secondly, are they going to ask the European Central Bank to reduce interest rates in order to support economic growth and exports, a key issue for countries with weaker economies such as Portugal?
Thirdly: are they going to approve a moratorium on liberalisations, review the Lisbon Strategy and undertake an in-depth study of the consequences of what has already been implemented in the various economic and social sectors, specifically in terms of employment, the quality and universality of service provided, the degree of user satisfaction and in terms of extending the democratisation of the operation and management of services, without overlooking the problems and shortcomings in most enlargement countries?
Unless these measures are adopted, it will be impossible to implement a policy to boost the economy and to sustain demand in the short- and medium-term.
What is needed, therefore, is a re-evaluation of production and labour with a view to promoting economic development, employment and social cohesion, based on a steady increase in national and Community public investment, particularly in basic infrastructures, in education, in qualifications and vocational training, in research and innovation, in the environment and in support for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
These are the real priorities, which the men and women in our countries hope to see addressed before the European elections of 13 June.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today, those in favour of Europe's enlargement and deepening have, or at least should have, one concern in common: how can the enlarged Europe be prevented from getting stuck; how can we prevent it from becoming a quagmire of indecision?
Europe has always been a source of hope for its citizens; even the governments, regularly failing to solve problems, point to Europe as the place where solutions can be found.
Today, however, Europe instils fear in people.
Unemployment is rising and people fear that this will get worse after the enlargement.
The Member States, whether they are large or small, cannot handle this problem on their own.
Decisions need to be taken at European level in order to promote real economic recovery and a real increase in the level of employment.
At the same time, the Member States must in that way provide an efficient answer to globalisation.
That is why it is their plain and simple duty to ensure that a constitution is adopted.
It is not difficult to explain to 14-year olds or 70-year-old pensioners that we need a constitution, so why is it so difficult for our Heads of Government to brace themselves to put this constitution into practice?
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can agree with Mr Poetteringâs initial statements praising the Irish Presidency and praising the achievements of one of the EUâs smaller countries.
This shows us clearly that it would be a mistake to end the system of rotating the Presidency.
I also appreciate Mr BarÃ³n Crespoâs quotation from Victor Hugo, saying âthe future belongs to the braveâ.
I often compare the process of European integration with the epic poem on the discoveries, in which the great sixteenth century Portuguese poet, CamÃµes, said that we were sailing âon hitherto uncharted watersâ.
We must indeed maintain this openness of spirit, this daring and this capacity for adventure.
We also need to take care to ensure that the ship does not run aground; we must ensure that the crew is informed and motivated and does not start a mutiny.
I am therefore concerned to see that, following a period of some secrecy, it should be announced that the IGC might be concluded hastily.
This could be a life-saver for those who wish to base their campaign in the European elections on euro-scepticism, because public opinion is barely interested at the moment and we still do not know precisely what was put forward in the first phase of the IGC under the Italian Presidency.
Many people have spoken about the issue of qualified majority voting, but I would remind you that this was not the only matter discussed.
Also on the table were the composition of the Commission, the issue of the Unionâs Presidency, defining certain competences, in the field of fisheries and marine resources, for example, the fundamental principle of the equality of States, clarifying the precise scope of the principle of the primacy of Community law, transparency and openness in the Councilâs legislative workings and deliberations, the preamble and the express reference to the legacy of Christianity and the limitation on the flexibility or clauses.
In other words, the agenda is enormous and I therefore support and understand the words of the President of the Portuguese Republic, whose pro-European feelings are well known, calling a week ago for more time to allow the negotiations on the European Constitution to take place.
He criticised the fact that things are being done under pressure, called for more time and asked us to concentrate on the immediate problems such as the Lisbon Strategy, enlargement and negotiations on the new Community support framework.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am fully aware of the importance of this debate on the future of Europe.
I would, however, like to take this opportunity to refer to an emergency very close to our hearts as Radical Members, and for which my colleague, MrÂ Dupuis, has been on hunger strike for over 30 days.
We consider it to be an emergency for Europeâs present, one which unfortunately, was not an emergency for Europeâs recent past.
I would like to turn once more, Mr PresidentâinâOffice of the Council, Commissioners, to the Chechen question.
This debate is certainly important for the future and for the institutions, but if we let the present go by, the horrors of the present, we will lose credibility when we want to construct a different future.
Well, Mr President, MrÂ PresidentâinâOffice of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as everyone knows â but no one reactedÂ â over the course of recent weeks, the Russian authorities organised, using the puppet government in Chechnya as a cover, a series of about 30 arrests of relatives of UmarÂ Khambiev, Chechen Minister for Health and emissary of President-elect, AslanÂ Maskhadov.
His brother Magomed Minister for Defence, gave himself up to avoid further bloodshed.
Starting on 29 February, in dramatic raids, dozens of masked armed men from Russian forces and Chechen militia surrounded villages, entered houses, hit, insulted and threatened to kill members of the Khambiev family to the last; they abducted and took away those members of the Khambiev family that they managed to find there.
There has been no further news of them.
Seven hundred men arrived in armoured vehicles in Benoi, the village of birth of the Khambievs, and having beaten the inhabitants and destroyed everything they could destroy, they kidnapped seven people and demanded that Umar and Magomed surrender.
MrÂ President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Europe â and Parliament has repeatedly spoken out in this regard, from a humanitarian and at times even political point of viewÂ â must form part of our political present.
Concern has already been expressed even by the US administration.
In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, we are calling for the Red Cross to be authorised to visit the Khambiev family and the Minister for Defence, Mr Khambiev.
These Geneva Conventions should be observed, Mr President.
We are going to put a question to the Council straightaway, but I think it is our duty to at least react to these methods.
Not just with radical non-violence but also by means of European political presence and compliance with the Geneva Conventions.
We achieved this even for SaddamÂ Hussein, who received a visit from the Red Cross; it is inconceivable that we cannot even achieve this in this case.
Â Â  Mr President, I am glad to see Commissioner Kinnock here, but where is Commissioner Prodi?
What official business could be more important than this debate this morning?
Perhaps we could have an answer before the end of the debate.
Let me begin by welcoming the moves made by the Irish presidency so far towards garnering consensus for the draft Constitutional Treaty.
In recent weeks a number of positive indicators have suggested an increased willingness on the part of Member States to agree a workable compromise.
Outstanding differences of opinion need to be ironed out in a committed and systematic way to break the remaining deadlock.
Minister Roche and, indeed, the Taoiseach, have my wholehearted support in rising to the difficult task ahead of them in the months leading up to enlargement and the European elections.
A simplified single Treaty will make the EU of 25 more intelligible to the citizens of Europe by defining the EU and Member States' competences clearly.
It will introduce reforms that streamline the workings of the EU and will facilitate decision-making in an enlarged Union.
Finally and very importantly, it will also help to dispel the many myths that have grown up.
Primary among these myths is the one about the draft Treaty leading to the creation of a so-called super-state.
An entity that cannot raise taxes autonomously, is not authorised to run budget deficits, has no right to raise a military force and, most importantly, cannot act outside the competences given to it by the Member States is not a recipe for a super-state by any stretch of the imagination.
The EU can only spend a maximum of 1.2% of the combined GDP of all its Member States.
Compare this to the only super-state in the world today â the United States â the federal government of which spends 20% of GDP, and you can see what a nonsense this accusation is.
The Constitutional Treaty is a voluntary agreement made between consenting governments whose national parliaments would, under its terms, in fact be given stronger roles with regard to scrutiny of the Commission's legislative proposals.
The foremost achievement of the European project to date has been to put an end to the rivalry and antagonism of the last century that pushed this continent into two world wars, which cost 56 million lives.
The recent conflagration in the Balkans highlights the latent potential for destruction.
We should have the courage to use our experience and our position in the world to promote peace and stability in the global arena and to treat the problems of displacement and terrorism at source, for example by helping to ensure an economic future for the millions of young people living in the Middle East.
I should like to ask the President-in-Office what stage has been reached in meeting the Lisbon commitments.
This is on the IGC agenda as well, but so far all we have heard about is a European Commission action plan for enterprise â which received a very lukewarm reception indeed and was accused of lacking focus and tangible recommendations.
I would end by saying to the President-in-Office that the jury is out, the ball is in his court and that he has all our support.
Â Â  Mr President, this month, for the second time in a short space of time, after the failure of the Italian Presidency in December, and under Irish leadership, the Heads of Government are facing a choice that is crucial to the European Union's future.
The European Council in Italy looked foolish when it failed to dispose of the narrow-minded national interest and to opt for a more democratic, efficient and transparent Europe.
Many wonder whether the Council will make the same mistake again.
Fortunately, the Irish Presidency has already done a great deal of work over the past couple of months.
There is willingness to reach agreement; very tentatively, things are moving in Europe.
I would urge the Irish Presidency to tread carefully, for another failure would be disastrous for the confidence among the European electorate as it heads for the ballot boxes in June.
If the Heads of Government drop another clanger this time, it will be impossible to convince the European electorate of Europe's power.
In this light, it is preferable to wait a little longer than not to have a constitution at all.
I would stress here once again that the text should actually benefit Europe.
Let us not produce another insignificant document, as happened at the meeting of Heads of Government in Nice in 2000.
The European Convention's draft Constitution was good news for Europe and its citizens.
It provides for a more democratic, understandable and, above all, decisive Europe.
That is why we should adhere to those proposals as closely as possible, without detracting from the rights of the European Parliament, without resorting to back-room politics and without any loss of transparency.
The idea of one Commissioner per country should be accepted, the defence agreement of Naples must be utilised, and social Europe must be reinforced.
I would therefore urge the Heads of Government, this time round, to produce a meaningful document, rather than an insignificant one.
I take the view that if a constitution is not forthcoming, the Heads of Government will throw Europe into crisis, further enlargement will be made impossible and the financial problems will become insoluble.
For them and for Europe, this is a decisive moment.
The Irish Presidency is working in a way that instils much confidence in this House, and I wish it every success.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morningâs preparatory debate gives me the opportunity to make a final contribution on the current and future direction of Europeâs policies.
To me, one who has always been a European, it gives the opportunity to bring the point home that Europeans have now had enough of a Europe that is essentially economic and financial, one that all too often, for the sake of the free market and of competitiveness, sacrifices jobs and ignores the day-to-day problems faced by the public; so I join with them, the people, this morning, in recalling the dream of Europeâs founding fathers, the dream of building a Europe of peace, culture, diversity, social security and citizenship in freedom and democracy.
Fifty years on, the Europe in which we live is certainly economically strong â for some â but it has neither heart nor breath of life, believes in nothing and is too full of injustice.
We are having what we call a spring summit, we are on the threshold of enlargement, a new Intergovernmental Conference is about to be held, and there is very little in the budget, yet I still want to believe that there is still time to set a new course.
Having been at first a rather euphoric European, and having now become, after fifteen years in the European Parliament, a more realistic, more critical, not to say more uneasy one, I wanted to use my two minutes to shout, âLook out! Danger ahead!â
If it took fifty years to build the European Union that we have now, there is no small risk that we will one day see the structure implode for lack of sufficient popular support or of any ambitious vision of society, through failure to give priority to jobs, to respect for national and regional differences, and in the absence of any real solidarity.
It is the richest, rather than the poorest, who must pay for the most disadvantaged.
A European constitution is not an objective in itself; it is meaningless unless it meets the publicâs expectations, and this morning, I have reminded you of what â in my view â their essential expectations are.
Â Â  Your words, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, and those of the Vice-President of the Commission lead me to believe that Ireland feels able to conclude an agreement on the Constitution put forward by the Convention.
We will be delighted if Ireland is able to achieve this, not only because Ireland is a Celtic country like my own, Galicia, but also because this would show, once again, that it is one of the Unionâs great pro-European countries.
As a Member for one of Europeâs stateless nations, and one that is not even recognised as such, I have reservations about this draft Constitution arising from the shortcomings in cohesion policy and from the weakness of the positions we have adopted on our role in preserving peace in the world.
I have confidence, however, in the direction the European Union has taken historically, which is unequivocally in favour of diversity with solidarity, in contrast with the uniform approach of the Jacobin States that today prevails in the State of which I am a citizen.
It would be most opportune, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if this Parliament issued a formal statement under the Irish Presidency, approving the Constitution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, whereas peace, democracy, freedom and social justice should be the cornerstones of the European edifice, what does the Council believe in?
What does the Commission stand for?
What have we achieved here in Parliament?
Not very much; we still have peace â if we disregard the latest outbreaks of civil war.
We have made little progress on democracy.
I believe there is a huge problem with the legitimacy of this Union, and what has happened in recent months seems symptomatic of further disintegration processes rather than of integration.
This is dangerous, but I need hardly say that it is also dangerous for us to hide behind the illusion that we in Parliament are the free voices in the institutional structure.
We should know better, for we saw, when Nice was being discussed, how the party leaders coaxed and cajoled the supposedly free Members of Parliament.
Here in the House we also suffer time and again from the way in which Stalinist instincts in the Socialist Group, which frequently takes the unwarranted liberty of calling itself Social Democratic, lead to repeated logjams.
This will have to change, not only here in Parliament but elsewhere too, and particularly in the Council.
There can be no democracy without transparency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the current situation, following the failure of the summit in Brussels, is rather laughable.
In the constitutional debate, France and Germany hold forth about the need to move Europe forward, but they are the very ones who have persistently ignored the common ground rules.
The effects of such behaviour are, in my opinion, fatal.
When Jacques Chirac speaks of an advance guard and outlines the notion of a two-speed Europe, that in itself is not the end of the world.
The Schengen Agreement and the euro have already established the principle of differing speeds.
The real tragedy is that friction has been generated.
This will not help Europe to move forward.
The prospects for the draft Constitutional Treaty have not become any brighter.
The negotiations on the EU budget may well pose the threat of some sort of linkage between the constitution and the financial framework.
I can only recommend vigilance.
The substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty is a mixture of good ideas that would bring progress and, alas, questionable features such as pre-programmed conflicts of authority, which are destined to occur, for example, in the field of foreign policy between the future EU Foreign Minister and the President of the Council.
It is high time that the EU prepared itself for a larger Community.
It smacks of absolutism, in my view, to proscribe the discussion of constitutional matters by the Heads of State or Government.
I refuse to treat these Heads of Government as if they were the insurgent rebels of Europe.
At the same time, these leaders must not be allowed to forget that they sent representatives to the Convention.
I appeal for political pragmatism; what has been achieved must be safeguarded.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what do our fellow-citizens say to us when we go out among them to talk to them about Europe?
What do they ask us about?
Most of all, they ask us about the role of the European Union.
What does it do?
How is it run and by whom?
What they ask of us is clarity in decision-making, precision and comprehensibility in the division of its competences.
Seeking closer identification with the European Union and with its actors, they would also like Europe to be closer to them and to care more about their future.
The Convention has done even more than to outline the face of the new Europe; by specifying its competences and putting faces to decisions, it has fashioned the European Unionâs body.
It has created essential linkages that will enable our political design to progress.
I believe it needs to be said, and repeated, that the draft constitution produced by the Convention under the former French President, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, is a good one.
What makes it the best of compromises is the fact that, rather than aiming to combine national institutions, it proposes a wholly new structure, one that makes for greater effectiveness and clarity and is in line with modern thinking.
I find it regrettable that last December saw a triumph for introversion, for individual interests, for the self-centredness of the nation states.
What place is there for the European public in this masquerade?
Above all, as this House had said, the Intergovernmental Conference is a thing of the past.
The Convention, a novel form of institution, was a gamble that paid off, even demonstrating that the intergovernmental method is no longer suited to the modern-day needs of the EU.
The way the IGC works reflects a former ambition that left no room for the real European designs, the one that gives us a glimpse of the future.
The EU is changing its nature before our very eyes.
The debates between those, on the one hand, who favour an intergovernmental approach, and on the other, the proponents of federalism, bear no relation to the realities of the EU.
The draft constitution embodies realism and modernity precisely because it bridges the divisions of the past that prevent us, today, from driving the European project forward.
It gives Europeâs citizens more power.
Let me conclude by saying that our House will respond to this blockage by standing firm, by seeing to it that we get a modern constitution, one that enables Europe to act, that makes it visible and gives it credibility.
I wish the Irish presidency every success.
Â Â  Mr President, the unified Europe, of 25, 27 or 30 States will not be capable of functioning with an institutional system created for a Union of six or 15 Member States.
By failing to adopt the Constitutional Treaty, at best we run the risk of a restrained, weak Europe, unable to act in political terms and to be a protagonist on the international stage, and at worst, the political collapse of the Union, that is, a dangerous step backwards with regard to the significant progress made in recent years.
This is why I am convinced that the Irish Governmentâs action, unobtrusive but effective, should be supported.
We certainly need to be quick, and sign the Treaty before the European Parliament elections, but we absolutely must do things properly too, as Mr GiscardÂ d'Estaing said yesterday to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
In short, we cannot accept watered-down compromises which thwart the precious work of the Convention.
It is right to resume the process on the basis of the achievements of the Italian Presidency, which in any case managed to obtain the consensus of all the countries involved on 90% of the proposed text.
Now we need to make an additional effort to rise above the obstacles which concern, above all, qualified majority voting.
The question is, however, not just formal or technical: the real problem we need to overcome is selfishness in some quarters, which in any case must be addressed.
We need to discuss this, but if we want Europe to be strong politically and to be a leader in the peace initiative, this selfishness must be overcome.
One final remark, MrÂ Presidentâin-Office of the Council: we should not forget to include a clear reference to Europeâs Judeo-Christian roots in the preamble.
We cannot conceive of constructing a large house for 500 million citizens by forgetting the foundations on which our common home must rest.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to follow on from Mr Tajaniâs closing remarks.
Yesterday, Mr President-in-Office, I handed over to you more than 10Â 000 signatures of people in my constituency who are petitioning for the inclusion of a reference to the Christian heritage of Europe in the preamble to the Treaty.
Quite frankly, any building that is not constructed on firm foundations will ultimately be doomed to collapse.
We must not build Europe on weak foundations but on the common basis that incorporates the heritage of our continent.
The people of my constituency have great faith in the Irish presidency and are confident that you will yet be able to present proposals for the inclusion of such a reference in the preamble.
I also wish to say a few words about the competitiveness of the European Union, because it is a subject that will receive special treatment at the spring summit, and I should like to address my appeal to the Commission in particular.
It is not sufficient to organise a summit on competitiveness once a year, and then consider the matter closed, when, throughout the year, we are inundated with proposals that would make Europe less competitive, of which the legislative and policy proposal on chemicals is but one example.
This proposal is designed to de-industrialise the European Union.
The Commission must be in no doubt about that.
Withdraw it, and you will be contributing to a more competitive Europe.
The same applies to advertising restrictions.
I could name many other directives too.
What I would suggest is that the Commission should declare its willingness to withdraw the ten worst proposals for directives.
That would greatly enhance the competitiveness of the European Union.
There is a second point I should like to raise, namely that the Member States must honour the commitments they make.
I myself come from a country whose government, even though it has been told for years what it needs to do, has done nothing in years to free up the labour market and create a more competitive economy.
This is where there is also a need to reflect on ways of exercising stricter control to ensure that the Member States actually fulfil their obligations.
Then we shall achieve growth and employment throughout Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the constitution, let me say that I support every sentence of the speeches made by Mr Voggenhuber and Mr Brok.
Those who seek to retreat from the draft produced by the Convention are snubbing their own representatives and showing contempt for the members of the national parliaments and hence the people of their own countries.
A total of 84 out of the 105 members of the Convention were representatives of the national parliaments and of the Heads of Government: this demonstrates anew how closely the Member States are involved in the consultation and decision-making processes of the European Union.
We want this constitution, we need it, and we demand that an agreement be reached before the first of May.
Let me move on to the second point, Lisbon, and say that the Lisbon strategy is the programme for the implementation of the European model of an environmentally and socially responsible market economy.
It is not the sole purpose of the spring summit to emphasise vigorously every year that the Lisbon Declaration is still valid, despite the lack of commitment and political will to implement its provisions.
This commitment and will are lacking among the national governments, which are equipped with the necessary instruments, but they are also lacking within the Commission, whose preparation and monitoring of the spring summit ranges from sloppy to unsatisfactory.
The summit must not degenerate into a talking shop.
It must supply straight answers to peopleâs questions about growth and employment as well as social cohesion.
For this reason, I demand a concrete innovation and investment pact for the promotion of competitiveness, growth and social cohesion.
This pact should prescribe exactly who should take what action and achieve which targets by when.
I expect the Commission to make this pact, along with the adopted projects, the basis of the policy that underlies its financial planning.
We need a public discussion, a public debate, on the level of compliance with this innovation and investment pact, analogous to the discussion on observance of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Failure to comply with the Stability and Growth Pact obstructs the effort to achieve the Lisbon objectives, and the non-compliant countries â France and Germany, along with Belgium â are also trailing furthest behind in the transposition of the directives on the single market.
So let us not play off the one against the other, but rather let us do what we have to do.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate the Irish presidency on the work it has done in picking up the thread of an IGC that was cut short in December for the lack of any real political will to complete the institutional reform of the EU, even though this is crucial to the proper functioning of Europe in the years to come.
Speaking on behalf of the French delegation within the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and joining with the great majority of my fellow MEPs, from whom you have already heard, what I ask of the forthcoming Brussels European Council is that it should demonstrate its determination, in political terms, to overcome difficulties which, whilst important, are still secondary to what is really at stake: making the unification of our continent a political, economic and social triumph.
It is absolutely vital that the draft constitution put before us by the Convention, the exceptional success of which we can see today in the light of the difficulties the IGC had with it, should be adopted with the minimum possible delay.
That is our message to the Irish presidency.
Moreover, the Lisbon objectives, which are ambitious but realistic, necessarily involve putting in place proactive policies enabling us to compete with our trading partners, first among them the United States and Japan, in the strategic areas of research and development, education, and lifelong training.
Let us therefore implement these necessary reforms and overcome our fruitless divisions in order to make Europe a success on every front.
Europeâs citizens will be summoned to the polls in June to elect their MEPs, and they expect more of the European Union than is often articulated.
They are relying on us to make it possible for them to live harmoniously beyond their own borders, to work freely and as much as they want, and to save them from being swamped by forms and pointless taxes.
Although the Spring European Council is certainly not the culmination of European history, it could well be a key staging post on the way to the speedy adoption of a Constitution and as we progress towards putting in place the economic and trading frameworks that are indispensable if Europe is, at last, to enjoy growth.
Â Â  â Mr President, in seeking solutions to the EUâs institutional reforms and the problems that have resulted from the failure of the Intergovernmental Conference, we must keep our minds on the internal market and maintaining and improving the competitiveness of our economy.
The implementation of internal market legislation at national level is an absolute precondition for achieving the Lisbon objectives.
An increase in the implementation deficit will cause EU markets to splinter and erode the benefits of the internal market.
An accusing finger cannot just be pointed at the inertia of the Member States in the implementation of the Lisbon objectives.
The work of the Competitiveness Council has to be made more effective and it must return to a fundamental question: what impact will each drafted law have on the EUâs competitiveness?
It is also time for some spring-cleaning in the Commission.
At present the Commissioners are very torn on their directives.
The drafting of the chemicals package was a good example of this.
EU competitiveness will not improve with laws like these.
On the contrary, it will become seriously endangered.
Next autumn a Competitiveness Council Commissionersâ portfolio is to be established in the Commission.
Its task will specifically be to finalise the Lisbon objectives and coordinate and harmonise the work of the Commissioners for Industry, the Environment and Employment.
Competitiveness and a healthy Europe are not a Utopian dream.
New magic remedies are not required.
The medication exists: it was discovered in the spring of 2000 in Lisbon.
Countries just have to do what they said they would.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to express my admiration for what I thought was a stylish and rather teasing address from Mr Roche on whether there has really been considerable movement on the IGC issues.
We have been reading about the Spanish and Polish Governments possibly shifting their positions, with similar reports about the German Government.
The UK press is now saying that Mr Blair and Mr Berlusconi are writing joint letters together â there's friendship for you! â and now we understand that Mr Blair is travelling to Dublin tomorrow for talks with the Taoiseach.
As Mr Napoletano said earlier in the debate, it is all very frustrating and unclear for those of us who are outside.
All this underlines the importance of restating the demand for democratic legitimacy, something which was conceded by Vice-President Kinnock in the course of his address.
I see that as coming through the process of a referendum.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo told us that 51% of UK citizens want this Constitution.
I might doubt that but, unlike his Labour allies, I am very happy to have the matter tested in a referendum.
I can tell you, Mr President, that more than 80% of people in my country agree.
Â Â  Mr President, among the topics on the agenda for the forthcoming Council is the Lisbon Strategy, the Unionâs Financial Perspective and the resumption of the constitutional process.
I will restrict my remarks to the latter issue, as I consider it to be crucial.
Parliament has been the mainstay of federalist policy, as acknowledged by the President-in-Office, whose prudence and perseverance we welcomed also today.
We also agree with his concerns: time is against the Constitutional Treaty.
In fact, we are at an historic turning point and not just because the reunification of Europe makes a constitutional charter both more difficult and more necessary, but also because the next Parliament will see a significant generational replacement of the parliamentary groups which created the European Community.
Europeâs future would be threatened by deadlock in the Intergovernmental Conference, and another failure, instead of ending the democratic deficit, would increase the danger of there being a democracy with no voters, threatened by populism.
A failure would also be a negative signal for the objective of making Europeâs economy more competitive, since this objective calls for greater economic integration, greater social cohesion and greater democratic transparency.
Nevertheless, we agree with Mr Kinnock: better no Constitution than a Treaty which does not live up to the Convention proposal.
We would therefore call on the Council, through its decisions, to rekindle enthusiasm for a more democratic Europe, united in its diversity and capable of having a common foreign and defence policy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate.
I shall begin with the Lisbon Strategy.
The bulk of the debate was on the IGC, and I shall return to that.
MrÂ Watson made a very interesting link between the future prospects for Europe and the new Constitution.
He suggested that we should move in tandem in both cases.
He is right.
Mr Watson and Mr Collins also made a very clear point about the importance of the Lisbon Strategy and the need to keep Lisbon to the fore.
Again, they are right.
Mrs Sudre has just made a very interesting point about the significance of the strategy in terms of the future.
The Spring European Council and the Lisbon Strategy are key priorities of the Irish presidency, and we look forward to a successful and focussed debate on the vital questions regarding the future economic, social and environmental development of the Union.
It is interesting that many of the key issues raised during the debate are ones we have indicated in our preparation and on which we have decided to focus.
Our strategy approaching the Lisbon discussion has been to limit the number of areas, and to focus on these in order to make progress.
I was intrigued by all the comments made on the Intergovernmental Conference and the Constitutional Treaty.
The views of the clear and overwhelming majority of this House confirm to me the urgency of the task at hand.
Mr Duff kindly drew my attention to a motion that is being prepared for adoption by the House.
As Mr BarÃ³n Crespo reminded us, the recent Eurobarometer poll shows that the people of Europe want a Constitutional Treaty.
That is a very significant poll.
I note that there are variations in the level of support for the Constitutional Treaty, but the fact that the people want a Constitutional Treaty is something that should weigh heavily in all our considerations.
My good friend and fellow member of the Convention, Mr Voggenhuber, can rest assured that I well remember the day at the Convention when we chinked glasses, listened to the Ode to Joy and all signed a very large postcard.
I must say that I do not recognise the rather negative characterisation of the Constitution by another good friend â Mr Bonde.
I agree with Mrs Doyle, who was much closer to the mark, that this Constitution certainly does not pave the way for some super-state.
As I have already mentioned, I am not in a position today to go into greater depth on the issues.
I fully understand Members' frustration.
However, Members understand equally fully that negotiations are at a stage at which it is impossible to be more detailed than we have been.
We have entered into discussions in confidence with Member States.
We understand fully that people belong to different States and have different views.
The presidency's job is to try and create a space in which people can come together to negotiate and align those views.
I therefore understand the frustration at there not having been more detail, and would also confirm that the presidency is anxious to seize any opportunity that exists.
We note that there have been changes in attitudes in recent times.
Mr Poettering's analysis, for example, was very interesting and he is quite correct that it is critically important to keep the momentum going.
It would be a disaster for that momentum to be lost.
Mr Brok was also correct.
Everybody now says that they want a Constitution, but one of the frustrations of being in the presidency is that everyone says they want to achieve success but this is always qualified with a 'but'.
Mr van den Berg also made a very interesting point.
He said that the presidency must bear in mind that a second unsuccessful rendezvous would be a disaster.
He is quite correct and we must balance all these issues as we move forward.
A number of Members â particularly Mr Napoletano â have made the point about detail.
He has spoken with me on more than one occasion about the outstanding issues.
On the institutional side, there are obvious issues to be resolved, including the questions of representation in Parliament, voting in the Council and the composition of the Commission, while detailed suggestions have been made in relation to the EU Foreign Minister and the presidency of the Council ministries.
On the non-institutional side, there are different approaches to the question of the extent of qualified majority voting in the Council.
This is not stating anything new, but these are the issues.
We will need to strike an overall balance in order to reach agreement.
Let me turn specifically to some of the matters.
In response to a number of enquiries regarding the issue of voting rights, the presidency's view on this has been made absolutely clear.
The Taoiseach has said that a solution based on dual majority is the one most likely to achieve an overall consensus.
In fact, it is clear that is how the decision will be made on voting rights.
There continue to be different views as to how the dual majority will be calculated.
However, it is interesting and intriguing â and a number of Members have made reference to this â that we are indeed now talking about a dual majority system.
As regards the Commission, there is a shared view that we need a strong and effective Commission.
There is also a need to find an appropriate balance between equality, the equally valid requirements for the Commission to be effective and for it to have some form of representational view.
Any agreement will have to take all these considerations into account and it will not be difficult to bridge all the different requirements.
Mr BarÃ³n Crespo and a number of other speakers also mentioned the issue of the budget.
On the question of the budget, I believe the balanced approach is the one most likely to secure agreement.
The Italian presidency made a proposal in December which built on that brought forward by the Convention and on the discussions it had with partners in the IGC.
We have further explored the matter in recent consultations, including with Parliament, and there is a consensus that budgetary procedures must respect the overall institutional balance.
In conclusion, I very much enjoyed today's debate.
I have to say that I was heartened by it and I am very grateful to Members for their positive words and encouragement.
Members who have spoken with me on a one-to-one basis know my particular anxieties in this regard, and they know the ambition of the Irish presidency to achieve progress, if progress can be achieved.
I have very carefully noted the points that have been made.
I very much look forward to a successful outcome to the European Council on 25 and 26 March.
Commissioner Kinnock made the point that the IGC is stage one.
This was also touched on by a number of other contributors.
That is true.
Stage one is agreement at Member State government level and the next stage will be to go on to the various and multifarious ratification processes.
This leads me back to the point I made in my introduction: delay will not help the ratification process.
I would reiterate that point. Time is not on our side, we need to reach agreement on this matter, as early as it is possible to do so, and the Irish presidency is ambitious that should be the case.
Â Â  . â Mr President. I want to add to the remarks made by Mr Roche in what has been a very interesting debate.
Perhaps it is most appropriate for me to begin by thanking Mr Brok for reminding the House about the basic reality that the healthy divisions in modern Europe are on issues and â contrary to what is represented in some parts of politics and the press â not between big and small.
This is a fundamental point, and understanding it means understanding that it is the equitable inclusion and representative rights of countries of large, medium and small size which makes this a Union and makes the Union a stable, developing, 50-year success, in place of centuries of grand diplomacy by grand governments, which ended repeatedly in terrible grief and war.
On an occasion like this it is as well to remind ourselves of those basics, as Mr Brok did.
Secondly, there were interesting references to the Lisbon strategy which, we must recall, was unanimously agreed by Member States to secure the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
There can never have been a more devout aspiration.
It is interesting to heed what Mr Wurtz, MrÂ Collins, Mr Ferber, Mr Karas and Mrs Doyle had to say on the issue.
Since we are all engaged in supporting the Lisbon strategy â maybe with differing degrees of enthusiasm â success in achieving such a knowledge-based, dynamic and competitive economy is not going to be propelled by hesitancy in the further development of the single market, by false economies with reduced public and private sector investment, or by a ceiling on the financial perspectives which disables European Union engagement in research and development, regional development and efforts to combat poverty and under-development throughout the world.
I should like to offer a quick comment on the points made by Mr Poettering and MrÂ BarÃ³n Crespo, with a degree of elegant nuance from both gentlemen, on the fact that it would be wise to take account of the results of the European Parliament elections in the nomination of the President of the Commission in future.
No-one seriously democratic could turn their back on such an idea, but nevertheless it is necessary to be careful because, if the impression was ever given that partisan reasons determined the appointment, that would reverberate over five years in Parliament, in the Commission, in the Council and more widely.
The consequences would be divisive, destabilising and disadvantageous for the Union.
Neither real democratic accountability nor legitimacy would be served by such a prospect and I am certain that nobody advocates taking proper account of the result of the elections is in any sense advocating partisan predetermination of the political alignment of the President of the Commission.
I would like to mention what I consider to be the curiosity of the debate.
It was a remark from Mr Bonde, who called on the presidency to use the Brussels European Council to require a process for national decision-making on the constitution.
That was somewhat paradoxical from an honourable Member, whom I think of as an evangelist for European fragmentation, especially since, if the advice he offered was followed, it would constitute the most massive act of superordinate centralisation in the history of the Union.
I am certain he will forgive me if I say, as a great enthusiast for subsidiarity, that not for the first time I have to disagree with him on his proposal.
A final point, which I cannot resist making â Mr Evans will not be surprised by this.
I did not in any sense concede the case for democratic legitimacy.
Indeed, as I am sure Mr Evans will acknowledge, it is a fundamental belief of mine.
Taking a completely detached view of internal United Kingdom affairs, which befits a Commissioner, I have got a certain divergence from him on the issue of a referendum on the constitution for a basic and simple reason.
As I understand it, in the United Kingdom referenda take place when a proposal is made for a change in the system of government, whether it involves devolution or the decision to have elected mayors, or in relation to a number of comparable issues.
The proposed constitution does not change the system of government in the United Kingdom.
I also recall that the only precedent for the party of which Mr Evans is a distinguished representative providing a referendum was on the acute question of Sunday opening of public houses in Wales.
For Mr Evans and me that is a fundamental issue of democratic rights and good governance but it does not bear comparison with the European constitution.
Â Â  I thank the Commissioner for that completely detached view, which I am sure he also had on the issue of opening pubs in Wales on Sundays!
Â Â  â Mr President, while welcoming Commissioner Kinnock to the House I respectfully request a full explanation for Commissioner Prodi's absence from the House this morning.
Â Â  . â Mr President, with no discourtesy to the House, I said to the House earlier that work obligations prevented Mr Prodi from being here this morning.
He is an avid attender at the important business of this House, as I am sure everyone here would recognise, and I consider it sufficient for the President of the Commission to be able to say legitimately and honestly that he has work preoccupations which, owing to timetabling, had to take precedence even over the proceedings of this House today.
I hope the House will accept this explanation without my having to read out the President's diary.
Â Â  I have received four motions for resolution(1) tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on:
- Report (A5-0111/2004) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the comprehensive monitoring report of the European Commission on the state of preparedness for EU membership of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia
- Report (A5-0105/2004) by Geoffrey Van Orden, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Bulgaria's progress towards accession
and
- Report (A5-0103/2004) by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on Romania's progress towards accession.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I believe it is fair to say at this point, only a few weeks before the first of May, the date that has been set for the enlargement of the European Union, that all ten acceding countries have made massive efforts over the past decade to prepare themselves for that day. They have taken far greater pains â with profound consequences for their peoples â than we in the European Union have done in preparation for enlargement, as the foregoing debate has demonstrated.
I hope that the Cyprus question will also be resolved in time for us to welcome a united Cyprus into the fold on the first of May.
At the same time, since this is the last report of this type, I have to say that the authors of the country reports from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy have shown great responsibility and commitment in the performance of their task over these past years, and, as chairman of the committee, I should like to take this opportunity to record my thanks to them.
On the first of May the , the body of established Community law and practice, as defined in the Treaty of Accession, will enter into force in the new Member States along with the associated transitional provisions.
This means that there must be no more discrimination in either direction and that we shall continue to set great store by compliance with this .
We are sure that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will take a similar view.
In respect of compliance, however, there are still weaknesses.
We do not say this by way of criticism but as a means of helping, of raising awareness, of creating scope for political action to eliminate these weaknesses.
We must appreciate that these countries have had to undertake a complete transformation of their political, economic and social systems, that they have had to make the transition from Communist centralism to a more regionalised form of government.
It is obvious that all of this cannot be achieved overnight.
The same sort of situation obtains with regard to the judicial system, but these weaknesses have implications: if the administrative machinery does not function properly, it will not be able to formulate the regional strategies that are required for access to EU structural funds.
The situation is similar with regard to the government departments responsible for agriculture and several other areas of activity.
It is therefore in the interests of the acceding countries to do better in these areas.
There is therefore a need to keep pursuing the efforts for which the Commission called in its own report last autumn.
We must also realise that a non-functioning judicial system implies legal uncertainty in some areas of regional activity, for example.
Legal uncertainty invariably acts as a barrier to investment.
It is essential to create legal certainty in those areas too.
This is not simply a matter of enabling individuals to exercise their rights; it also affects economic development in particular regions.
This point is appreciated too, and both factors together are relevant to the fight against corruption.
As we have heard today, there is corruption in my country, Germany, and indeed there is corruption in football too.
But we must ensure that this cancer, which exists everywhere in varying degrees, does not take a grip of the European Union and jeopardise our general development prospects
Another point that needs to be discussed is the fact that the issue of minority rights is not regulated in the same way everywhere.
The position of gypsies in some countries, for example, needs to be addressed, and here we hope to see practical improvements.
At the same time, we should also recognise that the Baltic States have made strenuous efforts in this historic context with regard to their minorities, and that the situation of these minorities is no reason for not signing or ratifying the boundary treaties with them.
We therefore call on Russia to move forward swiftly so that clarity can be established on this issue too.
We would like to be sure that the cooperation and partnership agreements will apply to the whole European Union.
The principle of no renegotiation must apply to all of them.
Nor can compensation be claimed on account of the enlargement of the European Union.
On the contrary, we must build bridges at the new borders of the European Union, and we must pave the way for the earliest possible application of the Schengen standards there in order to guarantee internal security and hence be able to open the internal borders.
This configuration surely constitutes one of the toughest problems we shall have to solve.
MrÂ President, may I say in conclusion â and I believe I can speak for the entire House here â that we are looking forward to the first of May and to the accession of our new partners.
Â Â  On behalf of Parliament, Mr Brok, I should like to thank you and the other rapporteurs for the work that has been done by your committee in leading this issue so consistently through the entire mandate and now bringing it towards a successful conclusion.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the past decade we have seen a massive transformation of Bulgaria, hauling itself out of a Communist past and now on track for accession to the European Union by 2007.
The turnaround is truly remarkable.
My report is therefore very optimistic.
I see no reason why accession negotiations should not be closed during the summer before the conclusion of the Irish presidency and before the mandate of the present Commission ends.
This would be a very important signal to the people of Bulgaria and a reminder that they are not forgotten at a time when ten other countries will have just acceded to the European Union.
This means that the Commission and Council must rapidly finalise the EU position on the four remaining chapters: competition, regional policy, agriculture and budget.
The draft financial package proposed by the Commission on 10 February â some EUR 4.2 billion over three years â provides an excellent basis for the final phase of negotiations.
Indeed, measured as a percentage of per capita GDP, this package can be seen as among the most generous that has been offered to an accession country, although this needs to be kept in perspective as Bulgarian per capita GDP is low.
The financial package may require adaptation in the light of changes to the overall financial perspective and I am reassured by the Commission's recognition that cooperation with Parliament, as one arm of the Union's budgetary authority, will therefore need to be intensified over the next three years.
Bulgaria's accession process has so far been characterised by commitment and good faith on all sides and a shared determination to meet the many deadlines involved.
The macro-economic indicators have been very positive in Bulgaria.
We have seen GDP growing by almost 5%, the rate of inflation dropping significantly, a surge in foreign investment and a major cut in unemployment levels.
It will take time for the effects of these improvements to be felt by large sections of the population, particularly in the regions outside of Sofia, but we can expect the upswing to gather pace as accession approaches and confidence in Bulgaria's political and economic transformation grows.
Confidence is a key factor.
It is most important, therefore, that Bulgaria's progress and accession should not in any way be linked to or held back by any other candidate country.
As my report clearly states, Bulgaria is part of the current inclusive and irreversible enlargement process that is based on the own merits principle.
I was pleased to hear Mr Verheugen state in Parliament last November, and I quote: 'The one country, Bulgaria, should not wait for the other, Romania. And we have also guaranteed this'.
I would be grateful for the Commissioner's confirmation of this position.
The accession process for other candidate countries, or indeed the addition of new countries to the accession process, should not impact on the timetable for Bulgaria and the assessment of its progress.
But in spite of this progress, many specific problems still have to be overcome in Bulgaria.
These are very much in the hands of the Bulgarian authorities, although we can help.
To put this in context, we know that many of the countries acceding to the EU in May also still have many problems to overcome.
But in Bulgaria's case, I have highlighted in particular the Roma question. I do not want to get this out of perspective.
Many other sections of Bulgarian society face difficulties, but the Roma question is important, not just for the stability and prosperity of Bulgaria, but also because of its potential impact on other countries in the European Union, not least my own, when Bulgaria achieves full membership.
The full and proper integration of the Roma into mainstream society in Bulgaria requires changes on both sides.
The Roma need understanding and massive resources deployed in order to provide them with the essentials of life, education and job opportunities, but equally they have to change their lifestyle.
There has to be a willingness to integrate and to adopt family practices and other social attitudes that give confidence to the wider Bulgarian population.
It is troubling that a large proportion of children in care or in institutions in Bulgaria come from the Roma community.
There is something fundamentally wrong with this and it needs to be addressed with real determination.
Many of the care homes and schools are in a bad state and my own constituents in Chelmsford provide admirable support for one particular school at Berkovitsa.
As far as amendments to my report are concerned, I do not support either of the two amendments that have been tabled.
The assertion that Bulgaria is the only accession country that lacks implementation mechanisms in the field of gender equality is frankly not correct.
The second amendment, regarding energy policy, has been adequately covered in the compromise language already in the text of my report.
I do not think the amendments are necessary.
In conclusion, I congratulate Bulgaria and thank the Commission and the Council for all the support they have given to Bulgaria's accession process.
Let us make sure that it remains on track for accession in 2007.
Â Â  . Mr President, this report represents a wide-ranging analysis of the problems facing Romania in its development to meet the high standards we demand for joining the European Union.
The resolution clearly points out that much remains to be done in Romania for political criteria to be adhered to in full.
The functioning of Parliament, the relationship with the executive and the judicial system and the overall functioning of the rule of law: all are questioned.
This point involves many issues such as corruption, which is widespread in Romania, involving administrative officials, judges, politicians and in its sum undermines the functioning application of the rule of law.
This must be the reason why corruption in the area of international adoptions has continually been circumvented by special adoption commissions.
The moratorium has been ignored and set aside, meaning that many children, even babies, identified as suitable for adoption by the government, signed off by the prime minister, have in reality been taken from suitable family settings by the authorities, against their will and disregarding the wishes of their foster families whose interest in adopting those same children was denied.
I have written evidence of many of these cases and stand happy to show them to anyone who wishes to see them.
In contrast, my resolution also deals with the achievements of Romania in the economic field, where many structural reforms have been undertaken that we praise.
But these must also and will need to be pursued most vigorously in the coming months and years.
But we hope too that the Romanian Government will give greater prominence to the needs to the lower strata of society in Romania.
In many areas simple, civilisational assets such as running water and sewage disposal systems are missing.
Surely the preaccession process must also benefit the many millions of poverty stricken citizens.
We in the European Parliament want to help them not just to survive, but to thrive.
Only if the Romanian Government and its administration are willing to forego corruption in all its insidious forms can poverty ever be conquered in Romania.
Honesty has not only a commercial value. Honesty provides the essential bond of trust between the state and citizen upon which democracy relies.
The report also points out the developments in the area of developing and implementing the , where much still needs to be done to build up the administrative and judicial capacity not only to have laws on paper and in Parliament, but to ensure that they are implemented in such a way that they can play a real and positive role in the lives of citizens.
This report as it stands was passed with unanimity in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy with no abstentions.
This exceptional consensus across all parties regarding the main thrust of the report has already had a positive impact in Romania.
The situation has changed, however.
Already there has been root and branch reform of government with many new ministerial positions and responsibilities.
Tomorrow I understand there will be a new children's law.
I understand there is some hesitation and a little confusion among our Socialist colleagues â due to the swiftness of the changes in the situation in Romania â on how to vote.
As the vote is now likely to be held tomorrow, I urge the PSE Group to have a new exchange of views on this so that I can fulfil my task as rapporteur and ensure that they have the fullest and most up-to-date information.
After the vote, I will be calling upon the Commission to report back to Parliament on how the Commissioner's team will now proceed.
I believe that such a report must come back to this Parliament before we rise for the European elections in May.
I will also call upon the Council to accept the reality of Parliament's clear and unequivocal position.
Council cannot simply continue along the old line that all is well in Romania and that entry in 2007 is the done deal that we have been told it is since Rome last year.
This is not so.
In the United Kingdom, the Parliament of which I also had the honour to be a member, is omnipotent and omnicompetent.
I have no doubt that other national parliaments of EU Member States hold the same responsibilities.
The European people have the final say.
We all want Romania to join the European Union, but not at a price that is too high for the European citizens to pay.
In conclusion, the European Parliament is a true friend of Romania.
This strongly worded report has been compiled by Members of the European Parliament across the political divide, from all Member States and with Romania's best interests in our hearts.
Bucharest must act on the report's recommendations if Romania is to succeed in membership of the European Union.
I hope and I believe that it will do just that.
Â Â  With regard to the rapporteur's question regarding voting, ten co-rapporteurs will speak in today's debate; the spokesmen for the groups will speak; there will contributions from the Council and the Commission; 37 colleagues will also contribute.
This is not surprising, given the nature of the issue at hand.
However, when we break for the vote at midday, we shall not have concluded the speaking list and so the votes on these reports will be held over until tomorrow.
Â Â  . â Mr President, at the outset I would like to thank Mr Brok for his very frank and interesting report on the accession states.
I would also like to thank Mr Van Orden for his insightful report on Bulgaria, and Baroness Nicholson for her thorough and honest report on Romania.
It is a great honour for me to participate, on behalf of the Council, in your debate on enlargement today.
For many years, I lectured students in University College, Dublin, on the European Union and sought to impress upon them how remarkable our Union is.
We are now on the eve of another remarkable breakthrough.
Enlargement represents one of the most exciting and positive developments, not just in the history of the European Union but in European history as a whole.
The ideal of a united, peaceful Europe is behind every effort at European integration over the past fifty years and this enlargement plays a significant part in making that peace a reality.
In less than two months, the Union will welcome ten new Member States.
For many years enlargement has been a mere aspiration; soon it will be realised.
The European Union is rectifying a past wrong: the artificial division of Europe, which lasted for far too long after two appallingly disastrous world wars.
As presidency, Ireland will be privileged to welcome the new Member States on behalf of the Union on 1Â May.
We look forward greatly to this day, which will be celebrated around Europe and which we in Ireland will celebrate throughout the country as a special 'Day of Welcomes' for our new partners.
The new Member States have come through a long and difficult process to get where they are today.
It is an exciting moment for them and for us.
They have spent many years and made great efforts preparing for membership; the reform of their economic and political systems has beenÂ â to put it mildly â highly impressive.
The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have very rapidly established stable democracies and functioning market systems.
The deep reforms carried out were monitored and reviewed closely by the Commission in its regular reports throughout the period of negotiations and most recently in its monitoring reports.
The Commissionâs comprehensive monitoring reports, published last November, illustrate clearly the huge amount of work done in the new Member States.
I wish to congratulate the Commission. In particular I want to congratulate Commissioner Verheugen for his excellent work, extraordinary dedication and excellent management of the whole process.
More importantly, I want to compliment the new Member States for their efforts.
However, while recognising that there have been many achievements to date, it is important not to become complacent.
We encourage newly acceding states to continue their efforts for the final two months until accession: now is not a time to rest on their oars.
We ask them to concentrate particularly on the areas identified by the Commission as requiring urgent attention and on the effective implementation and enforcement of measures already adopted.
It goes without saying that the more work done now, the quicker the newly acceding Member States can benefit fully from membership.
We are confident that any difficulties can and will be overcome.
The Treaty of Accession contains a number of safeguard clauses designed to protect the Union from unforeseen disturbances arising as a result of accession.
In addition, other measures are available to the Commission to protect the internal market, if necessary.
The smooth and effective integration of the new Member States is one of the highest priorities of the Irish presidency.
The hard work of the new Member States has been recognised, not only by the Commission in its regular and monitoring reports, but also by the excellent report drawn up by Mr Brok.
The enlargement has been described as the best-prepared enlargement ever and I think that is a fair description of what has been done.
Already the newly acceding Member States are sitting around the Council table and in Parliament.
They participated fully, actively and very constructively in the work of the European Convention and in the ensuing Intergovernmental Conference on the Constitutional Treaty.
The new Member States are already making valuable input to all aspects of the Unionâs business and from 1Â May, they will have full voting rights as well and will contribute fully to the formation of the Unionâs policies.
I believe they will make a remarkable impact on the way we do our business.
Support among the new Member States for accession was demonstrated by the referenda which were held in nine of the ten countries throughout 2003.
In addition, the process of ratification of the Treaty of Accession has seen the parliaments of many current Member States express strong support for enlargement.
It is important to underline that enlargement is good not only for the newly acceding Member States butÂ â as Mr Brok reminded usÂ â it is also good for the present Member States.
The Union as a whole stands to benefit.
Of course, the process of enlargement does not end on 1Â May.
As we have been reminded, Bulgaria and Romania are both advanced in negotiations.
I listened carefully to Mr Van Orden's report on Bulgaria, having met with Meglena Kuneva last week to discuss the position.
I was also very interested to hear Baroness Nicholson's very frank and honest report.
Last December, the European Council set out a very clear timeframe for the conclusion of negotiations in 2004 with both countries, subject of course to their individual state of readiness, with a view to their accession in January 2007.
One of the key issues remaining to be agreed among Member States is the financial framework for accession of the two states.
Since the Commission published its draft financial package in February, intensive negotiations have been underway to secure agreement among Member States, which the presidency is endeavouring to obtain by the March session of the General Affairs and External Relations Council.
Reaching agreement on the financial package will permit the Union to carry forward the negotiations in the remaining finance-related chapters with both countries.
The Irish presidency is striving to advance progress in accession negotiations to the greatest degree possible.
The presidency will ensure that negotiations with both countries are governed by the same principles that guided negotiations with the ten new Member States, notably that of their own individual merits.
It is worth recalling that Bulgaria and Romania are part of an irreversible inclusive enlargement process.
The pace of negotiations will continue to be determined by progress on the ground and we urge Bulgaria and Romania to ensure full implementation of commitments undertaken to date.
The Union will continue to monitor very closely the performance of both countries and has noted carefully the views of Parliament, as expressed in particular in the resolutions under consideration today.
In conclusion, this enlargement is one of the most remarkable achievements of the Union to date.
On behalf of the presidency of the Council, I wish to thank Parliament, and you the Members of Parliament, for the very positive and constructive approach taken since the very beginning of the process.
We believe that the Union and its citizens stand to benefit greatly from this exciting endeavour.
This is a remarkable moment, a defining moment in the history of Europe, and one in which we can all take considerable satisfaction.
Â Â  . â Mr President, honourable Members, this is probably the last big debate of this Parliament on what is a really great and historic project, and for my part I would like to take the opportunity to thank your House most sincerely for its cooperation on this project, in particular the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, its chairman Mr Brok and the rapporteurs.
We have seen what we can achieve â even with so great and difficult a task â when the institutions of the European Union have a clear common objective and when they are determined to work together to achieve it.
I will not hide my great satisfaction at the fact that ten new Members will be acceding on 1 May and that we have completed this difficult process, but I cannot deny either that my satisfaction is mixed with a measure of concern.
I cannot overlook the fact that a very broad debate on this enlargement is only now getting under way in the Member States â far too late, I think.
For many years, I have repeatedly said in this House that this debate must be conducted in the Member States in order to inform people and take them along this road with us.
Only now, when it is about to happen, has it made the European media headlines and become a number one issue for the European public.
No one in this House will be surprised â I am not â that all the fears, the concerns and the feelings of uncertainty that we have known about for years and have tried to deal with by providing people with information are now surfacing again.
Let me be very clear about this: the political elites in the Member States ought to have done more to make public opinion in the Member States understand this great historic task.
I am saying this now quite deliberately and also with some bitterness because we really have pointed out often enough how necessary it is.
There is still time.
The message we have to get across to people is quite clear.
Yes, this enlargement will create problems.
This enlargement will force us to make adjustments.
A lot of things will change completely from what we were used to.
There was no sensible alternative, however.
We had to do it.
We had to accept our historic responsibility of shaping the great change in Europe in such a way politically that it will lead to greater peace, security and prosperity for the people.
The message must be that this enlargement will not create problems but that it is the only way to solve the problems caused by the great changes that took place in Europe 14 or 15 years ago.
Let me say this once again at the beginning of this debate because I really am convinced that the democratic quality of this process depends on Europeâs citizens understanding it and sharing the objective.
So far as the state of preparedness of the ten countries that will be acceding on 1 May is concerned, ladies and gentlemen, we have kept you informed of the results of our monitoring.
I informed the Heads of Government of the ten countries of the results of that monitoring last November and since then we have been working closely with those countries to solve these problems.
There have now been further consultations with all ten countries in which we took stock.
We found that progress has been made in all areas, in some cases remarkable progress.
We are now receiving further information on further progress every day, and I therefore find a very positive trend over all as regards completion of the outstanding tasks.
I do not want to hide the fact, however, that there are still problems in a few areas.
That is true in particular for the creation of the necessary conditions for the payment of agricultural subsidies.
Our system is obviously very complicated.
Perhaps we could give some thought to whether the problem really is that the ten new Member States are not intelligent enough or not energetic enough to solve the problem, or whether it is perhaps rather that the system has now become so complicated that a country that has not grown up with it is unable to satisfy our requirements.
I have come to have great doubts as to where the problem really lies, whether it is only with the future Member States or whether it is not also for a large part on our side.
Another problematic issue remaining in most countries is food safety, the modernisation of food-processing establishments and their supervision for the protection of public health.
My fellow-Commissioner Mr Byrne is in constant close contact with the relevant ministers.
Here again I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission guarantees there will be no compromises on food safety.
Only products that meet our standards will come on to the internal market.
The Commission will use the instruments it has available to solve outstanding problems realistically and responsibly.
We are making preparations.
I cannot yet tell you whether safeguards will have to be applied or not.
The time for such a decision has not yet come.
As I said, if it should be necessary we will do it realistically and responsibly and keep you informed.
Let me now say a word about something that is particularly on the minds of all of us these days, namely Cyprus.
If this question could still be solved before 1 May, then we would be fully justified in saying that enlargement not only prevents crises but that it also resolves crises and conflicts.
That would be an incredibly important signal for the whole region.
We can say that it was the European Union that got the peace process moving again and enabled the UN Secretary-General to call renewed talks.
I was in Cyprus for the start of the talks on 19 February and had good discussions with the UN and the leaders of the two communities.
Since then, there have been intensive political and technical contacts.
The Commission has said from the outset that it now considers the Cyprus talks a top priority and we have therefore done all in our power to support the peace process.
Commission experts are assisting the United Nations team in Cyprus.
I have done everything the UN has asked.
Whenever extra help was asked for, we always gave it right away.
The technical level talks in Cyprus are going very well as a result, and we have also at long last begun to organise content-wise preparations for possible accession with the Turkish community.
Late, I have to say, but the responsibility for that rests with Mr Denktash.
We are now preparing the necessary legal instruments for the accession of a united Cyprus.
We will need regulations for the gradual introduction of the in the north of the island.
The use of Turkish as a new official language will require preparations, and we will not be able to get everything done by 1 May.
We will therefore have to provide transitional periods in a number of areas.
Let me say once again that we are in a position to transfer the results of the Cyprus talks into Community law provided those results do not run counter to the principles on which the European Union is founded, namely democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
We are of course also setting conditions, and I will reiterate them: We need a new Cyprus that speaks with one voice.
We need a new Cyprus that is capable of acting in international fora at all times and does not carry the risk of blocking them.
We also need a new Cyprus whose central structures are strong enough to implement and enforce all its international obligations, including Community law.
For us, these conditions are absolutely essential.
We are willing to convene an international donorsâ conference to help pay the costs of unification, and I urgently call on the two communities, the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots, to take advantage of this unique opportunity and to give a signal of willingness for peace and reconciliation in this part of the world.
I would now like to say something about Romania and Bulgaria.
We will do all we can to assist the Presidency in continuing negotiations with the same tempo and the same quality and in bringing them to a conclusion within the proposed timetable.
We have put the proposal for the common financial package for Bulgaria and Romania on the table.
Discussions so far show that the Commission proposal has been well received over all.
In the light of the financial package for the ten, the financial package for Bulgaria and Romania is fair, balanced and realistic.
We shall present the concrete proposals for the negotiating positions in April.
So far as Bulgaria is concerned, I agree with the assessment made by the rapporteur, Mr Van Orden, and would like to say for my part, too, that remarkable progress has been made.
The country still has further efforts to make, especially in strengthening administrative and judicial capacities.
We are concentrating on these areas in our cooperation with Bulgaria.
Romania can also count on our assistance and solidarity.
I have followed your debate very attentively and I admire the seriousness with which Parliament is working on the problems in Romania.
I believe you have now struck a balance, which means that the report neither paints too rosy a picture nor calls into doubt the European Unionâs political commitment to Romanian accession.
That is good, because Romania needs encouragement, but it also needs a very clear answer to the question of what is still to be done.
The Commission agrees with the rapporteur about the areas in which further efforts are required.
These are administrative reform, reform of the legal system and preventing corruption, and I want to make it very clear that when it comes to fighting corruption the political system must be included.
It is not enough to put petty officials on trial; their superiors must be in the dock as well.
Romania also needs to be more convincing in its handling of European money and, before that, to prepare its negotiating positions better.
Baroness Nicholson raised the subject of adoption.
I want to make the Commissionâs position on this clear again.
Our policy is geared clearly and unequivocally to the welfare of the child.
That is the opposite of a policy that serves the interests of families in all possible countries that are looking for children to adopt.
This difference is crucial.
Anyone whose focus is not the welfare of the child but the interests of families that are seeking to adopt and the non-governmental organisations that represent their interests is creating a market, and anyone creating a market can expect problems in Romania.
That is why the Commission insists that there must be a moratorium on international adoptions until legislation is in force that is fully up to international standards on child protection and until administrative structures are in place to ensure that such legislation is enforced.
The Commission, Parliament and the Member States still share the common objective of concluding negotiations in 2004, with accession in 2007.
I am sure we will all do everything we can to help Romania and Bulgaria in this.
The key to success, however, lies in Sofia and even more in Bucharest.
Â Â  Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Verheugen has spoken of his concern that people in todayâs European Union countries are not well enough informed.
I share that concern, but I would like to ask what the alternative would be.
The alternative â and we must tell people that â would be continuing lack of freedom, the continuation of a totalitarian regime.
That is why we should be glad and grateful that the nations of Central Europe â and of course Cyprus and Malta â are joining our union of values under different circumstances, on the basis of human rights, democracy, the rule of law and the market economy.
We wish the nations of Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus a warm welcome.
It is an occasion for joy. Our group and the entire Parliament have always supported it.
We will be having the first free elections in Europe.
In the accession countries, our political friends and the people there refer to these European elections as Europeâs first free elections.
That is why we must reject the call, from the prime minister of one of the accession countries, for there to be a single list.
No, ladies and gentlemen; elections are a political competition and we should be glad that such competition is now possible in the countries of Central Europe, too.
The enlargement of the European Union is, however, not just a material question.
In essence, it is a question of values, a spiritual question.
We should also be saying to our new partners in Central Europe, Malta and Cyprus: do not ask what you can get out of the European Union, but let us all in the present and future European Union ask ourselves what we can do for Europe together to make this Europe strong, to make this Europe democratic and to make this Europe carry weight in the world.
I have great admiration for what the accession countries have already achieved.
After more than 50 years of communism, these nations have had to make a tremendous effort.
There is still a lot to be done, however.
Commissioner Verheugen, Mr Brok and the other rapporteurs have already drawn our attention to that.
I believe we will do it, however.
We should put across to the people of the European Union that our experience with enlargement when Spain and Portugal joined shows that in the end everyone will gain, materially and economically too.
Tremendous challenges remain in the area of internal security.
I have just been talking to an expert on internal security from Europol.
Of course we must secure the external borders.
But that expert explained to me that the drugs mafia, which is already making trouble in the European Union, will also expand its activities to the accession countries.
That means we must strengthen Europol and police cooperation as a whole.
One final remark.
Commissioner, you and this Commission still have to give an assessment of Turkey.
Opinions in our Group differ over whether Turkey should become a member or not.
I will not go into that now.
However, we expect the Commission, we expect you, to make your assessment on the basis of the Copenhagen criteria and not to make a politically opportunistic recommendation, but to comply with the law.
The Commission is bound to do so as guardian of the Treaties, and we will judge you by that yardstick.
We will meet and discuss this matter again.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to begin by fully associating the Socialist Group with the remarks of Commissioner Verheugen in relation to Cyprus; no doubt my colleague Mr Poos will say more about that later.
I have always argued that this enlargement is going to make or break the European Union.
If we handle it well, it will greatly strengthen the Union.
A recent report by the economists Ernst [amp] Young in the United Kingdom showed the benefits the United Kingdom would receive from enlargement.
However, if it is handled badly, it will seriously damage the Union.
Thus there is still a lot at stake in making sure that we get it right.
That is why it is so crucial for the applicant countries to fully meet the standards required because, if they do not, we run the risk of having a backlash in public opinion not only in the 15 but also in the 10.
We still need greater emphasis â as Mr Brok stated in the report â on implementation and enforcement.
We must have proper transparency on state aid, competition policy and public procurement because, if enlargement is to work, the business community and trade unions have to be convinced that there will be fair play.
We must not relax our drive against corruption.
Corruption undermines economic progress.
The EU country defined by Transparency International as being the least corrupt is Finland.
The EU country with the most successful economy is Finland.
The two things are closely related.
The culture of the brown envelope passing between ministers and senior officials has no part to play in a modern, dynamic economy.
However, the candidate countries also have to realise that by joining the European Union they are committing themselves to the standards of the European Union, such as democracy and human rights.
That is why I was so horrified to see in Lithuania that the leading daily newspaper has been publishing crude anti-Semitic and homophobic articles, the first of which, on 20 February, contained a cartoon on the front page which is straight out of the Nazi propaganda of the 1930s.
Such sentiments have no place in the European Union: racism and xenophobia are cancers that destroy our society.
They have done so in the past and will do so again if we drop our guard.
We completely condemn these articles.
I regret the time it took for the Lithuanian media and authorities to take action and to respond.
I hope the Council and the Commission also condemn those articles.
We must recognise the difficulties that some applicant countries have faced and that they have made enormous progress in a very short period of time.
That is why we have always had a very balanced approach and recognised the efforts that the candidate countries have made.
That is why I regret the tone of the original Nicholson report on Romania.
We have always said that each country should be judged on its merits and has to meet the standards or we will vote not to admit them.
We have never said the negotiations should be suspended in the middle of a process.
We know that there are serious problems Romania has to address.
We know that past governments did not treat these negotiations seriously, but the current government does and it is making major efforts to catch up, as Baroness Nicholson herself has admitted.
Thus our message should be to encourage Romania to intensify its efforts, not to try to pull the rug from underneath its feet at this crucial moment.
I fear, given some of the misleading information in the original report, that party politics have more of a role to play than objectivity.
The new countries have a right to criticise the European Union.
We have been very niggardly in relation to the free movement of labour.
I am appalled at the dreadful populist campaign â which has often been racist â run by sections of the European press.
I am even more appalled at certain politicians who have jumped on the bandwagon, including, I am ashamed to say, the British Conservative Party, which said it supported enlargement, has never raised this issue in the past and then started to dance to the tune of its tabloid masters.
I hope that when reality â rather than mythology â rears it head after 1 May, Member States can start to ease these restrictions.
I hope that on 1 May we will enter into a brave new world of solidarity and cooperation, not of recriminations and national tensions.
We need these countries to work together on economic reform to boost jobs.
We need these countries to work together with us to stop multinational crime.
We need these countries to work with us to deal with the problem of people trafficking â the 21st century version of slavery.
Together we can strengthen Europe.
If we can do that, we will have a lot to celebrate.
That is what we should be aiming for on 1 May.
Â Â  â Mr President, there are now only fifty days remaining of the long journey that began with the scenes of joy on 9 November 1989 under the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin.
In fifty days, Europe will become a united continent, and almost half a billion people will join together to work towards a better and fairer world and to defend European values and together solve common problems: pollution, cross-border crime and, in particular, trafficking in human beings, which everyone has mentioned.
EU enlargement is a fantastic example of what we can achieve when we have a clear goal and a clear strategy in the EU.
With EU membership as a tempting goal, and hard work on their part, the former communist dictatorships have now become fully functioning democracies and market economies.
Potential membership has also contributed to the work of reform in Turkey and to the possibility of perhaps finally solving the Cyprus problem.
Naturally, there remain a great many problems, which Elmar Brok also pointed out in his excellent report.
The EU will change dramatically in the next few years, and the main task during the next term of office will be to make this enlarged Europe work.
It is therefore extremely important that the Conventionâs proposal is actually carried out so that the EU can take decisions and function democratically.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is always particularly concerned about minority rights, which is why we are greatly worried by the unrest within the Roma group in Slovakia.
The cuts in social benefits hit this group particularly hard, and we hope that the Commission can continue to monitor the Roma situation in both the old and the new Member States.
Finally, I too regret that we are building walls between ourselves and the new Member States in the shape of various types of transitional rules.
One country after another is now introducing more or less discriminatory regulations based on fears that seem completely unfounded and are eagerly encouraged by the press in certain countries.
Instead of hindering freedom of movement, we should welcome the fact that it embraces more and more people.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ Verheugen and I are not, presumably, in much agreement, politically, about a lot of things, but I have to say that I have seldom heard so good and precise a description of the problems we are now to face.
Nor have I heard so good and precise a description of our need to find a solution to our problems.
I believe that the lack of popular involvement and the lack of commitment on the part of the political elite is one of the reasons why we now see more and more Member States choosing to introduce restrictions in relation to workers from the new Member States.
That is something I deeply regret.
I think it is the wrong signal to send to our new friends and colleagues from Eastern and Central Europe.
I am tired of people typically proceeding on the basis of populism and of unreliable figures and information about the way things really are.
I am also pleased that, in the course of enlargement, many forces have been deployed in monitoring the human rights situations in the candidate countries, and I think that this is one of those areas in which we cannot allow ourselves to relax, either now or after 1 May.
We need constantly to monitor the situation.
We know that there are problems for the Russian minority in Latvia.
We know that the Roma have problems in many of the candidate countries, and we also know that they have problems too in the present Member States.
My recommendation is that we do what we once did in the Council of Europe when that institution admitted quite a lot of new Member States, namely introduce permanent monitoring of democracy, human rights and minority rights, and not only in the new countries but in all the EU Member States.
That is what we need to do, MrÂ President.
It will be an important task to persist in monitoring these areas.
Â Â  Mr President, in my contribution, I should like to focus on Romania, and I have three reasons for doing so.
The first is that the present discussion on Romania is, in my view, the best possible barometer of the current enlargement round.
Indeed, what is evident from this discussion is that the main problems in the new Member States are not related to the fisheries chapter or the transport chapter, important and interesting though these may be.
The most persistent problems in the new Member States have to do with the functioning of the constitutional state, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression of opinion.
This brings me to my second reason, provided that other Members allow me to carry on, Mr President, for noise levels are rather high at the moment.
The discussion on Romania is also of major importance for future enlargement rounds including Turkey and the Balkans, and for the reason that we cannot very well insist in Ankara and Zagreb on an improvement of human rights or the rights of minorities if, at the same time, we allow the situation in Bucharest to remain at a standstill and, in fact, to change for the worse in a number of respects.
So to my third point, which is that the situation in Romania itself remains problematic.
To this day, the reform of the constitutional state is in its infancy.
To this day, it is impossible for critical journalists to do their jobs.
To this day, corruption is an enormous problem right up to the highest political level.
In her report, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne is right to take a critical view of this.
To the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would say that advocates of enlargement, even more than its opponents, have a duty to be critical, and they must also remain so.
It is encouraging to see, Mr President, that precisely this critical stance is bearing fruit.
Over the past few days, the Romanian Government has announced new reforms and accelerated the old ones.
The Justice Minister has had to step down because he is held responsible for the stagnation.
I would urge the Romanian Government to carry on with the reforms, for if it does not, it may as well forget about joining in 2007.
My appeal to NGOs and journalists is to carry on with their critical work and keep us informed.
Mr President, the European Union is good at influencing countries by dangling a carrot in front of them, but sometimes an educational rap on the knuckles does wonders too.
Â Â  Mr President, who longs for a Europe that is divided into two opposing camps?
Who begrudges the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe their personal and national freedom?
Their liberation was late in coming; it took until 1989, and our continent will acclaim it on 1 May, the day of the EU's eastward enlargement, of which all those involved are firm advocates, whilst, at the same time, bearing a heavy responsibility.
Now that the usefulness of a greatly expanding European Union is the subject of a public debate, politicians in the East and the West need, first of all, to work towards the consolidation and creation of solid constitutional states.
This creates a national sense of public responsibility, the very foundation for Europe-wide cooperation.
Only a few decades ago, a major authority on Central and Eastern Europe, Mr Hugh Seton-Watson, referred to that region as the sick heart of Europe, for which may the enlarged EU soon show itself to be an effective medicine.
This requires a considerable mutual effort, a sincere attending to each other's needs.
It is precisely this involvement that I have noticed among grassroots support.
My group and I wish to continue on that entirely Christian course.
Â Â  Mr President, nobody can deny the fact that the ten future Member States have done an impressive amount of work as the day of their accession draws near, but any euphoria would be misplaced.
There are still many problems left unsolved.
For example, in its recommendation with regard to this report, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has expressed its disquiet at the large-scale corruption in the agricultural sector and at the way in which subsidies will be paid.
Another problem is Cyprus.
We are facing the unique situation that part of a future Member State is under the military occupation of a candidate Member State, Turkey.
To date, we are uncertain as to whether the entire island will be joining the EU.
Another big question mark is the immigration that may originate in the new Member States.
Although most of the present Member States have announced a transitional measure, the question remains of to what extent this will be adhered to.
I hope that I am wrong, but the figures used by the Commission lead me to believe that the problem is being grossly underrated, just like the other problems that enlargement will trigger.
Most of the new Member States are not yet ready for accession.
Everyone knows that, but hardly anyone dares say so out loud.
Jacques Delors is one of the few who has said it, and for that he deserves all credit.
Â Â  The debate is suspended. It will continue at 3 p.m.
We shall now proceed to the signing of the amending budgets for the financial year 2004, which we voted yesterday.
The first amending budget, No 1, is a supplementary and amending budget that relates to enlargement.
It is the first enlargement budget of the European Union.
It commits EUR 11.7 billion by way of commitment appropriations and EUR 5.1 billion in 2004 by way of payment appropriations.
The second amending budget voted yesterday was a supplementary and amending budget on the European Data Protection Supervisor.
I invite the rapporteurs, Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill, Mr Wynn, the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Roche to join me in the signing ceremony of those two budgets, not least to mark â as we debate enlargement â the fact that we are now providing for it financially for the first time in the European budgetary process.
Â Â  The next item is the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, regardless of whether there is an error in the text of Amendment No 1 presented by my Group, I would like to make it perfectly clear that the objective of this amendment is to establish a delegation within the EU-Chile Mixed Parliamentary Committee independent of the Delegation for Relations with Mercosur.
Â Â  We shall make sure that the text is corrected.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to propose that we replace the words, âUSAâs invasion of Afghanistanâ by the words, âthe conflict in Afghanistanâ.
That concludes the vote.
Â Â  . This proposal is extremely important in two fundamental areas: it both enhances safety in the management and the use of the sea and also contributes to reducing pollution.
Because of the type of vessel it targets, the proposal for a regulation is also crucial, since its scope is extended to cover vessels operating in domestic, as well as international waters within the Community.
The Commission has done a good job and on this I offer it my congratulations.
Incidentally, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has used this report to propose that its proposal for a regulation should also be adopted.
What we have here are measures that might at first glance appear to be highly technical, but once carefully analysed, prove to be crucial to achieving the stated aim.
It should be remembered that security in transport, not only in maritime transport but also in air and road transport has always been one of the European Unionâs top priorities and this is reflected in the legislation that has been adopted, particularly in the last decade.
For this reason and because I am quite happy with the thrust of the proposal, I voted in favour
Â Â  . The report concerns an issue that is very close to my heart.
I have called for a long time for a serious approach to developing rail transport, mainly because I believe that this is a perfectly viable alternative to the road transport sector, which has already reached saturation point.
This is precisely the aim of the agreement that the rapporteur is asking us to approve.
The Communityâs accession to the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF), is thus crucial to promoting, improving and facilitating international rail transport.
This agreement is also important for the benefits it provides from the technical and legal points of view.
Another positive aspect of signing up to COTIF is the fact that the European Community does not have to contribute to the budget of this organisation, despite the fact that it does not have a say in its decisions.
Because I believe that concluding the agreement in question will result in considerable progress in developing the rail sector and because this is something for which I have been fighting for many years, I am voting in favour of this report.
Â Â  . I agree, albeit in the long term, and in light of the criteria set by the European Council and of the progress made on implementing the Stabilisation and Association Process, with the idea of fully integrating the countries of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo, into the European Union.
This report also seeks to establish European Partnerships in order to be able to set about preparing these countries for this full integration into the European Union, and so I voted in favour of it.
I did so with all the more conviction because the report makes two key observations: one, concerning the requirement to consult the countries in question; the other, on the financial resources available for helping these countries to implement the priorities and objectives that have been identified, an observation based on the financial perspective currently in force.
It should be added that the report calls for the underlying legal basis to be adjusted to ensure that the priorities and conditions of European Partnerships are appropriately funded, and that the European Parliament is kept duly informed of any adjustments to the European Partnerships, enabling it closely to monitor their implementation and their achievements.
Â Â  . The aims of this Commission proposal could not be clearer: to remove the cross-border tax obstacles that not only hamper company cross-border mobility within the European Union, particularly that of multinationals, but also to allow a policy of company restructuring and relocation that favours tax relief or, viewed from another angle, that provides the greatest tax benefits.
This is something that clearly underlies the creation of common tax rules under the European Company Statute, ensuring that its activities are not hampered by discriminatory tax rules or by restrictions or distortions arising from the tax provisions of Member States.
In other words, at a time when so much is said about reducing the tax burden on labour, Member States are being allowed to provide tax relief for capital, as they see fit.
The key issue concerns Member Statesâ tax sovereignty and the risks inherent in eroding the tax burden.
Nevertheless, account must also be taken of the use of taxation as a tool for scrutinising and monitoring business activities, specifically in the field of mergers, in this case cross-border mergers, and of the company restructuring of major financial groups in the European Union.
The main aim of this directive is to extend the scope of this issue, which undermines the protection of the financial interests of the Member States, and this is clearly something that we must reject.
Â Â  .In line with the objectives of the Lisbon process, which provide for greater cross-border mobility for EU companies, the Commission has submitted a proposal intended to remove the obstacles relating to the methods of taxing companies in the internal market (cross-border tax obstacles).
Directive 90/434/EEC (known as the âMerger Directiveâ) already provides for a solution regarding a common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares in cases where these involve different Member States, but the Directive needs improvement, and its scope needs to be enlarged.
This new proposal tries to amend the Merger Directive to reduce instances of international double taxation when industries enter business restructurings in which companies of different Member States are involved.
These specific measures seek to solve the most urgent practical tax problems faced by companies operating internationally, until a common tax base is achieved.
I therefore voted in favour.

Â Â  We are very keen that the directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States come into force as soon as possible.
We therefore support the decision reached in the Council.
Â Â  .
The Council proposal rejected the Commission and EP proposal in some areas. To be specific:
- it reduced from six to three months the period in which a citizen of one Member State can reside in another Member State without any conditions applying, thus upholding the current situation;
- it extends the required duration of marriages or registered partnerships to a minimum of three years in order for individuals not to lose their residency permit in the event of separation or divorce, with a few exceptions;
- the definition of âfamilyâ gives no consideration to unmarried couples, only to registered partnerships if the provisions of the host State treat unmarried couples in the same way as married couples.
The issue of unmarried couples is left to the discretion of the host Member State and, consequently, the descendents and direct ascendants of citizens who do not hold citizenship of a European Union country are excluded from the directive;
- a new criterion is introduced for repatriation, relating to the excessive burden on the social security system of the host country.
Hence the four proposals that we presented in an attempt to solve these problems.
I am sorry to say that they were all rejected.
Â Â  â We fully support individualsâ right to freedom of movement as one of the fundamental freedoms in the internal market.
We are concerned that country after country is introducing transitional rules for the new Member States.
There is now a risk that we shall have to live with these transitional rules, which discriminate against the new Member States, for 10-20 years to come.
The transitional rules are being introduced on the grounds that there is a risk that the present Member Statesâ benefit systems will be misused when the borders are opened to the new EU citizens this spring.
At the present time, it is sufficient for people to be employed for ten hours a week in order to gain access to their new countryâs welfare system.
The requirement should instead be that people can support themselves by working.
We have therefore pushed for a number of general measures, covering all EU citizens, amending the definition of âworkâ to the effect that it must be sufficient to support the person concerned.
This already applies to pensioners and students.
The EU would then be open to the free movement of labour, but not to benefit abuse.
We are also doubtful about the definition of âfamily memberâ, which should be broadened to include spouse, registered partner or unmarried cohabiting partner, regardless of gender.
If we do not get support for this, we choose to vote against the report.
Â Â  . At the first reading of the proposal for a common position, I felt obliged to vote against it, because I was unhappy that the report was undermined by the heavy-handedness of the proposals, which mainly received the votes of the left-leaning Members of the parliamentary committee.
The proposals detract from the rapporteurâs much more balanced approach.
The European Parliament opted, then, for an approach that was frankly excessive, which far exceeded what is necessary in this area.
At this second reading, the Commission has seen fit to adopt most of the European Parliamentâs proposals for amendments although it has not done the same for family policies, which have clearly been excluded from Community sphere of competence, and this is to be welcomed.
I still hold to other observations and reservations that I expressed at first reading.
As regards the amendments tabled by the Communist left, I voted against.
Â Â  . Whilst I welcome the fact that that there is a programme in this area, it is appalling that significant increases in support for youth organisations are regularly turned down.
I understand the position of the rapporteur, who, faced with the Councilâs intransigence, did not wish to jeopardise the programmeâs entering into force on the date set.
I am appalled, however, by the Councilâs unacceptable position, which undermines the role of youth organisations.
Support for youth associations must not be allowed to dwindle; such bodies have a vital role to play in the education of young people, in the way that they encourage participation and extend democracy.
If we do not increase support, we are giving out the signal that we have no intention to broaden the field of youth participation, and this is a deplorable state of affairs.
Â Â  . This report is of special importance to the area of youth.
Its purpose is to establish a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of youth and, more specifically, by approving an action programme, to provide an appropriate legal base for Community grants already awarded in the sector.
I should like to highlight the 13% increase in the programme budget agreed between Parliament and the Council on 24Â November.
While the Council has always appeared decidedly reticent on the issue, it should be noted that it adopted in full, in part or in essence, 13 of the 16 Parliament amendments tabled at first reading and subsequently adopted by the Commission.
I voted in favour of the proposed package, as I welcome the unanimous vote achieved in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport.
Â Â  . The report before us dovetails with the Prets report.
It is a further draft resolution in the field of youth, education and training, which, in common with the previous report, enjoyed the support of all committee members.
In this case, education and training â also questions that are worthy of attention â are brought to the fore.
The Council reached a unanimous agreement, after acting on Parliamentâs opinion.
The amendments to the Commissionâs proposal tabled by the Council resulted in a clearer, more consistent text.
The budget available to the programme has been increased.
I welcome the rapporteurâs remarks, and I therefore voted in favour.
I voted in favour of the package of amendments, which have given substance to the common position.
Â Â  .â This proposal strikes us as being worthy of condemnation in various respects, not only the damage it does to subsidiarity and its failure to respect the Member Statesâ competence in the educational sphere.
Firstly, it is not desirable that an exception should be made to the Budget rules by delaying the signature of conventions; thought needs to be given to prompt compliance with them.
Secondly, it is not healthy for the Community budget to fund, year in year out, a European clone of the political science faculties to help supply a bureaucracy that harms democracy and political debate, whilst claiming, sometimes perhaps in good faith, to stimulate them.
Finally, the colleges and institutes that benefit have, ever since they were set up, been closely linked with the small world of the Community institutions whose cause they enthusiastically promote and which they systematically supply with ideas on European affairs to such an extent that one cannot exclude the risk of clientelism, exclusive dependence and confusion of roles.
The MEPs belonging to the CPNT delegation within the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities therefore voted against this resolution, which defends an elitist project for a uniform Europe, out of touch with its citizensâ aspirations but oppressing them with its decisions as they go about their daily lives.
Â Â  .I congratulate the rapporteurs, Ms Pack and Ms Prets, for their thorough work on the important issues of European policy in the areas of youth, education and training.
These reports dovetail nicely with yesterdayâs Commission communication on 'The new generation of education and training programmes' setting out future programmes intended to replace the current Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, Tempus, Youth, Culture 2000 and Media Plus from 2007.
I fully agree with Commissioner Reding on the need to reinforce and restructure programmes which are clearer to the citizens of an enlarged European Union.
These new programmes will also enable institutions in the fields of education, training and culture to improve cooperation.
They also coincide with the Irish presidency plans as outlined in the Culture Committee in January.
They will contribute to achieving the Lisbon objective, namely of making Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy by 2010.
In a Union which will have nearly 500 million inhabitants in 2007, the new programmes will form part of a new approach, building bridges between cultures and individuals.
Â Â  . I welcome this report, which is intended to establish a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level in the field of culture and, more specifically, by approving an action programme, to provide an appropriate legal base for Community grants already awarded in the sector.
The rapporteurâs recommendations â that Parliament should accept the common position with some amendments â are merely technical, and are essentially the result of the fact that the political agreement reached at the âCultureâ Council was superseded by the concessions granted by the finance ministers at the budgetary conciliation process that was concluded later.
Given that the Councilâs official position is, however, that the agreement reached by the ministers of culture should form the basis of the common position, Parliament must amend the Councilâs common position, in order that the agreement obtained by the ministers of culture corresponds to the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council at the budgetary conciliation process.
In view of both the general consensus regarding the common position and the technical nature of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur at second reading, I voted in favour.
Â Â  We have chosen to abstain in the vote on the Prets/Pack/Iivari reports.
The reason for this is that we consider that issues of culture and education should be dealt with at national level where the decisions are taken as close to the citizens as possible.
We object on principle to the Pack reportâs choosing a small number of schools to receive a large proportion of the total education grant from the EU.
We think there are many other good schools that should be taken into consideration.
For the EU to become more effective and efficient in relation to the big cross-border issues, the politics of everyday issues such as schools, the arts and youth issues must be left to the Member States.
These issues must be considered at a level that is closer to the citizens.
Â Â  â Mr President, deriving its inspiration from the Greens and from the health fanatics, a majority has voted not only against the growing of tobacco but also â it is not clear why â against the cultivation of olive groves.
All this is prompted by the simple logic according to which tobacco causes lung cancer, so all that needs to be done to do away with lung cancer is to stop growing the stuff.
It is an unfortunate fact that 75% of the tobacco smoked in Europe, amounting to 540Â 000 tonnes, is imported, in particular from Brazil, and so banning our 350Â 000 tonnes of European tobacco, 25Â 000 tonnes of which come from France, will have no effect on cancer whatever.
On the contrary, it will put a question mark over 50Â 000 French jobs, at Sarlat, Tonneins, Lille and elsewhere.
In Europe, a total of 500Â 000 jobs are at risk, many of them being done by women â who, in any case have fewer resources and are hence less able to fight against cancer.
What is the reasoning behind this hastily cobbled-together policy?
It is that the European Commission has no love for tobacco-growers, winegrowers, olive farmers and the people who work the land.
Brussels is all in favour of preferential treatment for foreign agriculture, and so it even prefers lung cancer to be imported.
Â Â  Mr President, I am very pleased that today we have managed to vote on the new rules for the organisation of the market in tobacco.
The proposal that Parliament has made with partial decoupling is the right road because the decisions of the 2003 Luxembourg Council provided for partial decoupling for all market organisations.
As Mr Maaten said, far more than 400Â 000 jobs are affected.
I would like to make one more thing quite clear here.
If anyone thinks that everyone would stop smoking if no more tobacco were grown in Europe, he is dreaming.
Tobacco would then be imported and we would only damage the European economy, in other words, farmers and workers.
Â Â  Mr President, I disagree with the last two speakers.
Backing this report is a very sad day for this House.
I would like to focus my remarks on tobacco.
I believe the Commission's reform package is fair.
The proposed schemes remove direct support for a product that is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the EU.
Half a million EU citizens die each year because of tobacco-related illness and disease â that is a million throughout Europe.
EU citizens find it deeply offensive that nearly EUR 1000 million a year go to funding a crop that nobody would buy if it were not subsidised; a crop that does nothing but harm its consumers.
Today's approval of the Daul report does nothing for European citizens' health.
It is a disappointing day for this Parliament and I am glad that 215 Members voted against this report and against tobacco subsidies.
Â Â  We chose to vote against all proposed amendments to the Commission proposal and against the report as a whole.
We would like to see modern European agriculture in line with the common agricultural policy reforms.
We consider the Commission proposal to be a step toward reaching the goals relating to the Unionâs agricultural policy.
We support a radical reform of agricultural policy with the decoupling of agricultural aid as the main goal.
We therefore support the Commission proposal.
To support the wording of the report would be to take a large step backwards in the work to reform European agriculture since Parliamentâs wording promotes continued direct aid and production-linked aid to far too great an extent.
The aim of the EUâs agricultural policy is to grant farmers greater freedom to produce what the market demands, which would lead to production being adapted to the consumer.
This is particularly important from an international perspective in order not to render competition on the European market more difficult for the developing countries with their agricultural products.
For us, these are important principles that must be taken into consideration in the Unionâs agricultural policy, particularly in relation to cotton and tobacco.
Â Â  We Moderates are of the opinion that direct support for the production of tobacco, olives, cotton and hops should be phased out.
European support for tobacco production is neither morally nor economically defensible.
We are also of the opinion that protective import duties on olives should be removed.
Â Â  . On behalf of the seven Radical Members, we intend to declare our support for the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development with regard to the support system for the tobacco-growing sector.
We consider it necessary and urgent to replace the current common policy, which is needlessly costly for European taxpayers and consumers, harmful to the environment and for the very competitiveness and innovation of the agricultural sector and detrimental to the economies of the poorest countries.
In this context, the CAP reform proposed by the Commission based on the decoupling of subsidies and production, although totally inadequate, is a step in the right direction.
Nevertheless, we do not support harsh discriminatory treatment to the detriment of tobacco growing expressly based on a âprohibitionistâ approach to the smoking phenomenon.
Furthermore, we support the rapporteurâs position according to which eliminating aid for tobacco producers in no way amounts to combating smoking.
Â Â  . Production aid in the olive oil, tobacco and cotton sector must be maintained if we are to prevent many producers from abandoning the sector, and if the specific characteristics of Mediterranean products are not to fall by the wayside.
The Commissionâs proposal for decoupling production aid, which has now also been approved by Parliament, is unacceptable and does not augur well for the discussions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers.
This proposal will have a devastating socio-economic impact and will lead to desertification, particularly in the poorest regions of EU Member States, such as in Portugal.
This proposal particularly affects Portugal.
In the case of cotton, the threshold for aid is set at a preposterous 360Â hectares, in spite of the potential benefits of the Alqueva project and of the conversion of barren areas into irrigated land.
In the case of olive oil, the financial package and methodology that have been established undermine both the modernisation of Portuguese olive groves and the new plantation rights set at 30Â 000 hectares, which were agreed in 1998; this despite the intended savings of EURÂ 113 million.
The proposal would entail increasing the financial envelope for Portugal by some EURÂ 20 million.
Yet the most worrying consequence of this proposal would be the number of producers leaving the sector in Portugal, which would happen, according to various studies.
Hence our vote against.
Â Â  . The Daul report has received the consensus of Alleanza Nazionale, as an acceptable compromise has been reached between the various political groups of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, thanks to the work carried out by MrÂ Berlato to modify the Commissionâs original proposal.
Our objective, with regard to a proposal which would also have endangered the Italian position of oil in certain disadvantaged areas, was an agreement which provides for a flexible 60% partial decoupling of aid, with the States having the opportunity to increase this percentage if necessary.
Together with other groups, the AN supported and obtained the introduction, in addition to landscape and social criteria, of a quality criterion, along with measures such as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and organic production, hand-harvesting and other measures which do not relate to quantity.
The quality of the product is a guarantee for consumers and protects the specific types of agriculture of certain European States.
We are therefore satisfied that the specific Italian characteristics with respect to the production of high quality olive oil are tangibly recognised, and we welcome the support mechanisms for olive growers, which safeguard employment levels in rural areas that are being depopulated and introduce important measures to guarantee quality European oil.
This is why I voted for the Daul report.
Â Â  I have voted against all the amendments and, in the final vote, against the report since we are of the opinion that the EU is wrong to continue with, and give more aid to, tobacco plantations, olive groves and cotton production than was indicated in the Commissionâs original proposal.
We think that these subsidies should be phased out and the taxpayersâ money used more appropriately.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats sees increased subsidies as a problem of principle and, where tobacco is concerned, there are strong ethical arguments against the aid.
Since many developing countries are entirely reliant on cotton production, EU aid distorts the competition.
These countries are even less well placed than regions within the EU to solve the transitional problems that arise if part of the production is stopped.
Â Â  . â The reform of the common market organisations for Mediterranean products follows on logically from the reform of the common agricultural policy inaugurated in Luxembourg in June 2003, being similarly based on the decoupling of aid and the transfer of funds to the second pillar.
The CPNT delegation has always opposed this reform and continues to make its opposition to it extremely clear.
Particularly in the tobacco sector, the decoupling of aid will bring about the end of this activity, which has, up until now, provided many jobs.
What will become of these agricultural workers when their strength is no longer required?
Rural development is not about killing off a sector, but rather about maintaining jobs in order to keep our countryside alive.
Given the choice between the total and partial decoupling of aid, we would prefer aid to be partially decoupled; were we to be asked to choose between this reform being implemented at once or deferring it, we would prefer a further short respite.
This is why, faced with the Commissionâs proposals, we are resigned to having to vote in favour of the rapporteurâs text.
It is in this state of mind, fearful and yet still no less combative, that we see the forthcoming reform of the common market organisation for sugar looming ahead of us.
Â Â  . â By declaring itself to be in favour of an upper limit for the decoupling of public aid to European tobacco growers, the European Parliament has done belated homage to those who fought against the inception of this perverse mechanism dreamt up by the Commission in order to obtain â successfully, as we know â the WTOâs blessing on income support payments.
In fact, by opting for decoupling, the European Union has chosen a system that is bound to hinder young people at the start of their working life, to throw the markets into chaos and to deprive public aid of its legitimacy.
In the case of tobacco, the Commission has in any case anticipated the disappearance of aids that decoupling will bring about, by openly proposing total decoupling in preparation for the complete banning of public aid.
Brussels was thus establishing real âforeign preferenceâ and benefiting non-European tobacco producers.
The counter-proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which the plenary has just adopted, limits environmental degradation while recoupling most of the aid and acknowledging the real subsidiarity of the Member States.
The ball is now back in the Councilâs court; from now on, it can rely on the work Parliament has done towards preserving tobacco-growing in Europe, and especially in France.
Â Â  We chose to vote against Amendments Nos 1-28, 30-39 and 40-43 to the Commission proposals and against the report as a whole.
We would like to see modern European agriculture in line with the common agricultural policy reforms.
We consider the Commission proposal to be a step toward reaching the goals relating to the Unionâs agricultural policy.
We support a radical reform of agricultural policy with the decoupling of agricultural aid as the main goal.
We therefore support the Commission proposal.
To support the wording of Parliamentâs report would be to take a large step backwards in the work to reform European agriculture since Parliamentâs wording promotes continued direct aid and production-linked aid to far too great an extent.

This is particularly important from an international perspective in order not to render competition on the European market more difficult for the developing countries with their agricultural products.
For us, these are important principles that must be taken into consideration in the Unionâs agricultural policy.
Â Â  . Parliament has approved a number of amendments to the regulation before us, which have made substantial improvements to the Commissionâs original proposal.
I naturally welcome these amendments.
The most important of these are the Community-level prohibition of the production and marketing of blends of olive oil with other oils or fats, essential to ensuring the quality of olive oil; the prohibition of the term âolive oilâ â or any other image or symbol suggesting olive oil, on the label or in information to the consumer â from being used to describe any blend of fats or oils, in order to combat unfair competition; the compulsory indication of the origin of olives, based on the country of harvest; and the retention of production refunds for canned fish and canned vegetables.
It was essential for the Council to act on Parliamentâs opinion in this area, but Parliament has not proposed effective mechanisms for regulating the market and has accepted the end of production aid.
