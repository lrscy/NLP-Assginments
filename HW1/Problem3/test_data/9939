It is several years now since Parliament proposed amendments to electoral legislation, and why indeed should the people of Europe not have the long-overdue opportunity to choose between various European lists of candidates put forward by European parties at the next elections?
If I may return to MrÂ Lehneâs remarks, I do not regard that as an âabstract conceptâ but as a new political departure.
There is nothing, of course, to prevent anyone from combining European lists with more personalised campaigning.
Allow me finally to thank MrÂ Leinen for his report.
His proposals on financial arrangements are balanced, and the Party of the European Left supports them.
More financial security for long-term planning and more flexible administration of allocated resources will make it easier for every party to go on developing its political activities.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I have voted against the report and, together with 22 other Members of the last Parliament, I tried in vain to take legal proceedings against the notion of taxpayers contributing to European political parties.
The parties are never anything other than artificial.
There is nothing that can be voted on, there is nothing of which to become a member and there is nothing over which to obtain influence.
The exception, curiously enough, is the EU Democrats, the new alliance for European parties and movements founded by critics of the EU.
It is possible to log onto our home page, EUDemocrats.org and, in that way, join right off the street, free of charge, and be informed, as well as take part in the various events.
The rules applicable to the political parties discriminate against smaller movements, smaller parties and, for example, national minorities.
These will never be able to achieve the status of European parties and obtain funding for activities that may be identical in every respect to the activities for which the larger political parties - in many cases the smaller groupsâ competitors - obtain funding from EU coffers.
The regulation on European political parties is discriminatory and thus unlawful in the ordinary course of things.
Moreover, it is something that we cannot even have tested in the EU's supreme court.
The regulation was adopted by majority decision in the Council of Ministers by people who all have financial interests in the outcome of the vote.
What is more, the decision-makers are themselves members of the political parties that now take money from voters who vote for their political competitors in connection with decisions from which those competitors are excluded.
The regulation is supported by a majority of the European Parliament, the majority of whose Members also, of course, have a financial interest in discriminating against troublesome minorities.
None of the decision-makers perceives any problem in relation to competence.
Nor do the decision-makers appreciate that they are offending against EU lawâs principle of equality and the ban on discrimination.
My group wants to see the regulation abolished or at least modified so that everyone is placed on an equal footing when they, for example, carry out a cross-border activity for the purpose of disseminating information.
Why should international conferences arranged by Social Democrats and Christian Democrats or, for that matter, EU Democrats be funded by EU taxpayers while 21 national minorities cannot obtain grants for debating perhaps exactly the same subjects at their own equivalent conferences.
That is indefensible.
It is clearly unlawful discrimination, and there should be equality for Loki as well as for Thor, as we say in Denmark.
Â Â  Mr President, this resolution speaks of the gulf between the public and the European institutions.
Those who think that more Europe with Europe-wide political parties is the answer are, I believe, missing the point.
It is the institutions, not the people, which are at fault.
Their expressions of disdain are clear enough: witness the lamentable turnout in European elections.
Indeed, most MEPs in this House come to this House with an embarrassingly low mandate.
I do not see the citizens of Europe out on the streets demanding the right to vote for European political parties, but I do find them demonstrably rejecting an ever-increasingly centralised Europe such as in France and Holland last year.
European political parties, that it is hoped might eclipse national parties, may fit the template of European integration, but the rock upon which they will perish is that of democratic rejection when they have to face the harsh reality of seeking a popular mandate from real people on real issues.
It is one thing to play at superstatehood in this rarefied House; it is quite another to face the real issues of our electorate.
The narrow political vision of this venture is evident from recitals A and B. It is seen as the next step towards European integration and as building a European political area.
Clearly these parties are seen as part of the machinery of a federal Europe.
Federalist parties for federalist politicians might make some intellectual sense, but I would welcome a fight with them any day in my constituency.
I should also say that it is not right to try and buy success by throwing endless supplies of taxpayersâ money at European parties.
Do not kid yourselves!
Our electorate does not think that much of us that it wants the privilege of paying to have us as European political parties.
I thought that maybe Mr Corbett, drawing on the experience of his own party back in the United Kingdom, was going to suggest that we could fund this endeavour by creating an upper House and then selling the membership to the highest bidder, it would not be totally out of place with some of the things that go on in this place.
Â Â  Mr President, I am a real person who is going to talk about real issues!
I address this to Mr Allister and Mr Bonde.
The difference between the last speakers and the majority of this House is that what we â the majority of this House â want is to build, we want to do things together, we want Europe to move forward, because we believe that Europe provides a good solution to the peopleâs problems.
In other words, we are not entrenched in defensive positions, we are not being critical and saying that everything is discriminatory.
No: we simply want to bring together the enthusiasm of the different parties in this House, of the different political families in this House, in order to seek solutions to the peopleâs problems.
That is the fundamental difference between us, Mr President; let us not deceive ourselves.
In this regard, the political parties play a fundamental role: political parties that, in reality, have emerged from the parliamentary groups in this House, just as they originally did in the different national States as well.
The origin of the political parties lies in the parliamentary groups in this House.
I believe that, if the European political parties have one problem, it is that, in reality, they are still federations, associations, of national political parties.
That is the reality.
It is true that we have made progress over recent years, but not enough.
We have to do much more.
Why?
Because I believe that the political parties at European level may be able to encourage the European debate and prevent any debate on European issues at national level being turned into a debate on domestic issues, which is what we see happening time and time again.
I believe, for example, that if the European Council had heeded Parliamentâs request that any referendums on the European Constitution be held on the same day, we would have been able to ensure that European issues were discussed rather than domestic issues.
Looking towards the future, however, Mr President, I believe that, at a time when more and more of us are feeling the need for the provisions of the European Constitution, the European political parties, during this reflection phase â and I am delighted that Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m, who is responsible for these initiatives within the Commission, is here â have to play a very important role.
On 8 and 9 May, we are going to hold the first Interparliamentary Forum here.
I believe that the role of the European political parties is going to be key to uniting the synergies of the Members of the European Parliament and the members of national parliaments and to moving in the direction that the majority of us who believe that the European Constitution is necessary in order to move Europe forward want to see.
We therefore have some great challenges here, and it is clear that these great challenges â Mr Onesta was right â at the end of the day require not just fine words, but they also need proper funding.
I believe that this report by Mr Leinen, whom I would like expressly to congratulate, highlights the difficulties of the Regulation and the formulae we must use in order to overcome them more effectively.
The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, therefore, Mr President, is going to back Mr Leinenâs report and is also going to vote in favour of the amendments presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by Mr Onesta on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance â which relates to young peopleâs associations â and by Mr Maaten and Mrs De Sarnez.
I believe that this would demonstrate that what we want is to build, Mr President, in the face of those who merely want to destroy.
Â Â  Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, which I support fully, and on all the work he has been doing in relation to the European political parties.
Mr Leinen is a tireless defender of the European political parties and of their development and is also one of the fathers of the current Regulation.
In my capacity as Deputy Secretary-General of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I fought hard together with him and some of the Members here today to have it approved.
This Regulation cut the financial and administrative umbilical cord that joined these parties to the political groups in the European Parliament.
Its objective was to make these parties financially and administratively transparent and achieve clear and transparent rules that would regulate their activities and funding.
This Regulation is just a first step, however, a temporary solution until the adoption of a genuine statute for the European parties and their funding, as laid down in Article 191 of the Union Treaty.
We would therefore call upon the Commission to present a proposal so that this statute can enter into force before the next European elections, in order to guarantee a competitive electoral process at European level.
It is also necessary to give these parties a legal personality, on the basis of Community law, which ensures that they operate transparently and efficiently in all of the member countries.
The role of the political parties is essential to bringing the Union closer to the citizens and to providing them with the incentive to participate politically, so that they may feel that they are participants and protagonists in a common political project and destiny.
These parties also provide a basis for the trans-national dimension of the Unionâs political process of integration.
Furthermore, we must open up and explore ways to create European political foundations funded from the Union's budget and under this Parliamentâs democratic control.
These foundations will be an essential instrument for extending the action of the European political parties and to reinforce the link with the citizens and will play an important role in terms of information and political training.
Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, carry on with your work and you can count on my total support.
Â Â  Mr President, I greatly support the reforms which will provide for a fair, buoyant and transparent system of public funding of political parties, something which, regrettably, does not exist in Great Britain at present.
The growth of truly European political parties is the vital key to solving the crisis of European democracy.
Why?
Because national political parties are clearly failing to respond to the challenge of European integration.
They are failing to develop a fluent discourse about European affairs, or to act as a conduit between the European national, regional and local levels.
I trust that European political parties, including the representatives of Mr Bondeâs party, will be galvanised during the period of reflection to contribute to a resolution of the crisis, and especially to publish European papers about those fundamental questions concerning the future of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, despite the success of ten European parties that has been described, the democratic legitimacy of, for example, this Parliament has declined in election after election.
The report states that there is a gulf between members of the public and the European institutions, which is true, but the solution to this problem is not financial support for European parties.
Instead, there should, for example, be an increase in democracy through the return of power to the national parliaments.
The report also states that an EU that is close to its citizens is a precondition for public support for the next steps towards European integration.
In order to convince people to accept the rejected Constitution, grants must, in other words, be awarded to European parties.
Any democratic forces may, of course, form parties, but to act on the belief that, through the award of large grants, the public would be induced to accept the draft Constitution would not only be an attempt to obtain acceptance of the Constitution in return for money, but would also be very dubious in democratic terms.
Â Â  Mr President, since the only natural place for political and democratic debate is at national level, coherent parties with a global programme have a place only within Member States.
The democratic deficit of the European Union will only be made good through the representation of national parties having their own particular identity, parties that are accountable to the citizens who know them and understand them.
The European political parties, virtually funded by the European Union, must be able to preserve their independence and not become yet another means of addressing European propaganda and communication to the electors.
Thus, the European political parties must remain simply a means of cooperation between national political parties, an open forum in which each member is respected.
On no account should they reflect, or become the means of conveying, some supposed European public opinion which does not exist and will not exist, because language differences are a fact and the European Union is a means and not an end in itself.
Â Â  MrÂ President, while cross-border cooperation between political parties in Europe is nothing new, even parties from the same ideological stable often represent different political cultures.
Regardless of the planned injection of millions of euros to support them, they will never be able to agree politically on any more than the lowest common denominator, which has hitherto been confined to the content of election manifestos and electoral appeals.
Not even European parties, to be sure, will be able to extricate us from this dilemma.
Although it is agreed that the European Union is in crisis, its institutions have chosen once again to pump in vast sums of money â the recipients this time being the European political parties â instead of finally tackling the causes of this crisis.
The reasons for the all-too-familiar lack of trust in the EU leaders are manifold: unrealistic promises made at the time of accession of various Member States, over-hasty eastward enlargement of the EU against the will of most of its citizens, a European constitution dictated from above, increased contributions and now the idea of European taxes.
It is always fascinating to observe just how credulous the political establishment of the European Union actually believes its citizens to be.
Plummeting turnout figures, ânoâ votes in referendums and growing exasperation with the EU are not interpreted for a moment as criticism of the Union but are dismissed as sharp reminders to national governments.
We shall not be able to change this mindset, however, through new European political parties; whether it suits us or not, the only way to build trust is through a good record of achievement.
The EU has somehow managed not only to squander goodwill but also to sleepwalk through decisive developments or even to guide them in the wrong direction, and the public impact of these blunders can be seen not least in the form of rising unemployment figures and huge increases in euro prices.
Even if we invest the planned annual amount of EURÂ 8.4Â million in the party project, there is little chance that this will do anything to create a sense of European identity.
We can only achieve that sense of identity if we give our critical citizenry the opportunity at long last to play a genuine direct part in major decisions such as enlargement and the constitution.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, while none of us has ever claimed to have all the answers, it is indeed depressing to see how the opponents of the EU who have seats in the European Parliament try to crush every measure with which we seek to advance the development of the European Union, with which we try to give our citizens a stake in this project, how they trample underfoot every little seedling we plant instead of nurturing it.
Nobody here believes that political parties are an end in themselves.
Every one of us believes that they are a potential means â a necessary means in a parliamentary democracy â of involving our citizens in the legislative process and adequately representing their views.
None of us has said here that a party statute alone would make political parties adopt the right course of action.
He who pays the piper calls the tune or, as we say in my part of the world, âNo money, no musicâ.
Music, however, is not the product of money but results from the work of an orchestra of critical, trained and qualified musicians.
They need instruments, they need scores, they need people who choose their repertoire, and they need a conductor.
I therefore appeal to all political parties to use this money and this party statute to create something worthwhile, to become involved and help ensure that the integration of national parties into European structures actually takes place.
There is too little progress for my liking in the development of a European dimension to the political debate, even among the European parties.
These are not mere adjuncts but parties with an internal as well as an external impact.
One thing is certainly clear in our view, namely that the EU must become more political, more democratic, more transparent and closer to the people.
Most of us contribute constructively on an everyday basis to the attainment of that goal.
We welcome the Commissionâs initiative to support information and communication throughout Europe by means of PlanÂ D. We lament the fact that the European debate is not being stimulated and that, sad to say, particularism, populism, nationalism and self-seeking are being practised shamelessly â I need only say âenergy policyâ, âFinancial Perspectiveâ and âEuropean foreign policyâ.
We want to strengthen the European Parliament, to support the independence of its Members and to loosen the bonds committing them to the pursuit of purely national interests.
We lament the lack of a European public opinion.
Many of us advocate Europe-wide referenda and a mechanism whereby public petitions can secure a European referendum.
We therefore see a party statute as the means whereby political parties can help to change the unhealthy situation I have described and to ensure that the opportunities created by such a change are grasped.
A European party statute will help to make the political debate transparent, independent and European in its perspective.
It will reinforce our efforts to give domestic policies a European dimension instead of renationalising European policies.
Let me say in conclusion that I am fully in favour of European electoral lists to supplement national lists, because a European list will serve to encourage European parties to campaign under a high-profile European leader.
Yes, I favour the candidature of European parties rather than national parties as the basis for the allocation of top-up seats.
Yes, we want European political parties to step up their training activities, to promote their own political foundations and to engage in youth work.
It is for these reasons that we are backing the report.
Â Â  Mr President, I believe that the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, has done an excellent job. I congratulate him.
We must be honest with ourselves: the national parties that make up the European political parties are often the first not to believe in them.
How often have we heard our colleagues in our countries saying, âYes, the party we belong to at European level is very important, it does many very good things, but the essential thing is what happens hereâ?
We hear that everywhere.
One simple phrase must be applied here: the function creates the body.
When we have European laws in force â beginning with the Constitution â which make it obligatory for these political parties to exist, with specific roles, we will have won this battle in favour of European construction.
For example, the European Constitution says that, when the Council makes its proposal on the election by this House of the President of the Commission, it must take account of the results of the European elections.
And if that is the case, the European parties will have to think hard about who heads their lists and also what their programmes are; and then European lists will make full sense, rather than transnational lists â a term that we must forget â and that is the most correct definition: European lists.
We are now naturally facing a period of reflection and debate.
We must provide the backbone for this debate: this House and the European political parties.
The European Convention was a success because it worked on the basis of European political families, and the interparliamentary meetings and the period of reflection will also be a success if we are able to work as political families, to understand each other and to reach agreements.
To this end, the role of the European political parties is essential, and it will also be essential when we have European referendums and when we put an end to the spectacle of national referendums hijacked by the problems of each individual country.
In this case, this report represents a further step, and it is good step.
Â Â  Mr President, the careers of the rapporteur, JoÂ Leinen, and of the political parties in Europe have followed a very similar pattern over these past decades: having started in a fairly lofty position, they are now plumbing the depths.
Only two per cent of the population of Germany still trust political parties.
These funding programmes, in the way they are actually being established now, surely cannot reverse this extreme loss of credibility.
What is the cause of this erosion? It is the fact that democracy has always been equated with political parties rather than people.
In short, sovereignty in our system does not lie with the people but with political parties, whose supremacy is to be consolidated, bolstered and inflated by these prehistoric plans that you are presenting to us.
They are doomed to failure; they will not bring Europe any further forward.
The future truly belongs to verifiable personalised elections with candidates whose real convictions are immediately discernible: candidates, in other words, who, unlike the rapporteur, do not engage in electoral campaigning within the SPD and, once they have secured a firm place on their partyâs list, abandon the electoral campaign and start canvassing support for fanciful European political parties.
Â Â  â When Parliament gave the go-ahead, in the January resolution on the period of reflection, for a second debate on the European Constitution, it became clear that Europe was in need of political parties.
The challenge is clear for all to see.
Europe needs to be increasingly political and should not shy away from having a strong, proactive and responsible party structure.
The parties have a central role to play in achieving European ambitions and in improving the quality of European democracy.
They act as a bridge between the citizens and the authorities, as a catalyst for European public opinion and as support for civil society to take action and for broader participation.
The function of political parties is â and should be â a long way from being merely parliamentary and representative.
The European political parties have, inexplicably, failed to become stronger in proportion to, and at the same pace as, the European Parliament.
This is due either to sheer ignorance of the system or to a lack of self-awareness on the part of European parties.
Yet Europe has never, throughout the course of its development, asked the parties to be dynamic.
The parties have been accused of glaring absence from the debate on the European Constitution, for example, a debate that has hitherto been strictly institutional.
Because Europe is waiting for its political parties to fulfil their role, a single European statute for Europe's political parties must be created to strengthen party structures, as a matter of urgency.
A statute of this nature would strengthen democratic control, foster political competition within Parliament, and free European parties from strictly parliamentary duties, in order to bring them up to speed with the various dynamics of the European public arena.
Furthermore, it is clear that, if the parties are to be strengthened, then what is required is a single statute, a legal personality based on European law, capacity for independent responsibility, stronger party reflection structures and adequate financing for real power to define political priorities.
The Leinen report therefore suggests much more than an accounting reform of the life of Europe's political parties.
It points the way forward for strategic understanding between parties, alongside recognition of their significance for structural solutions to persistent European democratic deficit.
In order to achieve structural solutions, the political market must be speeded up, there must be stronger links between Europeâs political parties and the national parties, and European politics â and the European electoral system â must be made more attractive.
The report also contributes towards a certain European-level party awareness, whereby we â who become organised in an attempt to take responsibility for the world â can understand that these organisations have also acquired a new scale.
This responsibility is growing, as Europe undergoes further landmark changes, for example the Constitution and the enlargement.
As such, what is needed is new political practice and a fresh look at the roles of the institutions, the citizens and the parties.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his work.
The European political parties are essential to the formation and expression of a genuine European public opinion.
Indeed, it is mainly to them that the difficult task of working for effective participation for citizens falls, and that is not only every five years at the time of the European elections, but daily and in every aspect of European political life.
MrÂ Leinenâs report puts forward suggestions that would make it possible to give the European parties the means necessary to achieve this objective.
I particularly welcome the following points: the improvement in the rules on funding through the introduction of greater clarity, flexibility, independence and financial security in the medium term; vital support for organisations and movements for young Europeans; finally, better representation of women on the electoral lists, and especially among the elected members.
Â Â  â Mr President, Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community states that political parties at European level are an important factor for integration within the framework of the European Union.
They help to establish a European consciousness and to express the political will of the EUâs citizens.
This is of enormous importance today because we are engaged in far-reaching reflections on the future of Europe, which call for broad dialogue with its citizens.
Political parties at European level should play a key role here by promoting further integration and defending the Constitutional Treaty.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has achieved much in this respect, and has a great deal of experience in the field.
European political parties undoubtedly have an important role to play in referenda on European issues, in elections to the European Parliament and in the election of the President of the Commission.
Furthermore, the results of European elections must be reflected in the choice of candidate for the President of the Commission.
In order to achieve these goals, regulations governing political parties are essential at European level. A statute for political parties is needed to define their rights and obligations, and to allow them to become legal entities.
Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Leinen on his superb report and on the exceptional level of competence he has demonstrated.
Â Â  Firstly, I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his very responsibly prepared report.
I would like to stress that support for the work of European political parties at EU institution level is particularly relevant now.
And this is why: some political scientists, in Lithuania at least, maintain that political parties have lost their ideological foundations and are becoming similar.
If this really were to happen, then party decisions, without an ideological base, would be unpredictable.
This would mean that it would no longer be clear to the voter what one party or another will do once they are in power.
And this would mean that it will no longer be important to voters which party they vote for and some will wonder whether it is worth participating in elections at all.
This is a particularly dangerous tendency; therefore, it is essential to strengthen Europe's local parties that each would have either left or right-wing ideology, which would become a landmark for parties of the left and right in different states, in every way possible, in a financial sense too.
I therefore propose that we endorse the report.
Â Â  â Mr President, political parties are rooted in the industrial revolution, the creation of nation states and the period following World War II.
Globalisation, with the new challenges to civilisation it entails, and the democratisation of the EU's political system mean that European political parties must play a part in European public life. They must become true institutions of representative democracy, acting as intermediaries between citizens and the decision-making centres of the EU.
To this end, a statute for European political parties is needed to set out their rights and obligations and to allow them to become legal entities on the basis of European law. Such a statute should function effectively in the Member States.
We in the European Union are currently faced with a crisis of the European systems of liberal democracy.
The constitutional crisis in the EU is accompanied by racism and intolerance, prejudice against immigrants and the erection of barriers between the nation states.
The EU must support European political foundations, and promote and strengthen European political organisations and youth movements.
The European Union must respond to the present crisis with a real European policy, as proposed by the Leinen report tabled before Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, political parties are a vital element in building and reinforcing a European political sphere.
They play an important and crucial role in promoting democratic values such as freedom, tolerance, solidarity and gender equality.
In parallel with this, we require a dialogue with citizens on the future of Europe and, in this context, political parties must play a key role.
Mr Leinenâs report is commendable in its support of European political parties and its recommendation to improve the current situation.
However, Mr Leinen and our political family have been stopped by the PPE-DE Group from mentioning the vital role of European political parties in furthering the priority of gender equality.
I should like to ask my colleagues to reconsider this, especially those in the PPE-DE Group, who voted against an amendment in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
That amendment stated that European political parties should take into account the principle of equal opportunities when filling posts in party offices and on party lists for election.
We should not forget that women form the majority of our population.
As President of the PSEâs womenâs group, I am aware of the tremendous work that our political family does in this field throughout the European Parliament.
Other political parties should be doing the same.
I urge my colleagues from the PPE-DE Group to rethink their position and to uphold the values of the EU.
Â Â  . Mr President, this has very much been a debate about democracy: its strengths, its shortcomings and the challenges that come from a rapidly changing reality.
Until now, the system we have for exercising and organising democracy goes through political parties.
That is the way we do it in Europe, at national, local and regional level, and at European level.
It is not perfect and it requires a constant effort to mobilise people, because we know that the biggest enemy is always ignorance and total apathy.
That goes for the European level as well.
We can state that it is no longer enough to leave the decision-making and the democracy to a small political elite; at least, that is my analysis of the situation.
We also have to mobilise people at European level to allow for a democratic development also at European level.
It is through political parties that we can make people accountable, that we can create openness and transparency, and that we can have effective decision-making.
It is still only embryonic: even if we have succeeded in creating ten European parties, we cannot say that we have succeeded totally.
However, it has helped and it does not contradict that we also have to invest in making sure that the national parties integrate European affairs into their political agenda, discussions and decisions.
We have to do both and we have to move on both fronts.
In addition it is necessary to make sure that there is European media that can cover what goes on.
This also requires some efforts and promotion from our side, to make sure that the reporting is there as well â for citizens, for democracy, to be able to follow what goes on and to take a position on that.
I would add that it is also necessary to create meeting places, citizen-to-citizen opportunities to discuss.
Those three building blocks are necessary to develop democracy at European level.
It can be virtual or geographical or real, but all three elements are necessary.
European political parties are a very important element.
You can discuss the criteria; we have to discuss the things that have been mentioned here.
I am very prudent in not promising what could come out of the review of the Financial Regulation now.
I think it would be very unwise of me to promise that the Commission will come forward at such-and-such a time with a new proposal for this or that.
It has to come in connection with and after the discussion we are having now on reviewing the Financial Regulation and the implementing rules.
This can come as a result of that and after that.
However, I think you have created and presented the elements and building blocks necessary to discuss what to do with European political parties.
As many have pointed out, however, there is a link to other organisations as well, and we have to take that into account so that it can be a balanced proposal one day.
It is wise to also have a vision as to when this could be ready, but I cannot make a promise on that on behalf of the Commission today.
This is a very important debate.
I welcome the amendments underlining the importance of promoting equality between men and women, and I would point out â as I see Mrs Gurmai there â I think this is absolutely evident.
Had Mr Allister still been here I would have asked him who he would vote for.
Would he vote for somebody and be willing to pay for somebody who says âI enter this room or this institution with ambitions and hopes and dreams and I promise to do my best and work for a future for the European Unionâ?
Or would you vote for someone who says âI do not believe in this institution, I do not think it should exist, I think it deals with nonsense issues and I am not going to pay too much attention to what goes on hereâ?
Who would you be willing to pay for as a normal taxpayer?
I think it speaks for itself, but in the end this is really also a matter of the choice that you have to give to people, as Mr Corbett and others have pointed out.
It is a choice to give to the European citizens and that is, in the end a matter of democracy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, may I apologise to Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m for those Members who deliver their speeches but are not present for the debate.
That is certainly not the custom in this House.
I wish to apologise on behalf of my fellow Members.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on European contract law and the revision of the acquis: the way forward (2005/2022(INI)) (A6-0055/2006).
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with a somewhat heretical remark.
The important reports are discussed in this House shortly before midnight, and the esoteric drivel in the form of resolutions is discussed during the day at prime transmission time.
If we are to talk about the question of parliamentary reform â and there is, of course, a proposal to this effect from the President of the House â I would say that, before we deliberate seriously on the curtailment of Membersâ rights, we should talk about giving the plenary agenda a more logical structure in which important subjects are given their rightful place.
This report is about European civil law.
In simple terms, its aim is to have the Commission try to shape broad areas of European civil law by creating a common frame of reference in a particular field of activity in the first instance in such a way that it will affect the legislation of the Member States and of the European Union in the field of civil law for many generations to come.
There is even something of a debate on whether the work we are considering here could ultimately lead to a uniform European code of civil law.
Although I say that with all due caution, what we have here is nevertheless a truly significant and decisive project.
This House has, for many years, been monitoring the efforts of the European Commission with regard to a code of European civil law and has expressed its approval and lent its support in numerous resolutions since 1989.
That is also our intention in this proposal for a resolution.
We have come to a very critical stage.
At the present time, work is under way on the frame of reference and on the revision of the established body of Community law and practice in the realm of consumer protection.
The reason why this stage is critical is that the present efforts will determine whether this work is ultimately crowned with success or whether it falls short of the desired outcome, and this depends very much on the quality of the substance that emerges from these present efforts.
Parliament therefore takes the view that, although what the Commission has launched is right in principle, it requires improvement in several respects.
For example, we have the impression that the cooperation between the research groups that drafting the common frame of reference on contract law and the practitioners on the network side is not functioning properly.
We want to ensure that the practical experience brought into this project by the network specialists is considered by the research groups in an appropriate framework.
This is something for which we in the Committee on Legal Affairs are pressing vigorously.
Another important point is that a distinction must be made between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions.
We want to protect consumers, but traders must also have broad scope to conclude contracts with each other, and this scope must not be restricted by excessive red tape.
There is also a need to ensure that what is currently being developed within this frame of reference and will subsequently form a very considerable body of soft law, at least at the European level, and have an impact on all legislation in the field of civil law is not simply created without any involvement on the part of the legislative institutions, namely Parliament and the Council.
It is not enough for Parliament and the Council to deliver their opinions on the drafting procedure; they must also be involved in the development of the substance of this frame of reference, because it will be they who adopt laws enshrining elements of the frame of reference and who must publicly justify the adoption of those laws.
Against this background it is important that Parliament is also involved on the substantive side.
From our perspective, this should involve two processes.
Firstly, the Commission should keep Parliament constantly and comprehensively informed of progress in the formulation of the frame of reference and the improvement of the body of Community law and practice relating to consumer protection, and we should have the opportunity to pronounce ourselves at any time within a continuous process.
The second process, for which we have already taken the first organisational steps in this House, is the establishment of a project group comprising the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs of both participating committees, a working party whose purpose would be to keep a close eye on the work of the Commission, the research groups and the network as well as providing political guidance on particular issues of legal policy, such as the issue of the demarcation line between business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions.
From our point of view, these are crucial matters which still require regulation and in which greater parliamentary involvement is both welcome and necessary.
These are the key elements of the resolution on the table.
Let me finish by saying that I believe this is the most significant project being undertaken by the European Commission and the other institutions in the course of the present legislative term.
It is the most significant by far, which is why I would certainly expect us to try and bring it to a successful conclusion.
It will also play an important part in determining whether the single European market continues to converge for the benefit of everyone â consumers and traders alike.
Â Â  . Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Mr Lehne for his report.
The Commission wholeheartedly welcomes Parliamentâs interest in the common frame of reference â CFR â on contract law and in the review of the consumer .
The Commission is happy to see that Parliament shares very similar views regarding the need to deliver a high level of consumer protection in the revision of the consumer .
Parliament considers that the development of the CFR is unpredictable and that the ultimate long-term outcome might be a European code of obligations, or even a full-blown European civil code.
I would stress that the Commission, and Commissioner Kyprianou personally, has clearly and repeatedly stated that it has no intention of producing a European civil code.
The Commissionâs view is that the CFR will be a better law-making toolbox for achieving coherence when revising existing legislation and adopting new instruments in the area of contract law, particularly consumer contract law, on which the currency of our work has been refocused.
The legal form of this instrument, and if and to what extent it could be binding, has yet to be decided.
If the Commission considers that this toolbox will be of more than internal use for the Commission, such a decision would clearly be a political decision and would need to be taken by the Commission, Parliament and the Council.
The Commission understands fully that Parliament wants to be kept informed of and involved in the ongoing work on the CFR.
We therefore welcome Parliamentâs involvement in the CFR process, in particular the creation of the working party.
The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way.
Commissioner Kyprianou will discuss regularly with Parliamentâs relevant committees the progress of CFR work and, in particular the intermediate politically relevant steps.
I would like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its encouragement and support for our work on this important dossier.
Â Â  . Mr President, I welcome very much MrÂ Leinenâs report, so much so that my own political group will vote against any amendments to it.
Despite all this agreement and it being so late in the evening, we are all of the opinion that it is essential to have a debate on this important report.
In the opinion for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, we highlighted the fact that this is an exercise in better law-making.
The CFR and the review of the can make a huge contribution to the better functioning of the internal market.
However â and this was our central preoccupation â the compilation of the CFR is a political exercise: it involves political choices.
Therefore, the European Parliament must be fully involved as a co-legislator.
We all welcome the setting-up of the project group, which augurs well for good future cooperation with the Commission.
However, we still have a concern that the Commission should present a coherent approach.
That means that not only DG Sanco, but also DG Justice and DG Internal Market should be fully involved in the process.
Above all, this project is of practical importance for the internal market, both consumers and businesses alike.
In my own country â which is not known for its support of anything that might even start to resemble a European contract code â an independent survey by a big law firm highlighted the transactional costs of an incoherent contract law in the internal market.
I believe this demonstrates what many of us have always felt: practical advances in EU civil law like this can assist to make Europe more popular we get it right.
However, in order to do that we must have discussion and debate.
This is not just a technical legal exercise, it is a political one.
If we ever get to the stage of a European contract code, then we cannot risk that it suffers the same fate as the proposed Constitution last year.
It has to have political support, and I hope that we, together, have put in place the appropriate mechanism to ensure that we achieve that result.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commissioner said just now, in September 2005 the Commission submitted a first annual report on the state of progress of European contractual law and the review of the Community .
One of the measures envisaged, as the rapporteur pointed out, is the creation of a common frame of reference for Community contractual law.
The Commission believes that the scope of the common frame of reference can include the possibility for national legislatures to use it even in sectors not governed by Community law.
The in force, which mainly relates to consumer protection, should be improved and a set of common principles should be added to it representing a certain but flexible reference point for citizens and legal practitioners.
MrÂ Lehne, the rapporteur, who performed valuable and important work in committee, and who this evening has given us his comments on a provision of historical importance, has tried in his report to delineate a strategic perspective for future activity by the Commission, naturally involving the European Parliament, and strongly calling for its involvement.
I would like to say, in order to underline the work that the rapporteur has done, as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, that a major process of harmonisation and in fact of codification has been begun for sectors of European contractual law.
This is an historic event, even over and above the results that may be obtained, because until now Community harmonisation had been done with a scope either more restricted or more extensive than the relevant directives: the consumer contract, to which the directives on the application of electronic and computer technologies were added.
From now on, the tasks are no longer restricted to the coordination of the law in force, but will be projected into the future, towards uniform definitions of terms set out in the directives, the identification of common principles relating to contracts which will be able to reduce the marked differences.
This is a process of regulation and knowledge which will be able to go beyond the law in force in order to form a modern code: there was even an idea that we might achieve a uniform code of contractual law, formulated through principles.
We would start by examining directives that contradict the implementing provisions of the Member States and would define a sort of common base of Community contractual law.
I will finish by saying that the process of convergence of private law and in particular European contract law is a reality, driven both by Community law and by the development of comparative analysis studies.
I support the primary role of civil law: civil law and contractual law are there to strengthen European citizenship and economic and civil exchanges in Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, I believe that this is the right time of day to be discussing this issue, because in reality it is an issue that requires reflection; we have very little to play with.
This is not a red-hot debate on something that is going to be done now: it is something that the Commission is beginning to do and that we in this Parliament are supporting.
Those of us who are here are probably amongst the few who believe in this objective or in this possibility, but I do not believe that a unified market, a European Union internal market, is possible without a contract law.
When I talk about contract law, that is precisely what I mean: law.
I am concerned about the Commissionerâs statements to the effect that we do not know what kind of legal instrument we are going to have.
There is no soft law in the European Union; the European Unionâs great advantage is that it has developed a solid law, a positive law, which is applied by courts of justice, and we need precision.
The most important thing in law is legal precision: precision with regard to the nature of the obligations and precision with regard to the content.
I therefore believe that it is important that we begin to think about defined legal instruments of an obligatory nature that are not merely recommendations.
Self-regulation, co-regulation or soft law will not be able to resolve the legal problems in this area.
In this regard, the Commissionâs report does not just refer to the possibilities of a contract law, but also to a revision of the acquis in the field of consumer protection.
I believe that we must bear in mind that nobody can take the view at this point that, with regard to contracts, the consumer can be treated in the same way as a company.
Relations between consumers and companies are of a different legal nature and the current legislations must recognise it.
That is the intention of the amendments by Mrs Berger and Mrs Patrie: to maintain a degree of protection for consumers.
In any event, I would like to thank Mr Lehne and MrsÂ Wallis for the work they have done and also to thank the Commission for persisting in this direction, because I believe that the future of the European Union will have to be shaped by means of a private law, as MrÂ Gargani has said, and, in particular, in the most immediate future, by means of an obligatory law in the field of contracts and not by means of mere recommendations.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Belarus â the political situation after the elections.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to be present here for this important debate today, because Parliament, in particular, needs to send out a strong signal regarding the depth of the concern the EU feels about the situation and developments in Belarus.
Of course, the Council has been devoting attention to Belarus not just since last Sunday, when the elections were held, but for a long time now.
For some time, the Council has viewed with concern the situation in Belarus, in terms of human rights and their suppression, of the opposition, and of civil society.
Indeed, that is why the Council took a large number of measures in the run-up to the elections, including, in particular, issuing a very clear reaction to the announcement by the Belarusian Government and President of their intention to take harsh measures against any demonstrators.
The word âterroristsâ was even used, alongside talk of the death penalty, and the Council spoke out very clearly.
The conduct of the elections themselves unfortunately confirmed the negative expectations we had had as a result of past events, namely the curbing of the opposition and the suppression of freedom of expression, and meant that these were not free elections: this was confirmed, in particular, by the OSCE/ODIHR election observation mission, which said that the elections were not fair or free, nor did they meet OSCE standards.
The Presidency immediately took a stance on the events in Belarus, and issued a statement on the subject as early as Monday, 20Â March, at the General Affairs Council.
The Council discussed the matter and expressed its opinion very clearly along the same lines as the OSCE/ODIHR statement subsequently issued that afternoon.
What is important now, of course, is the consequence of these events â how the EU should react.
The Council believed that it was important first and foremost to react quickly and send out a signal.
Once again, I am delighted at the speed with which Parliament, too, has set to work on this situation, to send out a political signal.
In the days and weeks to come, the Council will carefully consider what specific measures can and should be taken to express our discontent with this situation, and also to influence future developments in the country.
In my opinion, this is why the situation is so difficult and why measures have to be considered carefully, because we do not want any steps we take to affect the people, or civil society.
On the contrary, we must now seek to strengthen free society, or free civil society.
We must look for ways to cooperate, ways to encourage the courageous people who are assembling, who are holding out there, and we must consider our further course of action.
That is why the Council decided on Monday to join with the Commission for detailed deliberations on the form these measures could take.
It is very important that the present and future measures taken by the EU also have the support of the EUâs partners.
A total of 40 countries endorsed the statement issued by the Presidency yesterday afternoon: that sends out a strong signal.
This statement was endorsed by the candidate countries, and also the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process â Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro â the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and also Ukraine and Moldova.
It is important to arrive at a broad consensus so that we can send out a clear signal on this.
We shall also have to engage in dialogue with Russia, of course â herein lies another key to the events.
We must make it clear that Russia, too, has to endorse the common values of the European Union, that the four areas we are always talking of in connection with the partnership with Russia presuppose that Russia, too, adheres to the rules of democracy.
Naturally, we shall also express this in our contact with Russia.
By way of conclusion, I should like to assure you that the Council takes this situation very seriously, that we are concerned about Belarus, which is the last country in Europe where human rights are not respected, and where there is no freedom of assembly or expression.
We shall continue our active endeavours to improve this situation.
As the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs commented after the elections âIt will not always be winter in Minskâ.
Â Â  Madam President, you must forgive my infringing the basic rules.
I merely wish to take the liberty of protesting against our having this debate.
At best, it can be characterised as a complete waste of time.
Suddenly to agree at a few hoursâ or minutesâ notice to debate a very important subject is clearly in breach of the Rules of Procedure.
It is an important subject, but what we are now seeing is unusual complacency in a democratic context, reflected in reactions to the election in Belarus and to the oppression that has taken place.
This is not a subject that can be debated at short notice.
To do so is in breach of the Rules of Procedure, and I insist that we stop debating this subject and move on to the proper agenda.
Â Â  Many thanks, MrÂ Krarup.
The request to amend the agenda was announced yesterday; I assume that this was discussed in the groups.
I announced the amendment of the agenda this morning, together with details of who had proposed the amendment, which groups were involved and the number of signatures received.
No protests were forthcoming from the House.
I am sure that the honourable Member will raise the matter in his group.
Â Â  . Madam President, the recent elections in Belarus and the events on Sunday in the capital, Minsk, have clearly confirmed that President Lukashenko is determined to maintain his rule through whatever means.
This is no surprise as it is a repressive regime which shows no tolerance for political competition.
The bad news is that the President and the regime still enjoy some support among a significant proportion of the population.
The peaceful demonstrations, however, have given evidence of the consolidation of pluralistic forces in the country; this is a positive development.
The initial report from the OSCE and the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights concludes that the elections of 19Â March clearly fail to meet OSCE criteria for democratic elections as a result of the disregard for the basic rights of freedom of assembly, association and expression; and owing to the arbitrary use of state power and widespread detentions, and problems with early vote-counting and tabulation processes.
In the light of these serious problems, the Commission considers that the presidential elections in Belarus were fundamentally flawed.
This raises serious doubts as to whether the results of the elections truly reflect the will of the people of Belarus.
The Commission also deplores the non-admittance of the announced and registered OSCE and EU observers, including Members of the European Parliament.
We deplore the instigation of criminal cases against opposition members and the arrests of opposition activists and peaceful demonstrators.
We urge the Belarusian authorities to release them immediately.
The Commission is now considering the issue of sanctions.
It is important that we precisely target sanction measures against those individuals who are responsible for the fraudulent elections.
We have to avoid hitting the population and we should make this clearly understood.
The Commission will be fully involved in preparing such measures.
Looking now to the future, we must continue our efforts to support democratisation and civil society.
We are finalising a proposal for our assistance strategy for 2007 onwards.
In line with the Council conclusions, we will continue supporting democratisation through our different ways and means.
We will also continue to support the needs of the population by targeting social and economic developments in Belarusian society.
This can be done through our future European Neighbourhood Policy instruments.
This type of support will allow us to combine contacts with middle-ranking officials to reduce the self-isolation of Belarus; cooperation with NGOs; and support directly benefiting the population, for example in the health sector, the environment or in the Chernobyl-affected area.
The current TV and radio programmes being broadcast to Belarus and supported by the European Community are an important contribution to democratisation and to the visibility of the European Union in Belarus.
It is important that we get across to the Belarusian population both the considerable financial effort made by the EU and the potential benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Through our assistance we will be keen to foster people-to-people contacts and we will seek maximum flexibility within the limits of our financial rules.
Â Â  . Madam President, todayâs debate is important.
The decision to include this item on the agenda reflects very positively on the European Parliament.
The speech made by the Commissioner today also reflects well on the European Commission.
It seems that, for the first time in a long while, Parliament and the Commission are speaking the same language.
This is a very good sign.
The Belarusians are expecting an expression of political solidarity from us.
This is something for which Aleksander Milinkevich appealed when he made an appearance before Parliament a few months ago.
He met Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana and was acknowledged as a democratic partner by the political leaders of the European Union.
Political solidarity is not just about making political declarations but also involves the need to revise the policies of our Union.
This far-reaching revision process should aim to isolate the authorities in power without isolating Belarusian society.
It should aim to support Belarusian society without supporting the authorities.
This House has long called for the actions taken by the Union to be intelligent and to introduce only those sanctions which will affect the regimeâs officials, those responsible for the infringement of civil rights and democratic freedoms.
We call for the list of those who are banned from entering the EU to be significantly extended.
As the European Parliament delegation to Belarus, we have submitted the relevant document to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and Mr Solana.
It is also very important to open the gates of the European Union to those Belarusians who cannot find a place in their own country, and it is vital to include the youth of Belarus who are currently excluded from universities for taking part in peace demonstrations in a special grant programme in the EU Member States.
We owe this to our Belarusian partners.
Â Â  . Madam President, if we look back to last Sunday, I think it is quite clear that the only fitting response to the elections that day in Belarus is one of emphatic condemnation.
Those elections were not free, they were not fair and the situation was, if anything, worse than it was during the presidential elections four years ago.
I think it is also right and proper that the European Union should spell this out quite clearly and let our public know that we do not accept that a dictatorship should continue its grip on that country through elections of that kind.
That, of course, begs the question what we should do next.
I share Mr Klichâs view that we need to look into how we can go on extending what we call smart sanctions.
We believe it makes no sense to develop sanctions that affect the people of that country; the most important thing we should do for them is to see if we can help raise awareness or make more room for pluralism in that country.
I think that the Council and Commission need to make it clear how that regime, after these elections, is to be characterised, and that we should use the same harsh words to describe it as the US.
At least, there is then no doubt as to what we think of it.
I think that we should also look into the option of extending the role of the High Representative.
Why not, indeed, appoint a special EU representative for Belarus?
As Mr Winkler said a moment ago, one core issue is, of course, the relationship with Russia.
It is all well and good to have 40 signatures under an EU declaration â very good indeed â but one signature is missing.
That signature is at the bottom of a telegram which Mr Putin sent Mr Lukashenko as early as Sunday, I believe, to congratulate him once again on the fantastic outcome, in which Mr Putin expresses the hope that he, together with Mr Lukashenko, can work on both countriesâ further democratic development.
That is the situation we are facing.
I hope that these issues will be raised at the G8 summit, but also maybe, and mainly, in the framework of the regular consultation between the European Union and Russia.
I think it is of crucial importance for the EU to join forces with neighbouring countries such as Ukraine, but also with the United States, in order to further develop policy with a view to bringing about change in the country in question.
I also think that a more visible policy on our part would pay off at the moment.
There has been so much media attention in all our countries about these elections that we should make use of the momentum it has created.
Finally, we will be holding a more extensive debate on this issue in Strasbourg in two weeksâ time, where we may be able to discuss in greater detail the action that the European Union could take, and so I would like to ask the Council one thing, and that is to present a sound programme and sound proposals to support the opposition and civil society in that country.
I think that is really important: to look for more ways of giving the opposition the support that it needs and deserves, and it is probably the only way of securing change in that country.
I take Mr Winklerâs view: winter cannot last forever in Minsk.
Â Â  . Madam President, the Council and Commission have indicated their intention to enter into consultation about those sanctions and measures, and rightly so.
I am quite frankly astonished that a plan of attack has not been prepared beforehand.
After all, Belarusâ present plight does not come as a surprise to anyone.
Many examples of possible sanctions and measures have already been put forward, and I give my wholehearted support to such schemes as extending the visa ban for government representatives, flexible policy with low-cost visa for ordinary Belarusian citizens, freezing foreign assets, a better harmonisation of the European financial programmes to fit in with Belarusâ specific situation, and the list goes on.
Something that still, I think, remains underexposed, is Russiaâs role in this whole affair, to which Mr Wiersma referred briefly just now.
What is even more important is the role which the EU can, and indeed should, play in this connection.
Just to remind you, Mr Putin congratulated Mr Lukashenko on his victory without as much as batting an eyelid.
By doing so, he simply showed his disdain for the interim OSCE conclusions, and it is he who continues to oil the wheels of Belarusâ economy with cheap supplies of raw materials.
Is it not about time the Council and Commission entered into constructive dialogue with Putin?
The President-in-Office of the Council said a moment ago that he takes it as read that a number of issues will be thrashed out in contacts with Russia.
This may be a noble attempt, but not quite good enough yet.
Surely it cannot be considered acceptable that Putin should continue his policy straight-faced and congratulate Lukashenko, while human rights are still blatantly being violated.
Or are we at risk, by adopting a stance that is totally clear, of creating a conflict with different priorities, such as securing the European energy supplies?
It would be worth a lot to me if our own interests did not hijack the ideals on which the EU is based.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, the matter of primary importance as far as I am concerned is that the message is clear, that is, the message from all the European institutions that these elections were a farce.
There is no credible proof of MrÂ Lukashenkoâs claim to have won the election.
He has held on to power by means of fraud.
That is the truth of the matter.
The people are being taken in less and less by this deception; otherwise, tens of thousands of them would not have assembled in October Square on the evening of Sundayâs elections in spite of threats by PresidentÂ Lukashenko and the secret services.
These people in October Square are our great hope in Belarus, and so I should like to extend a very special greeting to them from this House, as they are our future partners.
For this reason, our top priority is to recognise these people as partners, support their democratic activities and ensure that, if they are arrested, a visa ban is imposed on those who arrest them.
After all, these people are doing nothing more than exercising their democratic right to freedom of expression and manifesting their desire to live in a democracy.
I should also like to raise the subject of Russia once more.
It is imperative to put the issue of how to proceed as regards Belarus on the agenda of the forthcoming G8 Summit as a special item.
Anyone who continues to blindly support Belarus and PresidentÂ Lukashenko cannot be a serious partner for the EU.
Belarus is standing in the way of a good relationship between Russia and the EU, which means that this has to be discussed.
I expect the Presidency to report to us on how these talks have gone.
This is the only way to take a step forward and to support those holding out in October Square.
Â Â  . Madam President, there is something amazingly optimistic in the fact that today, in this House, representatives of diverse political groups are all speaking with the same voice.
It is a good example of what European solidarity is all about and it shows that all those present here, or at least the overwhelming majority, award the same importance to basic standards in relation to human rights and civil rights, which are currently being so brutally abused in Belarus.
I would like to add my voice to those here today who have so strongly emphasised that President Lukashenkoâs regime and all events currently occurring in Belarus would be impossible if the dictator himself did not feel that he had the support of influential patrons and powerful friends in the Kremlin.
We have to realise that the key to solving the situation in Belarus is not to be found only in Belarus itself, but also lies in persuading the Russian authorities that we, as citizens of the European Union, regard the situation just beyond the Eastern border of the European Union as not acceptable under any circumstances.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention an issue which has so far not come up in this debate as we have, of course, been discussing the crimes related to the elections which took place a few days ago in Belarus.
However, we should remember that there is an aspect of continuity to the problem of human rights abuses in Belarus and that the problem is not only related to the electoral process.
I would like to call for more action on the part of the European Union, not only in the field of human rights in the sense of electoral rights, but also in the promotion of freedom of information and of the media in Belarus.
This is because President Lukashenkoâs regime also remains in power due to the fact that it simply deceives the citizens.
Â Â  Madam President, Belarus unexpectedly woke up to statehood in 1991.
It has had a terrible history, suffering particularly badly from the fallout from Chernobyl.
Indeed, I was one of the authors of an amendment in the last Parliament to increase the funding to help the children who are still suffering the consequences of the radioactivity to date.
Belarus is now saddled with a paranoid, self-isolating dictator, Mr Lukashenko.
I described the country as the âCuba of Europeâ.
Mr Lukashenko has no time for fair and free elections.
He goes through the charade only.
He believes in the Stalinist saying that it does not matter how the voting is conducted, but who controls the count.
Bizarrely, Mr Lukashenko may even have had sufficient popular support â 55Â to 60% â to have won the vote in a free election.
However, that was not enough for a man like him: he wanted a much larger margin of a majority as a dictator, because he would fear that, if he were to become more unpopular, next time round there would be no comfort zone in which to retreat back to 55% or 60%.
Regrettably, Russia, under Mr Putin, supplies gas to Belarus at USDÂ 50 per thousand cubic metres and the Belarus economy is rosy enough for Mr Lukashenko to be able to buy the votes of pensioners, the military, the police and all the apparatus of the state.
Fortunately, the young are more cynical and I salute the courage of all those who have taken to the streets in protest and faced the brutality and the wrath of the militia and the KGB under Mr Lukashenko.
At the end of the day, Mr Lukashenko should be considered a pariah in the West and travel bans and financial assets must be tightened up on all the members of the regime: they must be frozen.
We must support their civil society and their NGOs and we need a very special and generously funded visitorsâ programme in the European Union to bring students, journalists and members of civil society â the movers and shakers and the opinion formers â over to our Parliament to see how democracy really works in action.
Â Â  â Thank you Madam President.
The brave people in October Square are writing their countryâs history.
They are doing this because they are breaking down the wall of fear and apathy which was reigning in Belarus.
This is a huge slap in the face for those who do not believe in democracy.
And they are risking everything: their job, their studies, their family, their lives.
In spite of the threats, since last Sunday the courageous youths of October Square were able to hold a daily vigil of courage, a vigil which will go on until next Saturday at the least.
We insist that no violence is used against these people.
For us this will be unacceptable.
A number of these young people have been expelled from university because they are demonstrating.
Now we must show in practice the solidarity which we have been talking about for so long.
If things do not improve, we have to give these young people a place to study in European universities here among us.
The words we have been uttering for so long have to become facts.
The signal has been given and the writing is on the wall for those who want to read it.
Nobody is deluding himself by anything.
However, from now on, the question will be who is going to be able to resist longer.
We cannot come up with excuses.
We cannot hide behind bureaucratic or diplomatic obstacles in order to come to the help of these democratic forces.
The initiative of broadcasting to this country is a good step in the right direction, but frankly, I do not know what has become of it.
Apart from that, we must not shirk our responsibility simply because we took this initiative.
What is happening in Belarus is our business because it is happening at home.
Thank you.
Â Â  We have known for years what this dictator has been doing beyond our Eastern borders.
What we have had trouble with, however, is answering the question of what we should do about it.
The period of political helplessness passed when this Parliament seized the initiative, particularly during the present term.
I am certain that the House has performed a historic service in this respect.
Today, however, we have to fight the helplessness shown by Europe and by the free world with respect to practical actions.
In the short term, we have to extend significantly the list of people not welcome on European Union soil.
In the medium term, we have to find effective methods of supporting civic forces, first and foremost the media.
Breaking the information blockade is a matter of considerable significance when it comes to rebuilding faith in an alternative path for development in Belarus.
We have to enhance our actions in this field.
The first steps have already been taken, but they must be considered only as initial steps.
Most importantly, in the long term Belarusians also have to feel that these steps will lead somewhere.
We have to open the way for them to the West and offer them real European prospects.
Without this, the Belarusians will never believe that they can break free from the grip of one dictator or another.
Without this prospect, Lukashenkoâs regime will pass but his place will be taken by someone else who will enforce Russiaâs policy of rebuilding its sphere of influence in the region.
There is no third way for this part of Europe.
I, as a Pole, know this only too well.
Â Â  The results of the presidential elections in Belarus were anticipated.
The outcome reflects the use of violence, fraud and mass arrest, in other words, gross violations of the basic rules that govern free and democratic elections.
How will the situation evolve now, after the elections?
It looks as if one chapter in the struggle for democracy in Belarus has come to a close, but we must not remain inactive.
People have been protesting on the streets of Minsk for five days now.
What can we in the European Parliament and the European Union do under the circumstances?
Firstly, we must not accept the election results.
This means we must reject, ignore and isolate the Belarus president from the rest of the world.
Secondly, the European Union and the European Parliament must henceforth unambiguously support only the democratic opposition forces and citizens' associations, or civil society, as has already been suggested here.
This support should be expressed not only in moral terms but should be specific and include financial assistance.
Integrating Belarus opposition parties into European party structures might also be an effective step.
The SMK [Hungarian Coalition Party] in Slovakia set a good example in signing an agreement with the Belarus National Front and the United Civic Party last year, and at the same time, the SMK is advancing this issue within the PPE-DE.
As a result, the two parties will be given the status of PPE-DE observer members at the Congress to be held in Rome next week.
Thirdly, the European Union, particularly the Commission, should draw up a new strategy that is clear, more effective and more consistent.
We must not allow EU financial support to be channelled through the Lukashenko administration where we have no control over how it is used.
The Slovak Republic is in favour of stricter and tougher procedures.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union must not leave Lukashenko alone and revert to a âbusiness as usualâ policy â as the most important trading partner of Belarus, the EU has in fact been contributing in no small measure to the preservation of this regime.
Â Â  â The recent events in Belarus have made two things clear: firstly, that it is necessary to fundamentally review and concretise the European Union's strategy on Belarus as quickly as possible, and the positive sprouting of an awakening civil society should appease neither the European Union's leaders, nor the parliaments and governments of its Member States.
The wave of repressions will not abate, but increase; therefore, the first object is to protect the forces opposed to the regime and their leaders from repression.
Such a concrete, binding strategy should be upheld by the parliaments and governments of all European Union Member States, not just those which share borders with Belarus.
Secondly, having isolated the regime's leadership, we must use all means possible to strengthen informational support for the Belarusian people, develop existing contacts and establish new ones with all levels of civil society: the business community, academics, people involved in the arts and culture and journalists.
I believe that a successful, concrete example has already been shown by Lithuania, which has given refuge to what used to be the only free university in Belarus, but which was later sent into exile.
Offering young people in Belarus such study opportunities in higher education establishments and European Union universities is without doubt the priority of a common European Union strategy like this.
Â Â  Madam President, I was a member of the European Parliament delegation which never went to Belarus.
I took on the challenge.
I was stopped at the border and witnessed the whole ridiculous scene; the absurdness of the train waiting for an hour at the Polish-Belarusian border, the people looking on in horror then crossing the border, terrified.
Looking at the officials inspecting passports, I was reminded of the Communist era.
It was as if I was watching a film from those times.
I saw petty smugglers.
The border on the River Bug is a ridiculous Berlin Wall and we are quite right in saying that the authorities should be isolated.
However, so that we can build bridges, I would appeal for us not to isolate Belarusian society, the young people, the students, the journalists, the academics and the people working for NGOs who are already discriminated against in Belarus.
We need bridges that will allow Belarusians to feel that they are Europeans, and to understand that they could and should take part in upholding values such as democracy and freedom.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, I am really very much obliged to the House for its unanimous, strong and impressive support for our endeavours and those of the Commission.
We are all thinking along the same lines, and we must now find efficient ways of both holding the regime responsible for the situation, for the conduct of the elections, and supporting those who want to bring about change.
We all agree on this.
Naturally, we intend to follow many of the recommendations made here.
Since I cannot go into detail on all the points raised, I should like to discuss those that I find particularly interesting in this context.
MrÂ Klich reminded the House that Alexander Milinkevich visited Parliament; I should like to point out that MrÂ Milinkevich has also visited the Council â at all events, 14Â Foreign Ministers were present for that discussion, which was held within the framework of a Council meeting, and there, too, we made very clear the depth of our admiration for the courage of the opposition and the strength of our support.
Several speakers here have mentioned restrictive measures, or sanctions.
That is exactly what we need now.
Visa restrictions are already in place, and these restrictive measures must now be extended.
MrsÂ Schroedter said that a visa ban should be imposed on everyone responsible, and that is exactly what we need.
That is also the reason why â even though, naturally, scenarios have already been considered in the past â we are only now able to take specific measures: because we now know exactly who is responsible for the situation in Belarus and which names should appear on the list of visa restrictions â although a detailed analysis is still required.
As many speakers have said, at the same time, we must find ways of offering assistance to people who wish to travel abroad, to visit our countries, to broaden their minds, to see how democracy works.
I am also much obliged to CommissionerÂ KovÃ¡cs for taking a specific stance on the measures planned by the Commission, as it will also be important that the Commission, with our full support, develop credible, coherent programmes.
Smart sanctions have been mentioned.
Indeed, that is exactly what we need, although, to be quite honest, I must say that it is often easier said than done to find exactly the kind of measures that do not hit the wrong people.
Attention has also been drawn to the EU observers who were denied access.
That is a most regrettable state of affairs.
I should like to point out that the Presidency declaration on the situation in Belarus that was issued yesterday expressly deplored the non-admittance of EU observers, including Members of the European Parliament.
That only goes to prove the depth of the fear of allowing free parliamentarians into the county.
It is indeed our duty to support the young people, civil society, those people who are still holding out despite sub-zero temperatures, and we shall join with the Commission in seeking ways of doing so.
MrÂ KamiÅski mentioned the free media, which play a most important role.
That is indeed important.
We all know from past experience â and, as an Austrian, I am in a particularly good position to judge â the importance of the role played by independent radio and television in our neighbours Hungary and Czechoslovakia at one time.
In the present day, too, we must ensure that those interested in doing so have the opportunity to receive news free from censorship and control.
We shall endeavour to do that.
Â Â  . Madam President, the European Union is certainly a community of shared values, a community of democratic countries.
Consequently, we have to make it explicitly clear that we do not accept the repressive regime of President Lukashenko; the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms; the violation of the election campaign rights of the registered opposition candidates and the arrest of members of the opposition and peaceful demonstrators.
Policy declarations are important, but they are certainly not enough.
We therefore have to introduce and maintain sanctions that clearly reflect our position.
We should avoid economic sanctions at large that would hit the population.
Our sanctions should be precisely targeted against those responsible for the fraudulent elections and for the survival of the repressive regime in Belarus.
Such sanctions could include, for example, the extension of the visa ban or the freezing of assets in the Member States.
Parallel to the sanctions and the increase of support to civil society and the democratic forces in the country, we have to encourage and facilitate people-to-people contacts by, for instance, waiving visa fees on an ad hoc basis.
We also have to support NGOs.
We are aware of the problem that, according to our rules, support can only be granted to officially registered NGOs, but the Commission has found a solution to this.
We now agree to fund NGOs which are registered outside Belarus, but which work for the benefit of the country and its people.
The debate here was quite encouraging.
It shows that Members of the European Parliament, the Presidency â i.e. the Member States â and the Commission are following the same line.
By following the same line and working in close cooperation, we will finally promote democratic changes in Belarus.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party, I should like to express my support for the protests against the vote rigging in the Belarusian elections, in which President Lukashenko was re-elected under questionable circumstances.
I confirm my full support for the demonstrators in Minsk: thousands of young people have been peacefully demonstrating in the squares for days and, amid numerous difficulties, they are pressing ahead with a democratic battle to build a different and better future for their country.
The aspirations of the new Belarus are a far cry from the aims of Europeâs last remaining tyrant, Alexander Lukashenko, who has cheated at the polls, threatened the opposition in the squares and made use of prisons just as Stalin did in his day.
We support the Belorussian dissidents, isolated, cold, battered and humiliated as they are, in their struggle to claim back a future characterised by freedom and justice in this corner of the USSR, too.
The hands of time must begin moving again in Minsk, as they have elsewhere.
Â Â  It is laudable that the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament are speaking with one voice on the issue of Belarus and that they are doing this so forcefully for the first time.
The situation in Belarus is serious enough for the Council and the Commission, as well as the Members of the European Parliament, to condemn the Russian acceptance of and support for the undemocratic regime of Aleksander Lukashenko.
We cannot be lenient with respect to Russia's position at any cost.
We have to be honest and admit that the institutions of the European Union waited too long and reacted too slowly to events in Belarus.
The actions taken were slow and were not effective, not only because we did not want to annoy President Putin or because of the limited scope and resources for action, but also because of what MrÂ Onyszkiewicz mentioned, namely the lengthy procedures and inappropriate channelling of the funds spent.
It is the Commission's job to spend the funds earmarked for aid to Belarus appropriately and the Commission must do this job more efficiently and effectively.
As Members of the European Parliament, we shall regularly ask the Commission to update us on how it is carrying out its work and whether the procedure for transferring and spending the aid has been improved.
We shall also insist on the Council and the Commission taking a stronger position in future in condemning the support shown by Russia for the last undemocratic tyrant in Europe.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0041/2006) by MrÂ Bushill-Matthews on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations (2005/2147(INI)).
Â Â  .
Madam President, I welcome the priority given to this issue by the Commissioner. This priority is recognised and supported by all political groups in Parliament.
The fact that there were over 200Â amendments at the committee stage for what was and is an own-initiative report, is hopefully seen as a reflection of their priority and not entirely down to the inadequacy of the rapporteur in the first place.
I wish to begin by thanking colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, especially the shadow rapporteurs for their important input.
I should like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality â with whom we had enhanced cooperation, both officially and in practice â for their valuable opinions and for the many ideas they have also contributed to this report.
However, one direct consequence of all this is that the report is too long: a tribute perhaps to our collective enthusiasm.
I hope, with the support of colleagues in the vote today, that we can make it a little shorter.
However, the thrust of the report should remain clear: the challenges of an ageing population, with more people living much longer, with more older people who are inactive and need the support of others, and more older people who are active and need to support themselves, are not just problems for the elderly, but for society as a whole.
The challenges of a declining birth rate, with fewer people of working age, who are mathematically unable to fund the larger number of pensioners; with many parents who want to have more children grappling with the pressures of combining work and family life, but who are mathematically unable to make ends meet. These are not just problems for young people, these too are problems for society as a whole.
They are challenges for governments; they are challenges for businesses.
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions, but, as they say in the X-Files: the truth is out there!
There are many different ideas around and different experiences to draw upon, not just in the European Union.
A number of thoughts and pointers are in this report.
We now need minds to open, but, above all, we need action to follow these ideas through.
I hope the Commissioner feels that this report reflects not only his own priority but also his own personal sense of urgency, and that all will agree that the real work starts now.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality for their report, which is truly inspiring.
I am delighted at the support that Parliament has expressed for our Green Paper.
Parliamentâs report has come at the right time to provide a boost to the work of the Commission in respect of the new communication on demographics, since we will be finalising this communication over the next few weeks, and the timing therefore allows us to make use of your report in a very practical way.
The report includes a number of highly important points that merit a place in the new communication, which draws conclusions from the responses we received to our Green Paper and from impact studies financed through the pilot action which the European Parliament organised.
It sets out the possibilities for continuing cooperation at a European level over demographic issues.
Ladies and gentlemen, in recent times Europe has achieved some extraordinary successes.
I would like to state this unequivocally, so that we may bear it in mind.
The demographic ageing of our society is an outcome of this success in respect of two of the corners of the population pyramid and two locations on the pyramid.
Average life expectancy has increased through the enormous advances in medicine, which have, for example, largely overcome cardiovascular diseases, thereby making a significant contribution to average life expectancy for middle-aged persons.
Thanks to major medical advances in the area of child care and peri-natal care, the figures for child and infant mortality have fallen to levels never before seen in history and probably unexpected up to even a few decades ago.
This is an unquestionable success.
In a manner of speaking, we now enjoy twice as much life as our forbears.
And I was delighted to discover, during the course of discussions with the insurance companies, that they are now working from mortality tables that go up not to 80, but to 120 years.
This success has its consequences, of course, since demographic ageing alters our entire society across all areas.
It is important to realise that a holistic response is required, an integrated and all-inclusive response.
Demographic ageing goes beyond the issues of pension systems, health, education, urban planning and so on. In fact, I doubt whether we could find any area of human activity that is not affected by demographic ageing, including the armed forces.
We must therefore strive to ensure that active ageing becomes a reality.
We must develop our care services for children and the elderly.
We must develop new products and services in order to respond better to the needs of ageing individuals, and of course the needs of a society that will be ageing overall, as its age profile alters.
We must finally invest more in developing and retaining our human capital in such a way that we achieve high levels of employment and enable the elderly to remain active in the workforce for longer.
In the responses to the Green Paper consultations, especially in the responses of the Member States, great emphasis was placed on the need for better harmonisation of our private, family and professional lives.
It is already the case that migrants are reversing patterns of demographic decline in some Member States.
In order to have a truly beneficial effect, migration must go hand in hand with greater efforts at integration and overcoming differences.
Despite all of this, ladies and gentlemen, it remains clear that the migrants on whom we are counting as a permanent feature of our societies in the future do not represent the answer to the problems of demographic ageing.
They are one of the components, but they should never be regarded as the solution.
I would like to mention some of the issues that should be included in our programme of work over the coming years.
We would like to renew our focus on harmonising family and professional life, as it is clear that European citizens want to have more children than they currently have.
And in order for their natural longings and wishes to be fulfilled, we must in my view take a profound look at our society as a whole, our habits, our ways of doing things and the practices we employ.
We would like to set up a European forum on population and demographics, enabling us to understand better the various aspects involved in incorporating a demographic dimension into individual policies, and supported by recognised experts in the field as well as voluntary organisations.
In 2007 the Commission will be presenting a report on the measures taken by Member States to incorporate into their national legislation the provisions of Directive 2007/78/EC relating to age discrimination.
Every two years, coinciding with the plenary sittings of the forum, the Commission will publish a report on population and demographics in Europe, which will describe demographic trends in Europe in the context of developments worldwide.
Ladies and gentlemen, the added value of Europe consists largely in organising the exchange of information, comparing proven approaches and presenting and disseminating the resulting data.
We are already doing this in many areas, especially those areas relating to the Lisbon Strategy.
Ladies and gentlemen, demographic developments are changing our society. They have changed it throughout history and will continue to do so in the future.
Our society is becoming technically older in demographic terms, but we can also say with certainty that it is becoming wiser, as wisdom is related to experience and is in all societies a characteristic of those who have enjoyed good fortune, living long enough to have the opportunity to draw on their experiences.
In our debates I feel that we shall find ways to respond to the challenges arising from the enormous success of our society in prolonging life and raising the quality of life, and we shall do it in such a way that future generations will follow the course that we plot, a course that will involve a more profound sense of the quality of life, the human dimension and the social values that we all cherish.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to MrÂ Bushill-Matthews for his excellent report.
I would say to CommissionerÂ Å pidla that, personally, I would gladly live for 120Â years.
I need to reach 116 to break even on my pension scheme.
I am surprised that the Green Paper on demographic change does not take greater account of health aspects.
The problems of an ageing society are not limited to economic aspects.
New syndromes are coming to the fore, as can already be seen: dementia â be it Alzheimerâs disease or subcortical dementia â vascular disease, from coronary heart disease to renal insufficiency, metabolic diseases â diabetes, first and foremost â arthritis of the spine and the large joints, and osteoporosis, to name but a few.
This makes it all the more a question of prevention, of ensuring good living conditions for all before treatment and, if treatment should be necessary, of ensuring that this is as good as possible for all Europeans.
It is a case of maintaining both quality of life and mobility.
We need social reorientation in order to meet these challenges.
Retirement now comprises one third of the human lifespan.
We need meaningful employment, social tasks, fulfilling tasks for older people, barrier-free living, new forms of housing, and, if necessary, excellent nursing care and medical care.
However, I would take issue with the implicit and unreflective assumption in the Green Paper that a decline in population would have exclusively negative consequences for the established social system.
I should therefore like to see the following issues addressed: the extent to which the negative consequences of a population decline may be addressed by innovation, higher rates of employment and modernisation of social protection; whether there may also be positive aspects to the decline in population, for example on issues relating to the environment, traffic congestion and land development; and whether a âPareto optimumâ for Europeâs population size may ultimately be established.

Â Â  â I should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his excellent report and on the cooperation that we established in the process of drafting our respective reports.
In 2003, the natural growth of Europeâs population was 0.04%.
Between 2005 and 2030 it is forecast that some 20 million people will be lost.
By 2025, the population of the EU is expected to grow slightly, due to immigration, but then to fall again.
Immigration is only a partial solution.
Europeans do not have the number of children they want.
Studies show that they would like to have 2.3 children on average, but they only have 1.5.
This figure is too low for the population to be reinstated.
Among the reasons for the low birth rate are: belated or unstable access to employment; difficulty of access to housing; the late age at which parents are having their first child; a lack of tax incentives and family benefits; inadequate parental leave; lack of day-care facilities for children and other dependent persons; the salary gap between men and women; and the difficulty of reconciling family and working life.
According to demographics expert Phillip Longman, in Europe it is conservative Christians and Muslims who are having more children, and this will lead to changes in the make-up of society.
What can be done to redress the situation?
Phillip Longman makes some suggestions: Sweden has succeeded in increasing its birth rates by raising social benefits and by building day-care centres and crÃšches.
In Italy, it would be helpful if securing a loan to buy oneâs own house were made easier, as it is currently very difficult to do so.
One thing is certain: in most Member States there is a strong correlation between high rates of female employment and high birth rates, and vice versa.
Â Â  . Mr President, in the words of Commissioner Å pidla, demographic change is not only a topical issue, but also one of the biggest challenges facing Europe today.
That is why the report from Philip Bushill-Matthews is both timely and highly relevant.
The problem with politicians nowadays is that we only think in five-year time frames.
It is not seen as politically expedient to deal with matters that will have a dramatic impact on our lives ten or twenty years down the line.
Indeed, in the past few months I have been chairing a PPE-DE working group dealing with specific aspects of demographic change.
We have come up with some fairly useful conclusions on the issue.
First of all, in the field of demography and the family, Europe should not resign itself to a decline in its population.
Improving the overall situation for children and for young people and enhancing the compatibility of work and family life for men and women, combined with tax incentives, could have a significant impact on birth rates.
Secondly, it is clear that more choice and flexibility in the labour market is needed in Europe.
In this respect we should enhance the participation in the workforce of women, young people and older people, by providing new opportunities through, for instance, flexibility of working hours, the promotion of part-time jobs and autonomous work.
The education systems need to be reformed in order to increase the efficiency and pace of higher education, thus enabling an earlier entry into working life.
Thirdly, skilled workers from third countries should be attracted, but according to our working group, we should not consider immigration as a single solution to Europeâs future demographic and labour market problems.
Immigrants have to possess talents and skills that Europe is short of and must be prepared to integrate themselves into our societies and accept our common values.
In order to be able to face the challenge of demographic change and sustain an ever-changing society, we need to ensure the determined implementation of the Lisbon Agenda.
The status quo is not an option.
To develop and thrive, Europe needs â to use one of Mr Barrosoâs buzz words â âflexicurityâ and innovation.
Security and flexibility of the labour market will enable us to respond to the challenges of globalisation.
To achieve this we need to reform our pension systems and concentrate on growth and jobs by introducing innovative measures to support the birth rate and by a judicious use of immigration.
Only through innovation, through re-inventing ourselves, can we be sure that the challenge of demographic change will become tomorrowâs opportunity for growth.
Â Â  . â There is no doubt about the importance of the issue before us.
A large proportion of Europe is getting older.
With rare exceptions, birth rates are low.
Various social protection, solidarity and social security mechanisms have seen their sustainability come under threat.
Immigration from countries outside Europe has apparently made it possible to balance activity rates in some Member States, but there are social consequences in terms of social integration and family support that must be taken into account.
The debate on demographic challenges has gained fresh urgency, with the advent of the recent Scandinavian implementation of the European Social model.
It is very important to combine increased productivity and competitiveness benefits with strong female participation in the labour market.
At the same time, birth rates have gone up and there is now more understanding when it comes to paternity leave and greater support for motherhood.
Accordingly, from a European perspective, all efforts must be channelled into reconciling working life and family life in each Member State, by negotiating more flexible working hours, and by means of more appropriate and more widespread child support infrastructure.
In addition, mutual knowledge of different social security systems must be increased and people must be given the opportunity to move freely from one national system to another, be it public, private or any other kind, for example, mutual benefit systems.
This is very important for workers who pay social security in a particular Member State, whose lives will improve on their return to their country of origin and when they move to another Member State to work.
There also needs to be a drive to modernise social protection systems.
Moreover, active ageing should be encouraged.
This is all discussed in the reports by MrÂ Bushill-Matthews, Mrs Estrela and all the members of committees working with such dedication in this area.
I should like to conclude by saying that the demographic challenges currently facing Europe are serious, but that there are ways of addressing these challenges.
Let us therefore rise to the challenge of helping to ensure greater solidarity between the generations.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his very comprehensive report on this issue of major importance throughout the EU-25, namely the challenge of demographic change and the importance of solidarity between the generations.
In essence, what the report proposes is improved quality of life for all, at all stages of life, and a recognition that policy decisions and legislation enacted should contribute to that core objective.
Because of time constraints I will briefly make just two points.
I am happy to see included in this report a recommendation to Member States to improve the provision of services of general interest in rural areas, thereby promoting an equitable balance between rural and urban living, in particular for older people.
I am also asking for support on Amendment 20, which seeks to recognise the potential of assisted-living housing.
I use as a template for this the St Brendanâs Village project in County Mayo in the west of Ireland, and the SLE Habitat Extra Care scheme in Lille in France.
In a report produced by the European Liaison Committee for Social Housing to mark the United Nations Year of Older Persons, one of the main recommendations is that governments and service providers should help people to stay in their own communities as they get older.
According to the report, the two projects I have just named provide good examples of projects built to meet local needs.
They help keep older people in the communities where they have spent most of their lives, with the support of family, friends and services, and in familiar surroundings.
That is surely solidarity between the generations.
All of us in this House â if we are lucky enough to live long enough â will grow old.
For some of us, that is closer than for others.
However, personally, I would prefer to live independently in my community with the level of social and medical assistance that I need.
The two projects I referred to are European models of best practice in this area and could be replicated throughout the EU-25.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, alongside climate change, demographic change is probably the greatest challenge of the present day.
There are very many reasons why our birth rate is falling, with a consequent decline in future prospects for our society.
I should like to select just one aspect of this extremely complex issue: pension provision for mothers.
The work done by mothers, especially those with several children, receives far too little recognition.
One of the main problems is that most mothers from the days when mothers could not have or did not want careers because of bringing up and caring for their children are at a clear disadvantage, first in their careers and subsequently in old age.
In our affluent society, bringing up and caring for children should be given at least the same recognition as activities in the production and services sectors and should thus count fully towards pension entitlement.
The simplest, most comprehensive solution would be an unconditional basic income for all.
Â Â  . â The demographic changes taking place in the EU, are, on the whole, beneficial rather than detrimental to society.
Because of improved living standards and healthcare, life expectancy has increased. This of course creates fresh challenges, which must be addressed.
Among these challenges, which the Commission has not properly addressed in the Green Paper, are the importance of sexual and reproductive health, gender mainstreaming in all studies and policies, improving peopleâs living standards and greater economic and social inclusion and cohesion.
Consequently, in the proposals tabled by our group, the accent is placed on the need for job stability, safety in the workplace and reduced working hours, in order to ensure that younger and older workers alike can gain access to suitably paid work.
This will enable workers to have more time to devote to the family, to support their children and to pursue their own lifelong learning.
The main priorities as regards managing demographic change are jobs with rights, fairer income distribution, strong public social security based on solidarity between generations, and high-quality public services, in particular in areas such as health, education, housing and social protection.
In other words, what we are proposing is to reverse the current trend of prioritising competition and liberalism, increasingly precarious and poorly paid work, unemployment, privatisation of public services and the trampling of labour rights.
We therefore stress the need for a sea change in these policies.
Â Â  . Mr President, in 1981 in Ireland I heard a lecture by DrÂ Herbert Ratner, a professor of public health and medical ethics.
In it he described the demography of continental western Europe. He accurately predicted the pattern we now see of birth-rate freefall by the year 2000 and the terminal decline of population by 2020, which is now inevitable.
In this lecture Dr Ratner warned his Irish listeners to continue to choose life and, among the many benefits this brings, avoid the demographic suicide of our European neighbours.
We chose life two years later in a referendum to protect the life of the human person from conception to natural death.
Irelandâs birth rate is now falling, but we delayed the trend by 20 years and, although today we are just below replacement, we still have the healthiest birth rate, the youngest workforce and the strongest economy in the EU.
As the Commissionâs Green Paper on demography states, there is no economic growth without population growth.
I can think of many good reasons for the EU to embrace the culture of life, the dignity of the human person and God.
But, if for no other reason than economic growth and a viable future for Europe, we should rethink our attitude to the sanctity of life, to the position of the family and to support for mothers and other carers.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent work.
For my part, the issues that I wish to highlight are the two major challenges facing us: firstly, an ageing population for whom we want to ensure the best possible, dignified old age and, secondly, a low birth rate.
We want the right balance to be restored in our continent between the expectations of women and those of our countries.
In order to tackle the first challenge, two policies need to be followed.
The first is to do away with any disincentive to extend a personâs working life, and therefore to endorse all policies designed to enable elderly people to remain directly involved in the job market for as long as possible.
The second policy is to give the elderly the opportunity to remain within their communities for as long as possible.
All social policies should be geared towards this objective: to remain in the family environment and in the surroundings of oneâs own home, with residential care used only as a last resort.
As regards birth-rate policy, I believe that, as always in life, it helps to have concrete evidence.
It must be pointed out that, over the last few years, it was those very countries that took an intelligent approach to drafting new tax policies that went on to obtain good results; one interesting example is France.
New tax policies, extensive employment opportunities for women, the opportunity to enter the job market and undoubtedly a new and different quality of services are therefore needed.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that demographic change represents one of the greatest challenges of the present day for all the Member States of the EU.
However, demographic change should also be seen as an opportunity to achieve a new solidarity across the generations, which guarantees young people a good education, creates jobs for all and enables people to grow old with dignity.
A very important step towards this would be to introduce impact on demographic change into the mainstream of all policy fields at both national and European level.
That should also hold true for the work of the Commission.
Furthermore, this is another field in which we should learn more from one another, and intensify the exchange of experiences not only among governments but also among the social partners.
These make a vital contribution to the distinguishing feature of the European social model, namely social solidarity.
That is why I welcome the call for Member States to enter into new partnerships with the social partners, and also the call for the social partners to be consulted without delay on the balance between family and working life.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there can be no serious discussion on demographic change if people are regarded as economic factors rather than individuals; yet, in my opinion, both the Commission Green Paper and the present report by MrÂ Bushill-Matthews make that very error.
I also feel that the discussion should consider demographic change as a global issue.
It is evident that neither the Millennium Development Goals nor the fight against world poverty feature even remotely in our debate on demographic change.
After all, the main problem is not that the European population is declining, but that, firstly, this is disproportional from region to region; secondly, coexistence in society is at risk; and, thirdly, we are not relating demographic change in Europe to the exploding world population.
We are looking at the ageing of European society almost exclusively from the point of view of the dwindling workforce and, in the process, completely disregarding the development of productivity.
At the same time, we are exploiting productivity as a means to cut social, sickness, health and pension benefits and to consider prolonging working life greatly.
I am referring here only to the study prepared and published by the Commission, which envisages 71 years.
I call for a change in priorities.
We need a child-friendly society, which actually welcomes living with children.
We need a different kind of debate, as we cannot just see children as an investment to safeguard labour and pension provision.
Furthermore, we cannot continue simply seeking a better reconciliation of working life and family life, of working time and leisure time.
We need to concern ourselves with something more: with the children, for it is they who are important here.
Children must really be central, and must be regarded as individuals.
Naturally, society also needs to meet the challenges of ageing, for example by means of expanding social services or, of course, by means of urban development: for example, old peopleâs housing, and transport designed with children and the elderly in mind.
This issue is much more multifaceted than we think.
Â Â  Mr President, you do not need to be an economist or political scientist to figure out that the trend to want to cash in on things and the disappearance of green in our society brings with it a large number of consequences.
Politicians such as ourselves know â but most of the public do not â that globalisation and demographic change cause a great number of problems.
The Bushill-Matthews report tries to offer hope, and for that I offer him warm thanks.
What we should do, though, is not just to look at what the Commission says.
Whilst we must ensure that the birth rate goes up, it is not up to us politicians, but parents, to ensure children get born.
What politicians have to do is to create a child-friendly society, a society in which children are not a burden, but an additional benefit.
That also means that we must ensure that people can look after children properly.
That has implications for flexibility on the labour market, flexibility all through life and flexibility in working hours.
That is where we politicians come in again.
If we want to create a good and fair society in which both young and old people can function, which is what we need, we must also ensure that legislation is child-friendly at European, but certain also national, level.
Â Â  â Ladies and gentlemen, rapporteur. Mr Bushill-Matthews has prepared a much-needed report.
If we continue to occupy ourselves merely with everyday politics, Europe will be hit by a demographic and social catastrophe on the scale of the Asian tsunami.
The sustainability of the European way of life is under threat.
The younger generation works long days for a pittance, causing physical and mental weariness.
What is presented as their free choice is actually forced upon them by the âwinner takes allâ society.
Wage slavery or unemployment, climbing the career ladder or having the door slammed in your face â these are the choices faced by our highly qualified young people.
When, in spite of the law, a person works 12 hours a day and more, neither flexible working hours nor longer opening hours in the sales and services sector can help.
There is simply no time for private life or having children.
From the macroeconomic point of view, this arises from the need to finance the older generationâs anticipated pensions and medical treatment, which is becoming increasingly expensive.
This report should just be a starting point.
Maintaining the high standard of living in Europe requires politicians to do a lot of extra work, and to act quickly.
Thank you for your attention.
Â Â  âMr President, the rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his attention to detail and heightened sensitivity and who has patiently prepared this report, has quite rightly highlighted possible solutions to the demographic problem, starting with the means of decisively addressing low economic growth and high rates of unemployment.
A varied approach is advocated, depending on the circumstances, which â as is rightly emphasised â must respect freedom of choice and facilitate the exercise of the fundamental human right of European families to have as many children as they wish, without the obstacles raised by the difficulty of combining a professional and family life.
Identifying these obstacles and those which exist both inside and outside the workplace (such as taxation, housing and the cost of education, health and insurance) is the responsibility of the Member States, given that the Member States alone shape both development and family policy.
Historically, of course, immigration has often resolved the problem of renewing the population and today it fills the gap created by our choice to have no children or just one child at an advanced age.
What has brought us to these life choices in times of peace and opulence?
Seeking the causes of demographic change is not the concern either of the European Commission or of the governments.
It does not fall within the competences of the European Union; it falls within the competence of each European citizen who wants to go beyond his human capabilities, both in planning the beginning of life and in imposing its end.
Certainly education, training and finding work in an environment of sustainable development are necessary preconditions to a high standard of living.
However, if there is to be no demographic problem, if new Europeans are to be born and grow old under dignified conditions, future parents need of their own accord to have a demand for reliability in their personal relations and, in general, a vision of life for the present and the future.
Â Â  â As a Member of the European Parliament elected in Lithuania, I find the demographic problem particularly relevant. Namely because the number of inhabitants in Lithuania is constantly declining, not so much as a result of emigration, but rather as a result of rapid birth rate reduction, which has already led to the closure of a number of schools.
The steps taken by the Lithuanian Government to solve this problem are clearly insufficient and so the appearance of documents at European level is welcomed.
But the birth rate reduction is not just a problem for Lithuania, but for the whole of Europe, and while statistically our families have less than 1.5 children each, in Asian countries, including the European Union candidate Turkey, children are born like mushrooms after the rain.
What this could mean in the not too distant future is a theme worth contemplating.
We can and must overcome this demographic crisis through real actions and programmes. These should make it worthwhile for every family to have at least three children.
This is the precise spirit of the document presented, and once it is adopted, practical solutions should follow.
Â Â  â (Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank MrÂ Bushill-Matthews for his outstanding report.
In order to face up to the impact of demographic shock, it is usual to resort to three levers: a carefully chosen and regulated immigration policy, mobilisation of the workforce and policies aimed at families and at increasing the birth rate.
This latter kind of approach is usually left to the Member States.
It would be wrong, nonetheless, for the European Union to deny itself these resources.
Their effectiveness is well known, and the French example testifies to that: tax incentives for families, parental leave, financial assistance and, above all, the provision of child-care â out of school child care, a range of facilities for the care of very young children and care for children with disabilities.
What is more, it is important to remember that it will not be possible to massively recruit women into the labour market without proper provision for the care of their children.
Europe does not lack the means, provided that it has the political will and the financial resources.
It is therefore essential for the policy regulations for territorial cohesion to underline more strongly the need for funding for child care facilities.
At a time when the debate is raging over the nature of the European social model, children and families, with all their diversity, must be fundamental to this model.
Â Â  . Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for a debate which has shown that demography is one of the most important issues facing Europe today, and which has shed light on the issue in many ways.
I feel that we have had clear confirmation of the basic view that this is a matter of fundamental change, requiring a holistic or mainstream approach, as has been stated.
At the same time, consideration has been given to various aspects of the wider problem.
For example, it was stated that the Green Paper does not pay equal attention to two sets of problems, which is to say the problems in respect of the health sector and the problems in an international context.
You may have noted from my report that the international context is to be covered in the regular reports, since from this standpoint a specific preliminary response already exists.
The question of health is one of the most fundamental of all and I feel that the debate has inspired us to develop our thinking in this area further in the future.
This problem raises not only technical and organisational issues, but also a whole raft of ethical issues, since an ageing population will increasingly create situations where people are living in extreme circumstances through a combination of fate and their personal state of health.
This means that an appropriate ethical response will be very difficult to find, requiring a great deal of profound reflection.
I think it was also clear that one issue on which attention was focused, in my view justifiably, was the question of children and the very low birth rate and how we might change or at least influence this.
It also emerged clearly from the debate that that this was a general European question, since despite the fact that Ireland, for example, has at present the highest number of live childbirths per woman of childbearing age, it has also recorded a decline over the past 20 years sharper than just about any other country, and the current level is not sufficient to maintain demographic stability.
There are, of course, other states which are in a far worse position and where the situation might become extremely difficult within a few generations.
It is also clear that we must give very serious consideration to the fact that not every society is people friendly.
There is an old Roman saying âInter arma silent Musaeâ, in other words when society is under any kind of stress or in an extreme situation, creativity suffers.
In my view, having children is a matter of profound need and profound desire.
Educating children and caring for them is also, in its way, an activity that requires very high levels of creativity, and it is clear that European citizens, if they are to decide in favour of having children, need greater security in a world that is undergoing enormous change.
The debate also touched on questions of gender balance, in my view justifiably.
Allow me to mention one single item of information taken from a Spanish study: âin Spain men devote 52 million hours a year to taking care of dependent persons, that is to say children or elderly family members. Women devote 200 million hours a year to this type of careâ.
So the burden, which is a common one, falls very unequally, with women taking a fourfold share.
I think that these too are questions that we must examine.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the discussion and for a very concise report which shows that there is a striking tendency towards convergence in our approaches within the context of social and political thinking on Europe.
In my opinion this gives hope for a coordinated position capable of overcoming the frequently troublesome changes following elections, as five years is a very short time for many issues.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Â Â  Demographic challenges and solidarity between generations represent a complex issue having an extensive impact on our European societies.
These two are comprehensive challenges which Member States have the responsibility to address in a long-lasting, future-oriented way.
The solution should be a comprehensive, global, consistent and fair strategy encouraging understanding and lasting solidarity between the growing number of generations living side by side.
Policy solutions to the demographic challenge, like ageing, gender, labour market, pensions, migration, should give rise to a new and coherent vision of a European society.
Although there are considerable differences in the local circumstances of Member States, the challenges and targets are similar â to tackle the increasing challenge of Europeâs ageing society, bearing in mind the Lisbon targets of making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, with greater social cohesion and sustainable economic growth capacity, and more and better jobs.
Coping with demographic challenges must be a long-lasting solution which reaches even far beyond the Lisbon deadlines.
To meet these goals, complex political, economic, and social strategies are needed.
Â Â  The Member States face significant demographic challenges.
The problems and basic conditions differ, however, between one Member State and another.
Both for this reason and for democratic reasons, solutions rooted in the individual nations are required.
It makes no sense for the European Parliament to put forward detailed political recommendations expected to suit all the Member States.
The current report contains a long list of exhortations regarding the type of measures the Member States should take within important areas such as social insurances, taxes, working times and immigration.
Which routes individual Member States choose within significant specialist areas of politics must be determined through national democratic processes and not imposed from above.
Political and social progress takes place through countries experimenting and trying different solutions that can be compared.
Countries then learn from each other.
It is through such processes that European culture has developed and, in practice, conquered the world.
European solutions and ways of thinking have become successful precisely because they have come about through institutional competition between different countries rather than having been decided on centrally.
The report that is the subject of our debate constitutes a further example of the way in which, slowly but surely, the European Parliament tries to obtain ever more influence over national political issues.
I regret this process and would criticise the European Parliamentâs all but non-existent opposition to this undemocratic development.
Â Â  It is clear that if Europe is to meet its demographic challenges it must address more effectively in the future than it does today the issue of work-life balance.
If we are to attract parents of young children, the elderly or other groups who find standard ânine-to-fiveâ work impossible, we must achieve more flexible working hours, have better and more accessible childcare provisions, more family-friendly tax policies and greater equality in the workplace.
However, it is clear even if we attract more of Europeâs existing residents into the workforce we will still face skill shortages.
That is why we also need to have a balanced immigration policy.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0040/2006) by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes (2004/2259(INI)).
Â Â  . Mr President, I am delighted to be able to present my report on biofuels.
It is an own-initiative report from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
It is great to see the Commissioner here and I would like to thank her and her staff for the help they have given me while compiling this report.
The exciting thing about biofuels, biomass and biogas is that there is a great future for it.
When you hear the President of the United States say during the State of the Union Address that the American economy can no longer be an oil-based mineral economy, then it shows that things are changing, and here in Europe we have great possibilities.
Historically, farmers have always provided fuel for transport back in the days of horses, so what is the problem now with supplying fuel?
With the new payments for agriculture, the new reforms of the CAP, the decoupled payment and the single farm payment breaking the link between production and subsidy, we also need to find new markets for our products and that is where, as I said, cereals and oil seed rape for bio-diesel and wheat for bioethanol come into play.
We can also be sure that we can create more biomass.
In many countries of Europe you actually see that there are forests being used effectively.
Where there are no forests, then we can grow willows and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply.
Some of these can be big projects used for power stations, others can be small projects for local heating plants and for schools and hospitals.
There can be a lot of flexibility.
When it comes to not only fuel but energy as a whole, biofuel and bioenergy may not be the total answer, but it is one of the answers.
Where, for instance, Russia could possibly turn off our gas supply at any time, I think we have to look to alternatives.
The one thing we must always emphasise with all this is that these types of fuels and biomass are very environmentally friendly.
That is the great thing: not only is it good for farmers, but it is good for the environment.
We have the present generation of fuels and biomass available, but we are also seeing new generations coming on and we will see bioplastics coming into place.
I think there is a big future for that.
We have seen a new process of making paper from straw, again using much more environmentally friendly chemicals.
Out of a ton of straw you can create half a ton of paper pulp and a quarter of a ton of bioethanol.
So it shows, as I said, that we are moving forward with all these projects.
To mention the common agricultural policy, we have set-aside land on which we are growing nothing.
Some set-aside land is very effective for environmental enhancement, but I think we should look very positively at using other set-aside land for fuel.
On biofuel, Volkswagen in Germany has been very sympathetic to mixing fuels and creating engines that will support biofuels, but we need to put pressure on the car companies to be much more sympathetic to this.
I also think we need to mix fuels much more in order to get a quality of fuel that is good for motor engines.
Another point about putting land into production for biofuels and biomass, is that it keeps that land in production, so that in the future if we were to need it for food supply, then that it is in production and we could switch it back to food.
This is a very great bonus.
Finally, I would like to thank all the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and of Parliament for their support.
I have visited many countries to see what is going on.
We have an exciting time in front of us.
Commissioner, I think now is the time for Parliament and the Commission, along with Member States, to really pull together to establish the tax incentives and get everything in place so that we can deliver a very good biofuel/biomass policy for Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the past six months, energy has very much become the topic of the moment.
This was confirmed by the Heads of State at Hampton Court, and this is a window of opportunity that we simply must seize and that is what the Commission is doing.
I have been very encouraged to see that the European Parliament is having the same positive approach and doing exactly the same.
As Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, the use of non-food crops is an area of particular interest.
I see here a very interesting new outlet for our agricultural sector and an interesting source of income, not only for farmers but for the whole rural economy.
I therefore heartily welcome the report that we will be discussing today.
Its timing is excellent and it makes a valuable contribution to the debate about the non-food use of agricultural crops.
I would specifically like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Parish, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, for all the work they have been doing.
The Commission has recently issued two communications with the aim of encouraging the use of biomass: the biomass action plan and the European strategy for biofuels.
The Commissionâs framework programmes for research have for many years supported pioneering work into renewable bio-resources, including plastics, agri-chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
The seventh framework programme for research will place a particular emphasis on the development of sustainable non-food applications.
As well as offering new opportunities to farmers, the development of non-food applications for agricultural raw materials is very much in line with the whole Lisbon Strategy.
The approach is innovative and represents a high level of European added value.
On the use of biomass for energy, Eurostat and the Joint Research Centre estimate that the potential for biomass production to meet our targets for 2010 is there.
The CAP reform gives farmers incentives to respond to the growing demand.
As well as our specific support for energy crops of EURÂ 45 per hectare, farmers can use set-aside land to grow non-food crops.
Last year about 900Â 000 hectares of set-aside land were used for growing biomass for energy purposes.
The sugar reform has now made sugar beet eligible for all bio-energy support schemes.
On the processing side, however, major progress and investments are still needed.
In our new rural development programming period we have the opportunity to support investments and other actions in favour of biomass for energy and other non-food purposes.
Cohesion policy can also play an important role.
As far as the environment is concerned, I agree that we must keep a careful eye on any unwanted impact from the development of the non-food sector.
This must be carefully monitored.
The use of biomass is on the increase in all regions of the world, in particular for biofuels.
This can clearly have economic, social and environmental benefits, but we must also be sure to maintain a proper balance between the production of food and non-food.
We do not wish to develop the non-food sector in such a way as to have a negative impact on our agrifood industry or on food prices for consumers, either in the European Union or in the developing countries.
This is again something that we must monitor carefully.
I am looking forward to a discussion here in the European Parliament on the ways of using renewable energies in a more active way.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his own-initiative report, which shows great commitment, and also for taking the trouble to travel to various Member States and see for himself the kind of possibilities already existing in the renewable raw materials sector.
As the Commissioner mentioned, over the last six months, energy has become the most important issue of the day.
An environmentally friendly, economical mix of all energy sources is indispensable for Europe.
Renewable raw materials and renewable energy could also form the mainstays of this mix.
Alongside wind, water, photovoltaic cells and biogas, this particular sector of renewable energy provides for basic needs in the fields of building and insulating materials, and raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry.
Producing food and crops for the generation of energy was common practice for centuries.
The use of fossil fuels on a massive scale took over from the energy for our draught animals, which was derived from plants.
The production of renewable raw materials for energy purposes is of fundamental importance to European agriculture and forestry, and to rural areas.
It has opened up new sources of income and also made an essential contribution to not only maintaining existing employment but also creating new jobs in rural areas.
The EU would do well to regard renewable sources of energy as an important factor in energy use, in order to reduce its own dependence on international energy producers and, particularly, on politically unstable regions.
Many thanks and sincere congratulations to the rapporteur.
Â Â  . Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, first of all, to join with all the others who have just spoken in congratulating Mr Parish on the work he has done and to say to you that I am completely in agreement with the objectives set out in this report.
Firstly, that of taking an overall view of the environmental question: bioenergy, biomass and biodegradable matter.
Secondly, that of diversifying our sources of energy given that we know that we have to anticipate that fossil fuel will run out in 40 or 50 yearsâ time and that we must fight with all our might against the greenhouse effect.
Thirdly, and this above all since it concerns agriculture, that of offering new market outlets for our European agriculture.
Having said that, I would like to add that this can be done only on two conditions, Commissioner.
Firstly, biofuels do not, on their own, constitute the whole of the agriculture policy and, in the context of this agriculture policy, we have to maintain two pillars: one linked to production and one linked to territorial and social cohesion.
Secondly, the new policy aimed at bioenergy cannot specifically have any meaning unless it is fully part of a political process and willingness to make the agricultural model a model for sustainable development.
I believe, therefore, that we have to commit ourselves to considering the new models that allow for diversification of agricultural production while at the same time guaranteeing a sound ecological balance for all of our territories.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by offering my sincere congratulations to MrÂ Parish on this balanced report, which my group expressly supports.
The development of non-food crops offers EU farmers the opportunity of developing new markets, and therefore support and research are vital in this field.
The use of renewable raw materials and renewable energy production both represent an enormous potential for European rural areas.
I hail from the rural German of Lower Saxony.
For us in Lower Saxony, in particular, bioenergy is vital as an alternative source of income for farmers and foresters.
In some fields, especially biogas, for which we have around 430 plants, we are already leading the field in Europe.
At this point, I should like to say that I also expressly welcome the Commissionâs latest initiatives in this field: the Biomass Action Plan and the Commission Communication on Biofuels.
Parliament will renew its efforts with regard to the EU Strategy for Biofuels within the framework of an own-initiative report.
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, too, will draw up an opinion on this.
As draftsman of this opinion, I shall be glad to be able to build upon the good work accomplished by my colleague MrÂ Parish.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, it is remarkable that, when we talk of a supply crisis, everyone thinks of President Putin turning off our gas tap.
No one mentions the fact that Europe as a region is among the worldâs largest importers of food and that, if we maintain this standard of living, we shall barely be able to subsist.
When we discuss alternative sources of income, it is also interesting to hear that the cultivation of sugar for consumption, that is, as a foodstuff, generates little or no income; so why does the cultivation of sugar for bioethanol generate income?
There are some inconsistencies here.
I should now like to discuss the issue of ecology: what is the situation as regards the use of genetic engineering in the cultivation of renewable raw materials?
Do we not have the problem of contamination, that is, the problem of coexistence, here?
Yes, we do.
The cultivation of renewable raw materials also involves methods that are not ecologically sound; it is not necessarily environmentally friendly.
On the subject of greenhouse gases, it has to be said that these are also kept in check by food production, so we could do with a little more moderation and a little less of the enthusiasm shown by the rapporteur, and also a little more concentration on the renewable raw materials deriving from waste products.
It is also interesting to hear that grass is put to better use when recovered as biogas than as milk.
If we wish to use recovery, therefore, it is important to recover straw, wood or hedges, but tying up land for renewable raw materials that we need for food is a major problem that calls for less enthusiasm and more precision.
I would like to welcome the reportâs call for fuel tax exemptions to promote the production of biofuels.
Such a policy would move us closer to the EUâs target of 5.75% for the consumption of biofuels.
The active development of renewable energy will go some way towards addressing the fossil fuel crisis.
It can lead to environmental improvements, although I agree with both the rapporteur and the Commissioner here this morning that we need to monitor this environmental impact.
It can, and will, also bring economic benefits through developing new technologies, job creation and retooling in the agricultural sector, in particular where sugar factories are earmarked for closure.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I am a supporter of the development of biofuels as one of the many answers national governments need to the impending energy crisis.
Since the European Union has so profoundly failed to protect my country from price-fixing by European energy companies, the need becomes even greater.
However, I do not believe in pan-European actions on these matters, particularly in relation to setting obligatory targets.
The EUâs obsession with one-size-fits-all policy-making leads to the encouragement of quick-fix solutions from national governments.
We are going down that route in Britain with wind turbine technology.
Our countryside is in the process of being turned into a monstrous Meccano set for the sake of meeting renewable energy targets dreamed up by the European Commission.
The other problem is the propensity for the EU to bring in legislative regimes well ahead of the ability of national governments to create the necessary infrastructure to support them.
Again my country has suffered, not least with the growing mountains of refrigerators awaiting disposal.
Interest groups in favour of bio-diesel development should lobby the national government, not Brussels.
Our own government is much better placed to come up with suitable proposals for encouraging the sensible development of biofuels in Britain than the EU, which is likely to introduce a regime that will not suit us all.
Each nationâs needs are different and it is about time the EU took that on board.
Â Â  Mr President, the excellent report by Mr Parish on the promotion of crops for non-food purposes puts the problem well: at a time when the price of oil is constantly rising and when gas and oil reserves are diminishing owing to the growing needs of developing countries, it is useful to make provision for alternative energy sources.
Biofuels, the development of which we have long supported, meets, although only partially, the needs of the agricultural economy: an improvement in the environment through the reduction in greenhouse gases, we are told, the production of renewable energy sources that foster energy independence, job creation in rural areas, the balancing of territories against rural desertification and the preparing of set-aside land for crops for non-food purposes.
Nonetheless, there remain some questions.
How are we to achieve the ambitious goal of 5.75% of the market in 2010 for biofuels when France has as yet achieved only 1%?
Moreover, if the price per barrel continues to rise, biofuels will become competitive and the problem of tax exemptions will become pointless, and if not, will the Member States accept a loss of revenue amounting to several hundreds of millions of euros?
Finally, with the abolition of export refunds in 2013, decided on at the WTO, and the lowering of domestic support, cereal growers will turn more towards non-food production, which is not their main business.
