This strategy is an important step towards more sustainable urban development. It is a response to the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and a key contribution to improving the everyday lives of Europeâs citizens.
I am pleased that Parliament will soon adopt a resolution that recognises the importance of urban issues for citizens of the European Union.
I think, despite some differences on how to tackle this important challenge, the Commission and Parliament have a common view and understanding on the key issues, namely on substance and effects.
While the Commission believes that an approach based on guidance, incentives and the dissemination of best practice is the way to proceed, it will, however, monitor the effectiveness of the strategy and undertake reviews from time to time to see how it helps address this important challenge.
The Commission will report to Parliament on the results of this monitoring.
I hope that Parliament can adopt a resolution supporting the strategyâs aims and objectives.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30Â a.m.
Â Â  â Cities play a key role in generating wealth: economic, social and cultural development constitute a driving force for growth and employment.
Efficient urban planning, pragmatic development of urban environmental models and tools with an integrated approach and an exchange of best practices help cities ensure sustainable development and reconcile economic, social and environmental challenges, and they also contribute to the health and well-being of EU citizens.
These actions, based on comprehensive policies with clear, concrete, measurable targets and frameworks, must be sustainable, future-oriented and supported by adequate EU funds.
For the urban environment â being a wide, comprehensive and constantly changing issue â a flexible approach is needed, and so emphasis must be placed on research which could be included in the 7th Framework Programme on Research.
Among the wide variety of priority targets we find some of the most important challenges.
One of these is adopting measures to reduce land use, and in particular limiting greenfield and extending brownfield developments in urban development programmes in order to protect green spaces.
Sustainable urban public transport, the progressive introduction of environmentally-friendly modes of transport and technologies, and promoting the use of public and non-motorised transport rather than private cars are just some examples of the main priorities.
Â Â  The European Commission with the help of, Parliament and Council, produces many strategies meant to give guidance and disseminate best practise.
To ensure a European Urban Strategy is taken seriously is challenging.
The financial interests in urban planning and development are such that it will take more than suggestions to ensure what we do now leads to safe liveable cities in the future.
Rather than the Strategy including a statement that green space is important to urban design, I think it better to state we need, say, 15% green space in urban areas or so many metres per 1000 population.
Only a real target with weight behind it will stand up against land hungry developers.
In my constituency is a public housing area built 30 years ago.
Planned in a way foreseen by this Strategy, there is ample green space, wide easy to negotiate roads and community infrastructure.
This area has been a model of good practise and has served a community very well.
However, this area is threatened by city planners looking to build houses.
Only an urban strategy spelling out actual percentages will create sufficient green spaces in cities, and prevent the elimination of those presently enjoyed.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0280/2006), by MrÂ Ferber on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge for implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2004: SectionÂ I â European Parliament [N6-0027/2005 C6-0357/2002 2005/2091 (DEC)].
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps I might observe at the outset that it is stated in the report we are about to discuss, and on which we will be voting tomorrow, that we are giving discharge to the President of Parliament, and so I think it highly regrettable that the President of this House is not present for our deliberations today.
I would like to point out that he is under a particular obligation to be present.
Although we had in fact completed the discharge procedure for this Houseâs 2004 budget back in April, careful reading of the local paper here in Strasbourg brought to light something that, in terms of its drama, certainly takes some beating.
I think it unacceptable that, even though the House authorities were informed by the city of Strasbourg as long ago as November 2005 that the latter still had to conduct negotiations in respect of the two buildings â known as IPEÂ 1 and IPEÂ 2 â with a Dutch pension fund, both the House authorities and the Bureau pressed on with the purchase negotiations and it was only our own initiative that prevented the deal going through.
Moreover, what we have managed to find out from investigating this â and it is on this that I would like to concentrate in the little time remaining to me â makes for a pretty interesting tale.
Back in 1979, when direct elections were introduced, the European Parliament decided that it needed office space.
There can be no objection to that.
It asked the city of Strasbourg to make such space available â and there is nothing objectionable about that either.
The city of Strasbourg decided that it could not afford to do that itself, so it commissioned a third party â the Dutch pension fund to which I have referred â to build an office block.
What resulted from this was a sub-letting arrangement, with us ending up paying the city of Strasbourg between EURÂ 30 and EURÂ 60 million â depending on which study one consults â more in rent than it, in turn, was paying to the pension fund, even though this Houseâs Committee on Budgets and the Quaestors had, in 1980, insisted that no more be paid from then on to the city of Strasbourg that it itself was paying to the pension fund.
It was this Houseâs Bureau that, in 1983, reviewed the acceptability of the rent charged and devised a new system of calculation based on comparability, on which basis the rent was calculated anew, and, since it was during the 1980s that inflation in France was at its height, the city of Strasbourg wanted the lease index-linked, albeit without any limit of time.
This has led us, in the report which I have the honour of presenting today, to two basic conclusions.
The first is that, with effect from 1983 at the latest, the authorities charged with the management of this wonderful building, the European Parliament, stopped doing anything about the leases that they had concluded with the city of Strasbourg.
That is unacceptable, for, to give a quite specific example, one consequence of the introduction of the euro is that index-linking has become meaningless.
The second conclusion â and this is something I want to spell out plainly â is that the city of Strasbourg, which provides the European Parliament with a home, has given no kind of example of good and trusting cooperation between the institution and the city.
All our audits have established that there has been no corruption, no fraud, no mismanagement, no misappropriation of funds.
I very much regret the absence of the honourable Member who has been known to sit here wearing a gas mask and claiming that the place stank of corruption.
It was not for us to judge whether or not it was wise that the European treaties should lay down where the seat of Parliament was to be.
There is a lady Member who lives in Brussels and no doubt has a miserable time of it in the youth hostel when she comes to Strasbourg; I also very much regret her absence, not to mention the fact that she has contributed nothing by way of input to this report.
What we were required to do was to go through what had happened in the past, and that is what we have done.
My warm thanks go to all the Members who have played their part in this.
We were not, however, called upon to decide where the European Parliamentâs seat should be, which is a matter for the infinite wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, and I am sure we all know that the issue is safe in their hands.
So, then, many thanks from me to all who have had a hand in this, combined with sadness that there were so many who sought to turn this into a media campaign without, however, taking any part in the real work that was done by the working party and in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
All these observations notwithstanding, and with suggestions for the future, we are giving discharge for 2004.
We will, however, be discussing further developments in future reports as and when this proves necessary.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Ferber.
The main conclusion of the investigation into the allegations on the two Strasbourg buildings is that there is no indication of illegality.
In this sense, therefore, the allegations were unfounded.
However, a number of findings have emerged that, although not illegal, should be stressed here today.
The first is that there was indeed an excessive payment of rent in the order of between EUR 32 million and as much as EUR 60 million.
Secondly, the City of Strasbourg acted in breach of trust when it did things which it knew would never have been acceptable to Parliament, such as keeping part of the rent payments and negotiating a cut of EUR 29 million from the purchase price.
Thirdly, the administration of the European Parliament was also found to be lacking, because over a long period of 30 years it failed in its duty of diligence to ensure that the rent that was paid to Strasbourg for the buildings was not excessive.
Finally, the European Parliament was not united on this issue, for how else can one explain the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control was informed of the allegations well over a month after the Bureau of Parliament itself?
How else can one explain that, even as our investigation was taking place, our Bureau continued to negotiate the purchase of the buildings, thereby undermining the political authority of the investigation itself?
Although none of these points constitute unlawful acts, they surely cannot be condoned, still less repeated.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall not be addressing you today in my capacity as the official PSE Group shadow, so I shall not be taking my three minutesâ speaking time.
I only wish to say that I support the conclusions of the Ferber report.
This report argues that there is in fact a breach of faith between the City of Strasbourg and this institution.
This is something I can wholeheartedly support.
Two public institutions dealing with public money should behave in a way that is not only legally just but also ethically and morally acceptable.
After having participated in this working party, I find that in the tripartite negotiations one party has consistently acted according to those ethically just principles, and one party, namely the City of Strasbourg, has not.
I have become known in my short time in this Parliament as one of the leaders of the anti-Strasbourg campaign.
I am not used to using words like âanti-â because basically I do not like the way it rings.
I have tried my utmost to avoid mixing up the discussions on Parliamentâs seat with the discussions on whether tax money has been well spent.
I would like to put it to Parliament today that the only people who have consistently mixed up these two debates have been, firstly, the Mayor of Strasbourg, who, when she addressed us during her hearing, reminded us that having such a debate was in fact quite dangerous because the Alsace region has a very symbolic meaning.
I am absolutely convinced that this is true and I totally agree.
That is why I should like to use this short time in the sitting today to ask the City of Strasbourg â if what it says is really true and if it really believes that this is a region that deserves to be honoured â why is it that since 1979 it has consistently acted in a way that, to put it mildly, is inconsistent with that aim?
These are two public institutions that are trying to do the best for their citizens.
I stand here because I wish to ensure that the money that Dutch citizens pay into the account of the European Union is well spent.
I should just like to point out that, according to the auditorsâ report, it has not been well spent and that this has in fact been, to put it mildly, ...
Â Â  . Mr President, the 2004 discharge was certainly marked by a strange turn of events.
If it had not been for a newspaper article that appeared just before the discharge date, drawing attention to the compensation element involved in the purchase of two new buildings in Strasbourg, we probably would have simply granted discharge in April.
Once the report was out in the open, the administration reacted entirely appropriately by cancelling the purchase of those two buildings.
I also have to say that the Committee on Budgets reacted very adequately by immediately setting up an internal committee of inquiry to examine all aspects of the case.
I can only say that in this process and in that committee of inquiry, MrÂ Ferber has played a star role, and all credit to him for that.
The committee of inquiry has also done a good job within a short space of time.
The conclusion that I have drawn, like others â so at the risk of going over old ground â is that there was a relationship of trust between two public institutions, between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament which, as a result of this issue, has been dealt a huge blow.
The fact that two public institutions make profits on each otherâs backs is inexcusable, since it is still taxpayersâ money that is involved.
Legally, however, everything is watertight, and so there is little we can recoup from it.
In my view, the Ferber report is right to conclude that the purchase of buildings, subject to a number of conditions â provided that the price is right and we purchase land and buildings at the same time â is still the best option for the taxpayer.
I subscribe to that view and I think that that is set to happen shortly.
I should also like to point out that this purchase of the building is completely unrelated to the issue of seats.
As MrÂ Ferber has already said, a decision by Heads of Government could change this.
Parliament may have its own view, but is not in a position to change anything.
What matters are the taxpayersâ interests.
I believe that if the price is right, in the long run, and even in the relatively short term, it would be cheaper than carrying on paying rent.
A discharge is always about the past.
Apart from the buildings, the report also contains a whole list of interesting things with recommendations for the future.
It contains useful recommendations about the contracts that have to be given to parliamentary assistants, as well as about the new opportunities which communications technologies offer us, with which I, myself, endeavour to get to grips on a daily basis.
As for the general conclusions, I can confirm that my group broadly endorses MrÂ Ferberâs views.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to single out two sections of MrÂ Ferberâs excellent report: the buildings policy and the voluntary pension fund.
Turning to the buildings policy first, about which all speakers have had something to say, we now have before us a second report as a result of that article in the press.
A special working party was set up, in which, I believe, we all worked very hard and very well together, and in which we tried to give MrÂ Ferber maximum support.
The conclusions are therefore identical across the board, and most Members have quoted them.
We have been unable to identify any unlawful actions or corruption, but what we do know is that, over the past 20 years, the European Parliament has paid the City of Strasbourg quite a bit over the odds in rent, at least EURÂ 32Â million and probably more, between EURÂ 42 and EURÂ 60Â million.
What is also unacceptable in my view is that the City of Strasbourg took the unilateral decision at one point to set aside EURÂ 11Â million over that period for what it referred to as covering the risk of Parliament ever leaving its seat in this City.
These actions have dealt the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament a heavy blow, and it comes as no surprise, then, that this has cranked up the entire debate on Parliamentâs seat.
Whilst I am aware that this is not what this discharge report is about, I do think that Parliament should, in a recommendation to the Council, finally make up its mind and say whether it wants to continue to have its seat in this city or not.
Finally, I should like to mention the voluntary pension fund, which is another important aspect of MrÂ Ferberâs report.
At the end of 2004, that fund suffered an insurance deficit to the tune of EUR 43Â million, which, fortunately, dropped to EUR 28Â million by the end of 2005.
I should like to draw attention to my AmendmentÂ 5, which expressly states that Parliament itself can never be held liable for that deficit.
It is a voluntary pension fund, one that is managed by the managers.
As such, it is they who should be saddled with any deficits, not Parliament or the taxpayer.
It is the managers who are responsible for the unethical, or incorrect, management of vast amounts of money.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would like to thank MrÂ Ferber for his work, notably for having succeeded in drawing up a report that is competent and to the point on the basis of scant information.
A number of general comments concerning the control system and method of controlling implementation of the European Unionâs budget come to mind in the context of the debate on discharge.
I note with regret that the control system is rather general and superficial.
Much is said about the reliability of ledgers, the number of errors, and the inadequacies of the control system.
General remarks of this kind are repeated again and again, but in fact we do not have a full understanding of how the Unionâs budget is implemented.
Issues such as those concerning the Strasbourg buildings and before that the Eurostat affair and similar irregularities tend to be identified by the press.
The control system is not helpful in this.
The system needs to be rethought, to ensure it is more targeted and specific, and perhaps more akin to the system used by national control departments, which is more effective that the Unionâs system.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am eternally grateful to this august institution for allowing me a miserly one and a half minutes to comment on the discharge of the budget for 2004.
Given that the report describes this Parliament as âthe democratic representative body in the EUâ, let everyone be clear about just how little it deserves that description.
We do not have debates in this institution, but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time without the opportunity for reply, hence the empty Chamber this evening.
We simply go through the motions in what is a pale shadow of a parliament. It acts as a fig leaf of democratic respectability, designed to mislead the people of Europe into thinking that they have some say in the management of the so-called European project.
There can be no better example of this than the one million signature petition calling for an end to the utterly pointless and grotesquely expensive monthly pilgrimage to Strasbourg.
Ignoring this entreaty from the people we are supposed to represent, this Parliament is seriously considering purchasing these buildings and making this bizarre arrangement permanent.
It is all very well for this report to question the City of Strasbourgâs good faith, but the reality is that the City ...
Â Â  Mr President, I should just like to point out that MrÂ Titford from the UK Independence Party just gave one of the most passionate arguments for a European Constitution: he was supporting the initiative of one million Europeans and that can only be legally binding if we have a Constitution.
I would like to make three points.
First, congratulations to Mr Ferber on a wonderful report.
It was a good idea to postpone the discharge report because of the lack of clarity regarding the relationship between the City of Strasbourg and the European Parliament.
I fully support the content of the report and how it has been written.
We dealt with that in the Committee on Budgetary Control, where the report was adopted with 25 votes in favour and only one against.
The second point is about the blame game.
It is true that both parties should be blamed: Parliamentâs administration, which was perhaps a little naive, and the City of Strasbourg.
There is no denying it.
I agree with Mrs Mastenbroek and Mr Busuttil, who said that the City of Strasbourg has worked with us in bad faith.
My confidence in the workings of this city has gone down.
My final point concerns whether this report and the seat of the European Parliament are somehow linked.
They are not, but at the same time it is a matter of how we use money.
As in a marriage, it is important to talk about sensitive issues.
I fully realise that this is a sensitive issue, but we must remember that it is not only the rent.
The truth is that us coming here costs EURÂ 209 million of taxpayersâ money every year.
That is a waste and I support the idea put forward in the âoneseat.euâ campaign of having only one seat.
Let us talk about it openly and try to find a solution, but separately from this report.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I want to congratulate our rapporteur and the working party set up by the Committee on Budgets on their creditable handling of this matter.
What has become apparent is something of which one gets a sense in todayâs sitting, namely that those who call for transparency often, at the end of the day, do not want the facts to come out, and â as the rapporteur has observed â it sometimes turns out that the facts are not quite so scandalous and not quite so extraordinary as what they would have liked to see in the newspapers, but the Committee on Budgetary Control, the rapporteur and the working party have acquired these documents by honest means, and they stand by them.
I warmly congratulate them on the results that have come to light.
I have no great desire to go over again how appalling it was that so much was superimposed on this debate.
Everyone has an opinion on Strasbourg, on Brussels, and on other things, and that makes it more difficult to do the job properly.
I think it has been done rather well, and MrÂ Ferberâs report deserves our support.
What are the lessons we should learn from this?
For a start, our own administrators, our own Bureau â of which, or so I believe, our current president is a member â were in possession of information that was not supplied to us at a time when MrÂ Ferber was already working on his report.
That is not acceptable, and there is a need for change here.
A different way of doing things must be required in future, or else we will have to look out for ourselves.
Secondly, another lesson that I think we can learn from what MrÂ Ferber has written is that those who run this place should be required to review old contracts rather than waiting a thousand years for something else to crop up; that must not be allowed to happen.
Thirdly, I think that all those who believe the current debate on building policy in Strasbourg could be combined with the âone seatâ debate, should first be sure in their own minds â which I am not â how things stand as regards this Houseâs policy on the other places where it meets.
Â Â  Mr President, I want to use my minute to speak on paragraph 88 about the MEP pension scheme and the way the contributions are paid.
Firstly, I deplore very strongly the fact that some colleagues in this Parliament have been casting slurs on other colleagues.
Those who are casting the slurs are not present in this debate, and they have no evidence.
It is a disgrace that they can go to the press and try to make their names by casting slurs on honourable Members of this Parliament.
Let them produce the evidence before they go around saying such things.
I have no objection â and I have heard no objections â to our contributions to the pension scheme being deducted directly from our bank accounts.
That is perfectly okay. But it should be borne in mind that Parliament would apparently have to recruit five extra full-time staff to do this, at an annual cost of EUR 400Â 000, in order to check that the right amounts have been transferred from each of the national bank accounts to the central pot.
This is because some banks make bank charges to transfer the money and some do not, so that the amounts will vary.
Furthermore, as there is no euro currency in 13 of our Member States, the monthly payments will also vary with fluctuations in the exchange rate of national currencies against the euro.
All this involves very considerable expense, and we should keep cool heads and refrain from insults.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I am the longest-serving Member of the European Parliament and the one who has travelled most often to Strasbourg.
I was a member of the Committee on Budgets and of the Conference of Presidents when the majority decided that the secretariat should be in Luxembourg and the meetings held by turns in Strasbourg and Brussels.
When we had to choose between Strasbourg and Brussels, I voted in favour Strasbourg, so I am not addressing you from an anti-French perspective.
A million signatures have now been collected so that we might have a single seat.
That is a striking expression of grass-roots opinion.
We no longer want to find ourselves wasting taxpayersâ money and MEPsâ and employeesâ time.
We should therefore do what we can to respond to peopleâs criticism.
When we set the calendar of sittings for 2008, we could decide to meet each Tuesday in the city where the Commission meets.
We could be given a report on the dayâs decisions and take all the votes requiring absolute majorities.
In that way, the need for moving between the two centres would be drastically reduced.
The ball would be in the prime ministersâ court, and they would be forced to establish a single place of work.
That is something that we ourselves can do without violating the Treaty.
We can also send out a signal by not purchasing new buildings now.
I have tabled AmendmentÂ 9 in order to prevent or postpone their purchase.
No one has had the imagination to picture the city of Strasbourg taking financial advantage of the European Parliament and European taxpayers.
That idea was not put forward at any meeting I remember, and I will not accuse successive Secretary-Generals of having been negligent.
It must be possible to expect public authorities to be honest and to show loyalty to one another.
I understand, moreover, that Strasbourg has not contravened the law.
That being the case, the law must be changed so that public authorities have a duty of information when they deal with each other.
Here in Parliament, however, we are not obliged to purchase buildings from the city of Strasbourg.
We have enough buildings, and now we must unite in demanding a single place of work.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Ferber on the way in which he has presented the discharge and the report, and on his working methods.
I â being a mere acting member on the Committee on Budgetary Control â should also like to extend warm thanks to my group colleagues MrÂ Busuttil, MrÂ Stubb and MrsÂ GrÃ€ssle, for the excellent working relationship we enjoyed with MrÂ Ferber, not least in the preparatory meetings of the working party of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
MrÂ Ferber has tabled a critical report â critical, that is, about the buildings and about a number of services, whilst nevertheless being fair.
It contains a number of sound recommendations for the way in which changes can be made for the better.
For example, a discharge report must be used in order to control Parliamentâs own housekeeping and budget more effectively.
Needless to say, he devoted the necessary attention to the issue of the buildings, the problem we faced with the City of Strasbourg.
He spelled out quite clearly, but also fairly, that at times Parliament, and not just the other parties in the conflict, is also to blame to some extent.
Accordingly, whilst we Dutch Christian Democrats subscribe to the thrust of the Ferber report with regard to spending of the 2004 Parliament budget, as prepared and adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I should nevertheless like to make a few observations, which I see in isolation from the Ferber report, not least because he has done an excellent job with regard to Strasbourg.
Tomorrow, in the Committee on Budgets, we will be discussing a possible purchase.
It is obvious that my party is opposed to this, not least on account of the fact that the discussion that is being held surrounding this topic â and I only need to refer to MrÂ Stubb's words, with which I am in agreement â should in actual fact be held prior to the purchase of buildings.
Moreover, strictly speaking, Parliament cannot discuss this for another two years, during the 2006 discharge, which does not strike me as the right way of going about things.
I also have a comment with regard to content about this purchase, namely about the possible presence of asbestos.
The environmental aspects in this connection have not been adequately addressed.
Whilst I should once again like to congratulate MrÂ Ferber, we cannot agree to the purchase of the building at this moment in time on account of the issues I have mentioned.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Ferber, for his work and for the dynamism that he instilled in the working party and the Committee on Budgetary Control, as well as in the Committee on Budgets.
Nonetheless, we did not fully agree on some of his conclusions in committee and with his decision to revisit other subjects, which I believe have partly blurred the conclusions that were quite clear in the initial mandate.
This was going to be more of a management approval exercise for Parliament, but the information apparently given to the press by the City of Strasbourg about the profit that it had made on the price paid by Parliament â by using a kind of middleman contract which it never explained â threw up, or turned this exercise into, something much more interesting, from which we have gained some important experience.
The working party found that the practice was legal and was also customary in these financial engineering real-estate contracts, as was what, in my view, is the improper use of actual middlemen.
It has to be acknowledged that the middlemen really earned their money.
Well, if there was too much trust on one side and a lack of good faith on the other, I believe that we, as Parliament, have learnt not to trust the good faith of other institutions so much.
This whole exercise is therefore welcome if it can instil a greater awareness of the risks and dangers involved in real-estate transactions and if we can thereby â and I think that this is what we are aiming at â avoid such unpleasant surprises happening again in future, since they make it more difficult for Parliament to have the necessary trust in our own seats.
On the other two subjects that have again been included through the back door â pensions and Parliamentâs seat â I confirm that I share the opinion expressed several times in this House that that is not the solution proposed by the majority.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to take my turn in thanking MrÂ Ferber for having done an excellent job of carrying out the follow-up work in a context that was not only legally complex, but also quite often turbulent.
I am, of course, grateful to the Committee on Budgetary Control for having seen through its investigations aimed at shedding a little light on our debate.
While I, for my part, sincerely regret the clumsy way in which the City of Strasbourg has managed this issue, I have learnt two lessons from it.
One concerns the running of our Parliament: as the rapporteur points out, in future, we must pay more attention to the legal status of our contracts, even when they are complex.
The second lesson is more fundamental and is political in nature.
It still concerns the discharge, however.
I hope that the adoption of the discharge will enable us to put a stop once and for all to the constant confused attempts aimed at turning attention back to the cost of the seat in Strasbourg, something that is determined by the Treaties and by the wisdom of the Heads of State or Government, as MrÂ Ferber pointed out.
If we do not succeed in this, I propose two solutions: either we repatriate all of the institutions of the European Parliament, which is the democratic body , and we will have just one seat, as one of our fellow Members said; or, at the very least, we perform an audit to establish the cost of all of the European institutions spread across the whole of Europe, and we draw the lessons from that.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I, too, would like to have an extra 25% speaking time.
The rehashing of this business with the lease of the Strasbourg building â which has been going on for 28 years â puts me in a very reflective frame of mind.
It leaves me with doubts â doubts that will not go away â about the professionalism of the people who manage this Houseâs buildings and about how important value for money is to those who manage its finances.
For 28 years, the House authorities did not check to see whether the leases were still good value â not even when the capital costs originally included had been written off, nor even when, in 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam laid down that Strasbourg would be our seat, for it was at this point, at the latest, that it became necessary to assess the risk involved.
For years on end, the rent paid was excessive, to the considerable detriment of this House and of the European taxpayer, amounting â as even the assessor appointed to act on behalf of the French Republic admitted â to something between EURÂ 28 and EURÂ 32Â million at the least.
Who is actually responsible for this?
Why have this Houseâs internal auditors failed to do their job?
Nobody is answering these questions, and I am mad as hell about it.
I, like every other Member of this House, will make sure that these issues, far from disappearing into oblivion, are, as they must be, followed up.
Tomorrow, we are to release EURÂ 80Â million to buy these buildings, which we actually paid for years ago.
We are even getting one of them thrown in for free, without knowing what long-standing liabilities it conceals.
A contract has been cobbled together under considerable pressure of time, without the purchase price being renegotiated in view of what has transpired in the past.
If this contract is no better or no worse than its predecessors, it will, within the foreseeable future, be the subject of another debate in this House.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I would just like to point out â further to what I said in my speech when you were not here â that, the next time the discharge of Parliament is debated, I expect its President to be present.
Â Â  We shall inform him of this request.
I would simply point out that, as we sit here right now, the Bureau, for its part, is sitting under the presidency of the President of Parliament.
That is the explanation that I am able to give you.
The President of Parliament is not endowed with the ability to be everywhere at once; he is not omnipresent, like Fregoli.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6â0255/2006) by MrsÂ Prets, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on transnational mobility within the Community for education and training purposes: European Quality Charter for Mobility (COM(2005)0450 â C6-0291/2005 â 2005/0179(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, once again, I would like to thank Mrs Prets, the Culture Committeeâs rapporteur, for her commitment and constructive work, including several long meetings with my services and those of the Council.
For similar reasons, let me also express gratitude to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Kusstatscher.
Thanks to their political will, flexibility and negotiating skills, we have been able to agree on a reliable compromise text.
Let me first refer to the main objectives of this proposal from the Commission.
The aim of the charter is to lay down common principles to make all types of mobility for learning purposes more efficient and more effective.
These principles include quality information and guidance for the candidates; a sound learning plan; preparation, especially linguistic preparation; adequate logistical support and mentoring schemes in the host country.
We also want to make clear what the responsibilities of all stakeholders are and to ensure fair recognition and evaluation of the study and training on return.
We expect the charter to bring significant benefits to users.
First, it should help make citizens more confident that mobility is useful and is being carried out in the right conditions.
Additionally, it should make it easier for the large category of people learning in another country to exercise the right to move and study freely within the European Union.
It should have a positive impact on the employability of those concerned.
Indeed, the charter responds to the important components of the social dimension of the European Union: mobility, education and training for the acquisition of new skills and employability.
I come now to Mrs Pretsâ report, which I welcome very much.
I know that the European Parliamentâs amendments mean that the text now fits even better with the objectives of the proposal.
For instance, you point out that mobility is based on common values and on respect for diversity.
You have extended the scope of the proposal to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups and people with disabilities.
You have invited the Commission to encourage the use of a mobility charter by national agencies and other organisations.
You have insisted on developing gender-specific statistical data and you have also mentioned the portability of government grants and loans to the host country.
To summarise, of the 36 amendments voted by the Culture Committee, only four have not been accepted by the Commission.
That was not a refusal of the underlying ideas, however, but only because the matter was outside the scope of the proposal, or else covered by other parts of the text.
All the remaining 32 amendments have been fully integrated, either literally or with slight rewording.
Finally, as you know, Coreper last week agreed on the compromise text.
Not a single Member State opposed the text or maintained a reserve.
That should ease the agreement in the first reading.
Therefore, I ask this House to confirm the text in its vote.
It should be an excellent conclusion to a most efficient cooperation between institutions.
But, before that, I am open to your questions.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that we have been able, after long-drawn out wrangling, to agree on this document, and, moreover, that we have been able to produce it in good time before the Year of Mobility is over, for I do not think it would make much sense to roll out a Mobility Charter next year; that would not exactly have the desired effect on the outside world.
More to the point, this Charter is needed as an accompaniment to the new educational programmes that are due to start next year, in which we have put a great emphasis on quantity, in that we want, for example, to have three million students on the lifelong learning scheme by 2012, and 80Â 000 per annum on Leonardo.
In view of that, the need for quality must not be ignored; it really must not be allowed to lose out.
Quality must be guaranteed not only in the host countries in which students spend time, but also in their countries of origin, so that the best possible use can be made of their experiences when they return and can really be seen to be added.
I would also like to emphasise that mobility must not merely make them more employable; there is a purely personal benefit involved as well, for education is of value not least in that it is character-building, and should therefore ultimately also contribute to greater European understanding.
The Charter is intended for all those who want to complete a formal or informal period of education or further education abroad, but there must also be a certain balance, not only for the studentsâ benefit, but also to promote the use of the Leonardo programme and create more openings for businesses to take on trainees.
While I do believe that this document can set a lot of things in motion, that will depend on how it is received in the Member States.
What we have set before this House is not legally binding, and so it is for the Member States to commit themselves to doing what it calls on them to do.
We know that very many resolutions are adopted in the Council and accepted without dissent in the EU or within the Council, only to be inadequately implemented at national level.
That would be sure to diminish young peopleâs confidence in what we are doing and also in our intentions.
There are, though, a number of points I would like to highlight, some of which you, Commissioner, have mentioned.
It is important that there should be a Mobility Guide containing introductory information on mobility options, grants and contact addresses.
It is also important that the various educational systems be made transparent and capable of being compared with one another, so that young people can know what is in store for them in this or that country.
It is also, of course, important that there should be information on the recognition of diplomas, on financial and other support, and that language barriers should be removed.
The transferability of grants â to which MrsÂ SchÃ¶ppges has already referred â is absolutely vital, in that it is needed, not least, alongside logistical support, insurance, residence and work permits, accommodation and preparations for travel, and is every bit as important as the transferability of loans.
The same is true of social security insurance.
If young people are going to venture to make this leap and be prepared to embark on this âforeign adventureâ, then their own countryâs social security system is one of the things they have to be able to âtake awayâ with them.
The intention is that the mobility charter should be seen as a frame of reference for making mobility more efficient and effective, with the persons using it having a checklist of ten matters to be sorted out before their departure, such as advice, information, and a learning plan; there are others, but it is not absolutely necessary that I discuss them now.
I would like to thank all those who have played their part in putting this compromise together.
That was not an easy thing to do, but we did eventually manage it.
I am glad to see that all the groups have tabled amendments or compromise amendments, and that we will, no doubt, be able to get through tomorrowâs vote quickly and then be able to present a good report.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, particularly in this Year of Mobility, it is a good and necessary initiative to put in place a Europe-wide quality charter for mobility for all citizens who travel around Europe for their education and further education, although it has to be said that this mobility charter is also an example of the half-hearted approach that has been taken to the Year of Mobility.
We, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in considering this resolution, saw it as particularly important that vocation training should be treated as equal in value to general education.
Our second concern was that it should be stressed that good continuous education and training is the best instrument for confronting unemployment and poverty.
The negotiations with the Council were both disappointing and revealing.
I regret that I am unable to confirm the statements already made, according to which there was a high degree of consensus.
The Council turned the procedure on its head as soon as it realised how willing the rapporteur of the lead committee was to compromise.
We, representatives of Parliament, found ourselves being told by the Council what Parliament was permitted or forbidden to recommend.
The rapid agreement made this a less than democratic process.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate MrsÂ Prets on her report and on her desire to make a success of a text that presents certain problems and that, although it is not a legislative text, is the expression of a strong commitment.
This Charter is part of an attempt to go one step further in establishing the idea that education is an area in which cooperation among the various national systems is becoming crucial.
If we want to promote mobility, then we shall have to improve the way in which we exchange our knowledge and our information, promote multilingualism, reduce the administrative obstacles and guarantee welfare cover and the portability of financial systems.
We will obviously have to ensure that candidates are prepared before their departure, monitored during their stay in the host country and reintegrated into their countries of origin.
The finding that, despite the wide variety of specific programmes, mobility has not increased, confirms that this Charter is a step in the right direction.
However, the Council has pointed out on more than one occasion that the area of education is a responsibility of the Member States.
The compromise reached is worthwhile even though the progress made still lacks ambition and, above all, depends on the goodwill of the Member States.
We cannot build Europe without making the area of education and culture an open space in which each country and each system, bolstered by its own resources, will no longer be afraid of the other.
The Lisbon Strategy encourages us to aspire to be more effective and to modernise our education systems.
While the Charter will be able to help better coordinate the mobility plans, everything will obviously depend not only on the will of the Member States, but also on the demands of Europeans who, like their ancestors in the Middle Ages, ought to be able to go round Europe without having to negotiate a path full of pitfalls.
For that to happen, we need more Europe in the area of education and culture.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, today is a special day for the European Parliament and the Committee on Culture and Education and for our three honourable friends MrsÂ Prets, MrsÂ TrÃŒpel and MrÂ Beazley, the rapporteurs on three separate reports on education in the European Union.
The mobility of European citizens in the education and training sector makes an important contribution towards improving the quality of their knowledge and broadening their experiences and skills and, at the same time, it is a unique tool for mutual understanding and better knowledge of the various cultures which make up Europe.
It is true that over recent years, thanks to the dissemination of existing education and mobility programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo, the mobility of young people in Europe has increased considerably.
Nonetheless, it is a fact that there are still a great number of other obstacles which hamper mobility.
Even today, the number of young people crossing the borders of their country in order to participate in an education programme is still at relatively low levels.
This is linked, among other things, to various practices and omissions on the part of the Member States, which directly or indirectly restrict the mobility of young Europeans.
The European Quality Charter for Mobility, if correctly applied by the Member States, may make an important contribution towards lifting these obstacles, by offering adequate support for administrative assistance to people on the move, which will include, among other things, suitable preparation prior to departure, the provision of information and assistance, social security, resident's permit, housing and the facility to transfer grants and loans to the host country.
At the same time, it is especially important for the experience acquired through these programmes to be recognised on returning to the country of origin.
Particular attention also needs to be paid to safeguarding equal opportunities for participants.
Within this framework, use of the Europass must also be strengthened.
To close, I should like to extend my especial congratulations to the rapporteur, MrsÂ Prets, and to the other rapporteurs because, thanks to her work, the European Quality Charter for Mobility will be given more quickly into the service of European citizens.
Â Â  Mobility in training and employment within the European Union is important in raising employment levels among European citizens.
It can improve interâconnectedness, bring about ever closer cooperation and promote knowledge of other nations and languages.
As far as education is concerned, cooperation is improving, although funding is still too low.
If we want to attain better results, however, we must also make arrangements for higher quality education.
If all that companies see in the organisation of programmes for improved mobility is a higher workload without any added value they will not strive to make such programmes a success.
In their eyes these programmes will only appear to create more work, increase their costs in arranging mentoring, and leak information to their competitors.
If the mobility of workers is to be increased, suitable incentives need to be offered to employees working for companies and organisations.
Of course, appropriate measures will be needed to encourage them.
We also need to raise employeesâ awareness, so that they become familiar with the opportunities and advantages of mobility.
To this end, lists of organisations wishing to take part in the process need to be drawn up, but, at the same time, institutions responsible for the preparation and promotion of such lists should be established.
Moreover, employees are still facing difficulties in having their qualifications and skills recognised in other countries.
In many countries, students and employees are already successfully using Europass, the use of which also needs to be expanded and improved.
Knowledge is an asset and the best investment we can make in order to meet the challenges of the future.
Â Â  . I too am pleased that we have been able to prepare and submit the charter for the vote this year, a year of mobility in the European Union, because this is an important contribution.
I agree, of course, that a recommendation does not have the power of a binding instrument.
Developments so far have demonstrated, however, that the numerous recommendations adopted to date in this particular area have resulted in progress towards specific goals, benchmarks and the fulfilment of agreements; as a result, we can see a broad range of activities pertaining to the Bologna or Copenhagen processes.
IÂ would like to confirm that not only today, as the Committee on Culture and Education submits several important reports, but also over the recent months and even years the momentum of development in the field of culture and education has been very strong.
As MrsÂ Hennicot-Schoepges has pointed out, a common Europe needs more culture and more education.
I believe that this is the direction in which we are moving.
When the recommendation is adopted, it will advance coordination, transparency and culture, the evaluation of feedback concerning the effects of mobility and the conditions prevailing in individual countries and institutions.
I for one would like to express my gratitude and assure you that I am prepared to take follow-up steps, especially towards implementation.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow.
Â Â  There can be no doubt that increased cohesion between European citizens depends on their mobility, mutual acquaintance, understanding and acceptance of cultural diversity.
Knowledge of languages and recognition of educational methods and systems are crucial to fostering the mobility of European citizens.
Vocational training is a particularly important aspect of this, and one which brings us closer to achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy.
Considering the issue under discussion from this point of view, I would encourage Member States of the Union to:
1. Create the conditions necessary for at least two of the national languages of the Member States of the Union to be taught at secondary school level, in addition to the mother tongue.
2. Ensure vocational training is provided with the support of local economic bodies and organisations, as these are best placed to understand the economic needs of their country.
The development of cooperation between relevant bodies in EU countries will allow them to work with their governments to devise and take responsibility for vocational training tailored to the needs of the whole EU.
3.
Introduce a twin-track training system at the earliest opportunity. This means devoting half the time to theory and half to practical vocational training.
The so-called old Fifteen and the new Member States of the EU are equally responsible for efforts to promote increased mobility.
In addition, appropriate financial support is essential to achieve greater mobility and better vocational training within the EU.
Â Â  â The next item is the report (A6â0262/2006) by MrsÂ TrÃŒpel, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council on key competences for lifelong learning (COM(2005)0548 â C6-0375/2005 â 2005/0221(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, as I said to Mr Sifunakis, this is a special group of reports confirming that cultural education gets a momentum in these discussions.
I would first of all like to express my gratitude to Mrs TrÃŒpel of the Committee on Culture and Education, but also to the other committees involved in this report because others were engaged, and also to the political groups for their constructive discussions with the Presidency and with the Commission that have led us to the agreement on this recommendation on key competences.
All institutions have made efforts in order to find a balanced text and to allow a first reading agreement.
We all agreed on the importance of this proposal for European citizens and for developing consistent and comprehensive lifelong learning strategies which should help Europe to fulfil its goal of becoming a Europe of knowledge, a knowledge-friendly Union.
The purpose of this recommendation is to identify and define the skills that everyone needs for living, learning and working in a knowledge society.
It covers the traditional skills such as literacy and information communication technologies â digital grammar â but it also goes beyond them by including skills which are important for citizenship, for living together in more and more varied societies.
I believe that this recommendation after approval should be translated as quickly as possible into concrete measures in order to help people in their studies and training.
Our aim is to improve citizensâ employability, job opportunities and chances for the future.
I think that a lot of work was done, especially by Mrs TrÃŒpel and her colleagues, to analyse, discuss and amend our initial proposal.
As a result of the successful negotiations, I think a number of clarifications and improvements have been made, while keeping the text short and concise.
I think that the recommendation now better addresses the literacy problem and the need for equal opportunities, the need for procedures to validate skills and to evaluate achievements.
Target groups now include those with low skills and specific groups such as people returning to work; moreover, a number of definitions of competences have been clarified.
This report, together with some other reports and with the programme which we will have from New Year 2007 for lifelong learning, could create much better conditions for the value of knowledge, for the value of qualifications and for a knowledge-friendly Europe.
I appreciate the strong support in this Parliament â whether we speak about the programme or legislative tools â for education and learning and training policies.
I would like to thank you all for your cooperation in achieving this base for a recommendation and also I look forward to further support when we come to implementation.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Commissioner FigeÄŸ for his introductory remarks, and also for having so clearly summed up the spirit of this agreement at first reading, and explained the improvements in the text that our joint efforts helped make possible, pointing out that, ambitious though it is, it is now more sensitive to social factors and more balanced, which is a triumph for our joint endeavour.
Looking back briefly, let me say that the recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning takes as its starting point the changed state of the world, with a globalised economy in which Europe stands a chance only if we provide our people with better education and training, which is why education policy is meant to be â and must be â an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy.
Being a continent without much in the way of its own raw materials, our chances of having a future in a globalised economy are closely tied up with the resources of education and research; it is in peopleâs qualities and skills that our future potential is to be found, and that is why the Member States and the European Union must invest more in education and clarify their thinking about what skills are actually needed in a knowledge-based society.
That is the purpose of the recommendations on the eight key competences, and I will repeat that these are no more than recommendations.
The key competences are: firstly, communication in one's mother tongue; secondly, communication in foreign languages; thirdly, competences in maths, science and technology; fourth, digital competence; fifth, learning to learn; sixth, interpersonal, intercultural and social competences, and civic competence; seventh, entrepreneurship, and the eighth is cultural expression.
All of them are needed for social cohesion, employability and personal development.
It is intended that the Member States should be supported making policies enabling all young people, once their basic education is completed, to possess sufficient key competences to be able to embark on adult life, and adults to develop these competences in line with the latest knowledge throughout their lives.
The key competences are not ranked in any kind of hierarchy; while they are all equal in value, they do of course overlap, and they all contribute towards a successful life in a knowledge-based society.
These competences are defined as a combination of knowledge, skills and attitudes.
It is the key competences that we all need if we are to enjoy personal satisfaction in the knowledge society, that we need for our own personal development, for active participation, social integration and employment.
The concept of mankind underpinning this definition of key competences bears the stamp of humanism, and what breathes life into this recommendation is the idea that competences are not to be considered solely in terms of the uses to which they can be put, but that education is always of value in itself as well.
This concept of key skills includes such attitudes as critical thinking, creativity, the seizing of initiative, problem-solving, the willingness to take risks, decision-making and entrepreneurial flair.
As I see it, we have, politically speaking, opted for the right approach in giving the Member States these definitions as guidelines for their educational policies, thereby enabling them to prepare themselves better for the future.
My particular concern was that it should, in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, be made clear that, no matter how ambitious these key skills are â for we must all keep on learning if we are to succeed and be content in a knowledge-based society â the social aspect must not be forgotten, for not everyone starts from the same point or with the same opportunities.
That is why it is particularly important to help and support people with learning difficulties by reason of their background or social position, those who have dropped out of school, people with poor literacy skills, the long-term unemployed or people who want to get back to work after a long break, not least â and in particular â women returning to work after having children.
All these circumstances need to be taken into account if people are to be given the specific help they need to make use of their educational opportunities.
Following a number of rounds of negotiations with the Council, we were able to agree on a recommendation that is socially aware and emphasises gender equality, while at the same time being very ambitious.
I regard this compromise as a good one, and so my recommendation to all the Members of this House is that they adopt this text in the version agreed at first reading.
The negotiations were constructive and interesting, and for that I want to extend the warmest of thanks to the Members of this House, to the Commission and to the Council.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, over the past year, 10% of all adults in the European Union took part in further education â far too few in terms of the adequacy of the skills needed in an age of globalisation.
People need to learn at every stage of life; key competences need to be acquired and constantly refreshed â such things as command of oneâs mother tongue and of foreign languages, technical and mathematical expertise, social skills and awareness of other cultures.
Help is available from the European level to develop these skills and thereby help make individuals more employable.
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs adopted â unanimously, indeed â my opinion, in which we had achieved compromises across party lines.
My concern was with something to which the Commission draft does not yet give much emphasis, namely better provision for disadvantaged groups, such as people with disabilities, the long-term unemployed and those who dropped out of school early, all of whom find difficulties placed in their way when it comes to acquiring new skills on their own initiative.
If they are to make up for what they lack, they need to be provided with something tailor-made for them.
Young people on housing estates with high levels of unemployment feel abandoned and frustrated too; they need psychological support and special help if they are to gain self-confidence and be motivated to work to improve the conditions under which they and their families live.
The object of lifelong learning is the acquisition of key competences in order, not only to adapt oneself to change, but also, and in particular, to be an active agent of change.
Our committee is in favour of these competences being tested every three years at national, regional and local level, and the results of these tests being published, for only then will it become clear in which areas real progress has been achieved.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, lifelong learning and education are an important part of the Lisbon Strategy.
This is an important part of European competitiveness.
The point of education is to ensure that our citizens have work.
Education is a matter that the Member States have to take decisions about, but if the EU and its Member States want to guarantee jobs for their citizens, as well as competitiveness, all our citizens should be included, and investments of time and money should be made in lifelong learning.
I wish briefly to raise two matters.
We need to pay particular attention to middle-aged women, and secondly teenage boys.
Middle-aged women are at a disadvantage, as they do not receive adequate training.
This results in their not being able to find work either.
The other subject which I wish to draw attention to is teenage boys.
More and more, large numbers of teenage boys all over Europe leave school straight after finishing secondary education, and this leads to unemployment.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a recommendation puts forward a European reference tool for key competences of lifelong learning.
The recommendation should help to improve the quality of life for all EU citizens.
In other words, it can help hundreds of millions of people.
Given those numbers, it is extremely difficult to create a structure and definition of key competences that is optimal, well-balanced, appropriate and user-friendly and that would also meet expectations, help integrate people into society, and contribute to the fulfilment of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment.
The recommendation attempts to define the skills that will form the modern profile of the European citizen, skills that all EU citizens could and should be able to achieve.
I feel this is a lofty ambition and that it is a long way from being fulfilled.
As a reference tool, this document should prove useful.
Its clear weakness is, of course, that it attempts to profile the citizen in all the complex aspects of life, yet without defining a hierarchy of the competences involved.
Just as every scientific project has different goals and different methods for achieving those goals, the target competences of an integrated social nature should be identified; in this case, for example, I refer to relations between people and relations between cultures, or business skills and the more methodical competences that lead to the achievement of goals.
I mention the relationship to scientific projects deliberately, because competences in the field of science, including scientific principles and methods, are among the key competences.
The significance of key competences is all the greater in relation to an information society and a knowledge-based society.
I feel there is a lack of emphasis here on how society must be based on mutual respect and democracy.
For me, the social principle is a priority and I regard peopleâs ability to live together as the most important competence.
I wish to congratulate MrsÂ TrÃŒpel, as she has made a very positive contribution to the quality of this document.
Â Â  . Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to MrsÂ TrÃŒpel for the outstanding cooperation, which smoothed the path towards agreement at first reading.
Globalisation presents us with huge challenges; ordinary people are obliged to adapt themselves with ever-greater speed and flexibility to new conditions, and in this, education â in both the social and economic sense â acquires strategic significance.
If you want equality of opportunity in Europe, you must ensure that education is made accessible to all and that disadvantages â whether resulting from personal, social, cultural or economic circumstances â are minimised, and this is particularly relevant in view of the forthcoming âYear of Equal Opportunities for Allâ.
In view of the Lisbon Strategyâs ambitious goal of making Europe the worldâs most dynamic knowledge-based economic area, making outsiders of wide swathes of the population is something we cannot afford, and so we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, welcome the reference framework that MrsÂ TrÃŒpel has outlined, which includes the eight key competences.
It is particularly such disadvantaged groups as those whose parental homes or lack of primary education denied them the opportunity of secure and sound vocational training who must not be excluded.
People with learning disabilities, those who dropped out of school, the long-term unemployed and those returning to work after having a family â which means primarily women â not to mention older people, migrants and the disabled, must be supported in their endeavours by targeted policies and programmes, such as those for lifelong learning, although we are well aware that the regulation of education systems is largely a matter for the Member States and is also highly diverse.
It is only recently that educational matters in Germany have, by means of the reform of federalism, been transferred from the national level and handed over to the regions, and so I urge that agreement be speedily reached on a European frame of reference.
To take a narrowly and pettily national view of education and of lifelong learning would be to capitulate in the face of the challenges of todayâs world, our response to which will, at the end of the day, determine whether the European economic and social model proves to be a success or a failure.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on this excellent report on key competences for lifelong learning.
Eight competences are listed in the report, but I personally believe that the fifth competence, âlearning to learnâ, is one of the more important, because lifelong learning is a process.
It enables us not only to adapt to change but also to manage change, and I believe it helps us effect change.
In this context, it not only contributes to achieving the Lisbon objectives or to coping with globalisation, but also greatly enhances our quality of life.
Education is not just about knowledge and jobs: it is also about the development of the whole person.
Lifelong learning is an enabling process.
It often gives people a second chance or, indeed, a third chance, or simply another chance.
As a former teacher of 20 years, I am fully aware that formal schooling is just one part of education and that lifelong learning should be a natural continuation of that process.
It is crucial that lifelong learning is accessible to all and that realistic, practical and accessible opportunities are available so that citizens may acquire basic skills or indeed enhance their existing skills.
In this context, appropriate provision should be made to include, in particular, those with special needs, early school-leavers, people with a disability, the long-term unemployed and those with poor literacy or numeracy skills.
A recent survey in my own area of North Leitrim, West Cavan, indicated low levels of literacy among men in rural areas in particular.
This needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency, in particular because it is crucial to realise that poor literacy skills act as a barrier to political participation.
I agree with a previous speaker that is not just an educational issue but a fundamental democratic one.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I am always glad when we discuss educational policy, for we are then all thinking along the same lines and trying to make progress.
We very rarely disagree about culture and education, and that is terrific; the only thing is that we have no money, and that is a problem that we all have to deal with, so I am glad that we have been able to roll out the mobility charter as part of the new lifelong learning programme and are, today, discussing the key competences, which â since this is an area in which we have no power â can be seen only as recommendations.
What we can do, though, is make suggestions.
A week ago, I was in Sarajevo at a major conference on lifelong learning, at which we discussed key competences â a concept that everyone is taking on board.
I think it sends out a wonderful signal when we make such suggestions and countries that are not yet in the European Union act on them.
Striking a positive note, I would like to observe that this will provide a frame of reference for key competences, which make it possible for people to adapt themselves to a changing labour market in a knowledge-based society.
I would also like to say how glad I am that this proposal advances the development of national strategies for lifelong learning and thus also curriculum reforms, while also, of course, promoting the standardisation of adult and continuing education in the Member States.
I also welcome the recommendation relating to the inclusion of people with special needs, about which much has been said, and about how to bring the European dimension into civic competences, which means how to impart knowledge of our European history and foster awareness of our European cultural identity.
I would suggest that you buy a copy of the Franco-German history books that have been on the market for the past three months, and which are wonderful in the way they show what European identity means.
Finally, I would like to urge that we should not, on the basis of this recommendation, indulge in excessively utopian fantasies of what 2010 is going to be like; superlatives are not, in essence, of any use to us.
Let us instead build on it a realistic possibility for all members of the public to acquire basic skills and develop them.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, as a country, the Republic of Estonia, which was restored fifteen years ago, is a winner.
Shock therapy ensured Estoniaâs rapid return to the European cultural and economic area.
But Estonian society has split into winners and losers.
Among the working population, the winners are the young people, who in this new situation quickly acquired the necessary diploma and skills.
The losers are those who are nearing pension age.
They were considered relics who could not be retrained.
The acquisition of the eight key competencies proposed by the commission would definitely make it easier for workers to adapt to the changing requirements in the labour market.
American workers change professions an average of three times during their lifetimes.
This will soon become common in Europe as well.
With the increase in life expectancy, a forty-five-year-old worker will be only half way through his or her career.
This means new initiatives in middle age, although age discrimination is still undoubtedly a reality for workers in middle and lower-level jobs throughout the world.
In introducing the system of lifelong learning, we must change societal perception.
The eight key competencies must be given a content that would give workers confidence in the future; a confidence arising from their belief in their own ability to develop.
At the same time, employers must be encouraged to invest in experienced people from outside.
Europe must become accustomed to lifelong learning as an everyday phenomenon and an integral part of working life; otherwise, the achievement of the Lisbon objectives will only be wishful thinking.
Â Â  . I very much appreciate this atmosphere and the obvious consensus regarding the need for more and better investments in education.
This report, this recommendation concerning key competences, is about using the same funds more efficiently so as to ensure better outcomes.
Last year there were six million student dropouts in the European Union.
This is an enormous number.
IÂ believe that this number alone should be enough to make us focus more on what subjects are taught and how they are taught, on curriculum content and on improving the supply side, as our schools all too often produce young graduates who join the ranks of the unemployed.
Let me make just a few observations for everyone to consider.
This understanding of key competences implies a kind of equilibrium and a single space both for economic competitiveness and social cohesion or social responsibility.
The same argument can be used regarding the relationship between the humanities and the natural sciences.
Both are necessary.
I believe that the key competences reflect this.
As MrsÂ Pack has said, this serves as a basis of reform for many countries in the Western Balkans, the new Member States, and even in the old ones.
It is a good thing that we can stimulate and in a way unify this process and progress towards modernising educational content.
I would also like to underscore what MrsÂ Harkin has said, namely that the key competence is learning to learn rather than wait for encyclopaedic knowledge to be acquired in school; being able to handle information, experience and an environment which are increasingly more complex and more global.
In addition, the cultural faculty for perceiving and expressing oneself, as well as interpersonal and intersocial relations are extremely important in shaping personalities and mature citizens.
I would therefore like to thank MrsÂ TrÃŒpel again for her excellent presentation of the committeeâs position.
I believe that this will be reflected in the vote.
I am looking forward to more progress in implementing the key competences and skills.
This is a process.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â In the current context of globalisation, the world of work, which has become complex, multifaceted and subject to high-speed changes, is a source of insecurity and anxiety.
New ways of working, manufacturing, innovating and trading are forcing workers to continually call into question their own knowledge and skills.
In order to reconcile these increasingly harsh economic objectives with our humanist vision of work, lifelong learning, as a principle upheld in the majority of our national laws, is the subject of a broad consensus.
There are already countless official orders, including European ones, but let us not just make do with the slogan!
We are still a long way from putting into practice and systematising lifelong learning.
All too often, it is either a legal obligation that companies enter into without really thinking about the added value of such actions and without any real long-term policy; or a formula used in an emergency to respond to social problems.
Thus, work must now be done at national and local level to develop, on the one hand, effective learning facilities, and, on the other, a real commitment on the part of businesses and employees.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Beazley on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education on initiatives to complement school curricula providing appropriate support measures to include the European dimension (2006/2041(INI)) (A6-0267/2006).
Â Â  . Mr President, the purpose of this report is very clear and specific.
It calls upon the Council of Ministers to give a fresh impetus to the inclusion and enhancement of the European dimension in school curricula.
That is a national competence and the national, regional, and educational authorities in our Member States vary.
However, this Parliament is totally within its rights â and indeed has a duty â to remind the Council of Ministers that it passed a resolution back in May 1988 calling for the enhancement of the European dimension in education.
It is the virtually unanimous feeling of the committee that it is high time that this was updated.
So what are the practical steps?
First of all, the European dimension should not simply be a vague platitude, a notion that governments pay lip-service to but in actual fact do very little to achieve.
I hope attention has been drawn to this in committee and I hope that the Finnish Presidency will be able to confirm by correspondence that this item will be included on the agenda of the next Council of Education Ministers meeting in Brussels on 13Â November.
I look forward to receiving confirmation of that.
We think that there should be a discussion by our ministers, specifically about what the European dimension entails.
As far as Parliamentâs committee is concerned, we have looked at two aspects.
Firstly, in citizenship classes, what used to be called âcivicsâ: an understanding of what the EU is, how its institutions operate and, in particular, the democratic input of individuals, interests and concerns in the decision-making; and second, and equally important, an understanding of our common cultural and historical heritage.
Parliament held a hearing on the teaching of history and its European dimension two years ago.
Of course, national stories are the foundation stone of an understanding of our past, but it is impossible to teach the classical empires of Greece and Rome, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Napoleonic wars, the Industrial Revolution, the struggles between democracies and dictatorship without reference to the European context.
We also dwell specifically on the importance of language teaching.
That has declined very significantly in my own country in recent years.
In the last two years, the number of 16-year-old students studying languages has dropped by as much as 14%, as our government has made it an option rather than a compulsory element of the curriculum.
Looking across Europe, our understanding and our use of languages is very imbalanced.
As English increasingly becomes a âlingua francaâ, for those of us with English as our mother tongue that is a real problem in terms of motivating students to study and teachers to teach foreign languages.
And yet without that cultural understanding that goes with an understanding of language, how on earth are we going to be able to cooperate properly and enrich the content of our educational syllabuses?
With regard to teacher awareness, I mentioned that there is a disparity, not only across the EU but within Member States.
Some schools pay considerable attention to the European dimension, fully engaging in European exchange programmes, for example, using not simply resources from the EU but national and independent resources, television and newspaper archive material, while others concentrate hardly at all on the European dimension.
Therefore we have a âscatterâ effect.
It is important that teacher training courses should offer potential teachers the opportunity to be aware of what teaching materials are available and how they can fit into curricula.
I draw your attention to paragraph 13 of the report, which we are grateful to Mrs Novak for incorporating.
It states that: âThe European dimension complements national content.
It neither replaces nor supplants it.â
There is a very small fringe of people who would attack this report and say that it is all about propaganda, trying to force people to see only the rosy and beneficial side of the European Union.
I would return that taunt by saying that it is they who would seek to deny information, who are actually distorting the picture, depriving our students of the opportunity to make a balanced judgment of their own and to consider what their career opportunities might be, because they have had the full information given to them consistently, throughout their time at school.
This report is a call to the Council of Ministers for action.
We look forward to seeing the positive results.
Â Â  . Mr President, once again, this is a very timely initiative, as we are preparing for the launch of new seven-year programmes.
In future this particular dimension could be much more evident in cooperation on education and training policies than previously.
This report could also be inspirational, therefore, for the Council and the Member States.
That falls within their competence and responsibility, of course, but we should at least reflect on where we are and what can be done to improve this educational dimension.
In his report, Mr Beazley touches on serious and specific problems.
The Commission shares those concerns.
In the last joint report by the Council and the Commission on progress in the Education and Training 2010 programme, we concluded, for example, that âdespite some promising initiatives on mobility and participation in EU programmes, there is still a lack of national strategies on the European dimension in educationâ.
Policies that would ensure that, after initial education, young people have the knowledge and competences they need as European citizens â not only as tourists but as citizens â are piecemeal and fragmented.
It is also true that the term âEuropean dimensionâ has a different meaning.
On the one hand, it refers to the concept of Europe, its civilisation, democratic values and projects.
However, it can also be seen as European citizenship or European identity, with rights and duties as citizens, active participation and a sense of belonging to Europe.
It is thus important to have clear views on how to integrate the European dimension in school curricula and how to provide schools with both the material and the opportunities to learn about Europe in practice.
The Commission has already started this work.
Among our programmes, Comenius, for example, supports projects with partners from different countries working on developing the European dimension.
The âEuropean SchoolNetâ is a good example of an interactive and virtual tool for networking and for dissemination.
The Youth Programme also aims to familiarise young people with the concept of a European dimension in their lives through exchanges and especially through voluntary service.
Transnational projects like these are an excellent example of the European dimension in practice.
The recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning, which we have just discussed, is an important step forward.
It highlights a number of skills and attitudes needed for active European citizenship as part of social, civic and cultural competences.
Similarly, our work with national experts on teacher training stresses the importance of European knowledge, mobility and networking.
These are a very important part of teachersâ professional development.
I fully agree with Mr Beazley.
The Commission shares the view that much more needs to be done to raise awareness of the many good national and European initiatives.
The Commission continues to work with Member States, for example co-financing projects within Comenius and supporting multilingualism, and we will encourage Member States to develop the European dimension as part of their lifelong learning strategies.
Moreover, my colleague Mrs WallstrÃ¶m and I recently agreed on a number of initiatives to be taken in this area.
Therefore, for all these reasons, I see this report as providing major input into the Commissionâs reflections on the issues of education and citizenship.
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Beazley report presents us with a concept that is difficult to pin down, namely that of the European dimension.
If we wish to bring a sense of belonging to the complex reality that we call Europe, the corresponding European dimension must be conveyed to the citizens, in particular the youngest citizens, because it is a vital prerequisite for European citizenship in the true sense of the term.
Young people must be helped to understand this, and to absorb the fact that they belong to a shared tapestry of civilisation that gives rise, on the one hand, to diverse cultures and national entities, and, on the other, to a particular view of Europe around the world that, historically, has changed the course of the human race.
There are issues of great interest to the construction of the EU that go hand in hand with the European dimension, such as scientific and technological progress, which is as much an integral part of Europe as of any other part of the world.
There are other areas relating to a specifically European dimension that stand out, such as the history, the human and physical geography, the languages, and the cultural and artistic heritage in its tangible and intangible forms.
The national aspects of these realities have often led to the kinds of partnerships and relationships, and antagonism and conflict, that can be found in relations between neighbours.
Accordingly, they are arranged in strips that cut across national borders.
Yet there is a whole that is the matrix in which all of these elements coexist in a framework of dynamic interaction, and it is this matrix that enables us to call ourselves Europeans.
This is the dimension of which we speak.
It will be no easy task to reflect this dimension in school curricula.
It is therefore necessary to define the priorities, find the right methods, recast programmes, prepare teaching materials, and train teachers and educators in each country.
In common with the European project itself, this will be a gradual, multipolar process which will not always run smoothly, but it must begin as soon as possible.
The European dimension is the European added value and what we are talking about is more Europe.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recommendation we are now debating is, together with the previous two, a major step forward in making young people and citizens more aware of, and better informed about, the importance of the European Union.
It is a fact that the Union currently has few powers in the area of education.
While some Member States â only a few â include some appropriate content on European affairs in their syllabuses or educational programmes, others are still a very long way from introducing this element into the curricula taught at their educational establishments.
In view of this situation, I consider it necessary for us to develop at a European level what is laid down in ArticleÂ 149 of the Treaty, which states that the Union should develop the European dimension in education, particularly through lifelong learning and the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the European Union.
The Commissioner has already mentioned some examples that are leading in that direction, but this report must help to strengthen this requirement even more at a Community level, not only in order to provide the necessary skills in the area of European citizenship, but also to help citizens learn about the Unionâs policies and institutions.

There is also another reason, which is to raise awareness about European citizenship; this would lead to better communication between citizens and institutions; this communication is currently showing symptoms of ill health that will result in a number of not very helpful consequences.
MrÂ Figelâ, I call on the Commission to work even harder to specify what is meant by this so-called âEuropean dimensionâ in education, so that agreement can then be reached in the Council on how this commitment may be adopted within each individual education system.
Lastly, I should like to point out the importance of language teaching â as has already been mentioned â in bringing young people closer to the various different cultures in the Union, as well as the importance of exchanging best practices, especially in the area of teacher training, since teachers are a key group in achieving the objectives that we have set ourselves.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I myself would also like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, MrÂ Beazley, for this excellent report.
This is a very important subject.
We have to ensure that there is not just a regional and national dimension, but also a European dimension to our childrenâs identity and thinking, and that they understand what kind of community of values they belong to and what sort of intellectual heritage they have.
In spite of its mosaic of cultures, Europe has common values based on those of the Christian religion.
These values are also based on the Hellenistic heritage and Roman law.
Today they are mainly visible in the shape of democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion.
It is important to teach children and young people these values from a young age, to promote them and adopt them as a full immersion subject in their education, so that we might understand what it is to be a European in an ever-integrating world, and so that we might be proud of that, as well as of our national roots and our continent.
Â Â  . Mr President, my thanks to Mr FigeÄŸ, and to Mr Beazley for his report.
The making of the European Union is a complex process in which, according to our point of view, education plays a fundamental role.
It is impossible to establish European citizenship without the active support of a proper education system.
As we know, many of our views about history, cultures, society, etc., are forged during our crucial school years.
The education system happens to be a means for a state coercion, many times at the expense of cultural plurality and diversity.
For this reason, history for instance, has been traditionally very highly mediatised by the state.
The consequences of state-based education can be very counterproductive for our purposes and our values.
For example, chauvinism and unilingualism: nearly 50% of European citizens are only able to speak fluently their own language.
We need to overcome such a state-based education.
Introducing the European dimension in our education systems can be a fundamental contribution to avoiding national chauvinism, to improve citizensâ command of several languages, to strengthen respect for plurality and diversity, and to build a common European identity.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that in the Czech Republic at least two foreign languages are taught from primary school age, and in the higher education system, for example at the University of Ostrava, Europeanism has become part of the social sciences curriculum.
I should like to draw attention to one aspect of Europeanism that does not receive the emphasis that it deserves, however, and that is tolerance.
The rapporteur mentions the need for agreement on shared history, which in my view is an idealistic target that might be attainable in the distant future.
One thing that can be achieved, however, is tolerance, which is essential to the existence of the EU.
The EU Member States cannot have one single overview of their history, because the success of one nation has often meant the failure of another.
This view has changed only recently, however.
In Europe, there is no nation that can stand above the continentâs history, providing a viewpoint that would suit everyone without offending anyone.
The idea of a shared European history can be at best only a compromise.
A more realistic goal would be to understand the history of other countries and their impartial version of events.
Showing tolerance of historical and cultural differences would be a first step for Europeans towards sharing their values with other countries and cultures around the world.
At the same time, tolerance and understanding will become the basis for defining shared European values.
Young people should learn foreign languages, but should also recognise the culture and history of other countries.
The job of teachers is to offer this kind of knowledge as a set of values worthy of the same respect as oneâs own values.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, before discussing the European educational model and its implementation, we must first ask ourselves what kind of model we have in mind, whom it is meant to benefit, and what purpose it is meant to serve.
Is it to be a model which encourages the all-round development of free individuals, and the promotion of all their skills and interests?
Or is it to be a model intended to produce globalised people who are trained for everyday life but lack creativity and imagination, people who possess little knowledge but are capable of carrying out the tasks they are assigned with?
I am in favour of the first model, because it is the only one which allows human beings the opportunity to fulfil themselves and the freedom of thought necessary to enable them to enrich the world with their creativity.
Accordingly, the upbringing and education of an individual should be based on national and family values, and offer the possibility of freely drawing on the culture of other nations.
We need a Europe of homelands, in which every nation and individual can feel secure.
Any effort to create a globalised society with one single approved culture, in which it is possible to communicate in only a few languages would make Europeâs intellectual and economic development grind to a halt.
Therefore, the right European model of education is one that will protect the traditions of all its nations and draw on them to benefit individuals and promote their development.
Â Â  . Mr President, may I remind you of what our rapporteur said on 12 October last year: âGovernments know nothing about education; they frustrate the profession of teachersâ.
What frightens me is why he thinks the EU can do any better.
Mr Beazley is a former teacher and MP and cannot be unaware that the United Kingdom Education Act 1996, brought in by his own party, forbids the promotion of partisan political views in schools in the United Kingdom.
The EU is a political project â a project which has failed to persuade millions of adults, as shown by the results of the French and Dutch referendums last year.
Having failed at that level, Mr Beazley now wants to try persuading our children of the benefits of the EU instead.
I am reminded of a quotation: âGive me a child at the age of seven, and he is mine for lifeâ.
This, like so much else from this Committee, is sheer one-sided propaganda, and I will not tolerate or support it.
Â Â  Mr President, the document under discussion refers to a European dimension in education and the inclusion of European content in education.
These terms have not been defined, however.
There is a reference to shared history and cultural heritage, but that is not defined either.
Our shared history consists mostly of wars against each other, but what does our common cultural heritage amount to?
Let us endeavour to summarise it.
What is the nature of our common positive values?
If we stop to consider this question we must acknowledge that we are bound together by Greek culture, Roman law and Christian ethics.
Everything European is based on these key foundations which define Europe itself.
It follows that we should promote the teaching of Greek and Latin, the classical languages.
We should also promote teaching of the Christian contribution to the dominant cultural standards of Europe, by which I mean art, architecture, our way of life, and in particular our family and social lives.
Sadly, however, this House is doing its utmost to erase everything Christian from its documents.
What is more, a clearly anti-Christian stance is being promoted.
There was an outraged reaction in the Chamber when the Polish Education Minister withdrew the Council of Europeâs textbook from schools, which recommended promoting homosexuality in schools, with allegations that European values were being rejected.
This document is empty and useless without definitions of the European dimension, European values and European content.
Â Â  . Never before have the topics of European identity, European values, European borders and European citizenship been discussed as broadly as they are today.
Granted, we are not able to define these notions precisely, but this debate is a manifestation of how Europe has changed.
Where previously Europe was engaged not only in discussing, but also in controlling the production of coal and steel so as to avert the risk of war, today the discussion is about Europe itself and the world around it.
I believe that this is a positive shift.
Education about what Europe has been through and the environment in which it exists is very important for its own development and for the world of the 21st century in which Europe may â and must â play a more important and positive role than in the 20th century, when it was a source of tragedy, war, totalitarianism and other woes on a global scale.
Ignorance and indifference tend to be major sources of intolerance.
They pave the way for propaganda and the manipulation of public opinion, as well as the opinions of individuals.
I therefore believe that education about Europeâs past and present, and the cultures that we experience and live in, is an important precondition for a more peaceful and cohesive Europe that will continue to develop its legal system and views on values and culture.
I believe that Europe will set about doing this in more peaceful and tolerant ways than when it was engaged in mutual annihilation.
I would like to thank Christopher Beazley again for this own-initiative report and to express the hope that this topic may become a subject of debate among the Member States, for it is they that are responsible for determining the subject matter and organisation of education, something that will not be regarded as superfluous but rather as a highly important complementary aspect of education here in the single legal, economic and cultural space of an enlarged Europe.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report by MrÂ Mann on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the creation of a European Qualifications Framework (2006/2002(INI)) (A6-0248/2006).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, ladies and gentlemen, since we in the European Union are unable to compete with the low wages and minimal social standards of emerging economies, we must instead be consistent in developing our potential for high-quality work, and for that training in skills and continuing education are essential.
In March 2005, the education ministers of the twenty-five EU Member States declared their willingness to modernise their national systems in order to enable individuals to adapt themselves to the ever more exacting demands of the domestic and international markets.

There are still high barriers impeding access to education and training between one institution and another and between Member States, preventing knowledge and skills from being effectively applied, and making qualifications less than transparent, with the consequence that there is not enough recognition of degree and diploma qualifications outside the country in which they were acquired, but the more transparent the school, vocational education and university systems are, the more readily the specific models used in the Member States â for example, the quality of dual system in my own country, Germany, and the value of a master craftsmanâs qualification â can be assessed.
The European Qualifications Framework is a meta-framework with three functions.
Firstly, it is intended to link national and international qualifications.
Secondly, it is intended to ensure that vocational and general educational qualifications are recognised and capable of being recognised and transferred, and, thirdly, it is intended to ensure greater transparency, permeability and mobility.
The European Qualifications Framework is founded upon eight reference levels that categorise learning outcomes, ranging from basic skills for simple tasks to the highly specific competences required for academic education.
At every one of these eight levels, irrespective of the educational route pursued, it must be possible to acquire work-related skills.
This has met with broad approval from the social partners, from chambers of commerce and industry and the governing bodies of crafts and trades, from educational institutions, teachers in vocational colleges, trainees and apprentices and those who train them, and students at schools and colleges, for all of them are aware that the Member Statesâ schemes are not being replaced, but rather extended on the basis of expert knowledge to be implemented on a voluntary basis.
As your Houseâs rapporteur, I have expressed criticism of a number of points in the Commissionâs proposal as representing an excessive emphasis on academic education and taking insufficient account of vocational training.
I still believe that there is an insufficiently clear link to the labour market.
The European Qualifications Framework must have as its goals those of, , growth and employment, as set by Lisbon II, combining on the one hand the competitiveness of businesses and, on the other, the employability of individuals.
The Committee for Employment and Social Affairs shared my objections, and I was very glad to see my colleagues â many of whom are present today â submitting proposals and, apart from three abstentions, voting unanimously to adopt this report.
Among other things, we endorse the revision of the qualifications framework to include the comparability of the outcomes of learning processes, in marked contrast to many previous evaluations, which have considered only the duration of the learning process and the type of qualification gained from it.
What is most important to us is that vocational and academic education should be treated as being of equal value, being two sides of the same coin, namely the Bologna process aimed at creating a common European framework for higher education and the Copenhagen process for enhancing European cooperation in vocational education.
The European Qualifications Framework will succeed only if national qualifications frameworks come into being in all the Member States, if it is then possible to develop them, and if they can be properly coupled to the European Qualifications Framework by 2009.
My hope is that what the Framework contains will be made accessible to the public at large â in which we in this House will certainly play our part â and that the social partners, the providers of education and the institutions will cooperate in good faith.
Only then will the right tools be available for the educational establishments and for working life in the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, this is a package of issues that shows that education and training is getting a momentum.
I am sure that EQF is one of points for the coming years.
When I was asked about the top issues in my portfolio for the next five years, I said that EQF is one of them and so I think we are delivering it now; not only speaking about it.
First of all, I would like to express gratitude to the rapporteur and to the Employment Committee, for the excellent report prepared in consultation with other committees, which reflects the Commissionâs consultation paper from last year.
It gives us the opportunity to reflect the formal proposal adopted this month, because I am sure that lifelong learning and mobility are crucial to our competitiveness and social cohesion in the European Union.
The Commission has always taken positive steps to make progress in these fields.
However, in practice people in Europe still too often face obstacles when they try to move from one country to another to learn or work, and when they want to become citizens more than tourists in the Union.
They also face difficulties when they want to build on previous education and training and move, for example, from vocational education and training into higher education.
The EQF will help to solve that problem.
It will improve transparency and make different national qualifications systems or qualifications frameworks more understandable across Europe.
By helping different systems to talk to each other, it will promote access to education and training and increase mobility for learning or work.
It could also be instrumental outside Europe, because when I was in Moscow or, in June, in Canada, both countries â Russia and Canada â expressed interest in knowing more about this instrument because they would like it to inspire their policies.
We already have legal instruments, such as the directives on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.
The Europass initiative has been mentioned today, which also pursues similar goals.
However, these instruments alone are not sufficient, which is why the EQF is an important further step to improve the situation.
Our proposal already integrates many of the comments and recommendations contained in Mr Mannâs report; I am sure we can agree on that.
I therefore consider that Parliament and the Commission are very much following the same line on this issue.
The document on which you have commented was a consultation paper issued in July last year.
Since then, we have moved further on the road towards a more practical and user-friendly instrument.
Mr Mann is right to say that we should do more on vocational education and training.
I would like to remind you that it came into the treaties in the Treaty of Rome, in 1957; and higher education not until the Maastricht Treaty; in 1999 we started the Bologna process, and only later on the Copenhagen process.
Now we have two parallel processes, which feed well into the European qualifications framework, but we need it to get there in order to start the real implementation of important clauses in our treaties.
We are doing that now: in the Bologna process, 45 countries; in Copenhagen, 32.
Two weeks ago I was in Switzerland and they want to join the Copenhagen process.
So those are good messages for our work.
EQF will provide the full benefit only if correctly implemented by Member States.
They will need to link their qualification systems to the EQF.
I am convinced that our proposal provides the common language and the means to develop the necessary mutual trust, which is the basis for real implementation of such an instrument.
That strategy is also helpful to employers and individuals in comparing qualifications across the Union and across diverse education and training systems.
I am sure that this key initiative is helping people in Europe to face the challenges and reap the benefits of a knowledge-based society.
We are looking forward not only to further discussions but also to further cooperation following the recent adoption of the proposal.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Strategy proposes to speed up the process of modernising the European education and training systems, with the aim of making the European economy the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.
Greater mobility within the labour market and an effective lifelong learning system are the basic, essential conditions for this.
The lack of communication and cooperation among the national authorities and among the training systems at various levels is preventing the skills and knowledge already acquired from being used effectively.
For this reason, we need to promote a certain interplay among the education and qualification systems of the various Member States.
As the Commissioner has mentioned, through DirectiveÂ 36 on the recognition of professional qualifications, for which I was the rapporteur, work has already begun on certain aspects, and the creation of a European Qualifications Framework will naturally supplement and continue it.
This work will be the way to enhance and strengthen mutual trust among the various systems, and will promote mobility and lifelong learning.
It must provide a structure that is flexible and that can be easily integrated with the corresponding national structures, while at the same time upholding the various specific characteristics of those structures.
It must ensure that qualifications relating to vocational education and training are recognisable, compatible and transferable, as MrÂ Mann rightly maintains.
This will mean increasing and improving the exchange of information in terms of titles, qualifications, certificates and professional experience recognised in the Member States.
In its current state, however, and as it is conceived in the Commission proposal, the European Qualifications Framework does not appear at all clear; it needs to be made more understandable, and certain aspects that now appear inconsistent need to be revised.
We therefore suggest that the Commission revise and reformulate its proposal, while nevertheless maintaining the objectives.
Â Â  â () I am pleased to observe that the entire area of life-long education and training has recently moved from a marginalised position into centre stage.
The review of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment and the need to fulfil its goals have been a major incentive.
As early as 2000 an important step was taken in adopting the Education and Training 2010 work programme, aiming not only to improve the quality and efficiency of education and training systems but also to make them readily and broadly accessible.
The proposed concept of the European Qualifications Framework that we are discussing today is a concrete initiative arising from the work programme.
I regard this concept as a constructive incentive that will contribute significantly to transparency in the transfer and recognition of qualifications on a European level.
It should also stimulate national and sectoral reforms for the promotion of lifelong education, while playing a substantial role in fostering the mobility of students and employees.
In todayâs discussion I would like to highlight the new element introduced by the EQR, namely the recognition of unofficial and informal education.
This will alter the approach to evaluation, which has traditionally been based on the duration of education or the type of institution, putting instead more emphasis on performance, knowledge, skill and proficiency.
I would like to thank my fellow MEP, MrÂ Mann, the rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, for his work on the report into the establishment of a European Qualifications Framework, as well as the attending member of the European Commission responsible for Education, Training, Culture and Multilingualism, MrÂ FigeÄŸ, as well as his team who have worked on the policy paper.
It is good news that at its meeting on 5Â September the European Commission endorsed the draft recommendation of the European Parliament and Council establishing the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong education.
I trust that the European Parliament will adopt MrÂ Mannâs report at this plenary session, putting us in a position to debate a new Commission paper on the European Qualifications Framework.
Â Â  . () I consider it an important task of the EU to enact European legislation that will formally and informally enhance the rules regulating the business environment.
Human capital constitutes a key component of that environment; therefore, business associations describe the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as the most positive measure taken by the European Union during this term.
Another major step that deserves particular attention is the establishment of the European Qualifications Framework, which should ensure the transparent treatment of education irrespective of the method of attaining the underlying qualifications.
I would also like to praise the new element, that is, the recognition of formal and informal education, including the acquisition of professional experience.
In this regard I would like to thank my fellow Members, the rapporteurs Messrs Mann, GaÄŸa and ZappalÃ , for drafting a consistent report.
I agree with the rapporteursâ recommendation to simplify and make more transparent the eight-level reference scale that constitutes its basic element.
I believe that although the European Qualifications Framework is voluntary, it will, along with national qualification frameworks, establish a system that will help tackle obstacles in the European Unionâs labour market.
I am convinced that the business sector will also appreciate this initiative by the European Commission, as it will make the diverse national qualification certificates easier to understand, and employers will then be in aÂ position to use the European Qualifications Framework as aÂ reference tool in selecting highly qualified staff on the basis of education, skill and competency.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the European Qualifications Framework, the Union is providing itself with a tool that can certainly be improved, but that is key to developing mobility within the European Union.
The mobility of businesses and European citizens actually opens up a new labour market at Community level.
For all European employees, be they engineers, technicians or manual workers, professional qualifications are the only genuine guarantee of their value in the labour market, both at national and at Community level.
Just as the single currency, the euro, is a shared value in terms of guaranteeing that the economy is flexible and integrated into the Community, we need a shared value for professional qualifications that is recognised on the European labour market.
Businesses and employees both need the shared value of professional qualifications to be recognised.
For businesses, qualifications guarantee an employeeâs level of competence and his or her suitability for the role; for an employee, they guarantee and promote this level of competence wherever he or she is within the European Union.
Whatever our national traditions may be, certification always confirms a personâs ability to do a job and to use the skills necessary to that end.
That ability is the fruit of knowledge acquired, either through training or through work experience.
I should like to emphasise how progress has been made in some of our Member States in terms of validating acquired experience, which, as has been said, complements training.
In the long term, the European Qualifications Framework will have to integrate this process and be open to all forms of recognition.
The next stage will have to consist in making the social partners aware of, and involved in, this process straight away so as to ensure that the EQF is taken into account in the agreements and collective agreements and so as to combine a genuine social guarantee with the flexibility of the labour market.
The value truly placed in employment, MrÂ President, can be seen in employment contracts and pay slips.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said several times this evening, education and training policy is to be decided on a national basis.
That, moreover, is how matters should stay.
As todayâs debate also shows, however, there are many common initiatives under way to develop education and training in Europe through exchanges and cooperation.
These are sound initiatives, and it is important for them to be communicated to a broad range of the population.
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe can sincerely endorse the creation of a European Qualifications Framework, or what is popularly known as the EQF.
This framework is designed to promote the recognition and use of qualifications and skills that have already been acquired and thus to facilitate access to lifelong learning for everyone.
The fact that 32 countries are participating in this form of cooperation makes possible a broadly-based development of education and training and employment opportunities in Europe.
The very fact of concentrating on qualifications already acquired is an important breakthrough.
The focus is on results and actual ability, and not only on the ways in which that ability is acquired.
Proper account is thus being taken of the very different structures for, in particular, vocational education that exist in Europe, and, at the same time, we are setting common targets.
In this connection, I would emphasise MrÂ Mannâs call for us to focus more on vocational education, including continuing education.
It is not only university education we should focus on.
Moreover, it is important to produce a system that is not unduly complicated.
It needs to be simpler and clearer than what was proposed in the working paper.
If EQF is to be a success, it is also important, as the Commissioner has already said, for all the countries to be involved voluntarily and to introduce their own national â or, where relevant, regional â framework systems for assessing qualifications.
It is important to build on the work already done on assessing the quality of education and training and to avoid setting up unnecessary bureaucracy.
It will not be easy, but we are setting ourselves ambitious targets this evening.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, it is surely a very good thing that the Council and the Commission are concerned that skills, abilities and competences acquired at school, in working life or in leisure time, should be, as far as possible, mutually recognised.
I also want to express my high regard for MrÂ Mann, who deserves support for his proposals, particularly his proposal that far greater provision be made for vocational training alongside academic education.
In the one minute available to me, I would just like to say a brief word about the problems with the recognition of qualifications.
The main difficulty is that knowledge and ability are non-material goods, and, as such, very hard to standardise and measure.
People who were very good at school, for example, often get nowhere in day-to-day working life, since the qualities measured and marked in school are often quite different.
If people are going to be successful in working life, they need, above all else, emotional, creative and social competences, nerve, enthusiasm, practical intelligence, tenacity, and the capacity to cope with stress.
These qualities are, alas, not especially called for or encouraged at school, nor, indeed, can they be.
Â Â  . First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his very well drafted and balanced report.
I have no doubt that an effectively functioning European Union employment market is still just a matter of time.
The European qualification framework will be an important step in that direction, creating the preconditions for the formation of a single employment market and a single training environment.
I have no doubt that qualification comparability would not only foster mobility in the labour force, but would impart a different quality to the employment market, by effectively distributing the labour force.
The qualification framework would foster a much closer connection between Member Statesâ national education systems and the requirements of the European Unionâs employment market.
These steps are closely related to the Lisbon Strategy and the Lisbon objectives.
The most recent enlargement created an unprecedented increase in the mobility of the labour force within the European Union.
Jobseekers have travelled from various new Member States in central and eastern Europe to the United Kingdom and Ireland â older Member States, which were the only ones to open their labour markets without restrictions.
In fact, the situation at this moment is unique, as far as assessing the need for the comparability of European qualifications is concerned.
The significant differences in salaries have encouraged thousands of highly-qualified jobseekers from central and eastern Europe to take simple jobs that only demand low-level qualifications.
A study recently carried out by Irelandâs Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment shows that most employees are working in jobs at a lower level of qualifications than their professional training would permit them to do.
A not insignificant number of workers with university degrees work in jobs that require basic training of just a few hours.
Those are the difficulties in comparing education systems that are completely different.
Those are both resources that are lost to the states from which jobseekers come, and wasted resources in the states in which they cannot make use of their professional training.
I hope that the European qualification framework will encourage those Member States between which there is active movement by the labour force to become pioneers in putting the framework into practice and in the comparison of qualifications, and that these Member States will not be the only ones.
Thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to congratulate MrÂ Mann on his interesting report.
Mobility is one of the principles of a common Europe.
The mobility of students and workers can only come about, however, if the problems concerning recognition of certificates and diplomas are finally resolved.
This requires the European Union to set European Qualifications Frameworks.
The work set in train in Bologna, Barcelona, Copenhagen and Maastricht must be carried forward.
We need to ensure that as soon as possible, workers arriving from other Union countries are not told by local administrations that there is work for them but their qualification is not acceptable.
EQFs will improve the quality of training in all Member States of the Union.
They will help rise to the challenges of globalisation, and increase competitiveness on the labour market.
There is also a significant psychological dimension involved.
Recognising someoneâs qualifications underwritten by a vocational certificate or academic diploma amounts to recognising the effort made by the individual concerned to gain an education.
Conversely, there is an element of discrimination and denigration in the refusal to recognise a qualification as equivalent in another Member State.
We must not delude ourselves.
EQFs are not a straightforward matter.
Institutions of higher education and training centres in the same country often find it difficult to reach agreement, so it is hardly surprising if the same happens at Union level.
That is why the decision must be a political one, at Union level, rather than academic in nature.
For example, a Polish certificate in bricklaying should be recognised in Germany and a German one in Poland.
An Oxford degree in psychology should be recognised everywhere, and the same should apply to a psychology degree awarded by a less prestigious university in a smaller country.
Local professional associations should not be able to raise objections.
Yet in Belgium, for example, there is not even a competent body to consider the validity of the qualifications of self-employed Polish painters or bricklayers.
As a result, certain individuals are unable to do certain jobs.
The question of EQFs is particularly important for the citizens of new Member States.
It is they who will be offering their professional qualifications, rather than capital investment, to other Union Member States for the foreseeable future.
A common denominator for capital investment already exists, namely the euro.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that Europe has, during the course of its history, faced many challenges and serious threats, such as unemployment, poverty and job insecurity.
Nonetheless, these worrying trends towards social disruption are not a self-fulfilling prophesy that we should accept fatalistically.
The solutions need to be sought far from perceptions which consider that competitiveness must be achieved by showing disdain for employment.
With respect for European values and our social sensitivities and with knowledge as our epicentre, we can follow a development course, bearing in mind that the globalisation of economic activity, social progress and environmental protection are based on the continuous development of new skills and the use of new technologies.
If we upgrade research centres to pillars of innovation and acquisition of professional experience, we shall make lifelong learning efficient, for the benefit of one and all.
Workers' new skills must meet common European evaluation criteria, thereby expanding their potential for development.
In light of this and with respect both for the idiosyncrasies of the various professional sectors and the idiosyncrasies of the various regions, we need to determine in a clear, explicit and integrated manner the axes and prospects of the European Qualifications Framework, with knowledge as a social, not a commercial commodity at its epicentre.
To close, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Mann.
Â Â  . It is not only the discussion but also the report itself and the atmosphere surrounding qualifications in Europe that constitute a major challenge for us to establish a space with a more European content.
This would mean rules and standards that establish a certain quality, and hence mobility, for citizens.
I would therefore like to emphasise several aspects important to the entire issue.
One is about creating a space, which means not only availability and quality of primary education, higher education and training but also a space for follow-up education, continual or lifelong learning, and for the recognition of unofficial and informal schooling.
The European Qualifications Framework is moving in just that direction.
Secondly, this is a follow-up contribution to what we have already done: the Europass adopted in this Parliament helps make qualifications more transparent, but the Qualifications Framework will be instrumental in making qualifications compatible and comparable, and will thus enable their transfer.
This is a very important shift.
If we manage to adopt it definitively, it will provide a good framework not only for employers and employees but also for education and training providers, as it will open up this space and as a result will bring pressure to bear for improvements in quality.
Openness is all about promoting better-quality education and training.
MrsÂ Jensen has mentioned 32 countries.
I believe that their number will gradually grow as we succeed in developing the Copenhagen Process and the Bologna Process, offering credibility, high standards and guaranteed qualitative parameters.
I am convinced that this will benefit the EU as a whole, as well as its citizens and institutions.
I believe that this will be instrumental in ensuring that a plumber, for example, whether Polish or from another country, is not perceived as a threat but as a very important contributor to mobility and competitiveness in a common Europe.
Let us keep up the good work on this Qualifications Framework.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  â MadamÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to inform Parliament that, this morning, a few kilometres from Kabul, there has been a terrorist attack in which an Italian soldier has been killed and another two European soldiers â two Italian soldiers â have been seriously injured and have been admitted to Kabul hospital.
I believe that it is only right that we express our solidarity with these women and men who are involved in the peace missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon.
Â Â  I am much obliged to you, MrÂ Tajani.
We will pass that on to the President, who, I am sure, will cause those things to be done that need to be done.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0275/2006) by MrÂ Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on services of general interest (2005/2101(INI)).
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, having the President of the Commission present for a debate on an own-initiative report is not an everyday occurrence, for an own-initiative report is not exactly an outstanding event when what we are actually meant to be doing is making laws â although I shall turn to that in a moment.
What your presence here demonstrates is that the Commission is clear in its own mind about how important this issue is in the eyes of the public, and hence, too, in those of the citizensâ representatives here in this House.
It is for that reason that I would like to refer back to a previous President of the Commission, and not just any old President, but Jacques Delors, who, a few months ago, addressing a meeting of the Committee of the Regions, attempted to place services of general interest in the context of the project of European integration.
He told the Committee of the Regions that the work of European integration took three principles as its frame of reference: solidarity, which brings people together and has social, economic and territorial cohesion as its objectives; cooperation, whereby it is intended that the transnational and European aspirations of the EUâs treaties and programmes be fulfilled, and competition, which is meant to make possible the completion of the internal market on the secure basis of the rules of the social market economy and governed by democratic competition law aimed primarily at limiting the misuse of economic power and guaranteeing consumers the protection of the law.
Although these three principles refer to services of general interest and to services of general economic interest, there are always tensions inherent in the relationships of the corners of this sort of triangle, and, where services of general interest and services of general economic interest are concerned, it is obvious where they lie.
Public services have an essential part to play in the quality of life enjoyed by individual citizens; they also have a key role in the European Unionâs Lisbon Strategy.
Good public services can help overcome economic stagnation, social exclusion and isolation, to reinforce social and territorial cohesion, to improve, both internally and externally, the European single marketâs functioning, and to enable it to compete better.
Even so, whenever I am in the region from which I come or visiting others, and sit down with local politicians and the providers of services of general interest to discuss these, I have to deal with their complaints to the effect that we are interfering in their remits, making their jobs more difficult, and failing to make clear under what conditions they can operate.
Their claim is that they do not, where the law is concerned, actually know where they stand.
It is for that reason that appropriate legal initiatives to afford them that legal certainty would appear to be necessary.
There will be those who, in the course of this debate, will ask what we are actually after â after all, they will say, do we not have the Commission to issue communications and enact guidelines, and the Court of Justice to lay down the law? â and to them I have to say that that is evidently not enough, and, moreover, it does indeed contribute to the prevailing legal uncertainty, for the Commission, with its communications and guidelines, does nothing to create legal certainty.
It may well suggest that it does, but the fact is that a communication is not the sort of black-and-white law on which one can rely.
We really must take the initiative in matters of law, and we are also making proposals as to how we can do this, not all of which I want to discuss, but the point I would make to you, MrÂ President of the Commission, is that the right of initiative that you possess is also a duty of initiative, and I urge you to make use of it.
The building blocks for such legal initiatives are to be found in the resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, as well as in the resolutions we have already adopted, in, for example, the Langen and Herzog reports.
We are not prescribing a specific instrument; that is for you to do.
Our allotted task is to give our own assessment â each group for itself â of the Commission legislative thinking, and we will, after further debate, give our own assessment of the proposal for a framework directive that our group has put forward.
Others must do the same with their own proposals; then we, working together in this House, must move the legislative process forward, and for that, the codecision procedure is an absolute requirement.
It is within that procedure that we need legal initiatives, for it is not you and your fellow Commissioner, together with the highly qualified and well motivated staff of the Commission, nor indeed the national governments, but we, the Members of the European Parliament, who enjoy the legitimacy conferred by election.
It is we who have to get down to the grass roots and discuss these things with the local politicians to whom we are accountable; it is we who bear responsibility for what is done.
It is for that reason that the codecision procedure must apply, and for that reason that this House must exercise its prerogatives in full.
Â Â  . Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, services of general interest are at the very heart of our European social model.
They cover a vast gamut of activities, ranging from the major network services â the energy, telecommunications, transport and postal services â to health and social services and water and waste-management services.
What we call network services, namely transport, energy, telecommunications and postal services, account for about 7% of our collective GDP and 5% of total employment in the European Union.
They therefore constitute an essential element of the everyday lives of all European citizens and of Europeâs businesses too.
The success of the European growth and employment strategy â the Lisbon Strategy â which is vital to our prosperity, also depends on the quality and efficiency of these services.
Since the Commission published its White Paper on services of general interest, an intense debate has ensued on the role that the European Union might play with regard to these services.
I am pleased that this debate is taking place.
I wish to thank MrÂ Rapkay, the rapporteur, and his colleagues in the committees for having moved the debate forward with this excellent report.
The reality of services of general interest is complex.
Moreover, it is changing all the time.
Technical progress, new expectations on the part of society and consumers, financial pressures and the modernisation of public administration have all profoundly transformed the way in which these services are provided.
In these times of rapid economic and technological change, services of general interest need a useful and effective legal framework that enables providers of these services to achieve their prescribed aims and to keep adapting to a changing environment.
The Commission is willing to cooperate in the creation of such a legal framework on the basis of four essential principles.
Firstly, the framework for services of general interest provided nationally, regionally and locally must remain the responsibility of Member States so that we can uphold the important principle of subsidiarity.
There is quite simply no alternative.
I am firmly convinced that the European Union must respect the diversity of conditions and practices that exists among the Member States.
This diversity reflects different histories and cultures of state intervention.
I subscribe to the view expressed in your report that it would be absolutely inappropriate to adopt uniform definitions at the Community level.
Member States must remain free to define their services of general interest on the basis of their varied needs, structures and traditions.
The second principle is this: the promotion and protection of universally accessible services of general interest that represent good value for money are compatible with open competitive markets.
For evidence, we need only observe sectors such as telecommunications or air transport, where public-service activities have been successfully entrusted to private operators while the interests of consumers have been fully safeguarded.
It should, however, be emphasised that, in the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the rules of the internal market or of competition and a service of general interest, the service of general interest must take precedence.
This is what the Treaty prescribes and what the Court has confirmed.
The Commission is willing to provide any advice or information that may be necessary in this matter.
The third principle is that any EU framework applicable to services of general interest must be responsive to divergences and conducive to modernisation.
It must be based on the aims of high quality, good value for money and universal access.
It is, in fact, a matter of meeting the expectations of people and businesses but also of preventing social and territorial exclusion.
Moving on to the fourth principle, legal certainty is essential, as I have said, not only for consumers and operators but also for the public authorities.
It is incumbent on the public authorities at every level to define clearly the rules that apply to services of general interest.
At the European level, given the diversity of situations and sectors, it remains to be established whether a single legislative instrument or a sector-by-sector approach would be the better means to the desired end.
I noted that you asked this question in your report.
The four principles I have just outlined serve as a guide for Community action.
Such action is essentially pragmatic.
We are in the process of formulating sectoral policies at the level of the European Union for those sectors where the need for such a policy is clearly felt and where it can bring real additional benefits.
Problems affecting more than one sector are tackled as they arise.
The Commission has been very active in this area along with this House and the Council, and I think I can say that we have made good progress in several areas.
We used the Altmark package to simplify and clarify the rules on state aid relating to services of general interest.
We are currently checking the application of the new rules on public procurement which came into force in January.
We have engaged in extremely broad consultations on the issue of public-private partnerships, and we have announced new initiatives for 2007.
We have arrived at an agreement on public transport services.
We have adopted a Communication on social services, and we are now initiating consultations on health services.
We have launched a broad consultation process on the energy sector, and we shall be presenting other proposals â including, let me stress, legislative proposals, not just communications.
In fact, at the present time we are revising the regulatory framework that applies to electronic communications, and we shall be proposing a new directive on postal services before the end of the year.
These recent advances show that the European Union is displaying initiative and ambition with regard to services of general interest.
They also illustrate the important role played by Parliament and the Council.
After the adoption of the Rapkay report, which we shall analyse carefully, the Commission is firmly resolved to go further.
We shall present a communication on this subject before the end of the year.
Ladies and gentlemen, the main message I picked up from your report was a twofold call to action: firstly for the creation of greater legal certainty as regards the EU rules governing services of general interest, and secondly for recognition of the wide diversity of sectors and situations throughout Europe.
I believe the time has come for us to consolidate the regulatory framework that applies to services of general interest in the European Union.
That is what our fellow citizens expect.
The Commission will take full account of your report when it examines this issue between now and the end of this year.
Â Â  . Madam President, it is important to state one thing in this debate: there is no better way to ensure high quality, accessibility and low prices than a broad range of competition and entrepreneurship in the European economy.
We have all seen the results and achievements in a number of sectors that 10 or 20 years ago were looked upon as monopolies on typical services of general interest.
We have seen achievements in telecom and airlines and we will see achievements in new areas, because we are talking about services that are by nature dynamic and convergent. They are a huge and important part of the future knowledge economy.
We have to open up and, at the same time, respect the specific solutions each Member State needs for what it defines as services of general interest.
I should like to underline in this debate that there is no call in the report for a framework directive or a horizontal framework of any kind, but there is an emphasis on legal clarity based on a sectoral approach and a call for sector-specific directives where they are needed.
Mr Barroso, you mentioned healthcare.
We can look back and see how the sector-specific approach has been quite successful in recent years.
So we are calling for legal clarity, based upon the sector-specific approach, and we look forward to seeing future sectoral directives.
We underline that there is no legal basis in the Treaties for a proposal that would interfere with the internal market, competition rules or public procurement.
We stress that this is an area in which there must be respect for Member States and for the principle of subsidiarity.
In the coming decades, we will see opportunities arising for more and more cross-border activities in new areas.
I believe that there will be fantastic opportunities for patients to get better healthcare in different countries and that could also create vitality for the European economy.
But we agree on the need to respect the internal market, at the same time as we respect subsidiarity.
I hope, Mr Barroso, that you will read this report and see the need to go further on sector-specific directives and the sector-specific approach, in order to create the legal clarity that also respects the principle of subsidiarity.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has put my colleague MrÂ Rapkayâs report, and the issue of services of general interest, at the heart of what it is trying to do during this Parliament.
We have made so bold â and it was an extraordinary achievement on our part â as to put together our own draft directive, which includes the essentials of what MrÂ Rapkay has set out in his report, and which I presented to you, Mr President of the Commission, and to the then President of the Council, MrÂ SchÃŒssel.
What we see as important in the services debate â certain essential individual elements of which I shall shortly address â is that our strategy should strike a balance between the demands of the internal market, which we social democrats are aware of and acknowledge, and the need to protect the public by reinforcing local and regional institutions, which are still best suited to maintaining the subsidiarity principle in the provision of services.
The essential message that must be carried by this debate is âflexibility where it is needed, protection where it is possibleâ.
After all the Councils we have had â in Barcelona, Laeken, Nice â and after all the debates we have had, we see your coming here today, Mr President of the Commission, as the Commissionâs underlining of the importance of this debate, and something for which we are grateful to you.
That is also the reason why I, as chairman of our group, am speaking in this debate.
The main thing I have to do is to underline on behalf of our group what MrÂ Rapkay has, in his role as rapporteur, said about this report, but there are two other things I should like to say as well.
I listened to what MrÂ HÃ¶kmark said with a great deal of attention.
It is interesting when a convinced liberal tries to take the curve on this issue.
To be sure, we are all in favour of the internal market, and we all want it to do all it can to spark off economic dynamism; on that we agree with you, but it becomes more difficult when it comes to the subsidiarity principle, which free-marketeers otherwise insist on as a matter of principle, yet, when it is used to guarantee certain indispensable social standards, it suddenly becomes a hindrance.
That is not on!
I do not know whether requiring all health services to actually be subject to the free market is something that is worth striving for, nor do I know whether we have to sit back and watch until the day comes when every last municipal graveyard is run on commercial lines.
I do not think that makes sense.
We certainly still need strengthened local and regional authorities to enable us, within the framework of subsidiarity, to provide high-quality services that respond directly to what the public needs and demands.
That is at the heart of social democratic policy, and we will not abandon it, but we also want the chance for local and regional authorities to enhance quality by means of greater flexibility and opening-up to the internal market, thereby, by their own free choice, being able to ensure flexibility in the provision of good and affordable services, for both are possible.
It was with a great deal of attention that we heard you, Mr President, saying that you wanted to consolidate the legal framework as a whole, for your acknowledgement of the need for a legal framework marks a great step forward, and your wanting now to consolidate it is an indication of your desire for a broad-based rather than sector-by-sector approach.
If that is how you want to proceed, then I can imagine us making common cause quite soon.
I would like to say, on behalf of our group, that our venture in writing a draft directive of our own, combined with what MrÂ Rapkay has had to say, and with the Presidentâs remarks, will convince you too, Madam Vice-President, that we are on the right track.
Â Â  . Madam President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the rapporteur for a magnificent job.
Even if we did not always agree, he was extremely patient and open to cooperation, for which I am very grateful.
It is very important that we make our position clear once and for all.
I am concerned that the report we adopted in committee has been interpreted in so many different ways.
There have been jubilant press releases stating that the European Parliament has finally called for a framework directive, whereas others state that the European Parliament has finally rejected the framework directive once and for all.
We need to get away from a situation in which we have watered-down compromises that can be interpreted in various ways.
I can state, on behalf of my group, that we do not want a framework directive.
We do not want a one-size-fits-all solution for Europe, precisely because we want subsidiarity.
But what is subsidiarity?
Subsidiarity means that the national and local authorities can define their services of general interest and decide on how they are organised and financed.
Subsidiarity does not mean automatic exemption from the market rules.
We are therefore talking about two kinds of subsidiarity here.
I listened very carefully to what Mr Barroso said and again he left some room for interpretation.
I would like to interpret his remarks as meaning that he also wants targeted and concrete solutions for real problems.
Because another recommendation I should like to make to this House is: if it ainât broke, donât fix it!
In that case, it is not legislation we need, but solutions to real problems.
I have worked for a local authority, so I know what the real problems are.
Local authorities have very legitimate concerns.
However, we have to acknowledge that there is also a tendency towards protectionism.
We will have to find the right balance here.
We also need to get away from the ideological debate, or at least be honest and admit that there is a certain degree of ideology involved.
Some people very legitimately feel that the public authority should also be the provider of services.
I agree with my colleague, Mr HÃ¶kmark, that the market can provide excellent services.
Some sectors have been liberalised and that did not mean that more people were excluded from access to those services, but quite the contrary: many services have come within reach of many more people, which is extremely social.
A market is not a jungle; it has rules, because if there are no rules it is not a market.
Any market â even the simplest market on the market square â has rules and that is exactly what we mean by the social market economy we have in Europe.
We need to recognise the diversity of the Member States and allow them to decide for themselves what they call âservices of general interestâ.
Finally, we should not try to define what services of general interest and services of general economic interest are, because the word âeconomicâ applies not to the nature of the service itself but to the way in which it is provided.
To take an example: everybody will recognise that water is of general interest, but it may be provided in a purely commercial way.
So we must not lose ourselves in a senseless debate on the differences between âof general interestâ and âgeneral economic interestâ.
The only interest we should be looking at here is the interest of our citizens and consumers.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciated the content of PresidentÂ Barrosoâs speech.
I appreciated the intention he announced to present one or more legislative drafts â I shall return to the question of one or more in a moment â for adoption by codecision as well as the four principles he invoked.
I believe it was important to reiterate those principles.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs rejected our proposal for a simple reference to the substance of ArticleÂ 122 of the Constitutional Treaty and, what is worse, for a simple reference to ArticleÂ 86 of the present Treaty.
The latter article, as you pointed out, specifies that, in the event of a conflict between the market and public-service requirements in law or in practice, the public service must take precedence.
I believe it is extremely important that the parliamentary draft reaffirms what we adopted at the time of the Constitutional Treaty, namely the text of ArticleÂ 122, and confirms that at least we still believe in ArticleÂ 86 of the present Treaty.
What we would like is to go much further in pinning down the precise implications of our forthcoming vote.
If there is one point on which I agree with MrsÂ in'tÂ Veld, it is that MrÂ Rapkayâs diplomatic and very judiciously calculated statement about the need to legislate can be equally easily interpreted to mean one thing or the other.
We will therefore ask you, in accordance with both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the interinstitutional agreement, to present us with a draft directive by virtue of the right of legislative initiative vested in this Parliament.
We are also entirely in agreement with the four principles you outlined to us.
If we disagree with MrsÂ in'tÂ Veld, the precise bone of contention is subsidiarity.
I regard it as a grave misjudgement to talk of strict subsidiarity when the Services Directive is actually the applicable instrument in the absence of a specific directive on services of general interest.
The fact is that we have watched the substance and scope of the Services Directive vary incessantly from day to day and from week to week.
At one point, subsidised housing was included.
Then it was almost excluded, only to be reinstated again, though not fully.
We need only compare our parliamentary draft with those of the Commission and the Council to see the lack of agreement on the public services that fall within the ambit of the Services Directive.
We need to legislate today to set these matters straight.
Â Â  . MadamÂ President, MrÂ President of the Commission, the general interest, the public good, the common good, public services: these are all key reference points which, as the President of the Commission has said, are at the heart of the debate on the concept of the European social model.
We are touching here upon peopleâs daily lives, on their perception of the future and on our conception of society.
Fundamental values, such as equality, solidarity and democracy, are at stake.
The issues are too important for us to deal with by means of fuzzy definitions or unsatisfactory compromises.
My group wishes to emphasise three aspects that require clarification.
The first is the relationship between public services and the rules governing the internal market, in other words the provisions on competition, public procurement and state aid, not to mention the powers of the Commission and the Court to monitor and sanction perceived abuses.
In our view, we need a radically new legal basis that will allow public services to exist in Europe outside the logic of the market.
It is true, as MrÂ Barroso and MrÂ Lipietz have reminded us, that the Treaty gives precedence to the provision of public services in cases where such provision conflicts with the rules of competition.
It also recognises that national governments have the right to define general interest, but it is the Commission and, in the final analysis, the Court that determine the extent to which derogations may be made.
Consequently, a country that is not considered to be anti-liberal, namely the Netherlands, has been brought to book for having committed, and I quote, âa manifest public-service error, because the subsidised social housing cooperatives counted among their tenants households that were not socially disadvantagedâ.
The truth is that this exemption regime is effectively tending to whittle away at public services.
This brings me to the second point I wish to make, namely the extent of our ambitions in the realm of public services.
In our view, these services should quite simply cover the fundamental rights that everyone has in equal measure in this twenty-first century, namely education, health care, housing and decent living conditions, child care, information, culture, transport, telecommunications, postal services, energy and water supply, sewage and waste disposal and other needs that have become compelling, such as access to credit.
Services in these areas must therefore be governed by the imperative of socially effective delivery without being subjected to the pressure of competition.
One third and final aspect needs to be highlighted, and that is the link between subsidiarity and the European integration project.
As has been said, experiences of public-service management, of property structures and of funding methods vary from one country to another.
It must be the sovereign right of each country to make these choices, with all their implications.
So do we or do we not need a framework directive?
The debate on this issue has begun in our group, and I, for my part, would say âLetâs go for it!â
Let the Commission prepare such an instrument on the basis of the principles I have just restated.
Some might object that this approach is incompatible with the rules of the Treaty.
