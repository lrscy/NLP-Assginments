I wish to emphasise that with regard to all decisions made by the Court within the Small Claims Procedure, it should always be remembered that the procedure is economical, quick, simple and citizen-friendly.
Anything which constitutes an obstacle to this is therefore inconsistent with the aim of this Regulation.
I therefore call on all my fellow Members to give their approval to this new and citizen-friendly civil law procedure which is the same across the whole of Europe.

Voting time
The next item is the vote.
Explanations of vote
in writing. (SV) We would again offer our fundamental perspective on the EU's budget.
The June List believes that the EU's budget should be limited to 1% of the Member States' average GNI.
We have therefore chosen to vote against all the increases proposed by the European Parliament, at the same time as the June List has welcomed the few savings proposed in the form of amendments by either the Committee on Budgets or individual Members.
There are quite a few unfortunate budget headings, but the June List particularly regrets the large amount of aid for the EU's agricultural policy, Cohesion Fund and fishing industry, as well as the budget headings under which various forms of information campaign are to be subsidised.
The June List also believes that Parliament's constant commuting between Strasbourg and Brussels must cease and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be closed down.
On 23 October 2006, the EU's Court of Auditors observed for the thirteenth year in a row that it could not guarantee that more than a small part of the EU's budget had been used correctly or for the purposes intended.
How can this madness continue whereby, year after year, financial resources are appropriated, only a small portion of which can be guaranteed to be used for the purposes for which they were intended?
in writing. We cannot support this budget for a number of reasons.
First of all, out of protest against the fact that a few months ago the Court of Auditors once again did not approve the EU's accounts.
Because the EU cannot successfully combat fraud and inefficiency, it should not increase its budget.
Secondly, we believe this budget makes the wrong political choices, such as too large a focus on industrial agriculture and foreign policy and military projects, and not enough on environment and social projects.
Finally, this budget does not adequately change some policies which are simply wasteful, such as mass subsidising of destruction of wine and continuing subsidies for growing tobacco.
(LT) Mr President, I voted for the 2007 European Union budget.
European Parliament budget rapporteur James Elles, a United Kingdom representative, undoubtedly has his own vision for the formation of the European Union budget and allocation of its funds.
I believe that it is largely because of his efforts that the 2007 budget is innovative and based on the 'value for money' principle.
I am pleased that a compromise was reached with respect to the financing of European Union common foreign and security policy, the application of the flexibility instrument, defence of the European Union's outer perimeter, and financing of the life-long education programmes.
I am happy that we will begin the first year of the new financial perspective with a confirmed European Union budget in place.
The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr JÃžrgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against Amendment 1, tabled by Mr Tomczak and Mr Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group.
It is this delegation's view that the amendment is incompatible with the regulations currently in force, for which reason we have felt obliged to vote against it.
The delegation wishes, nonetheless, to stress its support for a gradual general reduction in EU agricultural aid without the possibility of differential treatment for different Member States.
The Danish Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen, Mrs Thomsen, Mrs Schaldemose, Mr JÃžrgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against Amendment 2, tabled by Mr Tomczak and Mr Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group.
It is this delegation's view that the amendment is incompatible with the statutes currently in force, for which reason we have felt obliged to vote against it.
Nonetheless, it is the view of the delegation of Danish Members of the PSE Group that there is a need for a reform of the rules governing travel expenses so that, in future, they are paid out in amounts corresponding to costs actually incurred.
In this regard, the delegation would make reference to its work on the new statutes for the work of the European Parliament, which will enter into force in 2009.
In this context, the delegation is pleased that with the new statutes will come new rules under which, from 2009 onwards, travel expenses will be covered in amounts corresponding to costs actually incurred.
One might say, with regard to the budget proposal for 2007, that history is repeating itself, but, given what has happened before, the significance of this budget is more worrying than that.
After it 'criticised' the budgetary ceiling proposed by the Commission and the Council, Parliament has just endorsed a budget in which the appropriations for payments amount to 0.99% of Community GNI, below the figure of around 1.06% agreed just a year ago in the financial perspective for 2007 - a cut of some EUR 8 billion.
Given that 2007 is the first year of the 27-Member State EU, a year that will set the bar for future budgets, Parliament has adopted a budget that falls well short of the funding needed for effective economic and social cohesion, a budget whose priorities are far from being an adequate response to this issue.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
The reduction in the so-called financial 'compensation' to Portugal is testimony to this.
It is a budget that is aimed - to cite just a few examples - at supporting the implementation of the neoliberal policies contained in the Lisbon Strategy, such as the liberalisation of the labour market and the internal market and the financing of major capital; at promoting the scrapping of many fishing vessels; at gradually destroying family farming; and at promoting the militarisation of the European Union and interventionism on the part of the EU.
Hence our rejection.
The Danish Liberal Party's MEPs have voted against Amendments 1 and 2, tabled by Mr Tomczak and Mr Bonde of the Independence and Democracy Group.
The Danish Liberal Party believes in reforming agricultural aid, but does not believe that this is the way to achieve such a reform, nor that the report on the annual budget is the place to state one's desire for proposals to that effect.
Mr Bonde's proposal may be regarded as poorly thought through.
The Danish Liberal Party also believes in reforming travel allowances, so that reasonable and necessary travel expenses are refunded.
This, however, has already been decided under the new Statute for Members, which will be implemented as of 2009.
Mr Bonde's proposal is contrary to the statute currently in force and may therefore be regarded as poorly thought through.
in writing. I congratulate the rapporteur on putting together a package which found a large majority across the House.
In 22 years as a Member, this is the shortest budget vote I can recall.
I regret that Parliament has agreed a number of reductions in order to stay within budgetary limits.
In particular I think it very unfortunate that we have reduced the budget for 'aid for trade'.
This is a vital budget line to assist developing countries connect with the global trading system.
in writing. (DA) It is deeply unjust for there to be discrimination against the new Member States by means of not granting them the same aid as is given to the old Member States.
I have nevertheless voted in favour of the transitional arrangements, as failure to adopt these could lead to Bulgaria and Romania receiving nothing.
In general, I am opposed to agricultural aid, which I believe should be phased out.
I would therefore rather have seen a reduction in aid to the old Member States so that the same conditions applied all round.
Such a reduction would start from the top, with a EUR 40 000 ceiling per legal entity, as I proposed in my amendment to the budget.
in writing. (SV) These reports are permeated by a host of populist proposals attacking one of the most basic principles of a state governed by law: the right of self-determination in connection with criminal law.
It is recommended, for example, that there be a genuine European judge and genuine European criminal law. The purpose of these proposals is unambiguous.
There is a desire to construct an EU superstate, and the proposals constitute a decisive step in that direction. That is wholly unacceptable.
The June List champions the sovereignty of the nation state with regard to legal issues.
EU cooperation must be limited to obtaining an efficient internal market and dealing with cross-border environmental issues.
The EU must definitely not have a harmonised legal system.
We have accordingly voted against these reports in today's vote.
in writing. - (FR) I feel that Mr Langen's report on a strategy for biomass and biofuels successfully describes all of the advantages and disadvantages of using renewable energy sources.
However, I should like to point out a few amendments tabled within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that have not been accepted.
Firstly, while renewables can help reduce the European Union's energy dependence, we must also take a broader look at our energy consumption and, thus, at our lifestyles and production methods so that we consume better but, above all, so that we consume less.
Next, we should not launch into an intensive and high productivity-focused process for manufacturing renewable energy sources, as this would have harmful environmental, economic and social consequences and would not fall within the European sustainable development strategy.
The main function of agriculture must remain food production.
Forest resources must be exploited in moderation.
Cogeneration must be the rule where biomass production is concerned.
Finally, we must organise and improve the channels for supplying, distributing and marketing agricultural and forestry raw materials and energy produced at local market level by preventing excessive journey times.
The extent of illegal immigration in the EU cannot blind us to the relevant issue of refugees, and in particular political refugees.
The right to asylum is, first and foremost, a fundamental value in any society that seeks to protect democracy, dignity and human rights.
It is also evidence of a spirit of solidarity in that community.
Consequently, because we should take the lead in protecting human dignity and because, when it comes to values, mere words are insufficient, those escaping persecution, torture, war and human rights violations must know that here in Europe they will be properly welcomed when it is possible for us to welcome them, and in order for us to be fully equipped for the task, this fund is necessary and most desirable.
in writing. Mr President, I am delighted to support the establishment of this fund for refugees.
Too often we see refugees being ignored and at the end of Member State priorities, and it is only right that where Member States fall down the Union should step in to ensure our standards are maintained.
This report takes us closer to a coherent system and I am pleased to support it.
in writing. I support the measures on double-hulling that should help diminish maritime pollution from oil tankers, which are particularly important for the Yorkshire coast and the Humber estuary.
The group of the Greek Communist Party in the European Parliament voted for the proposal to amend Article 4, paragraph 3 of Regulation (ÎC) No 417/2002, both during approval in the Committee on Transport and Tourism on 22 November 2006 and in plenary in the European Parliament on 14 December 2006, so that heavy grades of oil are only carried in double-hull tankers.
The Greek Communist Party is fighting consistently together with seamen and workers in general against the anti-grassroots policy of the ÎU and the governments of the Member States and against shipowners and capital for strict measures to be taken to strengthen safety rules for tankers and for all classes of ships in general, in order to protect human life at sea and the environment.
Maritime safety is extremely important to the EU, because of accidents such as that of the Prestige and the socio-economic and environmental consequences of such accidents and because of the need to prevent further tragedies, which undermine the sustainability of our seas and territories.
The measures put forward in the Le Rachinel report are a vital step towards ensuring that Community provisions are clear, consistent and stable.
The oil tanker sector, for example, requires an extremely stable and clear Community legal and judicial framework, without which the effectiveness and transparency of economic and trade relations in the marine sector cannot be guaranteed and maintained.
Accordingly, although in practice the Member States already observe and apply the ban on single-hull oil tankers, which transport heavy oil products, entering Community ports, this proposed amendment to the regulation will act as much-needed clarification and confirmation of the text.
Following thorough analysis of the socio-economic impact of this measure, it is clear that it is a sensible measure and that we must continue to bring Community measures into line with the objective of ensuring maximum marine safety for our vessels, our ports and our territories.
in writing. Mr President, this package on double hull oil tankers has been a long time coming, though I am pleased to support it today.
We saw in Scotland the disaster that the wreck of the Braer inflicted upon the Shetland Islands and we must do all we can to ensure the safety of our European marine environment and our coastlines.
The EU must impose high standards on these international operators, and this report takes us some of the way there.
in writing. - (FR) As it is designed, this fund is going to help finance the accelerated communitisation of European societies.
We are talking here about a kind of crazy 'urban policy' at Member State level.
In my country, we have already experienced the consequences of these policies, which are focused on absolute respect for the cultural differences of immigrant populations.
These policies inject substantial, non-refundable sums into measures aimed at people who do not want to integrate, but who claim their right to social, economic and political rights that should be reserved for nationals.
The consequences of this are ghettoisation, inter-ethnic clashes, anti-French riots, the destruction of public amenities - sometimes resulting in deaths - and the rise in power of Islamism.
However, since the sums allocated to each Member State will be commensurate with the number of immigrants it receives, this fund may in the end prove useful: it will enable us at last to know the real immigration figures.
For, constantly massaged as they are, the official figures fluctuate between 17 and 40 million non-EU nationals living on EU soil.
Thus, in becoming aware of the scale of the problem, the people of Europe might just be able to wake up to it before it is too late!
One of the most important issues in immigration policy is that of integration.
The capacity to integrate immigrants and the capacity of immigrants to integrate is the major factor - or at least one of the major factors - in overcoming potential conflict and tension between different communities, which is a highly topical issue.
As I have said on a number of occasions, the first thing to note when it comes to immigration is that the host country stands to gain a great deal from welcoming men and women who have gone through terrible ordeals in search of a better life.
These are people who enrich our communities.
Acknowledging that this is the case, however, does not mean that we must overlook the other side of the coin, namely the difficulties involved in integration.
In the attempt to address this question, this Fund can play an extremely relevant role, in financing programmes aimed at facilitating and promoting integration.
Everything will, of course, depend on the political vision underpinning the way in which it is used.
This, however, is above all an issue that falls under the competence of the Member States.
The committee report on the programme to finance Prevention, Preparedness and Consequence Management of Terrorism goes even further than the Commission proposal for a decision, by adding to the objectives of the programme the protection of critical infrastructures and 'continuity of public action'.
In other words, it brings it under the EU's revised action programme on terrorism, which focuses on the prevention of 'violent radicalisation' and the protection of critical infrastructures in the Member States of the ÎU.
On the basis of this programme, ideological perceptions, positions and stands which challenge the 'holy of holies' of capitalist barbarity and the exploitation of its political systems come within the definition of 'terrorism', while customary action which the mass grassroots movement has acquired the right to take, such as the symbolic takeover of buildings or roads, which they may consider jeopardises 'critical infrastructures' or the unimpeded functioning of public services can potentially be classified as 'terrorist action'.
The programmes and measures by European capital and its political mouthpieces against the rights and freedoms of the peoples and action by grassroots movements accurately illustrate their fear.
They are not as omnipotent as they say.
Only the peoples are unvanquished when they decide to claim and impose their rights in return.
(SK) The principles of non-discrimination and gender equality are democratic cornerstones of the European Union.
It is therefore natural that the European Union should be striving to establish institutional mechanisms, such as the European Institute for Gender Equality, in order to promote gender equality more effectively.
Therefore, I have voted in favour of this report in the second reading as well.
We welcome the Commission's decision to establish the Institute for Gender Equality in a new Member State, as the new Member Sates are particularly lagging behind in terms of gender equality compared with the old fifteen states.
I am truly delighted by the December Council decision to establish the Institute in Lithuania.
I must admit that I feel a little disappointed that Slovakia, a country ranking fairly low in terms of gender equality statistics, failed to win over the Council despite the advantage of her central geographic location.
I am convinced that, through our interventions and the active promotion of Slovakia in the European Parliament, fellow MEPs Mrs ZÃ¡borskÃ¡, Mrs Bauer, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡ and myself contributed substantially towards efforts aimed at establishing the Institute in Bratislava.
This is something that women's organisations have for a long time been calling for; Parliament has supported it, but achieving it has been an arduous process.
Finally, following the Commission's proposal to set up a European Institute for Gender Equality, Parliament adopted its position at first reading on 14 March 2006, with the adoption of 50 amendments to the Commission's proposal, which was published on 8 March 2006.
In the interim, the Council adopted its common position on 21 September 2006, incorporating 35 amendments tabled by Parliament.
Given the need to get the Institute up and running in 2007, amendments were negotiated with a view to reaching a rapid agreement at second reading.
This was the compromise to which we gave our agreement, which includes 13 amendments to the common position.
Among its provisions, this agreement provides for removing the Bureau proposed in the common position and for reintroducing the Experts' Forum, a consultation forum made up of experts in the area of gender equality, and this is something that both the Commission and Parliament want.
The Council has rethought its position and agreed to the replacement of the Bureau by an Experts' Forum made up of one representative from each Member State, two members appointed by Parliament and three representatives from the social partners.
I wish to congratulate Mrs GrÃ¶ner and Mrs Sartori on their timely report on the Recommendation for a second reading on the Council common position for adopting a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality, to which I lend my full support.
I particularly welcome the idea of replacing the Bureau with an Experts' Forum, as part of the structure of the Institute.
The objective of getting the Institute up and running as quickly as possible, in 2007, which is shared by all of the institutions, meant that they worked together towards achieving this objective.
The speed and manner in which the entire process has been conducted is worthy of praise.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report on the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality.
The Commission's feasibility study concluded that there is a clear role for such an Institute.
The proposed agency would be small, with a staff of 10 or so.
The overall objective of the Institute will be to assist the Community institutions, in particular the Commission, and the authorities of the Member States in the fight against discrimination based on sex and the promotion of gender equality and to raise EU citizens' awareness of gender equality.
in writing. Today I voted to reject the Council's common position on the proposed package for a European Driving Licence system.
National transport issues are a matter for national governments and, accordingly, each Member State should be free to determine its own rules and criteria on drivers' licences.
In no way does this over-bureaucratic and over-regulatory proposal appear to improve road safety records and therefore I consider it to be another unnecessary and unjustifiable piece of legislation.
in writing. (SV) Road safety is an extremely important cross-border issue.
The EU's Directive on Driving Licences could, then, contribute practical added value.
As usual, however, the Commission and the European Parliament are attempting, in their zeal for regulation, to control the Member States' rules in this area in detail.
We believe that the principles of subsidiarity and country of origin should be applied in full, something that does not happen in the current report when it comes, for example, to the detailed proposals on driving licence regulations governing motorcycles and mopeds.
We believe in the principle of mutual recognition and consequently have every confidence that the Member States are capable of taking wise and well-considered decisions.
Driving licence regulations can be harmonised without a detailed proposal for a directive like the current Directive on Driving Licences.
We have consequently voted in favour of Amendment 6, which recommends that the common position be rejected on the grounds that it is excessively regulatory, without improving road safety.
in writing. (DE) I have voted in favour of the adoption of the European Driving Licence System since this overhaul represents significant progress as far as I am concerned.
The new Driving Licences Directive entails greater security and less criminality in dealings with driving licences, since the possibility of so-called driving licence tourism is substantially reduced.
The establishment of a database of traffic offenders who have had their driving licences taken away in their home countries is particularly important in this connection.
As a result, drunk drivers can be clearly prevented from simply undertaking new driver training abroad.
However, I sense that the 26 year period during which all driving licences which are valid today have to be withdrawn from service, is overly long.
in writing. I voted in favour of the Grosch report, which aims to recast the Driving Licences Directive to have all rules on driving licences in one document and thus make them more transparent and accessible to the citizen.
If these proposals find their way into law they should end the practice of driving licence tourism, where an individual banned in one Member State obtains a licence in another Member State.
I know many motorcyclists are concerned about the minimum age of 24 years for access to more powerful machines.
I hope they will find the compromise of allowing them access at an earlier age if they have sufficient experience acceptable, as that keeps safety at the top of our concerns.
in writing. I welcome this directive which will replace over 110 different driving licence models currently in circulation throughout the EU.
I believe that this new single EU-wide credit card format will also go a long way in combating driving licence tourism.
The net effect of this will be that Member States like Ireland can refuse to issue a driving licence to an applicant whose permit was restricted, suspended or withdrawn in another Member State.
I also support the targeted road safety aspect to this report, with a theory test for mopeds becoming compulsory from 2013.
Also, the principle of "progressive access" will mean that riders must accumulate experience on smaller motorcycles before moving up to larger engines.
I have always maintained that on certain issues exchange of best practice and standard setting at EU level can often reap positive results.
In this respect I believe that EU standard setting on the basic qualifications and retraining programmes for driving examiners is a positive development.
in writing. - (FR) In 2032, our grandchildren will all have the same driving licence: one licence for all Europeans, in the form of a credit card, a 'made in the USA' driving licence.
This is evidence of heightened security, and a tangible sign where European identification is concerned.
I regret the fact that it has taken 26 years to achieve harmonisation; that being said, the very first licences will be distributed as from 2012.
About time too!
There are 110 different types of driving licence in the European Union today.
This creates confusion that benefits the most dishonest among us, and makes the roads more dangerous than they need to be.
Harmonising national laws means fighting against 'driving licence tourism', that is, against the opportunity for European citizens who have been stripped of their driving licences in their countries following a serious offence to obtain another licence elsewhere in the Union.
The rules on training examiners will also be harmonised.
This will guarantee the quality of training throughout Europe.
in writing.
Mr President, I support this report with a few reservations, namely that I am not convinced that the certification of drivers should be dealt with on an EU level, provided there is suitable recognition of standards from other EU members.
I am sceptical of concerns that have been expressed by the anti-European right that this package would introduce ID cards by the back door, but I do have some sympathy with the idea that this package is answering a need not in fact felt on the ground.
in writing. My colleague Richard Corbett is undoubtedly Parliament's leading expert on constitutional matters.
I welcome this latest report which amends the rules of procedure to bring them in line with the new agreement on comitology.
While this can be seen as a technical matter it is in fact highly political because the way we adapt our rules directly impacts on our ability to influence EU legislation.
Richard has always been adept at maximising Parliament's influence.
Mr President, you will have noticed that this report, this change to our rules, was adopted by a majority of only seven votes.
It was very close.
I think that is indicative of the feeling of this Chamber that this is a change that was not strictly necessary to our rules, but one that has been brought in on a temporary basis - there is a sunset clause and it expires at the end of this legislature - to help with the particularly difficult situation that we have now.
I think the lesson of this close vote is that any attempt at the end of this legislature to prolong the life of having a fourth Vice-President for each committee and a sixth Quaestor would be doomed to failure, and I would advise against it.
in writing. I voted against the Leinen report on amending the Rules of Procedure to increase the number of committee vice-chairmen from three to four and the number of Quaestors from five to six.
I think it is frankly ludicrous to have four vice-chairs per committee. There is no obvious role for a fourth vice-chair and this increase is simply political expediency to ensure that group leaders have enough jobs to hand round to keep key supporters happy.
As for the increase in Quaestors, this may be marginally more justified but I think it dangerous to have an even number of Quaestors.
The decision to set up a Fund for the Union's external borders is a timely one.
Whilst it is true that the borders of each Member State fall exclusively under the competence of national sovereignty, it is also true that these borders are at the same time the external borders of the EU.
There is therefore a duality that needs to be recognised and addressed accordingly.
At a time of increased risk - be it the terrorist threat, illegal immigration or economic crime - the need to strengthen our borders is paramount, although this must not, let me state clearly, lead to high walls being erected around Europe or a fortress-continent being built.
This is about sharing part of a burden the cost of which arises, in part, from belonging to the EU.
It is the right thing to do.
We hope, most importantly, that it will work efficiently.
in writing. - (FR) On reading the title of the report, I thought that the European Union was proposing financially to help the Member States repatriate to their countries of origin illegal immigrants that are subject to an expulsion measure, or even to help them along, when their legislation provides for aid to resettle legal immigrants in their own countries.
We believe that the EU does not and should not have competence in the field of immigration.
Indeed, such a proposal could have been explained by the consequences for every European country of disastrous regularisation policies pursued by a few countries, such as Spain and France, which attract illegal immigrants like moths to a flame.
It is also a question of funding not only the repatriation of illegal immigrants, but also cash incentives and other aid for reintegration, employment and goodness knows what else, for the purpose, and I quote, of the 'personal development' of the repatriated immigrant!
This is, in a way, a bonus for acting illegally, and an encouragement to start over again.
The European Return Fund is yet another step towards promoting the anti-immigration policy of the ÎU.
It forms part of the broader funding programme entitled 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows', which is confined to providing economic support for 'Fortress Europe' by stepping up controls and 'rapid response forces' at the external borders of the ÎU, basically abolishing asylum and protection for refugees and further repressing economic migration.
The European Return Fund is designed to reinforce the mechanisms of forced repatriation of 'illegal' immigrants to their countries of origin; in other words, it is basically a fund for supporting mass deportations of economic migrants and refugees, thereby concealing the hypocritical nature of the pronouncements by the ÎU about the social integration of immigrants.
ÎU migration policy moves solely within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, from the point of view of increasing the profitability of European capital.
Within the framework of this policy, the reactionary institutional framework of the Member States and of the EU is taking shape, keeping millions of immigrants throughout the EU in an illegal or quasi-illegal regime, in order to hold them hostage to the harshest exploitation of capital, with poorly paid, insecure work with no fundamental employment rights and exclusion from access to basic social and political rights.
in writing. I voted in favour of this report, which is an adaptation to the new comitology procedure.
Even though this is a technical report I wish to stress my backing for the content, which ensures that medicines and other products for children are tailored to their needs and not simply variations (i.e. lower doses) of adult medicines.
in writing. I warmly welcome this report, which sets out to establish a European procedure for small claims.
It is intended to simplify and speed up litigation concerning small claims (up to EUR 2000) and reduce the costs for litigants.
The fact that it is easier in some countries for creditors to pursue claims creates a distortion in the single market, so I welcome this attempt to create a level playing field.
in writing. I fully support the objectives of this report on preventing and fighting crime.
The specific programme 'Prevention and fight against crime 2007-2013' is a welcome attempt to contribute to a high level of security for citizens by preventing and combating crime, organised or otherwise, in particular terrorism, trafficking in persons and offences against children, illicit drug trafficking and illicit arms trafficking, corruption and fraud.
Clearly all these activities have a cross-border aspect to them and therefore EU coordination can bring real added value to domestic law enforcement efforts.
in writing. - (FR) A proposal has been made to change the 'SIS' Schengen Information System which, although described as a success, will be unable to function with more than 18 Member States.
According to the pro-Europeans, 'SIS II' ought therefore to become a highly technologically advanced system and to enable the new Member States, too, to apply the Schengen acquis in full by abolishing the controls at the internal borders with their neighbours.
Conceived at the beginning from the universally appealing angle of cooperation among Member States, in particular of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, one might wonder today about the risks of the federalist and totalitarian excesses to which such a tool might give rise.
This potential European big brother actually possesses the most extensive database on people, with more than 15 million entries containing information, including people's surnames and first names, physical characteristics and lost, stolen or embezzled banknotes.
Besides the fact that such a concentration of information could constitute a threat to people's privacy and freedom of thought, it is justifiable to fear SIS II going beyond its principal task of police and judicial cooperation and one day becoming the self-proclaimed informer of the pro-European and pro-globalisation system.
(SK) I am satisfied with the outcome of the vote on nuclear safety regulation.
Nuclear energy is an important component in securing a stable and clean electric power supply for the world.
After the accidents at the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear power plants, the Community's attention has been focused on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The assistance provided to them has contributed substantially towards increasing the safety of nuclear plants in these countries.
The Slovak Republic has also received extensive assistance towards increasing the safety of the JaslovskÃ© Bohunice and Mochovce nuclear power plants, and therefore they now enjoy the same safety levels as similar nuclear plants in Western European countries.
It would also be desirable for the Community to provide aid for nuclear facilities that are being constructed, operated and decommissioned, as well as to promote safety and security in handling radioactive waste and spent fuel.
The draft regulation is in line with the interests of the European Union, as well as the goals and mission of Euratom.
By enhancing the safety of nuclear facilities beyond the EU borders it will contribute to protecting the health of EU citizens as well as making an important contribution to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
in writing. I voted in favour of the report which deals with assistance and cooperation in the area of nuclear safety between the Community and third countries, mainly states in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
It aims at establishing an Instrument for Nuclear Safety and Security Assistance.
The Chernobyl accident in 1986 highlighted the global importance of nuclear safety.
In order to create the conditions of safety necessary to eliminate hazards to life and health the EU should be able to support nuclear safety in third countries.
This report strikes the right balance by allowing the EU to promote the use of safer technologies and methods while not relieving third countries of their duty to ensure that nuclear plants on their territory operate safely and environmentally responsibly.
in writing. I supported the Commission's proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from the requirement, but we must have exemption for persons who are not nationals of any country, who reside in a Member State and who are holders of an alien's passport, a non-citizen's passport or another travel document issued by that Member State.
in writing. Although we fully support democracy and we condemn human rights abuses, we do not recognise the European Union's moral or political authority to make pronouncements in this area.
The Greek Communist Party neither recognises nor participates in the proceedings for the so-called Sakharov prize, which is supposed to be given for freedom of thought, but which in practice serves the political and ideological objectives of the ÎU.
The EP considers 'freedom of thought' to be primarily in those who espouse and serve imperialism; that is why it mainly rewards 'personalities' or 'organisations' which promote imperialist barbarity.
Such a prize was given to the Cuban counter-revolutionaries and, in 2006, to Milinkievic, the Belarusian chosen by the USA, ÎÎÎ€Î and the ÎU, who gained a 'surprising' 6% in the last elections, supported by a package of several million euros from the ÎU.
We consider the resolution, which is provocative interference in Cuba's internal affairs, to be unacceptable in its decision to send a delegation from Parliament to Cuba, thereby ignoring the government of the country which has popular support and is fighting heroically against the embargo and the undermining actions of imperialism.
We express our solidarity with Cuba, which defends and builds socialism, despite the rabid attempts of the imperialists to overturn it.
The political groups in the European Parliament, including the majority of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, have huge political responsibilities, in that they are trying to create preconditions for the justification of the overt or covert war which has been unleashed against the Cuban revolution.
Defending it is the duty not only of the communists but also of every progressive person.
Sakharov Prize winners are men and women whose lives have been devoted, always at great personal sacrifice, to the cause of freedom of expression, democracy, freedom and human rights.
It comes as no surprise, therefore, that some of these men and women are prevented from receiving the prize by the repressive regimes in their countries.
Unsurprising it may be, but that does not mean we should turn a blind eye to the problem.
I therefore welcome Parliament's decision to keep up the pressure on these regimes by taking the decision to create a mechanism for monitoring cases in which the winners have been prevented from receiving their deserved prize or from returning to the European Parliament, as in the cases of Oswaldo PayÃ¡, of Aung San Suu Kyi, who is still under house arrest in Myanmar, and of the Women in White, who were winners in 2005 and who were prevented by Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba from receiving the prize.
By stopping the winners from receiving their deserved prize, these regimes are proving that the award was deserved.
It is therefore necessary to keep up the fight for the most basic freedoms in both Myanmar and Cuba ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it gives me no pleasure to say that the ALDE Group voted the wrong way on amendment 1, by the PPE-DE Group, to the Roure report.
We should have voted against this amendment and it was a sheer mistake on the voting list.
I accept that, technically, the amendment went through and there is nothing we can do about that, but I would say that, politically, the vote does not represent the will of the House, which was expressed in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on Monday evening, when a similar amendment was wholeheartedly rejected.
Nothing can be done about that, but the position of the ALDE Group remains that we will not agree to the VIS Regulation unless and until we have an adequate framework decision on data protection, and we are utterly committed to everything that Mrs Roure, as rapporteur, is doing to seek to promote that decision on data protection.
We wholeheartedly support her, and the fact that we did not express it on this occasion is a technical - I could use a ruder word - mistake for which, I am afraid, a number of us probably bear responsibility.
We will try to ensure that no such mistake ever happens again, but the way we voted did not represent our actual position on amendment 1.
We must guarantee the protection of personal data and prevent them from being used inappropriately.
Every individual has the right to his or her identity and privacy.
Increased cooperation between the judicial and police bodies in fighting transnational crime has led to the transfer of more and more personal data.
We have been campaigning to ensure that this exchange of information upholds fundamental rights such as respect for privacy and the protection of personal data and reinforces mutual confidence between the competent police and judicial authorities.
We want to see a framework decision that comes into line with what is laid down for the first pillar.
It makes no sense for the Union to have a high level of personal data protection under the first pillar and to make completely different laws in respect of the third pillar.
The important thing is to guarantee a high level of protection, while taking account of the particular characteristics of police and judicial work.
This issue has been dragged from Presidency to Presidency, and the Council has regrettably shown little inclination to take a decision.
The Council must understand that this framework decision is linked to various proposals currently on Parliament's table, such as the Visa Information System, but that these proposals must not become hostages to the adoption of the framework decision.
in writing. The EPP-ED Group is keen that the Council not only adopts a Framework Decision on Data Protection which takes due account of the opinion of the European Parliament, but that it does so soon, as it undertook to do at the time of the adoption of both the SIS II package and the EU-PNR agreement.
We believe strongly that a strong Framework Decision will greatly facilitate the adoption of the VIS package.
However, while we consider it highly desirable that a Framework Decision be adopted soon, we agree with the statement of the rapporteur that the adoption of the Decision cannot be construed as a sine qua non for future work.
The EPP-ED Group will do everything in its power to prove responsible and loyal partners in the legislative process.
in writing. - (EL) The proposal for a recommendation formulates the basic refusal of the European Parliament to protect fundamental human rights even to the minimum.
Whereas the political forces of capital have previously voted in favour of the Schengen Agreement and its updated version, the SIS II information system, whereas they accept the VIS visa information system, which legalises the collection, processing and exchange of personal data relating even to the political, ideological, philosophical, religious and other views of every citizen of the ÎU and the introduction of biometric data and DNA-related data, now they are pretending to be worried because the Council is moving towards a decision which will not safeguard a 'high level of protection' for personal data.
Having accepted the facility to transmit personal data to the police authorities and secret services in third countries, such as under the agreement between the ÎU and the USA on the transmission of the personal data of Europeans flying to the USA (PNR), having agreed to the facility to transmit personal data even to private individuals, they are now calling on the Council to safeguard protection for personal data, having taken account, however, of the 'peculiar nature of the work of the police and judicial authorities'.
The hypocritical recommendations of the European Parliament cannot conceal its full alignment with the policy to legalise the monitoring of and the holding of files on European citizens.
in writing. - (FR) I would like to congratulate Mrs Morgan for the initiative she has taken in drawing up a report on the Green Paper presented by the Commission on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
Indeed, today we have to respond to some big questions about the future of Europe: how can we can guarantee a secure energy supply at prices that are predictable and affordable, particularly for the poorest citizens?
How can we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and on a few producer countries at a global level?
However, I have had to abstain from the final vote because I think that the proposed complete separation of the ownership of energy networks will not allow us to respond to these questions in a decent way, particularly questions about the security of investments and supply.
As Vice-President of the EU-Central Asia Delegation, I am concerned about the call to increase energy supplies from Central Asian producers such as Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
These countries are in fact zones where there is little respect for democracy or for the rule of law, and I think, like President Borrell, that one does not exchange petrol, gas or electricity for human rights.
This report that has been adopted is unfortunately entirely in line with the Commission's proposal, spelling out what it means by the 'European energy strategy', namely liberalisation, control over sources of supply and threatening people's sovereignty.
Working on the premise that the 'market' will solve the problem of energy supply and consumption, the report seeks to hide the increasingly obvious fact that the 'market' has worked in the interests of the few, who have obtained fabulous profits, and not in the interests of the consumers, who face ever higher energy bills and ever more frequent blackouts.
The 'market' is put forward as a solution to the lack of a genuine policy aimed at overcoming energy dependency on fossil fuels and excessive energy consumption.
We also find it unacceptable that the solution to issues of pollution is a system of emissions trading, given that this does not help reduce 'greenhouse gases'.
All it does is boost the profits of those in a position to earn them, thereby exacerbating inequality as regards development.
Furthermore, the path of a common external energy policy is a fresh threat to the sovereignty of those Member States that are most dependent, ...
(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163(1) of the Rules of Procedure)
in writing. (FR) I am voting against this report which, under the pretext of sustainable development and energy security, proposes a new stage of liberalisation and competition in a sector in which public services should, on the contrary, be consolidated.
The report asserts the necessity of increasing the separation between actors responsible for the marketing of energy and the owners and managers of energy networks. What is more, it insists on imposing a difference in the ownership of these two areas.
Clearly, this is a challenge to the existence of public enterprises responsible for the entirety of public service functions.
I cannot validate such a policy of privatisation and total competition: it will lead to an increase in energy prices, it does not ensure the reduction of energy consumption, nor does it ensure the development of renewable energy sources, and it increases inequalities between regions and citizens.
in writing. I voted in favour of the Morgan report on European energy strategy.
I am convinced it points the right way forward for a sustainable, competitive and secure energy policy for Europe and one that the Heads of Government would do well to take careful note of when they meet in March to discuss the future of EU energy policy.
My one disappointment is that the Parliament was not stronger on the need to 'unbundle' energy ownership to avoid conflicts of interest and to create a more level playing field for energy competition.
in writing. In this report there are a number of points we do not agree with, particularly in relation to nuclear power and liberalisation.
However, we have decided to vote in favour as there are a lot of positive elements in the report, particularly its emphasis on renewable energy, which is clean, cost-effective and secure.
We also agree that there should be an emphasis on fuel poverty.
in writing. In voting for this report I voted to put consumers at the centre of energy policy alongside an effective approach to dealing with harmful emissions such as CO2.
The effectiveness of a sensible Carbon Tax Trading Scheme depends upon internationalising the market.
Furthermore, strong targets for 2020-2050 for reduction of CO2 emissions as pronounced in this report are the only reasonable way ahead.
However, tidying up the ETS in both methodology and targets is something the EU must crucially put into action to remain a world leader in both working for a cleaner environment as well as sustaining a pan-European energy policy.
There is a danger that unless action is taken now then both our environment and our energy security will be under threat.
in writing. Mr President, I wholeheartedly congratulate our rapporteur Ms Morgan on this report, and am grateful that she has taken so many amendments which specifically answer Scottish concerns.
The Union's energy markets are increasingly interlinked and interdependent, and it is right that an EU framework be created to ensure that our consumers benefit from our common market.
From a Scottish perspective, we have a particular stake in the energy debate given our massive energy resources and even greater energy potential.
That potential is currently being held back by the shortsightedness of the UK Government, and this report will help us, from the EU side, to hold them to account.
in writing. - (FR) I would like to congratulate my colleague Mrs Morgan on her own-initiative report on the European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy.
This report contains notable advances on the social level, particularly in terms of facilitating access to energy for the poorest citizens, as well as on the environmental level.
However, I have abstained from the final vote because I regret the total separation of ownership in the gas sector.
Because of the specific features of this strategic sector, I think that a more flexible separation would have made it easier to ensure the security of supply and investments.
In spite of its inadequacies and even some points to which we object, there are some positive aspects in this report, inter alia in the area of protecting alternative and renewable energy sources.
However, we would stress the fact that biofuels cannot, on a sustainable basis, resolve the major problems of energy dependency, as they are of only local technical interest and have a limited impact.
Most importantly, the production of biomass and biofuels should not replace the main function of agriculture, which is food production.
I wish to highlight the devastating effects of the production of various oilseeds in developing world countries, for example the destruction of vast areas of forest, and oilseeds are the raw material for producing biofuels in Europe.
We therefore do not go along with the excessive emphasis placed on promoting energy crops for obtaining biofuels, given that such crops use scarce production factors like water and soil, as well as various fertilisers.
We therefore feel that the best thing would be for the Community to support the production of biomass and of biofuels obtained from various organic waste sources, such as forest residues, solid and urban waste, edible oils and waste resulting from the treatment of waste water.
in writing. (FR) Whatever hopes we place in biomass and biofuels, they cannot be more than a partial solution to our countries' problems of energy dependency and to the search for clean and renewable energy production.
This is, firstly, because the entire arable and forest areas of Europe, and even the planet, would not be enough to satisfy our needs, and because we do not want to replace one dependency by another more serious one, related to foodstuffs; and, secondly, because the current state of global carbon is not necessarily as positive as some would like us to believe.
It is true that we should profit from the potential of these energy sources, but not to the detriment of food production, not to the detriment of biodiversity and of the existence of the forests, nor to that of other uses for these products in the wood sector or other sectors, or even to the progress that we can hope for from research into the new hydrogen motors.
We should start, moreover, by getting rid of the absurd regulations which mean that in my country, in France, a community or a farmer may be sentenced to heavy fines for using biofuels in public transport or in a tractor, in violation of nonsensical fiscal rules.
in writing. Mr President, I congratulate our rapporteur for negotiating this complex area.
Biomass and biofuels are of massive global potential, yet the growth of this sector must at all times be managed sensitively.
I am sure I am not alone in receiving correspondence from many constituents worried that an unforeseen consequence of this policy could be the decimation of tropical rainforest to make way for biofuel monocultivation.
I believe this report, as amended, takes due account of these concerns and am happy to support it today.

Fiji
The next item on the agenda is the debate on the situation in Fiji.
author. - (LT) The situation in Fiji is very tense after yet another coup d'Ã©tat.
I believe that the European Parliament should react firmly.
Four revolutions over twenty years - that is really too many, and it promises nothing good for the people or the country.
This frightens off overseas investment, sharply reduces the flow of tourists, and stops financial aid.
The European Union allotted large sums of money to raise the educational standard and political sophistication of all ethnic groups, but unfortunately it has not been enough.
Thus far, the revolution has not claimed human victims.
The legal government welcomes acts of peaceful resistance.
Its position is supported by influential church representatives and the Great Council of Chiefs.
The situation is controlled by the army and censorship has been introduced.
The arrests and questioning of opposition representatives indicate that the situation may still become more acute.
The EU and our allies in this region should give a clear signal that the use of force will not be tolerated and that avoiding bloodshed is essential.
I invite my colleagues to condemn the use of force in Fiji, not to recognise the usurpers of power, and to support the opposition's invitation to the people of the country to oppose the revolution through peaceful demonstrations.
It is important to organise democratic elections in Fiji that meet the international standards as soon as possible, which are based on an equality principle between people despite their ethnic origin, and return to efforts of observing principles of legal superiority and democracy.
author. - Mr President, yet again we are confronted with a coup d'Ã©tat in Fiji.
Fiji has now suffered four coups d'Ã©tat in the last ten years and the latest one is based on the most unbelievable logic of Commander Bainimarama, who says that he took action to have a coup because the democratically elected government of Fiji was going to pardon the previous coup leaders.
The logic of this beggars belief but, whatever internal differences there may be between the Fijian leaders, it should not damage the fragile democracy of this Pacific island state.
The European Union, together with Australia and New Zealand, spent a considerable amount of money and resources to ensure that a fair and free election took place in Fiji in May 2006.
The Government of the Prime Minister came in with a considerable majority.
It is a unique constitution, under which the ethnic element - ethnic Indians and indigenous Fijians - shares power.
All that has been put at risk by the commander of the army taking the law into his own hands.
No commander of any army has the right to take any law into his own hands and subvert the course of democracy.
Therefore, I ask Parliament and my colleagues to send a strong signal that we will stop non-humanitarian aid.
We will tell the European population who want to go on holiday in a country like Fiji that they should not until democracy is restored.
We must send a signal to the Fijians that we are in complete solidarity with them on this very important issue of freedom, democracy and justice.
author. - (DE) Mr President, the military coup in Fiji has brought a country which is undergoing a tragic development to the attention of worldwide public opinion.
The economic situation in Fiji has also been worsened as a result of the EU's policy regarding sugar.
In the meantime, according to German radio, credit transfers from Iraq for the Fijian economy are no longer conceivable.
These ensure the survival of entire families and rural communities and, in the meantime, more money is arriving in Fiji from Iraq than is being generated by the local sugar industry.
How has this situation come about?
In Iraq, there are very many mercenaries from Fiji who make their money there and then return as individuals, some of whom have been heavily traumatised.
The military, which has become independent after a fashion, has played a role.
The talk is always of how the conflict in Fiji runs along ethnic lines.
Whilst, superficially, it may perhaps be considered an ethnic conflict, essentially, it is a question of power.
Which chieftains have a say?
Moreover, this conflict between the various clans is happening as we speak.
This coup d'Ã©tat essentially points to the fact that conditions there are unstable.
It is also to do with the fact that the conflict is a post-colonial one.
Here is a brief recap: since 1879, the British colonial administration has been bringing Indians from the subcontinent to work in Fiji, primarily in the cotton and sugar cane industries.
Consequently, this is one of the prevailing conflicts between the various ethnic groups.
When the EU now talks about condemning this military coup d'Ã©tat, something I wish to emphasise, we must also concede at the same time that the EU has made a not insignificant contribution to the causes of the conflict in Fiji.
We should also bear this in mind.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I too believe that we must condemn this coup d'etat, the fourth in twenty years, in a country, a former British colony, that is actually one of the richest and most developed in the South Pacific and that is among those with the most tourism.
Commodore Frank Bainamarama, commander of the Fijian army, deposed the elected prime minister and took power in a blatantly illegal manner.
He said that he was taking over President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's and Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's powers on a transitional basis with the intention of restoring them in the future, without stipulating when elections would take place.
The situation is clearly complicated, uncertain and worrying.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations himself said this clearly a little while ago: he condemned the military coup.
I believe that that is precisely what we in this House must do.
We must not just condemn the coup, but we must also make an explicit appeal for the release of the prisoners and hostages and demand the restoration of order and the rule of law, which had made it possible for elections to take place in a normal and acceptable fashion within a democratic context.
In addition to that, however, we must also acknowledge the European Union's responsibility.
We have a very strong instrument available to us: the Cotonou Agreement.
It is possible for us to use this framework - suspending non-humanitarian aid to Fiji - to apply pressure and achieve a political change in the region, provided that we bear in mind that this must not be to the detriment of humanitarian aid and certain educational projects that are already under way.
I would also like to support the proposed amendment presented by Mr PflÃŒger, which demands that these measures also help to ensure that the indigenous population of Fiji is not forced to flee and to ensure that any dialogue in the region includes all of the communities currently living in the country.
author. - (PL) Mr President, the international community must unequivocally condemn the military coup in Fiji.
We cannot pass over the military coup and overthrow of a democratically elected government in silence.
The European Union must answer the question of what measures it should apply to bring democracy and the rule of law back to the country.
This is the fourth military coup Fiji has seen in the last 20 years.
Seizure of power by the Army, which controls the government and the administration, and the suspension of a number of articles of the constitution will holdback the country's development.
It is hurting ordinary citizens and undermining Fiji's image as one of the most developed countries in the region and a destination for thousands of holidaymakers from all over the world.
I appeal to the Commission and Council to do everything in their power to overcome the present political crisis and restore democracy in Fiji.
The overthrow of the democratically elected government by the armed forces must be decisively condemned, and everything possible must be done to restore lasting principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law to this country.
I also ask that we consider imposing a travel ban to the countries of the European Union on the members of the army responsible for the military coup in Fiji and for the suspension of all aid other than humanitarian aid.
The international community needs to send out a clear signal that political and economic relations with the West will only be restored if the legal, democratically elected government in Fiji is returned to power.
author. - (HU) Last May, Fiji held parliamentary elections.
The European Union sent an observation mission to these elections.
The great honour of leading this election observer mission fell to me.
I can assure you, in full awareness of my responsibility, that the elections were free and fair, in line with international standards, and faithfully reflected the will of Fiji's electorate.
The only factor that already then cast a shadow on the electoral efforts was the unconstitutional, or anti-constitutional, declarations made by Commodore Bainimarama.
He was already threatening a coup d'Ã©tat at the time, and I myself spoke with him and very firmly drew his attention to the fact that he was thereby seeking to undermine the credibility of democracy.
In September, when I was next in Fiji, the situation seemed to have stabilised.
The two largest parties had formed a coalition in accordance with the constitution, or that conformed to the constitution, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qarase, and it seemed generally that the mood and tensions had calmed down.
It is most regrettable that on 5 December, the army transferred power to the military and overthrew the democratic government; it is impeding freedom of the press, has expelled people from the country and has detained protesters.
The country is now seeing the development of a visibly forceful yet peaceful, non-violent protest, which is extending to ever wider circles.
It is regrettable that the leadership of the second largest opposition party, the Labour party, does not distance itself unambiguously from the coup.
We must consistently demand that the army immediately and unconditionally return power to the democratically elected government, and we must use the available instruments, namely sanctions, to make it clear that what is currently happening in Fiji is entirely unacceptable to us.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, my home province of Bavaria has maintained close ties with Fiji for decades.
The Hanns-Seidel Foundation has been supporting democratic-related projects there for many years and a former Member of this House, the sadly now deceased Minister of State, Mr Fritz Pirkl, supported the cause of democracy in Fiji more than almost anyone else.
It is therefore truly distressing to see that barely six months after the democratic elections in May, such a brutal military coup d'Ã©tat has taken place, a coup d'Ã©tat which we are unable to condemn with sufficient force.
Nevertheless, we must be clear on one point, however. The overwhelming majority of the parliament elected in May, as well as all the major democratic forces, with the deplorable exceptions indicated by my fellow Member, Mr Szent-IvÃ¡nyi, are on the side of democracy there.
Likewise church groups, the different religions, the National Council of Chiefs, that is, representatives of the traditional structures, are quite clearly on the side of the democratically-elected Prime Minister.
We, as the European Union, must use all of our authority to restore freedom and rule of law in Fiji.
Therefore, no leniency whatsoever should be shown towards these tyrants and dictators.
That is why funds, right down to humanitarian aid, must be frozen.
However, we must also exert all the political pressure at our disposal to restore democracy and freedom on this beautiful group of islands immediately.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, today the European Parliament is condemning the military coup in Fiji by the military junta on 5 December.
The coup was in breach of the constitution, contrary to the rule of law, and against the democratic system developing in Fiji.
The latest elections there, held in May this year, were approved by EU observers as being properly conducted.
The coup d'etat is seriously undermining the Fijian economy, primarily in the tourist sector.
We should act promptly now, in particular by suspending non-humanitarian aid to Fiji under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and by imposing an EU travel ban on members of the junta, their families and their staff.
We must do everything we can to help democracy and civil society to deal with the current military coup d'Ã©tat and restore democracy.
Mr President, regarding the coup d'Ã©tat in Fiji there are three points we should consider.
Firstly, we should condemn the coup, as we are doing in our declaration.
Secondly, we need to consider whether the toppled democratic government was acting fairly with respect to the aboriginal minority, which supported the coup: the fact that it was a democratically-elected government does not necessarily mean that it was honest, fair and just.
Thirdly, we should consider supporting the initiative of the Polish premier, who said that the European Union needs to set up its own armed forces which could where necessary intervene on behalf of victims of injustice, and where, as in Fiji, a coup d'Ã©tat has taken place.
Let us therefore analyse the causes of this coup before issuing our final opinion.
In the meantime, we will in our resolution rightly condemn the coup and demand the restoration of democracy.
(DE) Mr President, when I was in Fiji last year with my fellow Member, Mrs Carlotti, and two colleagues from the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, on the day of our departure, the headline in the largest daily newspaper read coincidentally: 'Army: No more coups'.
Unfortunately, barely two years later, events are repeating themselves for the fourth time in 20 years.
This country has inherited a highly sensitive composition of peoples since colonial times, with Fijian natives just about outnumbering a very strong Indian minority, but with the latter dominating economically speaking.
For our part, we must make it perfectly clear that the balancing of interests between these groups can only be achieved by means of a thorough interethnic dialogue and not through the military.
Consequently, by putting a stop to financial assistance which would not benefit the people but which would simply make the work of the government easier, by placing travel bans on the rebels, and by supporting countermeasures undertaken by the Pacific Forum countries, we must make it clear to the military that they should return to their barracks immediately.
I do not believe that in this particular case, as mentioned by my fellow Member Mr PflÃŒger, the sugar market regime has brought about this coup d'Ã©tat.
What I mean is that, irrespective of the reform of the sugar market regime, the distribution of property in this country is very problematic because those parties who are engaged in the sugar trade, that is, Indians, have only rented the land from the original inhabitants and this leads to problems time and again if this involves extending leases.
I do not believe that EU policy has contributed to this coup d'Ã©tat through the sugar market regime.
I wanted to clarify this again here.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission agrees with Parliament.
The military takeover in Fiji is indeed a matter of great concern to us all.
Commissioner Michel has strongly condemned this seizure of power; it was also condemned by the Finnish Presidency and the European Union on 11 December 2006.
The takeover has been condemned by Fiji's ACP partners in the Pacific and by Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
These condemnations are more than mere words.
They result in international isolation, which will have serious consequences for Fiji.
It has already been suspended from the Commonwealth and cannot remain in the chair of the Pacific Forum.
The military takeover is a clear violation of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement and the essential parts of it concerning human rights, democracy and the rule of law.
It means there will have to be consultations pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which may lead to appropriate measures being taken to rectify the situation, including as a last resort suspension of development cooperation.
The European Union wishes to continue the dialogue with Fiji's legitimate authorities to find a consensus and encourage Fiji's return to democratic governance under the constitution.
The Commission is preparing a proposal for the opening of consultations under Article 96.
The military takeover will damage the Fijian economy.
The islands' most important economic sector is tourism: it will now suffer as a result of the instability and the security situation.
The interest rate has been raised, growth rates will suffer, the investment climate will deteriorate.
What has happened in Fiji is so serious that our continued cooperation is now at risk: much will depend on how the military behave in the next few days and weeks, in particular on how quickly they facilitate the return to democracy and the rule of law.
Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have spoken; I believe they are in agreement and show that everyone in the European Community is united on this.
The debate is closed.
Voting will take place today at 17.00.

Implication of the UN forces in sexual abuses in Liberia and in Haiti
The next item on the agenda is the debate on the implication of the UN forces in sexual abuses in Liberia and in Haiti.
author. - (ES) Mr President, why are we talking about the United Nations?
Because the European Union is the main donor of the funds that make it possible for that wonderful invention to operate.
I have here with me Nirj Deva, who is a fierce advocate of the necessary role that the United Nations must play in the world.
A hundred thousand people are working for the United Nations to maintain peace in the world and practically every single one of them does their work very well, but there have been accusations of, and complaints about, crimes of sexual abuse, child prostitution and paedophilia.
There have been accusations in the Republic of Congo, in Kosovo and now in Liberia and in Haiti, the country from which I have just returned.
Since 1994, amongst the one hundred thousand personnel deployed as peace-keeping forces, more than three hundred cases of sexual crimes against children, against people with few resources, have been investigated.
As a result of the three hundred and nineteen cases investigated, one hundred and seventy-nine soldiers have been found guilty.
If we are going to maintain peace and if we need the Member States of the United Nations to send personnel, we must do everything we can to ensure that they are going to maintain peace and not to indulge in sexual tourism paid for essentially with Europeans' money.
This Resolution is therefore intended to praise the role of the United Nations, but also to state that we need the Member States responsible for peace-keeping forces and soldiers to behave in a civil manner that respects human rights.
We must therefore prevent any more rapes of women and children, we must prevent paedophilia and we must stop European money being used, via the United Nations, for the purposes of committing sexual crimes.
author. - (PT) It has been well documented that there have been complaints of children being subject to rape and forced into prostitution by UN peacekeeping forces in Haiti and Liberia.
This follows on from other similar scandals, including paedophilia perpetrated by UN personnel in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the trafficking of human beings in Kosovo.
These are deeply shocking acts, which we condemn, and we would like measures to be put in place to prevent such acts from happening again.
We are in denial about the fact that these acts of sexual abuse and exploitation and other forms of criminal behaviour committed by UN staff, which violate human rights and which run counter to, and are a betrayal of, the UN's humanitarian and peacekeeping mission take place.
As the resolution to which we put our name stresses, we know that action has been taken in the form of inquiries and disciplinary measures.
As recent cases show, however, the troops' countries of origin too must take action to prevent any repetition and to ensure that the outstanding work of the majority is not tainted.
We also call on the UN to take steps to protect vulnerable people such as women, children and refugees in areas in which its troops are operating.
We call on the Commission and the Member States, moreover, also to support initiatives aimed at safeguarding the rights of women in conflict or post-conflict zones and to take economic and social measures to make these women less vulnerable to sexual exploitation.
author. - (PL) Mr President, in the last century the gravest cause for concern were aggressive superpowers such as Germany under Hitler or the Soviet Union.
Unfortunately, these problems did not end with the turn of the century.
In the 21st century we are still encountering violence and inhuman, humiliating treatment of others.
This is particularly regrettable when the organisations whose duty it is to help nations which have been oppressed and suffered injustices send in peacekeeping personnel who, instead of bringing help, bring more suffering and humiliation.
Such is the situation in Liberia and Haiti at the moment.
Instead of maintaining security, peace and respect for individual rights the peacekeepers have been engaging in the disgraceful practice of sexually abusing women and young girls.
There have even been cases of children being raped and forced into prostitution.
Any kind of sexual abuse and other forms of criminality that are blatant violations and betrayals of peacekeeping and humanitarian missions by UN personnel, and which are infringements of human rights, must be condemned categorically.
The people in question have suffered enough already.
They waited hopefully for salvation, but what did they get instead?
The same story all over again, except this time round the perpetrators were those who they expected to help them.
author. - (ES) Mr President, giving the UN the greatest possible support is a strategic priority within the European Union's foreign policy.
Our Parliament has reiterated this, with particular acknowledgement of actions in the field of conflict prevention and peace missions.
This support was expressed once again by Parliament's delegation that visited New York a few weeks ago and that held talks with the Secretary-General and the people in charge of peace-keeping operations.
What we have said is consistent with the House's decision to award the Sakharov Prize to Kofi Annan, for the work that had been done in the very field that we are dealing with here.
The Resolution that we are to approve should therefore be seen within the context of the solidarity that the European Union is expressing with the UN's difficult work in this field.
It is regrettable and extremely unfortunate for the organisation itself that certain personnel acting in the name of the United Nations have behaved in a criminal fashion, carrying out proven sexual assaults on women and children in countries in which they were carrying out missions.
That kind of behaviour tarnishes the image of the UN, which also faces great pressure from certain people in the world who, taking a unilateralist view of international relations, adopt the opposite view to us and would prefer to see the UN's role greatly restricted.
While we are condemning this behaviour, therefore, we are also acknowledging that they are exceptional cases and expressing our satisfaction at the fact that it has been the UN itself that has brought them to light.
We must also urge the United Nations to take the greatest possible care in its selection and training of people taking part in these missions, either as agents of the UN or as participants from the Member States or associated NGOs.
For the UN and for those of us who identify with it, it is essential to clear up any doubts over the view we take of the behaviour being condemned, and we all have the responsibility of ensuring that the guilty people do not go unpunished.
(ES) Mr President, while it is unacceptable that anyone should exploit or abuse women and children, taking advantage of their defencelessness and vulnerability, as we are seeing on a daily basis in Afghanistan or - as has already been mentioned - in the recent cases of Sudan or the Republic of Congo, it is absolutely unforgivable that those responsible for that abuse should also be responsible for protecting the women and children concerned.
This is particularly serious if, to make matters worse, it is United Nations personnel, whose stated role, as has been pointed out, is to protect not just these people's lives and dignity, but also peace as a concept.
The constant cases of sexual violence, therefore, such as those committed in Haiti or in Liberia by United Nations staff and particularly by soldiers, civilian personnel and police, must not under any circumstances be ignored or go unpunished.
They must be appropriately condemned and penalties applied.
In this regard, it is extremely worrying that the staff expelled from the organisation for having engaged in sexual exploitation or abuse are rarely prosecuted in their countries.
The governments of those countries therefore have a responsibility, and it is therefore also necessary that impunity in relation to incidents of this kind should not be accepted under any circumstances.
That requires that we move towards the adoption of an international treaty which, being of a binding nature and involving penalties, can clearly detect, and take action in relation to, practices of this kind when they take place.
Any kind of flexibility in this regard would be entirely unacceptable.
I believe it necessary, firstly, for the fundamental and classic principle of zero tolerance to be properly applied, as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has said on several occasions.
Secondly, the issue must also be tackled from the point of view of the vulnerability suffered by women in post-war conflict situations.
It is therefore important that aid programmes should prioritise the empowerment of women so that they themselves can defend themselves in these situations and be less vulnerable than they are at the moment.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the UN is an organisation which enjoys a high degree of credibility worldwide on the subject of maintaining peace.
It is extremely important that this good reputation is preserved.
If all we receive is shocking reports of rape and sexual abuse, we must also assume, unfortunately, that a high number of incidents have gone unreported, also in view of the fact that reports are circulating of a culture of silence within the UN missions themselves.
I am convinced that only a strategy of zero tolerance will succeed.
This means that the commanders on site must be able to send the persons in question home immediately, in which connection the country responsible for sending the individual in question is under an obligation to prosecute said party at home under criminal and disciplinary law.
For the individual soldiers, many of whom are from developing countries, such deployment is also of financial interest.
If it gets about that examples are actually to be made by sending people home, meaning that money is no longer paid, this would presumably be the most effective way of reducing such incidents in future.
However, it must also be made clear that superiors who tolerate such conduct will no longer be available for deployments of this nature in future.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the references to the sexual abuse of children in Haiti and Liberia by UN personnel is just the most recent in a long list of similar scandals.
These human rights violations contrast starkly with the humanitarian task of the United Nations to preserve peace.
In many parts of the world, UN troops assist in overseeing the transitions from dictatorships to democracies and transformation processes.
Time and again, however, individual UN soldiers have committed serious misdemeanours, damaging the reputation of the peacekeepers.
Since troop training and discipline is ultimately also the responsibility of the Member States, we call on those countries which provide UN contingents to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the parties accused.
We call on the United Nations to create a working environment in which the culture of silence does not stand a chance, for this is inconsistent with the zero tolerance policy of the United Nations.
It should not be the case that sexual abuse goes unreported for fear of reprisals.
Reference has also already been made today to the importance of strengthening the role of women.
In connection with this, I would like to appeal to the Council, the Commission and also to the UN, that Resolution 1325, which was adopted by the UN Security Council in 2000, be implemented in practice.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, there is now ample evidence that a number of United Nations peacekeepers have, in recent years, been involved in hideous crimes against the vulnerable civilian populations they are supposed to protect.
These crimes include such abominable acts as rape and sexual exploitation of children.
In considering the subject, there are three aspects that are extremely worrisome and disconcerting.
First, it is almost certain that the reported and investigated cases are only the tip of the iceberg.
Some claim that, for every case investigated, there are ten that will never come to light.
Second, in most instances a cover-up operation is put in motion, not just by the criminals involved, but also by their superiors in command - the comradeship-in-arms of soldiers becoming the conspiracy and concealment of criminals.
In any event, carrying out a proper investigation under the circumstances involved is not just difficult, but, in most cases, it is impossible.
Of relevance here is the fact that jurisdiction over UN soldiers lies with the country of origin of the individuals involved.
Such a jurisdiction process is strewn with procedural and legal problems and, in effect, provides UN soldiers with immunity from prosecution.
Third, in most cases investigated and found to be substantiated, the guilty get away with minimal punishment.
Ordinarily, a paedophiliac rapist would get life imprisonment in most countries, but a UN paedophiliac rapist would probably merely be disciplined, or would just be excluded from again being hired by UN missions.
This shameful, despicable and abhorrent criminal activity by UN personnel cannot go unpunished, and neither can the ultimate political responsibility of the UN hierarchy be swept under the carpet.
The outgoing UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, has a lot of explaining to do in this respect.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the present debate on breaches of human rights is particularly shocking and repulsive as it relates to human trafficking and sexual abuse against children in Liberia, Haiti, Congo and elsewhere by the staff of humanitarian missions who are supposed to provide help and care to the victims of starvation and armed conflict and ensure their security, protection and nourishment.
Exploitation, sexual abuse, forced prostitution and trading in starving children show what degradation and moral depths people can sink to when they are driven by their urges and ignore moral principles.
Even if only a handful of individuals are guilty of such vile and shocking practices, it is the others, the thousands of dedicated mission personnel, who bear the burden of suspicion, and this leads to a loss of hope.
That is why we cannot remain silent and must demand that the guilty be punished, and that the personnel of humanitarian missions be carefully selected and screened.
(PL) Mr President, I would like to highlight three issues.
Firstly, the shock and horror that resulted form the reports of UN forces being implicated in sexual abuse in Liberia and Haiti make it clear that these questions must be fully cleared up by the structures of the UN, and that the individuals guilty of these crimes must be brought to justice and punished.
The second point is what Miguel Angel MartÃ­nez has already spoken about, which is the role of UN peacekeeping forces in the modern world, and the importance which the European Union attaches to these forces.
The third point is the need for special training for UN peacekeeping forces in human rights, which should include an element of gender relations.
I would also like to underline that there should be a proportionate participation by women in UN peacekeeping missions.
These actions could in future become a guarantee that crimes of this type are never repeated.
Mr President, after East Timor, Somalia, Kosovo and Congo, can we really see what is happening in Haiti and Liberia as exceptional?
Wherever the UN goes it seems that sexual abuse occurs against the civilians they are supposed to protect.
Kofi Annan has been the Secretary-General of the UN and its peacekeeping forces for many years while this abuse by UN personnel, for whom he bears responsibility, has been taking place.
He has done nothing about it.
Instead, he allows it to be covered up, as an internal UN report on sexual abuse in East Timor demonstrates.
Though sexual abuse has been a problem there since the arrival of the UN in 1999, not one UN staff contractor or soldier has been brought to justice, even when it involved East Timorese children.
The Pope and the Vatican are held responsible for sexual abuse by priests, so why does the same principle not apply to Kofi Annan and the UN?
Mr Annan will retire soon to great honours and a generous pension.
I hope his successor will take sexual abuse seriously.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it goes without saying that the Commission shares Parliament's indignation and concern at this unacceptable and intolerable behaviour by soldiers engaged in peacekeeping operations.
As such, of course, this question is not strictly speaking within the Commission's competence.
It is, however, obvious that the exploitation and sexual abuse of which some of the Blue Berets have been guilty can only be of very serious concern to us.
These incidents have not only sapped the confidence of the local populations, who are already traumatised and impoverished, but they are also in breach of the obligation of care incumbent on all peacekeeping personnel.
The Commission therefore fully supports the measures taken by the UN as part of its policy of zero tolerance towards such acts of exploitation and sexual abuse.
Obviously, the Commission joins the European Parliament in encouraging the UN to quickly take the severest action in this matter.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place presently, following this afternoon's debates.
3.
Myanmar (Burma)
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions concerning Burma.
author. - (DE) Mr President, 10 December 2006 was International Human Rights Day.
In many countries, this was not a holiday but a day for mourning.
This is the case in Burma, for instance, where brutal attacks, killings and slave labour are the order of the day.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven away or have fled in the face of rioting.
For the first time in 18 years, there were changes in the government with a change of personnel in the armed forces.
However, the Junta chief, General Than Shwe, remained, along with his deputy, Maung Aye.
The EU established that gross human rights violations are still taking place.
Just recently, Burmese people were forced to construct police stations and buildings for the military against their will.
Workers had to walk like human tracker dogs through minefields.
This perfidious slave labour should not be tolerated.
The International Red Cross also experienced a worsening of the situation.
It was prohibited from carrying out further work.
It had to withdraw from its regional offices, leaving the population without medical supplies.
Essentially, aid for the Burmese people must come from outside, but this aid must reach the people directly, without falling into the hands of the powers that be.
In Burma, around 30% of the children are malnourished whilst at the same time, the country is the second largest opium producer.
Many thousands are political prisoners and the Sakharov prize winner, Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for the last 16 years.
Large ethnic groups have been oppressed and any opposition nipped in the bud.
We call on China and other countries to finally discontinue aid for the military Junta and to participate in international measures designed to bring about positive changes in Burma.
Action taken by the ASEAN countries against those in power is an important and necessary step.
Burma needs a road map to democracy in order to institutionalise human rights and to adopt a convention which introduces steps for the introduction of democracy.
Commissioner, the EU must become much more active and perhaps even impose sanctions to bring the violence to an end.
author. - (NL) Mr President, countries governed by leaders whose power is derived, not from their electorate, but from their machinery of violence can be extremely attractive to foreign investors, who capitalise on low wages, bad working conditions and a population that has no scope for protesting.
Moreover, free movements that want to protect nature and the environment from short-sighted decisions aimed at increasing short-term industrial profits have no means of functioning there.
If their main goal is to keep the costs of their companies down and to derive benefit from this within the international market, then Burma has for many years been the right place for them to be, and it was international support from the likes of them that enabled the military regime to weather domestic protests in its early years.
Since a number of major companies withdrew from Burma under pressure from protests in their home lands, things have been quiet; the regime accepts the low standard of living and the criticism from outside as inevitable, without making any changes.
Election results are still ignored; the leader of the opposition is still in jail, and minority peoples are oppressed and driven away, as they have always been.
International aid organisations are being sabotaged.
This regime cannot even attract a political following for itself and now serves no purpose other than its own preservation.
This regime in Burma will be able to survive unnecessarily long if its neighbouring countries do not isolate it, if the arms supplies are not stopped and if the European Union does not emphatically demand that economic sanctions be adhered to.
Since the resolution supports the measures which my group has been demanding for years, we are happy to support it.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I spoke here on the situation in Burma a little over a year ago.
Even then, the words repression, ruling military junta and disregard for human rights occurred frequently in what I had to say.
Sadly, the situation has not changed. Burma is still making no effort to get power exercised more democratically.
Moreover, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has closed several International Red Cross offices, making that organisation's humanitarian work impossible.
The authorities there are preventing non-governmental organisations from working properly, causing many of them to leave.
We are also unable to understand why India is providing military aid. Does that country not proclaim itself to be the world's largest democracy?
It is utter nonsense and we condemn it.
India cannot be unaware that such military aid will be used to repress ethnic groups and political opponents.
I think the United Nations Security Council should take strong measures against Burma, condemning this illegitimate regime and calling for the restoration of democracy.
I would also like to underline my confidence in the positive influence the other ASEAN countries may have: in seeking greater integration they are in my opinion playing a not insignificant role in relation to human rights.
I wish that China and India would play a similar role in future so that the Burmese regime will move towards democracy.
author. - Mr President, Commissioner, in recent years Burma has regularly been on the EU's human rights agenda.
For good reason, too, since the Burmese authorities continue to subject their citizens to gross human rights violations, including forced labour, persecution of political opponents and forced relocation.
A glaring example of the anachronistically deficient attitude exhibited by the profoundly irrational Burmese military regime is the fact that the National League for Democracy (NLD) leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Sakharov Prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for the last ten years, despite an overwhelming international outcry.
While the Burmese population suffers exhaustively through malnutrition and disease, the Burmese Government has thought it wise to embark on persecution of Red Cross representatives across the country.
In considering how to make such a totalitarian governing body understand our resolve to protect the human rights of the Burmese people, we are of the opinion that targeted sanctions, focused on economic income revenue to the junta, must be implemented.
Furthermore, we call upon countries that continue to supply Burma with weapons to cease to do so.
Additionally, we expect the UN Security Council to adopt a binding strict resolution on Burma.
We hope that, eventually, the blinded military dictators of Burma will finally see the light of sense and democracy and hand over power to a civilian-elected government.
author. - Mr President, those of us active in these human rights debates will recognise the subject of this one with depressing familiarity.
The situation in Burma is getting worse not better, as colleagues have said, and I echo everything that has been said thus far.
In our view this motion could have been better.
However, there is one provision I would highlight and that is the paragraph recognising that the sanctions against the regime in force are not hitting the target and on occasion not being observed at all.
The Council must ensure that all our Member States are observing the sanctions we have agreed and, if not, name and shame those falling down.
We must put pressure on our international partners to put pressure on the Burmese Government itself.
Paragraph 9 states that we want to see the sanctions widened, but we must always target them against the specific individuals in the regime and avoid doing harm to the people of Burma, because the suffering of the people must be our main concern, not our distaste for the democratic standards of the regime itself.
That is where this motion really could be better.
We wanted to see an explicit recognition of the 8 December briefing by the International Crisis Group and I shall quote the opening line: 'With growing signs of a humanitarian crisis in-the-making in Myanmar, the international community needs to get beyond debates about the country's highly repressive political system.'
Caught in the middle of the grand geopolitics along with the people of Burma are the NGOs active on the ground trying to ameliorate the situation for the citizens of that unhappy country.
We must in all our efforts remember that we must not undermine their independence, their efforts or ability to help the people.
The recent closure of five Red Cross centres, an organisation that prides itself on its impartiality and integrity, is a desperate act by the Burmese Government, but one that was carried out because of a suspicion that the NGOs are too close to western policy.
We must in all our actions on this ensure that we do not cut down their scope for manoeuvre.
Therefore, in welcoming and supporting this resolution, my Group would also sound a note of caution that the people on the ground trying to help those most affected by the situation must not have their freedom of movement curtailed by our actions.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, a brutal, totalitarian military dictatorship, corrupt rulers, the opium trade, expulsions (at the moment, we have over half a million internal exiles) and the suppression of many peoples, not least the Karen. All this characterises the sad situation which has existed in Burma for more than 40 years.
There are, however, two new developments to which we must turn our attention.
Firstly, the ASEAN countries have finally decided on following a harder line, which we can only encourage and support.
At last, the ASEAN countries are fulfilling their obligations and starting to exert pressure on Burma.
Secondly, it is regrettable that Indians have allowed themselves to become more and more entangled in bad company with these military rulers.
We are appealing to the world's largest democracy, namely India, to take its democratic responsibility seriously and, together with ASEAN and the European Union, to support democracy and rule of law in Burma and not become chums with one of the world's most evil regimes.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, a year and a half has passed since the latest resolution of the European Parliament condemning the infringement of human rights in Myanmar.
Unfortunately nothing has changed since then.
The military regime that has ruled the country for forty years openly ignores the recommendations of the international community.
Opposition politicians are imprisoned and tortured.
Forced labour and the use of child soldiers are part of daily life.
The complete collapse of the education and health system is cause for concern.
The death rates for malaria, TB and AIDS is rocketing, while the regime bans the activities of non-governmental organisations and has closed the headquarters of the International Red Cross.
Also worthy of condemnation are the acts of aggression and forced displacement of ethnic minorities that have affected more than eighty thousand people this year alone.
If we do not provide financial assistance, pro-democracy and human rights organisations in Myanmar will be condemned to failure.
At the moment it seems that the only way to force the regime in Myanmar to introduce changes in favour of democracy are economic sanctions backed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Vice-President of the Commission. (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like the other European institutions and like your Parliament, the Commission is very concerned at the situation in Burma.
It is exactly 15 years since the European Parliament awarded Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi the Sakharov Prize.
We deplore the fact that the political process in that country has been completely paralysed since then.
It is true that, like other developing countries, the Burmese authorities are faced with considerable challenges - guaranteeing national unity, political stability, speeding up the country's economic and social development - but that does not prevent the establishment of a legitimate civilian government.
The present government has said many times that the military authority would be replaced by a legitimate, elected regime based on the road map for Burma, but we are still at the stage of promises.
It is for all of us, observers and international backers, inconceivable that a transition to a legitimate and democratically elected regime should take place without dialogue.
Such a dialogue must bring together government and political players.
It must include Burma's many ethnic minorities and bring an end to the fighting in the areas where those minorities live.
In the same way, political transition is inconceivable so long as the present regime's political opponents are in prison or deprived of their liberty, as is still the case of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi and more than 1 000 of the regime's opponents.
The vision of a democratic and prosperous Burma also assumes respect for human rights.
Such respect is cruelly lacking.
Despite the existence of a civil society, the exercise of basic rights is far from guaranteed: intimidation, arbitrary arrest, imprisonment of civilians for exercising their civic rights, and restrictions of individual liberties are continuing.
Members of political parties are under constant surveillance by the security services.
Part of the population is being exploited by the army, which is using them as forced labour.
It goes without saying that the restrictions imposed on the International Committee of the Red Cross, as you rightly said, are intolerable: there are few signs that the government is undertaking to remedy the matter.
What is the European Union's position on all this, ladies and gentlemen?
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Charter of the International Labour Organisation are our benchmarks.
The European common position imposes restrictions on visas and investment.
On the trade front, Burma no longer enjoys the preferential trade arrangements conferred by the system of generalised preferences.
For all that, the very nature of the Burmese regime makes the Burmese population highly vulnerable to poverty and disease.
For that reason, the Commission has decided to increase its assistance appreciably from 2007, especially in the fields of health and education.
The Global Fund To Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, under the aegis of the United Nations and cofinanced by the Commission, should enable those three diseases to be combated more effectively.
In that country's particular context, any programme calls for vigilance and commitment.
The programmes financed by the Community, to the tune of around EUR 24 million, are being implemented by UN agencies and international NGOs.
The Commission has also set up a decentralised cooperation programme to support civil society.
Moreover, the Commission is by far the largest donor to Burmese refugees in Thailand.
In critical dialogue with the government, the Commission will not cease reminding the Burmese authorities of their responsibilities.
The transition in Burma must respect human rights.
The admirable struggle of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize laureate, reminds us of that every day.
Mr President, may I say on my personal behalf that I have particularly appreciated these debates on human rights, especially the debate on Burma.
I would really like to assure Parliament that the Commission will be showing the utmost vigilance and the utmost determination in doing all it possibly can to bring to an end the situation currently prevailing in that country.
(Applause)
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place after the debates, that is in a moment.

Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
The Minutes of the sitting of 14 December 2006 have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
(FR) I will be very brief, Mr President.
Last week in Strasbourg, Parliament adopted a number of important reports, including two on the ten proposals relating to the financial perspectives in the field of the area of freedom, security and justice for the period 2007-2013.
I simply wanted to take the opportunity offered by the approval of the Minutes to thank the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for the exceptional work which it had to complete quickly and also to Parliament's services, which were able to correct a number of disturbing material errors and provide the translations of the reports originally filed by that committee.
The texts now clearly reflect the will of the plenary, and I would also like in your hearing to thank the Council services, which provided us with the translations of the texts on which we were able to obtain complete agreement.
Thank you very much, Mr Cavada, for your comments, which are certainly very appropriate and reflect the efforts made by your committee and all the committees that collaborated with it to achieve this important result.
I therefore congratulate you and everyone involved in this process.
Mr President, last Thursday we adopted a number of changes to the Rules of Procedure, including the change to the new procedure on comitology, to take advantage of the biggest increase in the powers of Parliament since the Treaty of Nice.
I understand that a new edition of the Rules of Procedure is to be published soon.
May I urge that it be distributed in January if at all possible and can I also ask that it be completed with the adaptation of the various numbers in the Rules that have to be adapted automatically, without a vote in Parliament, to take account of the new size of the European Parliament?
As you know, we shall be increasing in numbers in January.
Thank you for your request, Mr Corbett, which is also relevant.
As you know, we have a problem with the translations.
Parliament's services tell me that they are doing everything possible to make a provisional version available in every language in January.
That version will have to be considered a provisional version but it is undoubtedly helpful for Members to be able to have access to it as soon as possible.
It would therefore appear that your request will be met and that we will have a provisional version available in every language in January.
After that the versions will have to be revised to ensure that the translations are correct before this process of reforming our Rules of Procedure can be finally deemed completed.
(The Minutes were approved)

Welcome
Before moving on to the first item on the agenda, I would like to welcome a delegation from the Pan African Parliament, led by Her Excellency Mrs Getrude Mongella, President of the Pan-African Parliament, which is seated in the public gallery.
(Applause)
Welcome, Madam President.
Your delegation will take part in an exchange of views today with our Committee on Development and with the Delegation for relations with the Pan-African Parliament.
You will also have meetings with representatives of the European Parliament's different services in order to help you to develop your Parliament's administrative structure and strengthen the relations between our two institutions.
I wish you a happy and fruitful stay in Brussels.
Signing of REACH and the seventh framework research programme
We will now move on to the joint signing of the REACH programme and the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
I think that it is appropriate for us to take a few minutes to sign officially in public, in this House, two important pieces of European legislation that Parliament and the Council have just adopted: REACH, the Regulation governing the chemical industry and its environmental impact, and the Seventh Framework Research Programme.
The joint signing of acts adopted under the codecision procedure is, as you know, the final stage in the Union's lengthy and complicated legislative process before the acts are published in the Official Journal.
It is the moment when the two co-legislators (the Council and Parliament) add their political seal to the new legislation.
I therefore have great pleasure in welcoming to Parliament this morning the Prime Minister of Finland, who is representing the Presidency of the Council and who will sign these important acts with me.
I would also like to welcome Mr Barroso and invite him to join us for the photograph of the signing.
I would like to thank, too, the various Members of the European Parliament who have been most closely involved in these two new legislative acts and ask them to witness the signing: the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Mr Florenz; the REACH rapporteur, Mr Sacconi; the Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mr Ransdorf; and the three rapporteurs for the Seventh Framework Research Programme, Mr Buzek, Mr Busquin and Mrs Laperrouze.
Before signing the acts, I think it would be appropriate for Mr Vanhanen to say a few words, if he so wishes.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to be here today.
The signing of this document is a historic moment.
The REACH Regulation will mean a complete revision of EU legislation on chemicals.
It is a huge step on from the current system of control, which is 40 years old.
The aim of the REACH Regulation is to guarantee high standards of health and environmental protection and boost the competitiveness of the EU's chemicals industry through the use of high standards of safety and by promoting product development.
With the REACH regulation a European Chemicals Agency will be created to deal with such tasks as registration of substances.
The fact that the Regulation has been approved is a genuinely important achievement.
It is also a splendid example of excellent levels of cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament.
On this point it has to be said, however, that the work has to continue.
We must now all of us ensure that the Regulation is implemented effectively.
I am very pleased that on this auspicious occasion the results of our collaboration also allow us to finalise the details regarding the seventh framework research programme.
Research and development play a major role in promoting European competitiveness and in the implementation of the goals of the Lisbon Strategy.
The framework research programme is the Community's main instrument for achieving these aims.
It will also be an important tool in the development of a new, wide-ranging policy on innovation, which has also been one of the Finnish Presidency's main themes.
May I once again sincerely thank the European Parliament for its excellent levels of cooperation in the negotiations on the framework research programme.
Without you we would not be here now.
I am very pleased that the programme will get under way on schedule from the start of 2007.
(Applause)
(Accompanied by JosÃ© Manuel Barroso (President of the Commission), Karl-Heinz Florenz (Chairman of the Committee on the Environment), Guido Sacconi (rapporteur for the REACH reports), Miloslav Ransdorf (Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy) and the three rapporteurs for the Seventh Framework Research Programme, Jerzy Buzek, Philippe Busquin and Anne Laperrouze, the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the European Parliament signed the acts relating to the REACH programme and the Seventh Framework Research Programme)
Meeting of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 - Activities of the Finnish Presidency
The next item is the joint debate on the European Council report and Commission statement on the meeting of the European Council of 14 and 15 December 2006 and the statement by the Presidency-in-Office of the Council on the activities of the Finnish Presidency during its six-month term.
President-in-Office of the Council. (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to be here once again to talk with you in my capacity as President of the European Council.
A meeting of the European Council during Finland's Presidency was held in Brussels on 14 and 15 December.
My purpose now is to report to you on its outcome.
As Finland's six-month Presidency of the Council draws to a close, I also want to tell you what we have done for our Union during our term.
Last Thursday at the European Council we offered President of the European Parliament, Josep Borrell, our sincerest thanks, now that his duties are almost over.
I would like to thank him here once again for his dedicated efforts for the good of Europe.
Mr President, it has been a pleasure working with you.
We have achieved many good results, for which I thank you sincerely.
Your work has been much appreciated.
(Applause)
Here I would also like to thank the European Parliament for all its support and the combined efforts that it has made.
Together, we have achieved some significant results.
The Union's legislation on chemicals, the Reach Regulation, has finally been adopted.
Consumers and industry have both been awaiting this legislation.
We also adopted the Services Directive, thus creating the world's largest market in services.
The seventh framework research programme, meanwhile, will lay the foundations for European competitiveness.
At the start of the Finnish Presidency I said that the European Parliament was clearly becoming the place where European solutions are found for thorny, complex problems.
That is still my firm belief and today I want to thank Parliament sincerely for its excellent levels of cooperation and express my appreciation for its work.
In an increasingly politicised Europe, Parliament is a more important player than ever.
The main themes at the December European Council were the EU's enlargement policy, justice and home affairs, and consolidation of the results of the informal summit in Lahti.
Since the conclusions of the European Council are available to you, I am not going to explain them in any great detail.
I just want to bring to your attention a few of the most crucial policy decisions.
The European Council conducted a thorough and wide-ranging discussion of the EU's policy on enlargement, in line with the mandate given it by the June European Council.
I wish here to reiterate one basic point: the Union's enlargement policy has been a huge success.
The Union has succeeded in uniting Europe and overcoming the two-way split of the Cold War.
Today, the EU is a proud and close union of 25 Member States - 27 from the beginning of next year.
It is a pleasure to welcome Bulgaria and Romania as members of our European family.
Turkey's membership was not on the European Council's agenda.
The decisions concerning its accession process were taken at the General Affairs and External Relations Council preceding the European Council meeting.
The EU is thus capable of making decisions.
During its Presidency, Finland worked hard to find a solution that would have led to implementation of the protocol to the Ankara Agreement and direct trade with North Cyprus.
We did not succeed in this and so we had to decide on measures relating to Turkey.
The situation was clear: Turkey had not honoured its commitments and that has consequences.
I want to stress, however, that Turkey is a country whose future is in the European Union.
Turkey's accession process did not grind to a halt during the Finnish Presidency, nor was it shunted into a siding, to say nothing of the much predicted collision.
The process may have slowed down for a while but the final destination is as before.
The outcome of the European Council is that the Union remains open to new members.
Enlargement will continue and those applicants that meet the demanding conditions set by the Union will be able to join.
This open membership angle is essential to stability in Europe; it encourages reform in neighbouring countries as they progress along the European path.
This incentive must not be taken away from them.
One of the objectives which the Finnish Presidency set itself was to keep the EU's enlargement policy open and not close the door on deserving applicants.
We succeeded in this.
Our future is an ever-stronger and open Union.
On the basis of the discussions we can emphasise that the Western Balkans' membership prospects are real.
The region's future clearly lies in the EU.
That is of fundamental importance to us.
At the same time, obviously, the Union's enlargement policy must be respected.
The counterweight to an open door policy is rigorous application of the conditions.
There are no short cuts to EU membership.
Membership is possible only when the membership criteria have been met.
It was very important that there was no discussion of limits to Union enlargement, as there is no place for them. We cannot set up artificial barriers to the Union.
Our real borders are not to be found on the map but in values.
The construction of Europe is work in progress while there are still democratic black holes like Belarus so close by, which is a blot on the European landscape.
We do not need places like that in Europe anymore.
(Applause)
At the European Council, I gave an appraisal of the situation regarding the Constitutional Treaty.
During our Presidency, we have had systematic discussions with all Member States concerning the Constitutional Treaty.
I will not go into details regarding the individual Member States' positions, as we are bound by the confidential nature of the talks, but I do want to give you the general picture the Presidency got of the situation during the course of the consultations.
The first thing to mention is the change in atmosphere that took place during our Presidency.
When it started, people were still in a bit of a dream world.
No one really wanted to give the Constitution active consideration.
Now the Member States have started to think seriously about the future and many take the view that the Constitutional Treaty was actually a well thought-out and successful package.
We are still in a dilemma, though: the Treaty cannot be put before the Member States that rejected it in exactly the same form as before, even though it remains a well-balanced package.
Upsetting the balance would cause more problems than it would solve.
For that reason there is broad consensus that restarting negotiations as if there had been no Treaty is not possible.
The institutional provisions in the Constitutional Treaty in particular are the result of long negotiations and deliberation.
It is difficult to reopen talks without creating new problems.
At the same time I want to say that my personal view is that picking the Treaty apart would be no more than an apparent solution at best.
For example, we cannot separate Part I from Part III: the competences of the Union and of the Member States need to be clearly demarcated.
Part II of the Constitutional Treaty, on the other hand, sets out the fundamental values on which the Union is based.
I do not understand why they should be ignored.
For now, 16 Member States have ratified the Treaty and at the start of next year there will be 18 of us.
This is not a question, however, that can be resolved by force of numbers.
The Constitutional Treaty will not enter into force unless it is endorsed by all 27 Member States.
It would seem only reasonable to try and find a solution before 2009 when the next European Parliament elections are held and a new Commission appointed.
The fact nevertheless remains that the Constitutional Treaty is still on hold and that soon we will be handing the baton on to Germany.
We are looking to the German Presidency to take this difficult issue forward.
At the same time, though, it is important that we use whatever practical means are available to us to push ahead with European cooperation.
Justice and home affairs are one outstanding example of this.
Our citizens expect concrete action to improve security and justice.
Justice and home affairs, however, is beset by a serious problem.
The requirement of unanimity in police and criminal matters prevents genuine progress from being made in cooperation: cooperation which is important to our citizens.
They are entitled to expect more effective collaboration in improving security and combating crime.
At present, however, decisions on cooperation are either watered down or cannot be made at all, as we saw just recently with regard to the transfer of detainees.
The requirement of unanimity is a barrier to justice and home affairs and hinders real progress.
We have a procedure that would enhance decision-making on justice and home affairs, the passerelle provided by Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, which allows us to decide unanimously to switch to qualified-majority voting.
The Finnish Presidency was very eager to explore this possibility but at the September meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Tampere it was evident that a number of Member States opposed it.
This avenue has been closed to us, therefore.
That is why I welcome the fact that, in spite of everything, the European Council sent an unequivocal message that more effective decision-making on justice and home affairs is important, along with the principles set out in the Constitutional Treaty, and that means switching to qualified majority voting.
This is a major breakthrough, which we are pleased with.
Future Presidencies, furthermore, should honour this decision.
In this connection, I would say that, if there was one thing that I could change in the Union generally, with the experience of the EU Presidency behind me, it would be to increase substantially the number of decisions taken by qualified majority.
It is without question the most effective, the fairest and indeed the best way of arriving at good decisions.
The unanimity requirement does not serve European common interests in any but the most critical of matters.
The European Council held in-depth discussions on the Union's immigration policy.
It is in a spirit of solidarity that we all remember the problems that the Mediterranean Member States faced in the summer.
The Finnish Presidency actively addressed the challenges of illegal immigration and the matter was discussed at the extraordinary summit in Lahti.
This time, at the December European Council, we agreed on a comprehensive approach to both legal and illegal migration and we acknowledged the complexity of the issue.
Immigration is not primarily and only a question of better border controls.
Equally crucial are developments in the countries of departure, transit issues and a controlled immigration policy, which the EU so badly needs on account of its own ageing population.
Europe is not some remote island.
The European Council also endorsed the important results of the informal summit in Lahti.
We all agree that Europe needs a more focused innovation policy.
We cannot maintain our current levels of prosperity unless we are genuinely competitive in the future and cultivate our capacity for skills.
A significant feature of the Finnish presidential term has been that innovation has been at the very centre of competition policy.
Promoting innovation must be an integral part of the EU's competition strategy.
Now that the groundwork has been done, we expect the spring European Council to formulate some forward-looking innovation-policy guidelines.
Something else essential for the Union's sustainable economic growth and our competitiveness is how we are to agree on common energy policy goals and engage in wide-ranging, global cooperation to manage climate change.
These themes have attracted a growing amount of attention during the Finnish Presidency.
At the same time they were among the most important areas of cooperation discussed this autumn with Russia, the United States and our Asian partners.
The European Council's conclusions on energy and climate issues demonstrate that more consistent progress is now being made, as they point the Union to the path towards the spring summit during the German Presidency, at which these issues will be high on the agenda.
On Friday, I received some direct feedback from the press.
They thought that this European Council was boring, that the decisions lacked drama and that there were no last-minute solutions hammered out in the dead of night.
If it is dull for decisions to be taken in an orderly fashion and on schedule, then yes, I have to say that I am dull and proud of it.
Europe needs tangible results, not contrived political drama.
(Applause)
I am convinced that a Europe of results, as Commission President Barrroso so often emphasises, is the best way to take the Union forward.
We need practical solutions of benefit to our citizens.
Only that way can we build the sort of legitimate structure on which major solutions like the Constitutional Treaty can rest.
Mr President, there are 13 days remaining of the Finnish Presidency.
We will do our duty until the last minute.
One important theme during our term has been to strengthen the unity of the Union.
We will not cope in world affairs unless we can be more united in our external relations.
In the early days of Finland's Presidency we experienced a serious crisis in the Middle East, culminating in a serious war-like situation in Lebanon.
I am proud to say that the EU took a strong and united position on Lebanon, acted decisively to implement the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council and, most crucially, was able to mobilise troops, which was decisive for the success of a sufficiently strong UN operation in Lebanon.
The summer in Lebanon was a testing time but the Union came through the crisis laudably.
And I would like to say thank you here once again to all the Member States for the support which the Presidency received in trying to resolve this matter.
It is essential that we have a Union that is united and resolute in its external relations and that can use its wide range of instruments to work for a better world.
Since enlargement the Union has moved into the leading position in the world on a number of counts and we must take full advantage of this.
During our Presidency, we have also done a great deal to improve the coherence of development policy, for instance: an issue of primary importance to a significant global actor like the EU.
One of the priorities we set was to consolidate the EU's policy on Russia.
Here too, the practical importance of a united policy is very much in evidence.
At the informal summit in Lahti, we had a good discussion with the Russian President, Mr Putin, and the EU was able to speak with one voice to Russia.
Russia is clearly an important partner for the EU. A glance at the map is enough to see that.
Russia is important for the EU and we are bound together by many ties, but it is fair to say that there are a lot of developments in Russia that worry us.
I am not persuaded that Russia is heading in the right direction. We need to see a firmer commitment to democracy, the rule of law and the market economy.
We do not want Russia to go in an authoritarian direction.
We are fully entitled to be concerned about developments in Russia.
Russia is an acid test of the EU's unity.
Finland would like to have reached agreement on starting negotiations on a new and comprehensive agreement with Russia.
For reasons that are well known, that agreement has not been reached up till now.
I think that the new agreement provides an excellent illustration of the problem we face.
We need a strong joint agreement which incorporates the main basis for cooperation between us, values, and which provides a lasting foundation for trade and energy cooperation.
If no common agreement is possible, a regrettable and short-sighted option is a network of bilateral agreements that would enable Russia to treat different Member States in different ways.
Some will get good agreements, some will get bad ones, and some may get none at all.
Yet it goes without saying that a united EU is such an important partner for Russia that it can, as one single entity, negotiate a decent agreement.
Just how united is Europe if we are competing amongst ourselves to see who can get the best terms?
That is not what European solidarity is about.
Presidencies start with big goals, but real life brings us all back down to earth.
We have achieved a great deal but many crucial matters have been left unresolved.
Finland worked hard for a decision on amending the Working Time Directive and I think we got pretty close.
It was not enough, however.
The problem has not gone away of course and I wish subsequent presidencies every success in finding a solution to this European issue.
I am rather sad that this is the last time that I will be representing the Finnish Presidency at a plenary session of Parliament.
I will now have some splendid memories of good cooperation with Parliament and I would like to thank you all for the support you have given Finland in its endeavours.
I believe that Europe has a common future: a more united Europe where border fences will vanish.
I am particularly pleased that we achieved a result on Schengen enlargement.
That is the kind of practical progress that Europe's citizens expect from us as decision-makers.
Once again I want to thank the European Parliament sincerely for its excellent show of cooperation.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Vanhanen.
I would also like to thank you on behalf of the European Parliament for your excellent collaboration and constant presence, and that of your ministers, especially your European Affairs Minister, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki.
The consideration you have given to the European Parliament has produced tangible and concrete legislative results that will be remembered, such as the acts we have just signed and the Services Directive.
Thank you all.
President of the Commission. Mr President, last week's European Council was an important demonstration that Europe is moving decisively forward for results.
It showed a Europe of consensus and progress, the right kind of Europe to build for the future.
Prime Minister Vanhanen has given you a comprehensive overview of the results of the Summit, to which I fully subscribe.
The issues addressed - enlargement, immigration, innovation, climate change - are all long-term issues which require determined, ambitious, persistent action at the highest level.
They are not one-minute wonders which hit the headlines for a day and then fade away.
The momentum and focus which the European Council can provide is central to their success.
So I believe that Prime Minister Vanhanen and the Finnish Presidency are to be congratulated on holding fast to a clear direction for the Union: a Europe of results that is concentrated on delivery.
I think it illustrates a general trend towards a consistent approach, building ambitious policy reform for Europe year on year, an approach better suited to the kind of consensus policy agenda we have today.
Another requirement for making this work is partnership.
The achievements of the past year are generally shared achievements of the Council, the Parliament and the Commission.
I would like to underline the contribution of the European Parliament.
At the European Council meeting we expressed our gratitude for the role that President Borrell Fontelles has played during his period in office, the role he has played while defending the European Parliament in a responsible and constructive way, taking the approach of a good partnership with the Council and Commission.
I think the past year has seen a new phase in the way the European Union operates.
We have got away from the idea of the Union as a zero-sum power game.
On a whole series of dossiers the past year has shown that this is not how the European Union works.
It works through a constructive exchange between a unique mix of institutions producing, hopefully, a win-win situation for everybody.
If you look at what has really happened in concrete terms on the Services Directive, on enlargement, on energy, on REACH (we have just witnessed the signature of the REACH regulation), on the seventh research framework programme (the biggest ever, with a 40% increase in real terms), on the new system for Schengen (especially important for new Member States), on our response on Lebanon, on our response on the Congo (where the European Union was by far the biggest contributor to the successful democratic elections, the first ever in that important African country), on all those issues and on several others we have seen the three institutions much more focused on delivering results to the citizens of Europe and, hopefully, much less on Brussels turf wars.
I think that we can learn some lessons here as we deepen the debate over the future of Europe next year.
Today I would like to concentrate on three areas concerning the European Council.
Firstly, on what I call a renewed consensus on enlargement.
The Commission's report on integration capacity was praised and, I believe, succeeds in demonstrating that rigour and fairness are at the heart of how the enlargement process works, that Europe is not enlarging by default.
There is a common understanding that we need to combine the strategic vision of enlargement - our open Europe - with the capacity of integration of the European Union.
For us, enlargement is not only an important policy in itself, it also embodies some core principles of the Union: that we are forward-looking, open, rules-based, fair and grounded in public consent.
The consensus shows that strict conditions must be met, but we must keep the momentum moving forward in relation to our existing negotiating partners and give new impetus to the aspirations of the Western Balkans.
This was clearly underlined during the European Council meeting.
It also helps to remind us why, with the right preparation, enlargement is a win-win policy, making Europe stronger, more prosperous and more successful internally and globally.
I am glad that the European Commission was able to provide the European Council with the right groundwork to make this consensus possible.
Secondly, in the area of migration the European Council successfully translated common concerns into common action.
We have taken real steps to help prevent and address the crisis we saw this autumn.
In particular European Union leaders recognise that it was not enough to manage the problem.
They acknowledge, rather, that it had to be tackled at source with a new emphasis on development.
I am particularly happy that the Council agreed to the European Union Africa Summit next year, which will provide an excellent platform for dialogue.
But we should not need the personal tragedies we saw on our television screens this autumn to spur us into change.
We need to give ourselves the right tools to save lives, fight terrorism and tackle crime.
It is true that we would have liked the European Council to have gone further in the streamlining of the decision-making process in the area of justice and home affairs.
I have to tell you very frankly it is regrettable that some Member States oppose the proposal of the Finnish Presidency, supported by the European Commission, to make use of the passerelle clause that is possible under the current Treaties.
I have to underline once again that we need a more efficient decision-making process in the area of justice and home affairs in the European Union, and not only in that area.
Thirdly, on innovation, I am also pleased to have the support of the Member States for our proposals on innovation and the European Institute of Technology.
I know that Parliament shares the conviction that the innovation agenda is central to a competitive Europe and I look forward to our working together on this in the coming months.
Concluding next year would mean that the European Institute of Technology could start its work in 2008. This should be our common goal.
Over the last six months we have seen the European Union delivering, showing that it is serious about the twin-track strategy of a Europe of results to move Europe forward, that concrete projects are a way to fulfil the EU-grade projects.
We have a springboard to take us forward into next year, with a wide range of new programmes now negotiated and in place, such as the framework programme for research, which I have just mentioned, and the Globalisation Fund which was also approved, not to mention the very important cohesion agenda.
If you look at three key areas - economy, energy and climate, and external policy - you can see the European Union delivering real change on issues that matter for citizens.
On the economy we have had four quarters of significant growth in jobs this year.
The fruits of economic reform are starting to be felt, but we should not sit back.
Last week's annual progress report on the Lisbon Strategy showed how much is to be gained from pressing on with the commitments made in the national reform programmes.
