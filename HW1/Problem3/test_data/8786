On 3 October last year I made a declaration here in Parliament on the Toulouse accident.
I proposed that we should move forward with this amendment.
In the meantime we have been able to incorporate some conclusions from the Toulouse accident into the amendment proposal.
However, I remain convinced that it is not because of deficiencies in the Seveso II directive that the Toulouse accident happened.
Nor am I of the opinion that legislation is the only means to ensure industrial safety.
Safety consists of a mosaic of factors, but the responsibility lies first and foremost with the operators of hazardous facilities.
Thereafter it is the task of the public authorities to control the operators and to inspect the sites.
In my opinion - and I do not seem to be the only one to have this opinion - Toulouse was much more a problem of practical application of the legislation than a problem of legislation being deficient.
As long as we face problems of enforcement, we should rather concentrate our efforts on good cooperation, both within industry and public authorities, in order to improve safety in practice and not by the letter of the law.
So the Commission proposal did not aim at a major overhaul of the Seveso II directive.
As you are aware, the Seveso II directive has replaced the original Seveso directive of 1982 that had been in force for more than 15 years.
Seveso II itself represented a major revision of the European major hazards legislation and has only been applicable for three years.
I therefore stress that the Commission does not intend to move from Seveso II to Seveso III at this point in time.
Having said this, I regret to say that only a few of the 55 amendments proposed actually address issues raised in the Commission proposal itself.
The majority of the other amendments seem to have been developed under the cloud of the tragic accident in Toulouse and address issues unrelated to the scope of the directive.
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the AZF site in Toulouse was fully covered by the Seveso II directive unlike Baia Mare and Enschede.
It has been repeatedly stated, including in the report of the inquiry commission set up by the French AssemblÃ©e Nationale, that the Seveso II directive contributes significantly to improving safety.
Moreover, some of the suggested changes will actually increase red tape with no direct impact on safety.
I will give you some examples.
Nevertheless, the Commission has had a careful look at all amendments proposed with a view to accepting as many as possible.
So we have taken a very positive approach.
Let me make some detailed comments on some of the proposed amendments.
Firstly as regards mining, the Commission cannot agree to deleting the words "chemical and thermal" as proposed in Amendment No 6.
In this context we also reject Amendment No 43 proposing to make references to the water framework and hazardous waste directives.
In our opinion the Seveso II directive should only apply when chemical processes are involved and chemical substances are stored.
It is not meant to be mining legislation or waste legislation and the future directive on mining waste management should cover safety aspects of disposal facilities.
Secondly, as regards explosives, the definition of the two new categories for explosives are the result of a multi-stakeholder consultation aimed at reinforcing the directive while not placing undue burdens on industry.
The Commission therefore rejects Amendment No 49.
Member States have the possibility to make use of Article 176 of the EC Treaty to introduce lower threshold levels at national level as the Netherlands has done.
Regarding ammonium nitrate, the Commission can accept Amendment No 39, in principle Amendment No 48, and in part Amendment No 53.
I can also inform you that the Council's position on ammonium nitrate is almost identical to the amendments proposed and this is a sign of good cooperation between Council, Parliament and the Commission and will greatly facilitate an agreement.
As regards land-use planning, I acknowledge Parliament's strong wish to reinforce Article 12 of the Seveso II directive.
The Commission will therefore accept Amendment No 13, and Amendment No 54 in part, but reject Amendments Nos 51 and 55.
Furthermore, the Commission is of the opinion that the development of schemes of incentives and/or funding for the relocation of establishments is a task to be performed by Member States and cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31 either.
There are more things to be said about land use and I understand how important Parliament thinks this is.
We will definitely follow up this matter and we have also had European workshops on land-use planning.
As a result, it was decided to re-establish a European working group on land-use planning involving stakeholders from all interested parties and at all levels in order to develop harmonised guidance on technical advice, taking into account industrial risks in land use planning.
This is what Parliament is asking for in Amendment No 30.
There are other amendments that the Commission cannot accept.
I shall give you a couple of examples.
Amendment No 35 suggests introducing a new article on training of staff, which would compel industrial operators to provide competent authorities with a training report every two years.
However, the issue of training is appropriately addressed in Annex III and Annex IV.
Moreover, as the safety report has to demonstrate that the aspect of safety management has been put into effect it must necessarily contain the information on training of staff.
We do not advocate the duplication of effort that would be involved in producing a separate report on training.
Last, but not least, several amendments even aim at regulating how the public should be informed - newspapers, mail, Internet - and go as far as imposing certain obligations on the mayors of municipalities.
This raises not only the issue of subsidiarity, but also the following question: should the provision of information be a one-way street or do we believe that responsible citizens should also actively exercise their right to know by requesting information?
One of the core novelties of the Seveso II Directive is that it gives more rights to the public, but it also strikes a fine balance between active and passive information, thus imposing equal responsibilities on industrial operators, public authorities and citizens.
Let me confirm the Commission's position on the amendments.
The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 8, 27, 32, 37, 39, 40, 42 and 45.
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 9, 13, 16, 18, 23, 24, 46 and 48 and in part Amendments Nos 7, 17, 25, 26, 30, 50, 53 and 54.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 to 6, 10 to 12, 14, 15, 19 to 22, 28, 29, 31, 33 to 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 47, 49, 51, 52 and 55.
So by way of conclusion, and excuse me for speaking for so long, I would like to emphasise that it is in our common interest - the interest of European citizens - to have this proposal adopted and enforced rapidly.
I would therefore ask you to accept the Commission's view - which is largely shared by the Council - not to consider the present proposal as an opportunity for a major revision of the Seveso II Treaty.
As you can see, I have already made an effort to accept as many amendments as possible, thus already going beyond our initial intention.
I promise that within the timespan of the sixth environmental action programme the Commission will undertake to gather all the experience gained with the application of the present directive and present a new proposal for a more comprehensive review of Seveso II as necessary.
Thank you for the debate.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0223/2002), by Mrs Van Lancker, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, on sexual and reproductive health and rights [2001/2128(INI)].
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before I start this debate, I should like to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of my fellow Members of this House who have tried to reach the widest possible agreement on this topic in a constructive manner.
I am aware that, for some of them, this is a sensitive issue, and I appreciate their efforts.
I should like to use my speaking time to do away with two misconceptions that are nourished by an aggressive mail campaign to which we have all been subjected over the past few days.
First of all, this report does not call for harmonisation of legislation at European level.
It does not impose anything on the Member States or the candidate countries.
We remain convinced that legislation and measures must remain within the remit of Member States, and the report therefore takes full account of subsidiarity.
What the report does do is to launch an appeal, at European level, to bring into motion a learning process, to collect information about the situation in the Member States, to examine the constituent parts of policy in the Member States concerning sexual and reproductive health and rights and the measures that yield positive results.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have very good reasons for giving this speech.
First of all, there are a whole number of areas in which the European Union has set up a comparable system of best practice, of mutual learning and of exchange of information.
Less than an hour ago, we discussed in this House the Trakatellis report on a European health strategy in which such an approach is justified and encouraged within the framework of an action programme.
Sexual and reproductive health needs to form part of a health promotion campaign, and I therefore fail to recognise why this would not be fitting here.
Secondly, if we talk about development and cooperation policy, this Parliament, along with the entire EU, rightly argues that sexual and reproductive rights must form part of such development and cooperation policy.
It would be rather bizarre if we argued this on behalf of the developing countries, with European voices falling silent the moment we talked about our own policy.
Moreover, there is reason for concern.
There are huge differences in the situation in the Member States in terms of sexual and reproductive health.
Why is it that in some candidate countries, the number of abortions is up to ten times higher than in the Member States that obtain the best score in this area?
It is understandable, because the price of contraception in some candidate countries amounts to one third of the wage of women, while abortions are free.
Surely this is not the kind of policy we wish to promote. I will give you another example.
Why is it that a number of countries are experiencing an incredible rise in unwanted teenage pregnancies while other countries manage to handle this situation?
Should we ask ourselves whether teenagers are so different, or whether policy is so different? I therefore urge you to learn from each other without the need to harmonise.
The second prejudice concerns the fact that this is not an abortion report.
Quite the reverse, in fact. The report is looking for ways to enable women to choose whether they want children, when they want them and how many they want, and to experience their sexuality in a healthy way.
This means that the report aims to prevent unwanted pregnancies and therefore also abortions.
Paragraph 8 states quite clearly that abortion should not be encouraged as a method of family planning.
However, we must develop a 3-track policy.
The first track is open sexual education and information.
Far too many young people still believe that it is impossible to conceive the first time they have intercourse, or they receive their sexual education through pornographic films.
This information should be about forming relationships and about how to relate to each other in a responsible manner.
If sexual education is reduced to biology, things are bound to go wrong.
The second track is that every woman must be able to make a free choice with regard to her sexual and reproductive health.
This means that she must have access to a wide range of contraception and effective services, and must be informed about the pros and cons.
This choice is not there if women have to pay up to a third of their wage.
It also means that we need to make an extra effort for those groups that are currently not being reached.
All campaigns that claim that this is to talk in terms of eugenics are acting in a very deceitful manner.
I am convinced that emergency contraception, specifically the morning-after pill, should also form part of this draft.
I hope that the PPE-DE Group will continue to support the amendments tabled by both groups.
The third track is the most controversial of the three.
I also believe that abortion should be the last resort of a policy on sexual and reproductive rights for women who have been let down by contraception.
In fact, abortion has been legalised in most countries.
I urge you not to turn a blind eye to abortion tourism, the journeys which some women are compelled to undertake because contraception has indeed failed them.
This entails a serious social injustice because only those who are sufficiently well off can afford these journeys.
In fact, the report urges the Member States not to prosecute those women who have had an illegal abortion nevertheless.
By saying this, we are only regurgitating what has been said at the Peking plus 5 platform.
Finally, a huge number of discussions have preceded this debate.
Even just before this meeting, attempts were made to reach the greatest consensus possible.
I hope that these attempts will be rewarded tomorrow and that the Commission will lend its support in order to launch an initiative.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, sexual and reproductive health and rights are an area on which we need to tread softly softly at European level.
We have to take account of the diverse cultures, religions and traditions united within the European Union and give priority to ethical considerations.
The European Union does not in fact have any competence when it comes to legislating on abortion or health systems.
That is the job of the Member States.
The principle of subsidiarity must be brought to bear to its full extent in this sensitive area and must not be ignored.
Reproductive health is also a matter for the Member States.
The EU's job here is to draw up carefully thought-out guidelines and foster collaboration between the Member States.
This report confines itself to other matters not mentioned in the title.
Thus, to talk of emergency contraception is completely misleading.
What this refers to is the morning-after pill and that is clearly not a form of prevention; it is quite simply an early abortion.
Encouraging the demand for abortion and the morning-after pill as standard practice in the European Union and the accession countries without any formalities is unacceptable.
The PPE-DE is also firmly against legalising abortion.
Numerous European countries have already enshrined the unborn child's right to protection from the state in their constitutions.
No one has the right of life or death over another person and any demands to the contrary run counter to the spirit of our humanistic culture.
The report takes no account of what needs to be done in order to guarantee effective prevention.
There is no mention whatsoever of mutual responsibility in a relationship or of the indispensable role of parents and family in sex education, two decisive factors in preventing unwanted pregnancies.
This report sends out a misleading message, not just to the Member States of the EU, especially Ireland, but also to the accession countries.
Like all of you, I have received numerous letters and telephone calls from worried organisations and individuals in candidate countries.
People there suffered for a very long time under undemocratic regimes which arbitrarily controlled all areas of their life, even the most intimate.
This is one reason this report not only worries, but incites anxiety and mistrust of the European Union in the central and eastern European countries.
It makes fundamental demands on the governments of the accession countries, which are completely excluded from the decision-making process. That contradicts our understanding of the word democracy.
The Charter of Fundamental Rights requires us to uphold human dignity and protect life.
The principles of the European Union include subsidiarity and maintaining cultural diversity.
And we should not forget that when we vote on this report tomorrow.
Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Anne van Lancker, who has made a huge effort to bring about a consensus here in the House.
As previous speakers have said, this is a very delicate subject which touches on the most intimate area of our citizens' lives.
So exactly what is this report about?
It is about the right that, at the end of the day, no one here in this House would wish to be deprived of.
It is about the right of control over ones own body.
Women cannot be denied this right, the less privileged in the European Union cannot be denied this right, the citizens who are to join the European Union cannot be denied this right.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has, without any shadow of a doubt, recognised the primary competence of the Member States in safeguarding sexual and reproductive health and rights.
But Europe also has a huge responsibility as pioneers in the world, as we conveyed at the World Conference on Women in Beijing, when we defended the concept of the need to safeguard sexual health and reproductive rights.
Mrs van Lancker has abided very closely by these specifications and has presented a whole host of best practices in her report, the most important being proper education on responsible sexual conduct, on which we need careful guidance by experts, with the Member States providing full coverage by professional advice centres.

A gender-specific approach aimed at young people is needed and mutual respect and responsibility must be shown on sexual matters.
The Member States must ensure that girls who become pregnant are not excluded from education which, unfortunately, is what usually happens.
There are pointers on this in the White Paper on Youth.
We must offer a networked policy here, which is why the European Parliament and the Commission also have work to do.
We must take a closer look at the situation in the candidate countries, where little contraception is available at affordable prices and abortion is often used as a method of family planning.
As the van Lancker report clearly states, we must prevent this.
Abortion can never be the solution; we must prevent unwanted pregnancies per se.
The sub-text is probably that it stops women from becoming independent and I am quite appalled at this campaign, which was attacked once again here in Parliament: with half truths, by questionable means, millions of women are being disconcerted by the assertion that terminating a pregnancy increases the risk of breast cancer.
Half truths are being used to make millions of women insecure and deprive them of their rights.
We will not stand for this any longer, which is why I hope that there will be a large majority in favour of Mrs Van Lancker's report tomorrow.
Thank you, Mr President, the preparation for this report can be described as bizarre, to say the least.
Sensible texts on sexuality which should be so evident that one could almost describe them as open doors.
Yet, there are Members of this Parliament who believe that the report should be taken apart.
Very bizarre.
In the eyes of my group, these issues should be dealt with at Member State level.
However, once the decision was made to draft a report, we simply decided to cooperate in a constructive manner with a view to achieving a good content.
We would congratulate Mrs Van Lancker who did a sterling job in this respect.
She is right to call for effective measures.
The provision of sexual information is essential to avoid unwanted pregnancies and diseases.
Statistics clearly bear this out.
In addition, as Mrs GrÃ¶ner pointed out a moment ago, owning your own body and your sexuality is a right.
It is, in my view, a fundamental right that should not only be guaranteed in Europe and the candidate countries, but throughout the world.
Most EU countries apply sound legal provisions where birth control and abortion are concerned.
In those countries, health risks have fallen.
It would therefore be completely implausible if we were to adopt amendments in this Parliament tomorrow which would force the Van Lancker report to make a step backwards in relation to the effective provisions in the Member States.
The ELDR Group is therefore opposed to the overwhelming majority of the tabled amendments, because these threaten to undermine the very balanced text.
We support the current text, certainly with regard to the two most sensitive issues: the morning-after pill must be cheap and available over the counter, and abortion must be safe and legal.
Those who do not support this create the possibility of very vulnerable women and girls once again ending up in little backrooms with knitting needles in the foreseeable future.
If that is the message that this Parliament sends out tomorrow, our group will refuse to have any part in this.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to comment on an amendment to be proposed tomorrow, which seeks to change the title of this report by removing the word 'rights'.
We sit in a parliament and we live in democracies. We have experienced two UN conferences, a conference on population in Cairo in 1994, and a conference on women in Peking in 1995.
What did those two conferences say?
On the one hand, that the question of controlling fertility and reproduction was a human right, and on the other, in 1995 in Peking, that it was a woman's right.
Human rights or women's rights - they are still rights.
We are therefore stating people's rights, not controlling populations.
In the e-mails and in the scores of letters that I receive, I discover that the only things being discussed are population control, women's fertility, retirement for all, falling birth rates in our countries - we could also talk about birth rates, why not - and that is what I would call population control.
That has nothing to do with rights.
I believe, therefore, that the proposed amendment is quite representative of the conflict that we have here.
If we accept that we are in a country as of right, we can go so far as to say what I myself say, namely that the right to contraception, to fertility control, is the habeas corpus of women.
We said thirty years ago that our bodies belong to us.
This is what is known as habeas corpus, the exact translation of the English expression, 'our bodies our selves'.
That is called habeas corpus.
Therefore, if we look at matters from that viewpoint, we shall not fantasise about the subsidiarity reaffirmed in Article 1.
We shall not fantasise about abortion, which would become the way to obtain contraception.
No one wants an abortion. No one would wish an abortion on anyone.
It has nothing to do with contraception.
Therefore, if we look at things from that angle, we are looking at them from the angle of women's rights, which are the equivalent of human rights, and I believe that with this in mind, unless we want to contradict ourselves, we must vote in favour of Mrs Van Lancker's report.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, may I first and foremost express our deep respect for the rapporteur and for the way she has brought about this well-founded report?
Mrs Van Lancker has taken ample account not only of all the groups, but also of the different sensitivities within the groups.
The sensitivity of the report is evident for everyone to see.
It concerns an issue which urgently requires clear policy.
After all, there is today a huge discrepancy between the different Member States in terms of the rights of women in the area of sexual and reproductive health.
This means that the right to decide what happens to your own body is also different in the Member States.
All Member States must shoulder their individual responsibility in this respect.
In some countries, it is still completely impossible these days to terminate a pregnancy in a legal and safe manner.
As a consequence, 'abortion shopping' is on the increase.
Mrs Van Lancker mentioned this a moment ago.
However, women will go where they can.
For example, last year, no fewer than 6 000 women travelled from Ireland to Great Britain for an abortion.
The numbers increase every year.
My fellow MEP here only knows this too well, as she is from Ireland.
Such statistics illustrate that this is a fact that will affect virtually every family sooner or later, particularly in those countries where sexual education and access to contraception remain sub-standard.
I can identify with people who are against legalising abortion, but I do ask myself whether our policy-makers have the right to deny women an abortion?
Every policy-maker must be acutely aware of their educational role and it is exactly for that reason that we must also prevent pregnancy from in future becoming something one either does or does not have insurance for.
Under no circumstances whatsoever should it be possible to proceed with a termination, whatever the pressures to do so, without the consent of the woman.
Finally, what really matters therefore is to protect pregnant women, on the one hand, and accept that it is always the woman herself who has to decide what happens to her body, on the other.
Consequently, Member States therefore have an enormous task of preventing abortions that are not carried out for specifically woman-related reasons, such as poverty, career or stigmatisation.
We will be voting in favour of the proposal tomorrow.
Mr President, although I pay tribute to the rapporteur for her work, at the risk of being unpopular I am completely unable to support this report.
I cannot even endorse the language used, which I consider to be far removed from my own view of the matter and that of many European Catholic women and non-religious women too, who believe deeply in the values of life, the family and motherhood.
Just by way of example, there are repeated references throughout the text to reproductive rights and fertility awareness: terms which, quite frankly, I feel would be more suited to cattle than women, who are human beings.
It would be more respectful to talk about the right to maternity, to informed maternity, about emotional education, but, above all, apart from a number of general and therefore largely acceptable statements, I feel that the entire report is based on the imperative of upholding the right to contraception, particularly emergency contraception - the morning-after pill - and to abortion, for both the Member States and the candidate countries.
All that is unacceptable in that it rides roughshod over the principle of subsidiarity and therefore the right of each Member State to decide on its own health policy, and especially because it trivialises recourse to abortion and shows no genuine respect for life and the rights of the unborn child.
Moreover, this is a proposal which does very little of substance to develop a responsible policy promoting solidarity and the family, adoption and the protection of child mothers, which totally disregards all the legislative measures and good practices which exist to help pregnant women and mothers, offering practical help for women expecting a child, dissuading them from resorting to abortion by providing a programme of economic aid and proper social and psychological help.
Therefore, Mr President, my group will vote against this report.
Mr President, in 1994, there were 179 countries, including all the EU countries, which adopted the ICPD Programme on universal access to reproductive health by 2015.
Progress in this area might have been expected since 1994, but the opposite has unfortunately been the case: the Arabic countries have entered into an unholy alliance with President Bush to obstruct the UN's work on achieving the ICPD objectives.
I was just recently at the American Congress in Washington in connection with a hearing concerning Mr Bush's Mexico City Policy.
I was together with a member of the Russian Duma who was able to state that, after the IPPF had made provision for reproductive health facilities in Russia, the number of abortions had fallen by as much as 25%.
Why?
The answer is quite logical.
Any woman who has unintentionally become pregnant and refers herself to a clinic for an abortion instead of carrying out the abortion herself is always made aware of options other than abortion, informed about how she might avoid an unwanted pregnancy in the future and alerted to the possibility of HIV infection.
The policies which this report proposes that Member States introduce will therefore lead to fewer, not more, abortions.
The campaign conducted by opponents of abortion against the report is therefore absurd and, in certain cases, downright unsavoury.
I am thinking of the e-mail sent by The Truth of God, maintaining that the real intention is to introduce eugenics in order to get rid of the poor and that the IPPF was founded by the British Eugenics Society.
Statements such as these are an insult to our intelligence, but should also be followed up by libel proceedings.
A vote in favour of this report is a vote in favour of ensuring everyone's basic right to take free and informed decisions concerning their emotional, sexual and reproductive lives and of ensuring that everyone has the same opportunities to increase and protect their sexual and reproductive rights and, especially, to be protected against HIV infection.
A desire to safeguard basic rights should be reason enough for voting in favour of the report.
In order to reduce the risk of the spread of HIV, it is essential to vote in favour of the report.
Mr President, sometimes I really do feel that we repeat the same things year after year, decade after decade.
I have to say that, since 1995, all the States - and I would stress, all of them - have willingly been signatories to the UN Declaration on reproductive rights.
Whether we like the term or not, the fact remains that all the Member States signed this declaration independently: therefore, Europe is not imposing anything on anybody, especially since the report itself confirms that the matter falls within the competence of the Member States, and the Member States, I reiterate, have already independently and freely subscribed to all these provisions since 1995.
Quite the opposite, if there is any criticism we might make of the report amongst ourselves, it is that it does not go far enough as regards the freedom of women to choose to have children. In other words it does not say anything about assisted fertilisation, an issue which is currently the subject of much debate in my country, for example, and, if anything, that it is not ambitious enough in that it does not mention options such as RU-486.
There you are, if anything, these are the points on which the report is too cautious, but I will vote for it in any case.
I would, however, stress that the report seems to be a repeat of documents which have already been adopted by the Member States and that, in my opinion, it does not represent much progress.
In view of the political dispute, I will, as I said before, vote for the motion.
It may be that we could have been a little more ambitious, for example as regards the new techniques that science has placed at the disposal of women's health and reproductive rights.
The fact that this is still a women's issue is, I am sad to say, borne out by this House today.
Although children and the family life of couples must, or should clearly be, matters addressed by both partners together, the very composition of this House today is a clear indication - and maybe that is genuinely the ways things are - that, ultimately, this is still an issue which can only be addressed by ensuring that women have the freedom to choose.
Mr President, Mrs Van Lancker's report deals with an issue of particular concern to the Committee on Women's Rights and my political group and to each of us individually.
It has given us an opportunity to make two findings.
First, there is an information vacuum in modern society on sexual and reproductive health issues, such as transmittable diseases and how to combat them, and contraceptive methods and their advantages and disadvantages.
Secondly, there are differences between, and even, in certain countries, a lack of policies on, family planning, sex education and sexual and reproductive health services, and we have agreed to exchange best practices on promoting modern policies.
We engaged in an up-to-the-minute dialogue between the political groups in committee and representatives of European society and we agreed that these issues are vital to today's European citizens, especially women.
However, we also made another finding or, to put it another way, we were the butt of particularly vehement reaction on the part of governments, political parties and representatives of women's agencies, because we are giving out advice and guidelines - not to mention taking decisions - on issues on which Europe has no authority.
These concerns were taken as a very important political message by my group, especially now that we are trying to define our authority at European and national level and persuade the people of the European Union and the candidate countries that we respect democracy, subsidiarity and cultural differences, and we took on board the message that asking the Member States to legalise abortion or not to prosecute women who illegally terminate their pregnancy or to hand out the morning-after pill without a doctor's prescription does absolutely nothing for our credentials.
It just creates confusion and distrust among our citizens.
When I and my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights visited Poland, we all stressed how important it is to engage in dialogue on women's rights at all levels and in all spheres of life and for policies to develop and adapt to new social and historic circumstances and Europe is not going to come along and reduce national ideologies, customs and conscience or cultural differences to the lowest common denominator.
I acknowledge the rapporteur's well-intentioned efforts to get us to agree on a text and I personally hoped that we might achieve a text which was acceptable both to us and to the people of the European Union.
Unfortunately, the message to come out of the report is not the message which the Europe People's Party thinks the European Parliament should send out, which is why we shall not be voting in favour of the report.
Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Van Lancker, who has managed to broach the thorny issue of rights in the field of sexual and reproductive health with intelligence, understanding and courage.
This report, which I think is outstanding, has nevertheless given rise to major discussions and extreme positions.
Its most controversial point has undoubtedly been abortion, although the report deliberately starts by stating that abortion must not be encouraged as a method of family planning.
Abortion must be seen as the solution of last resort and the report suggests various ways of achieving this.
Abortion is, however, a very real social tragedy.
The blame, the pain, the physical and mental violence that abortion entails are borne predominantly by women. Consequently, in all Member States of the European Union with the exception of Ireland and Portugal, legal solutions have already been found for society to recognise every woman's right to be attended by medical specialists in the abortion procedure.
The tragedy of undergoing an abortion is enough in itself.
It is time for this procedure no longer to be considered a crime and for the public persecution in the courts and in the media to stop!
I feel that this report is an act of hope for the women of my country, showing them that we in Europe are fighting for everyone to enjoy equal rights, for there to be tolerance and solidarity, for the hypocrisy to end and for the health and dignity of all women to be protected.
Calls for tolerance, respect and solidarity are sometimes met with obscurantism and boundless narrow-mindedness.
In Portugal, a referendum on decriminalising abortion, which was not binding because less than one-third of the population voted, was won by the 'no' campaign.
The situation has gone from bad to worse in the meantime and the proof is that numerous women have already been taken to court, I myself have been bombarded with messages from activists from the 'no' campaign to vote against this report, and, to top it all, the so-called 'pro-life' association has just instigated legal proceedings against Mrs Van Lancker in Portugal.
If this were three hundred years ago, she would have been handed over to the Inquisition!
It is sad, but this is still the situation in Portugal, and this is why it so important for us Portuguese to see this report approved and to feel the solidarity of Europe on such a sensitive issue.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker on her report.
It is an excellent piece of work, which is very much in line with the final statements of the Cairo and Beijing United Nations conferences and is intended to ensure the exchange of best practices in the field of reproductive health and in the defence of women's rights and dignity.
As recently became clear in Portugal when 17 women were subjected to the shame of court proceedings, with the investigation of their private lives and with the accusation of having had an illegal abortion - which was not proved, except in one case - in which the young woman was unacceptably convicted, this is not the way to combat illegal abortion.
Another reason is that those who have the financial means can always go to a country where the procedure is practised legally.
Portuguese women, for example, go to neighbouring Spain.
Whilst it is true that abortion, as the report states, must not be encouraged as a method of family planning, it is crucial that a health and social policy be put in place that enables women to resort less to abortion, specifically through the promotion of sexual education and of family planning properly targeting young people, so as to prevent unwanted pregnancies, specifically amongst adolescents.
It is equally crucial, however, that the voluntary termination of pregnancy is legal, safe and universally accessible in order to safeguard reproductive health and women's rights, as the report states, and that all women have access to this procedure, regardless of their economic and financial situation, and not only those who can afford to have it done in a good clinic in a neighbouring country.
This is hypocrisy and must end as soon as possible.
Mr President, all of the issues raised in the report fall not within Community competence, but within the competence of national political bodies.
We should not, therefore, even be discussing it or voting on it tomorrow.
This abusive external interference in self-determination and in the free will of the citizens reaches the height of absurdity in paragraph 28, by proposing to force our taxpayers to finance actions in third countries in the service of a militant agenda to promote abortion.
This, as a matter of fact, is the report's greatest weakness: an apparent lack of focus and considerable confusion.
It takes issues which, when taken individually, are positive, such as the rejection of abortion as a method of family planning, the need to reduce the recourse to abortion and the viewing of sex education in a global and positive way, based on mutual respect and on responsibility. The report, however, confuses these issues with others that either correspond exactly to the opposite doctrine or which lead, as has been proved, to the opposite result.
Consequently, the overall implementation of this set of guidelines that has prevailed in many countries, as formulated in the report, can only lead to disastrous results, some of them recognised, as a matter of fact, in the report both in the number of teenage pregnancies and in the alarming spread of sexually transmitted diseases despite all the information that is so widely distributed.
According to the media, my country would be one of the direct targets of this report.
Portugal held a referendum four years ago on liberalising abortion and won 'the right to life'.
I am, therefore, sorry to see some federalists here choosing to see the Community as an appeals court and supporting the scam of putting pressure on the free expression of the citizens' will, whilst the debate is obviously still ongoing.
This debate, however, which is a serious one, is not on women's rights, but on the rights of the child, of the child that has been created and is about to be born.
This is what divides us, not the body of the person who chooses but the life of those who have no choice.
The report takes the side of the stronger against the weaker.
The weaker person is also often the woman who has been abandoned by her husband or partner, or pressured by her social set to have an abortion that, deep down, she does not want.
And the weakest is always and in every case the child, who is at a vulnerable and helpless stage of development.
It is the weakest that need the protection of society and of the law and who look to us to provide this.
In my country we choose to act in this way; we take the side of the weakest.
And it is our right to do so, provided that this is allowed by law and that this is what our citizens want.


Thank you, Mr President, the candidate countries would be delighted to find themselves actively involved in virtually every paragraph of this report and finally being taken seriously.
Unfortunately, the opposite is the case.
It is true that they are the reason why this report on sexual and reproductive health and rights was originally written, but in an unpleasant way.
Parliament is imposing on the candidate countries its own time-limited standards regarding abortion, contraception and sexual education concerning free sex.
That is, after all, what is behind the fine rhetoric.
An outlook on life in which individual sexual and reproductive self-determination are praised as the ideal, while nothing is being said about the downsides.
Rightless, unborn children, damaged lives of women as well as men and distorted views of love and sex.
Century-old values of fidelity and love within a marriage bond as it is mentioned in the Bible remain the best guarantees for human well-being.
However, in this report, we look in vain for essential information which promotes both physical and mental health.
What is left is a report on an area of policy which does not concern the EU, but which nevertheless wants to impose on the candidate countries, without any respect for their own independence, the godless morals that are currently prevalent.
This report is the result of a curious process. First of all, it shows contempt for the principle of subsidiarity, because it means that the European Union is interfering not only in the Member States but also in the applicant countries, by trying to compel them to integrate into their legislation provisions which are contrary to their ethics, as a condition for their accession to the Union.
Then there is the fact that sexual and reproductive rights are not mentioned in any treaty, in any European convention, or in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Also curious is the fact that the reproductive rights in question consist of a whole list of processes which actually prevent reproduction.
Finally, it is irresponsible to teach very young children a policy of sex without discernment.
The educational choices which have to be made on this subject are the responsibility of parents and the family.
Moreover, one cannot reduce sex education to mere contraception, nor regard abortion as a method of family planning.
Is abortion the only solution to the distress of a pregnant woman?
On the contrary, sex education is an apprenticeship preparing children for freedom, for responsibility and for respect for their own bodies and those of other people.
Respect for human dignity and consideration for women in difficulties should have led us to propose measures that were more responsible and showed more respect for life.
Unfortunately that has not happened, and that is why I shall be voting against this report.
Mr President, the report before us does a great disservice to the topics it covers, whether one is pro-choice or pro-life, because it purports to dictate to Member States a certain direction in relation to what are most important subsidiarity matters for the Member States.
Neither this Parliament nor the Commission have any competence in this area.
While it can be useful to discuss these matters and to tease them out, the particular timing of this report, which I accept was a long time in the pipeline, is causing an awful lot of collateral damage, which perhaps it was not intended to do.
I state categorically that even today the topic of this report is on websites in Ireland and is being used by the "no to Nice" campaign to beat around the ears those like myself who would be part of the "yes" campaign in relation to the Nice Treaty.
It is already being used on websites, including the website of a Member of this Parliament to say 'this is what Europe is about; look what they will do given half a chance.
They will dictate to us on ethical issues'.
I plead with colleagues, whatever your views are on the important topics in that report, do not let what we do in this Parliament be misused and abused by those people.
I am particularly sensitive to the issue in Ireland at this point in time.
It is not only in our interest in Ireland that we ratify the Nice Treaty, it is in the interests of all the accession states who want to rejoin the European family.
Those accession states themselves have contacted many of us and the leaders of many groups about the added difficulties this report is causing.
I know personally that three accession countries are having serious problems.
They have a battle to win the hearts and minds of their people in relation to joining Europe, just as we have in Ireland at this particular time in relation to the ratification of the Nice Treaty.
I do not mind what your views are on this issue.
They are secondary at this point in time to the collateral damage this report is doing in accession states and in Ireland.
That concerns me greatly.
Quite a lot of other matters have been raised.
Personally I do not have any difficulties with the morning-after pill.
I do not consider it an abortifacient.
Some of my colleagues, who like me will be voting against this report, might disagree with me on that.
But we might as well get the biological facts right.
It is emergency contraception.
It is not an abortifacient because you do not have implantation of the fertilised egg until up to 72 hours after fertilisation.
It cannot be an abortion if you are not pregnant.
Let us stick to the facts.
Much of the report, I feel, is very badly drafted and very repetitive.
But the important point is that this is a subsidiarity issue and we must give no indication that it is otherwise.
We have no competence in this Parliament.
The collateral damage at this point in time is huge.
I regret that.
Mr President, this own-initiative report commits various cardinal sins.
The first of them concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins Community law.
This motion for a resolution breaches this principle, which forces us not only to respect Members States' exercising their autonomy in matters that fall within their competence but also to encourage them to do so and to exclude illegitimate interference in the internal jurisdiction of each State.
The European Union must abstain from intervening in a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States.
It is widely known and quite clear that this report addresses issues that do not fall within the scope of the European Union's competences, and interferes particularly in policies of health and justice.
Another of the cardinal sins concerns the serious fact that this proposal deliberately and flagrantly disregards the will of the citizens, expressed freely and democratically in the referenda on the decriminalisation of abortion held in some Members States, such as Portugal, for example.
The aim of approving this proposal is to create a means of pressure once again to place the discussion on the voluntary termination of a pregnancy on the political agenda of some Members States.
This will furthermore have the perverse consequence of creating suspicion amongst the citizens of Members States and also of the candidate countries, and this report is thereby doing a disservice to the European Union.
The European Union is an original political model founded on cultural diversity and on respect for the historical and ethical heritage of each of the nations that it comprises.
European integration must give priority to these values.
Deepening the European spirit must involve respect for differences and for strengthening the principle that decisions must be taken at the closest possible level to the citizens of the Union.
These two requirements are missing from the report that we are today debating.
Consequently, for these reasons, we do not accept this proposal and have no alternative but to vote against it.
I wish lastly to pay tribute to the commitment of Emilia MÃŒller, the shadow rapporteur for this controversial report, who spared no effort to try to improve it.
Mr President, I think that Mrs Van Lancker deserves our warmest congratulations and praise for taking the initiative on this important report, which has opened up a dialogue and highlighted a problem which goes right to the heart of the rights and fundamental freedoms of half the world's population.
Despite improvements over recent years in the sexual and reproductive health of women, the indicators still show high abortion rates, especially among teenagers, low rates of contraceptive use and an increase in sexually transmitted diseases.
However, worst of all is the return in certain areas of the Union to anachronistic and obscurantist perceptions of sexual rights, contraception, equality of the sexes and women's right to self-determination.
The fact that conservative and religious circles have taken action and flooded us with papers over recent days in a bid to overturn the vote in favour of this report makes that clear.
On the pretext of protecting life, they basically propose criminalising abortion and incriminating women and even prosecuting them under Portuguese standards.
They are our familiar adversaries in the battle for equality of the sexes and women's rights and we know that when they talk about morals they usually display the double moral standard of one sauce for the goose and one for the gander.
Obviously absolutely no one advocates abortion as a contraceptive method; however, it is often a necessity and is generally carried out under the pressure of adverse social, economic, psychological or cultural conditions.
Does anyone dispute the fact that many pregnancies are the result of some sort of violence against women?
But apart from women's health and rights, should we not be ensuring that children are born into an environment in which they are welcome, so as to safeguard their proper mental, physical and spiritual development?
It is worth pointing out that statistics show that the number of abortions is very low wherever there is a high level of free reproductive health and contraception services, in countries in which pregnant women facing difficulties, such as unmarried mothers, are given material support and where liberal legislation on the termination of pregnancy is combined with serious and effective sex education and information, especially for young people.
In conclusion, I think that the European Union and the Council, and the candidate countries, should step up their efforts and should give priority to and formulate an integrated European policy on reproductive health, with the emphasis on prevention, contraception and sex education and information for young people.
The principle of subsidiarity must not under any circumstances be used as an excuse to prevent the European Parliament from taking a stance on such an important issue.
We shall be voting in favour of this report because it proposes a policy of encouraging sex education and contraception, because it clearly states that abortion should be legalised, safe and accessible to all, and because it calls on governments to refrain in any case from prosecuting women who have undergone illegal abortions.
However, I condemn the fact that the report merely recommends or urges governments, instead of forcing them to include, in their legislation, laws along these lines.
Like other women, I do not regard abortion as a normal method of contraception.
However, a woman's right to have control over her own body ought to be an inalienable right.
It is revolting that in certain countries of the European Union that right is denied in law, while in other countries it is denied in practice.
I also find it extremely shocking that even here, in the European Parliament, speakers dare to oppose the few improvements that this report proposes by propounding ideas which are as barbarous as they are reactionary and by voting against this report.
Thank you, Mr President.
The lateness of the hour and the limited speaking time oblige me to confine myself to one single reason from a nonetheless long list of reasons for rejecting this report, and for the sake of convenience, I will therefore pass over the fact that Parliament has no authority whatsoever in the fundamental matters underlying this report, and what is before us should really be considered as a kind of ideological occupational therapy, as the umpteenth violation of the subsidiarity principle and as an attempt to force the practice of abortion on the candidate countries as some kind of acquis communautaire, which is wholly unacceptable.
Allow me to give you a fundamental reason.
It really is beyond me how the termination of life by abortion can be considered as a kind of victory in terms of human rights in such a nonchalant manner.
I am quite happy to enter into a debate with people who ask for sympathy for emergency cases, but this report's abortion propaganda, which is hardly discreet, goes against the grain with me.
In fact, I think that taking life is the opposite of reproductive health.
The truth is, moreover, that very many abortions, the majority of them, in fact, are the result of parents lacking the material resources to accommodate children, for example, because marriage is still being penalised fiscally, because child benefit is too low or because our society does not value the family.
Despite this, there is in Europe an enormous demographic problem, one that can obviously not be solved by abortion, but by sound, positive family policy and sound, child-friendly policy.
Mr President, this own-initiative report on sexual and reproductive health is surrounded by controversy, mainly because it concerns an area that is still within the competence of the Member States.
It is subject to subsidiarity and, as an amendment by my Group recognises, its aim is for all the Member States of the Union to have the same policy, in other words for all the States to have the same law on a matter that is subject to subsidiarity but which, above all, depends upon the beliefs, traditions and patrimony of each State.
This report contains a number of positive elements, in particular with regard to information and prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases, better education in schools and improved access to family planning centres and clinics, in particular for young people.
The fact is that there has been an increase in unwanted pregnancies among young women, and even young girls, but we cannot allow unrestricted abortion to be put forward as a solution to this problem, because the fact is that the ultimate objective of this own-initiative report is to introduce unrestricted abortion and the morning-after pill into the legislation of the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries as an effective means of combating unwanted pregnancy.
This is unacceptable to many Europeans, both from a moral standpoint and from the point of view of health.
This includes the candidate countries, which have not had the opportunity to participate in this debate, and which are therefore having our opinion forced upon them.
Young people need to be given more information and the wherewithal to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
Public health authorities must become involved in this information process and also in schools, and we must not forget the fundamental role to be played by parents and the need for them to be involved.
I am sorry that we have not reached a greater consensus on the key issues, and I hope that in the vote we shall be able to achieve it if some of the Members who have spoken here are able to tone down or moderate their extreme approach.
Otherwise I, like the rest of my Group, will have to vote against the report.
Mr President, in recent days, I and my colleagues have been inundated with e-mails and faxes containing urgent calls to vote against Mrs Van Lancker's report because it would be an invitation to legalise abortion throughout Europe.
This is the result of an extremely disturbing false information campaign launched by the right, which must be firmly condemned.
The report addresses the sensitive issue of sexual and reproductive health and rights, women's reproductive health and the dissemination of contraceptive practices, it focuses at length on a policy of health and sexual education policy for young people, and, of course, it is also concerned with unwanted pregnancies and abortion.
This issue is, however, addressed in the context of the recommendations made to the Member States and the candidate countries with the aim of safeguarding women's reproductive health and rights.
The rapporteur makes numerous recommendations regarding prevention.
The governments of the Member States and the candidate countries are called upon to endeavour to implement a health and social policy which will reduce recourse to abortion, particularly through the establishment of a network of counselling and family planning services.
The report proposes that impartial, scientific information should be provided on reproductive health, including the prevention of unwanted pregnancies.
It stresses that interrupting pregnancies should not be promoted as a family planning method and recommends that, in order to protect women's reproductive health and rights, abortion must be legal, safe and accessible to all.
In any case, the experience of the countries which have legislation in place on the interruption of pregnancies reveals that fewer abortions take place if they do not have to be carried out illegally but can be performed in safe establishments under strict medical control without risks to health.
In Italy, for example, the abortion rate fell by 40% between 1980 and 1998.
Mrs Van Lancker does not undermine the principle of subsidiarity in this extremely balanced report.
She does not suggest that the European institutions should take over the competences and responsibilities of the Member States, but recommends that they adopt a policy of prevention - sexual education - and reminds us all that sexuality and reproductive health are, first and foremost, women's rights.
What is this debate that we are holding amongst ourselves about this report?
One might imagine that it was an administrative debate, but that is not the case.
This is a debate about people's rights, and the reproductive rights that we are talking about this evening represent a further step forward.
The first generation of fundamental rights was concerned with civil and political rights, and the second concentrated on social rights. Now, finally, we are talking about reproductive rights, about women's right to their own bodies.
We have now reached the stage where we are defining those rights, and here the WHO concept, which regards health as a fundamental right, will support our efforts to define a framework which will establish reproductive health in law.
However, we must be aware that, when it comes to procreation, in Europe and elsewhere in the world, people do not have a free choice.
In order for men and women to obtain that freedom of choice, they must have access to information about the various options possible, and their respective consequences, hence the need for education about sex and the emotions, which plays a very important role.
Such education, however, is influenced by different political, cultural and family contexts, so there is a lot at stake. We need to make room for a possible debate which respects individuals and their cultures, a debate in which respect for each individual must force us to provide the sort of education which tackles all the issues, and which always provides full information.
At the present time, in many countries, public policies aim to give women autonomy by means of a series of measures, including education, which must cover all areas of life if it is to be a tool of democracy.
To exclude certain aspects is to practise censorship, to deliberately withhold knowledge and to fail to respect individuals' capacity for free choice.
To bring laws and real life closer together is to organise the emancipatory evolution of a society.
This is yet another signal, another project which Europe is able to achieve and of which we can be proud.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is not a case of barbarians on one side and civilised people on the other, of reactionaries on one side and progressives on the other, of the moral on one side and the immoral on the other.
The debate should proceed in an atmosphere of mutual respect, and on that score we should thank both Mrs Van Lancker and the shadow rapporteur from our Group, Mrs MÃŒller, for the way in which they have worked together.
The fact remains, however, that this debate is out of time.
Even Mrs Van Lancker recognises this in her report, and I quote, '... the legal or regulatory policy concerning reproductive health falls within the Member States' sphere of competence'.
The proposed resolution that we are discussing today, no doubt authorised, wrongly, by Parliament's Bureau in the context of our institution's right to take the initiative, does not seem to me to be well-founded. It seems to be even less well-founded if we remember that just one month ago - and we really are being paradoxical here - we voted in favour of the Lamassoure report on the division of competencies into what falls within the remit of the Community and what is the responsibility of the Member States, and we should apply what we voted for to ourselves.
That is the first reason why I shall not be voting in favour of this report.
My second reason is that I do not know how we can impose standards in every area.
There are a certain number of cultural differences, but what is a good standard?
Let me give you an example. In France, we have introduced legislation governing the morning-after pill.
Suppose we were to take French legislation as our basis.
It is entirely unsatisfactory.
Why is that?
It is because at the present time the morning-after pill is authorised in France and is distributed exclusively in schools. It cannot be authorised in hospitals.
Yet schools operate for 150 days out of 365. Shall we take other legislation as our basis?
We shall still find that there is something missing from the framework.
What, then, is the framework for good practice?
The third point, which really concerns me, is that I believe that at the present time, the combination of the recommended longer period during which abortion will be allowed and the progress being made in science which means that potential anomalies in unborn children can be diagnosed increasingly early, plus the progress being made in bio-ethics, carries with it a risk. A certain number of doctors, and by no means the least progressive - I am thinking, in the case of France, for example, of Professor Nisand - would agree with me on this point, and the risk is that this combination of circumstances might lead, tomorrow, either directly or indirectly, somewhere, to a system of State eugenics which would prejudice the founding of a peoples' Europe which is what we are all hoping to achieve.
Thank you, Mrs Hermange.
As a member of the Bureau, may I remind you that it is the Conference of Presidents which organises the agenda.
Mr President, the Van Lancker report talks about prevention, education and health, but certain groups have tried to turn this into a report on abortion.
They have lied to us, manipulated, blackmailed and coerced us, and have even claimed that abortions lead to breast cancer.
We have been put under an intolerable amount of pressure.
The Van Lancker report aims to eradicate certain inconsistencies, such as only giving the right to choose to women who are wealthy, and denying this right to all those who are not.
Women of a high socio-economic class are able to solve the problem.
It is women with fewer opportunities who still have a problem.
The report also exposes the hypocrisy of failing to provide sufficient sex education and then refusing the possibility of abortion.
Mr President, Spanish women used to travel to London to have abortions.
Now Portuguese women travel to Spain.
Is this right? Is it sensible or fair?
Does it make any sense in the context of the European Union?
The Van Lancker report provides guidelines with a view to reducing the number of abortions that take place.
Better prevention and education will lead to fewer abortions.
The Van Lancker report is balanced and the rapporteur has been flexible and generous with the right-wing groups in negotiating amendments, yet the representatives of the Left do not want to know.
They do not understand, probably because they do not stay for the debates - they just give their opinion and leave.
We think that many women in the European Union and from outside the Union are awaiting the result of this report.
The report must be adopted by Parliament, as many women are awaiting its guidance, and all those who have been using blackmail need to learn their lesson, namely that, on Thursday, this Parliament will adopt Mrs Van Lancker's excellent report.
Mr President, I would like to make a point of order.
It has been suggested in this debate that Members should vote against this report because it might have a negative effect on the Nice referendum in Ireland.
Could I ask Members to put that consideration out of their minds.
The Irish people are well capable of looking after themselves.
They do not need to be protected from themselves and they do not like being treated as children and being asked to leave the room when sex is being discussed.
I would also like to suggest that if men could become pregnant, abortion would not be a problem anywhere in the world.
Mr De Rossa, I think you would find it difficult to tell us which of the Rules of Procedure your speech refers to, and so I am obliged to interrupt you, but I think that everyone understands what you mean.
I am pleased to have been afforded the opportunity to speak, on behalf of the European Commission, at the conclusion of the plenary debate on this report.
Ms Van Lancker's report addresses a range of important issues which are amongst the most sensitive and significant health and ethical issues facing our societies today.
At the outset, let me acknowledge the efforts that have been made by the rapporteur to respond to the legal order of the European Union.
As the rapporteur rightly acknowledges, the European Union does not have competence to engage in health care delivery.
This is clear from the Treaty.
The Treaty sets out in Article 152(5) that 'Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.?
Therefore, I would underline, as does the report, that the delivery of health care falls within the responsibility of Member States.
This also applies to the policy of delivery of sexual and reproductive health services.
In this regard I note, as Ms Van Lancker has said, that the vast majority of recommendations in the report are directed to Member States and accession countries.
It will be a matter for them to consider how to respond most appropriately in line with their own constitutional and legal frameworks.
Let me avail of this opportunity to underline that the Commission has no ambition to become engaged in health care delivery systems or medical care.
At present we do not have the power to do so.
I do not envisage this situation changing in the future.
Subsidiarity is the underlying principle in the delivery of health services and this should be respected.
Let me be clear.
The Commission will not be making any proposals in areas relating to the delivery of health services.
This is the responsibility of Member States.
So whilst a full and frank debate about key health issues is essential, we must also respect the distinction between Member States' and Community competences when we begin to consider general recommendations in sensitive areas.
Clearly, there are important cultural, ethnic, ethical and religious differences between our citizens on such matters.
In highlighting the importance of sexual and reproductive health and rights, sensitivity needs to be shown to the divergent attitudes on issues such as abortion in our Member States.
Sexual and reproductive health issues are core topics of social and public health debate in Europe today.
These issues touch the lives of our citizens in a way that other issues never could.
For this reason they are issues best decided as close as possible to those affected.
But in the context of developing a public health policy, there are a number of issues which require careful consideration and analysis.
And reports, such as the one under discussion tonight, provide insight into the complex issues affecting today's policymakers.
In all aspects of sexual and reproductive health, the more informed and the better educated the individual, the greater is the chance that they will avoid pitfalls, by taking responsibility for their health and wellbeing.
Of course, in often very difficult real life situations, individuals must move from absorbing information to developing a holistic understanding of how these issues impact upon their lives.
Naturally, in this debate, there is significant attention addressed to the responsibility and rights of women in dealing with their health and wellbeing.
I believe however, that greater attention needs to be brought to bear on the responsibilities of men in this domain.
Too often we overlook the importance of improving men's education so as to change behaviour, attitudes and involvement.
I hope that our Member States will place a greater emphasis on the education and information of men in this important area.
The 1997 Commission Report on the State of Women's Health in the European Community also provided some useful analysis.
It drew attention to the fact that sexual and reproductive health issues are vital questions for women of reproductive age.
Work on public health indicators is ongoing within the European Commission.
Experts are developing indicators, which will provide the basis for gathering and analysing health information in Europe.
These will include a range of indicators addressing various aspects of reproductive and sexual health.
The Commission is prepared to compile and undertake statistical, epidemiological investigations on the basis of collected data.
I must stress, however, that the quality of such work will depend on the quality and compatibility of the data provided by the Member States.
Within the new Public Health Programme, the third strand will address health determinants through disease prevention and health promotion.
This applies also to sexual and reproductive health.
As with the Health Promotion Programme, accession countries can participate.
However, the local health promotion and disease prevention strategy is the responsibility of the Member States.
This would include school health education and promotion projects which can draw on the scientific data generated by this analysis.
In relation to the "Mexico City Policy" of the US Administration referred to in the report, the European Commission does not see itself in a position to comment or react.
This issue is a matter for the US administration to decide.
I have therefore restricted my comments today to those areas for which the Commission has competence.
May I conclude by underlining the importance and sensitivity of the issues under discussion today which have been raised and explored as a result of the work of Ms Van Lancker.
Thank you Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5-0203/2002) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the European Community framework programme 2002-2006 [COM(2001) 822 - C5-0017/2002 - 2001/0202(COD)]
(A5-0205/2002) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the amended proposal for a Council decision concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in the implementation of the framework programme 2002-2006 of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) [COM(2001) 823 - C5-0236/2002 - 2001/0327(CNS)].
Mr President, what exactly is the point of the rules on participation?
Well, they mean money for research activities, money which - let there be no mistake - comes from the public purse.
It is public money, taxpayers' money that funds research activities.
Invitations to tender for projects are published, applications are made and, at some point, approval is granted - or not.
So what was important for us?
First that, when applications are made, the invitation to tender should be clear, unequivocal and straightforward.
So that clear, unequivocal and straightforward applications can be submitted.
That is why we opted for the two-stage procedure that has already proven its worth in the past.
The Commission agreed to this suggestion.
Secondly, it is of course important to be able to carry out a quick evaluation, so that people are not left sitting around waiting to hear whether or not their project has been accepted.
For us as a Parliament, it was important to include a number of criteria in addition, of course, to the criteria of excellence and innovation.
I am thinking here, for example, - what a pity several lady Members have just left - of the role of women in research.
It is also important to fund European added value.
In other words, if we work together, the total should be greater than the sum of the parts.
Working together means solidarity between the Member States in the group.
It also means solidarity in liability should something go wrong - not that anyone expects it to.
But then again, solidarity should not go so far - as the Commission proposes - as to make all the participants jointly and severally liable.
This has now been successfully introduced.
Joint liability, but within certain limits.
We have managed to find a good compromise between the solidarity needed and the responsibility of the individual participants.
Of course payment channels need to be set up so that they are flexible and payments can be tracked.
And the money should be paid out in a targeted manner.
To give just one example, lump sums, yes, if necessary, but only if they are based on actual additional costs from European research and can be proven, even if the proof is submitted afterwards.
In other words, networks of excellence, joint European research area, yes, but not in the form of some sort of collaboration which cannot be properly quantified.
Here too we have managed to move the Commission proposal in the direction suggested by Parliament.
Another important point for Parliament in the discussion was this: the Commission proposal gave us the impression - and I use the expression advisedly; we discussed this at length and eventually agreed otherwise - that the Commission actually wanted to backtrack slightly.
That it simply wanted to say, there is a project coordinator, he gets the money, he is responsible for everything.
That is out of the question.
We cannot release our Executive from its responsibility.
It is liable for the sums which it approves and it alone is directly answerable to the European Court of Auditors.
Thanks to input from numerous colleagues on my ideas, we managed to turn a good proposal into an even better final text.
I should like to say a few words now about the procedure, because it is quite an unusual procedure.
The first report is a full codecision report; the report on Euratom is a consultation report.
But let us stay with the first report and codecision.
This is a codecision procedure and we shall be adopting a text after just one reading.
Why?
Because we have had excellent cooperation with the Council and I should like to make a point of naming Secretary of State MarimÃ³n here.
He interceded with a great deal of personal commitment in order to help us reach an agreement in the talks, in the dialogue.
I must say that I also found the Commission most willing to talk.
All in all, everyone was very receptive to everyone else's position and we managed to draft a text that was approved by the Council following the vote in committee.
In early obedience, as it were, to the vote which, I assume, will be a large majority in favour.
This sort of agreement at first reading is only possible if everyone is ready to cooperate and I am most grateful that they were.
I should also like to thank all my fellow Members in the other groups.
The specific circumstances caused by my temporary disability - I am sure you have all seen me travelling around everywhere - gave rise to tolerance on all sides, on the part of the Commission, on the part of the Council and on the part of the honourable Members, for which my thanks once again, as well as flexibility and innovative working methods - and I wish these qualities of flexibility and innovative working methods on all the participants in the sixth framework programme and on the Commission as it starts its work handing out the money.
We shall be keeping a critical but well-meaning eye on this work during the course of next year.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now considering the Commission proposal seeking to establish the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and for the dissemination of research results for the implementation of the European Community framework programme 2002-2006.
I congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report, to which I give my full support.
Like the rapporteur, I agree with the approach pursued by the Commission to facilitate access to funding by simplifying legislation and by providing greater operational flexibility.
I therefore welcome the new objectives that have been proposed, which are: the introduction of simple and comprehensible rules for participation, faster and slimmer administration and the protection of the Community's financial interests.
As Member for one of the outermost regions, the Autonomous Region of Madeira, I should now like to focus the final part of my intervention on a point that is of direct concern to the outermost regions.
Heading 9 of the compromise amendment refers to the need for the activities of the sixth framework programme to promote the participation of the most remote regions of the Community.
The previous framework programme also referred to the need to address the specific features of these regions.
In my proposal for an amendment, I nevertheless called for us to go further, so as to follow up the heading I have just mentioned, because I think that in programmes concerning an outermost region, greater weight must be accorded to the criterion of Community added value.
According greater weight in this way would be extremely important, so as to prevent the outermost regions being penalised, bearing in mind in particular that it might be difficult to find outside partners willing to enter into collaboration with institutes based in outermost regions, whatever the quality of the projects that might give rise to an application.
When the complete equality of the participants and the general openness of the projects to new participants is protected, according greater weight to the criterion for Community added value would be crucial to guaranteeing access to the sixth framework programme for projects originating in those regions.
Since it is now past midnight, I should just like to let our interpreters know that the debate will last for another quarter of an hour or so, and I should also like to thank them for their patience.
Mr President, to follow on from what you just said, a very good morning.
Perhaps this is also a sign of the new start which we are planning with the sixth research framework programme.
My thanks also to the rapporteur.
I do not say that merely as a courtesy because I think we have worked well together and have basically followed the rapporteur's line and I should like to make a point of thanking her for her initiative.
As far as these rules of participation are concerned, I would like to say that we have put a great deal of responsibility on the Commission and demanded a great deal from it.
I do not envy the Commission its task, because it will be no easy matter to implement the sixth research framework programme; you only have to think of the provision requiring the Commission to give reasons for any decision rejecting a proposal.
That is one of our old demands, but with several tens of thousands of projects, it places an enormous responsibility on the Commission.
If it succeeds here, my hat off to it, because this is certainly one reason why many people are still just as enthusiastic about taking part in the European research programme.
But it will not be easy.
The main difficulty with this sixth research framework programme is that so many Member States are taking part in it - fifteen Member States, plus the countries which want to join the European Union, plus the countries in the European Economic Area, plus Israel and, in the future, Switzerland too.
In other words, there are a great many participants and "managing" them, by which I mean implementing the research framework programme properly, will be no easy task.
I also understand why it wants to encourage projects, networks of excellence, integrated projects etc. which are as big as possible and presumably this will also be the future of the European research programme.
However, this means that other, mainly smaller projects will increasingly need to be taken over by the Member States and the regions, leading to a stricter division of labour between the European Union and the Member States.
I am absolutely delighted that the matter of the two-stage procedure has been described in greater detail.
I expect this two-stage procedure to lighten the load somewhat, depending on how it is implemented.
The Commission has a certain amount of experience here and I trust it will be able to improve on it.
The faster we implement the sixth research framework programme, the more money we shall save.
Parliament has made its contribution, and there is a consensus in favour.
The thing now is to hand out the money as quickly as possible and I wish you every success in doing so, Commissioner.
On behalf of the Liberal Group, I should like to congratulate Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl on her sound report and especially also on her dynamic negotiating skills during the informal trialogue, both with the Spanish Presidency but also, and mainly, with the Commission.
The Spanish Presidency has done sterling work in this area.
The result is that we can now approve the rules for participation in framework programmes in one reading, allowing the sixth framework programme to be launched on time.
This is good news for all researchers in Europe, but also for the research climate and innovation in the European Union.
Indeed, it once again transpired recently that the European Union is progressively lagging behind where research and competitiveness are concerned.
The difference between Europe and the United States in research investments has grown sharply in the past few years.
In 1994, this difference was still EUR 51 million annually, and this has risen to no less than EUR 124 million in the year 2000.
As well as national governments, industry, in particular, must make more investments. However, this requires a much better investment climate to make it attractive for companies to invest in Europe.
Participation in the framework programme by the private sector should also be stimulated. It is, therefore, important that Parliament has been granted its wish with regard to liability of participants in a consortium in the framework programme.
Surely it is not acceptable if one participant breaks the contract, for the other participants to be jointly and severally liable for this, as per the Commission's request? Fortunately, the Council has taken this on board, and the text has been amended accordingly.
I should also like to note that the European Commission's handling of contracts causes many problems.
Payments are usually late and the administrative pressure is high. This causes problems especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
At this rate, the Commission will have difficulty obtaining sound projects because innovative companies will no longer wish to take part.
This is partly due to the projects being cancelled without any explanation.
Practices of this kind do not stimulate the private sector and will not lead to higher investments in Europe, and certainly not to 3% of the national product, as the Commission would like to see.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was very anxious to see the implementation of the framework programme simplified and - let us be honest - humanised.
The report by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, whom I should like to thank most sincerely for taking on the task and for the provisions full of common sense which she has included regarding the rules for participation, has set us on the right track.
I should like to emphasise that, for the first time in the framework programme, the acceding countries will enjoy rights that are equivalent to those of the Member States, and the European scientific cooperation organisations and those of the acceding countries will be able to participate on the same footing as the bodies established in the Member States.
I am also pleased to see that the organisations in third countries will be able to participate fully in the projects in the framework programme.
This is particularly important for our group, which wants to intensify research with developing countries and with the countries of the Mediterranean and of Latin America.
Taking into account the new management provisions - provided, in particular, by the new tools - it will certainly be necessary to optimise operations during the implementation of this programme, but without, however, opting for formal conciliation procedures.
With this in mind, we should like to thank the Council, as represented by Mr MarimÃ³n, who has devoted a lot of attention to this matter, for having agreed to our proposal intended to speed things up.
This is why we would be happy to maintain regular contact between Parliament and the Commission, which will in fact be possible thanks to the kind competence of Mr Busquin, in particular with a view to the possible updating of the evaluations at the halfway point, in 2004.
Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur who used her experience in the fifth framework programme and her professional experience as a scientist to the great benefit of all of us, particularly following her accident.
I should also like to thank Mr Busquin, an excellent Commissioner, who has been very skilful along with his staff in ensuring that we could get a result early in the process.
Of course we all wish to thank Mr MarimÃ³n for his patience and good humour.
I also thank the scientific community, which was not slow in giving us advice and in pointing out that its needs were for simplicity, faster administration and financial care.
These new instruments are exciting, but we have to be sure that many people are not prevented from taking part in the programmes because of their lack of familiarity.
Liability looked as though it would be a big problem but, fortunately, it was overcome.
I would point out the importance to Parliament of Amendment No 29 and its counterpart in the Euratom programme, Amendment No 38, which add criteria which can and should be taken into account, including activities to increase the role of women in research and to look at synergies with education.
Ease of access means that dissemination should be fairly easy, but Parliament considers dissemination to be an important stage in this process.
You can be sure that we shall be following up very carefully the sixth framework programme, visiting projects, speaking to scientists and asking for evaluations.
With the adoption tomorrow of Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl's report, the final piece of the puzzle will be in place.
Thanks to Mr Caudron and the rapporteurs on the specific programmes, we have worked efficiently and we now have plenty of time for our scientists to prepare, knowing our aim is to make the sixth framework programme efficient, well managed, easy to take part in and above reproach from the financial point of view.
Thank you again to all concerned.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, together with the decision on the framework programme itself and the specific programmes, the rules for participation and dissemination make up the third element of the system for implementing the research framework programme.
This third element is not the least important one.
In fact, the rules for participation establish the legal and financial framework which governs the implementing and financing of the research activities of the sixth framework programme.
I should like to thank most sincerely the rapporteur, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, for the very thorough work which she has done on the proposal for these rules, in close collaboration with the intervention zones.
I should also like to thank the draftsmen, Mr Linkohr, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, Mr PiÃ©trasanta and Mr Alyssandrakis, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Mr Westendorp, for the excellent climate which they created during these discussions.
You are right, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, to emphasise that this agreement has been made possible thanks to the hard work during fruitful discussions in which everyone has been involved.
Like you, I should like to emphasise the role of the Spanish Presidency, particularly in the person of Mr MarimÃ³n, and I believe that the outcome confirms our common desire to simplify and lighten the load compared with the preceding programme, at the same time retaining the necessary rigour.
The new model is based on the principle of greater autonomy for the consortiums, and this will be reinforced by the increased flexibility of the rules and contracts, and a substantial reduction in the administrative constraints that they face..
It was in fact our intention to make these rules simpler, lighter and easier to use, easier for participants to read and understand, and more flexible, without, however, ceasing to be rigorous.
You are also right, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, to make the point that thinking that the Commission was going to withdraw from all its prerogatives, and therefore its responsibilities, particularly as regards the assessment and selection of proposals to be financed, the selection of participants receiving Community funding, as well as the setting up of an effective programme for monitoring the funded projects and the decisions on what payments should be made, was only an impression.
You emphasised that point, and it is in that context that the whole of the solidarity process should be interpreted.
Naturally, compared with the rules that prevail at present, the rules have also been adjusted to take into account new information available under the sixth framework programme, starting with the introduction of new instruments of financial support.
One of the principal changes, some of which saw the light of day at Parliament's initiative, is, in particular, the fact that participation in a research project - except for some individual cases - is open to any legal entity and not only to legal entities which have a specific research activity.
Another change is that organisations in the acceding countries have been placed on an equal footing with those in the Member States of the Union as regards the conditions for their participation, which is a strong political signal at a time when we are talking about enlargement.
Opening up participation and financing to include legal entities based in third countries involved in international cooperation activities also broadens the scope of the European research area.
We should also mention the introduction of the opportunity of full participation for international European interest organisations, the reduction in the number of model contracts, and a new procedure for the entry into force of contracts, the simplification of the funding systems, the grant to the budget and the grant for integration for integrated projects and networks of excellence respectively, the use of audit certificates by participants in order to claim expenses, thereby giving greater financial security in conditions which involve fewer procedures, and, finally, the simplification of the rules regarding intellectual property, with the single defining principle of an overall framework and of general principles to be observed, while the detailed provisions may vary depending on the type of action.
On all these points, and on many others, the in-depth and sustained discussions which took place between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission enabled us to reach an agreement.
The Commission is therefore able to accept formally the single compromise amendment which brings this agreement into being, and I believe that the Council has expressed the same sentiment.
One of the points of compromise to which I should like to draw your attention, I shall mention, in particular, the raising the minimum number of compulsory participants from two to three, the possible introduction of a two-stage evaluation of the proposals received, the restricting of anonymity to certain specific cases for the purposes of evaluating proposals, the reference to a greater number of criteria for evaluating proposals, both compulsory and optional criteria, such as activities, like those mentioned by Mrs McNally, intended to increase the role of women in research and to create synergy with education at all levels, the clarification of the way in which the responsibilities of the participants are exercised, the definition of the method of calculating the Community's financial contribution to the networks of excellence - an issue which gave rise to many discussions - and the introduction of the concept of the consortium contract as an essential tool for setting up research projects.
I should just like to say a word about the Euratom participation rules.
They are, to a great extent, similar to those laid down for the framework programme and are therefore acceptable.
The only amendment not covered by the compromise provides for a rate of funding for Fusion Associations which unfortunately cannot be envisaged at this level within the limits of the planned budget allocation.
The Commission cannot accept this, but we shall try to find a compromise.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the difficulties, thanks to the efforts and the willingness of the rapporteur, the participation rules for the sixth framework programme will be adopted tomorrow, I hope, at first reading.
We have every cause to be happy about this.
For the scientific community and for businesses, this is an essential element in the implementation of this framework programme which is an instrument of the European research area.
I believe that the scientific community has already partly understood the message.
More than fifteen thousand expressions of interest have been received and will be made public.
This will enable us to prepare, in optimum conditions, the implementation of the framework programme between now and the end of the year.
Once again, I should like to thank Parliament for its contribution, which has been most constructive.
Thank you Commissioner.
On my own personal behalf, I should also like to thank our rapporteur, who really has made a great effort, despite having had a slight problem with her health, in order to produce this double report.
She is to be doubly congratulated.
The joint debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
I should like to thank all Members and the interpreters for their time and their presence here. I declare the session closed.
(The sitting was closed at 12.25 a.m.)
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed.
Are there any comments?
Mr President, yesterday, when Mr Cappato asked for information on whether a motion for a resolution signed by 10% of the Members of Parliament was going to be included in the agenda of the Conference of Presidents, Vice?President Schmid announced that a response would be given that afternoon.
I would remind you that I started to refuse liquids as of 5 p.m. yesterday evening, having been on a hunger strike for 24 hours already, for precisely this reason: the motion for a resolution in question has already been withheld once from debate by the political body.
I now hope that you will find the time to restore the dignity of the political body and allow it to do its job.
Mr Turco, I will consult the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday on this question.
Mr President, I would like to point out a linguistic problem concerning Amendment No 11 to my report, which was put to the vote yesterday.
Out of respect for grammar and the institutions, the amendment should read as follows: 'The financial framework for the implementation of this Regulation for the period 2000 to 2006 shall be EUR 4700 million and shall be subject to a mid-term review based on the implementation of this Regulation?.
The rest of the amendment remains as before.
Mr President, a delegation from the democratically elected parliament of Taiwan visited us here in Strasbourg yesterday at the invitation of Members of the European Parliament.
You, Mr President, did this delegation the honour of welcoming them and speaking with them.
However, during this visit something happened of which I, and I believe several colleagues here, are ashamed.
Last night our guests had to leave in haste because the visa that they had been granted by the French authorities was only valid for 24 hours.
All attempts by Members of this House to have this visa extended or to have a visa issued for a longer period failed in the face of the obstinacy of the French authorities.
I have two questions for you, Mr President. Firstly, do you consider this refusal to grant a visa for - and this is my suspicion - purely political reasons to be compatible with the values of the European Union, which deems freedom, including the freedom of movement of all people, to be a fundamental right?
Secondly, do you, like me and other members of this House, consider this incident to constitute a serious obstacle to the proper functioning of the European Parliament in Strasbourg?
If so, what action are you minded to take?
This is not the first time that senior politicians from that state have suffered the problem of a refusal of visa and this is not the only place of work of the European Parliament where that problem has presented itself.
I am bound to say that I look at the part of the bottle that is half full, which is to say that at least yesterday the authorities allowed the visit, brief as it may have been, something which for some of the members of the delegation had not been possible on previous occasions.
So yesterday marks a modest progress towards reconciling the rights of this Parliament to do its business and to be able to ensure that those who are invited to Parliament or its committees can make those visits.
Mr President, I should like to raise an issue relating to the fittings in the Parliament building, something that is also frequently brought to my attention by visiting groups.
We in this Parliament are rightly very proud of the fact that we may all speak, listen to and read our mother tongue.
However, many of my visitors ask: why then are all of the signs, notices and also all of the announcements on screens here in Parliament only in one language?
To my mind this is surely about our identity, about whether we all feel at home here, and it is also about Parliament's image.
After all, at the moment eleven languages are spoken here and I think that it must be possible, technically speaking, to ensure that the fittings here in Parliament reflect this.
90% of my visitors do not speak French and when they look, for example, at the evacuation instructions, which are displayed on every 'totem pole' or whatever it is called here, they find that they are only in French.
The instructions to be followed in an emergency are only in one language.
I do not actually believe that this is appropriate in the European Parliament.
I would therefore ask you to instruct our services to put forward proposals for how we can extend the multilingualism in this Parliament, of which we are rightly proud, to signs and notices.
That is a useful suggestion.
We should refer it, in the first instance, to the College of Quaestors and if we can find an appropriate way of doing that, it would be a good idea.
Mr President, I would like to emphasise what Mr Sakellariou said regarding the Speaker of the Taiwanese Parliament and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Common Security and Defence Policy.
Mr President, I urge you to take up with the French authorities the fact that Parliament here in Strasbourg should be able to work on the same terms as in Brussels.
If the Speaker of the democratically elected Taiwanese Parliament and the Committee on Foreign Affairs had visited Brussels and not Strasbourg, the delegation would have been allowed to stay for longer than 24 hours and would not have been forced to break off under the dishonourable circumstances which prevailed yesterday.
The next item is the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council on the programme of the Danish presidency.
By way of introducing this item, I should like to thank on behalf of Parliament and the presidents of the groups, the Danish presidency for inviting us to Copenhagen in advance of the formal start for an extensive discussion with the incoming presidency on its priorities.
I note that the President-in-Office of the Council, Prime Minister Rasmussen will exceptionally participate in our major debate next November on enlargement, even though he will not be reporting on the work of the European Council.
We anticipate before the close of the presidency at the Copenhagen Summit an intensive dialogue with the group leaders from Parliament.
These are all innovative aspects showing a commitment to partnership between the institutions.
I should like, on behalf of Parliament, to express formally to the President-in-Office our appreciation of the extent and intensity of these efforts and of this innovation.
Mr President, honourable Members, honourable Members of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very great honour for me to speak in this Parliament for the first time here today.
It is with particular pleasure that I do so as President-in-Office of the European Council with a view to presenting the priorities of the Danish Presidency of the EU.
I look forward to the subsequent debate concerning the tasks ahead of us.
The European Parliament is an important and constructive force in the development of European cooperation and I am sure that this will continue to be true in the months ahead, in which we face a number of decisions of crucial importance for the future of the EU.
The Danish Presidency is therefore preparing for close cooperation with the European Parliament.
The Danish Presidency wishes to strengthen the cooperation between the institutions of the EU.
I know that the European Parliament shares this desire.
We will seek to promote contacts and cooperation between the institutions.
We intend to hold summits between Parliament, the Commission and the Presidency ahead of the European Council meetings in Brussels and Copenhagen.
We face important decisions in connection with our common decision making.
The Presidency will demonstrate efficiency and flexibility and looks forward to fruitful cooperation.
We have a new budget to pass.
Here, too, the Presidency is ready for constructive and results-oriented negotiations.
Denmark attaches great importance to the work of the European Parliament and the Presidency will be well represented at all plenary sessions.
In this connection a central role will be taken by our European Affairs Minister Bertel Haarder, a former Member of this Parliament.
A number of other Danish ministers will also participate in plenary debates in the coming months.
I myself will keep Parliament informed following the European Council in Brussels and give a report at the end of the presidency following the summit in Copenhagen.
In addition, I will participate in the great debate concerning enlargement which will take place on 19 November.
We have given our presidency programme the title 'One Europe?. In so doing we are emphasising the significance that we attach to enlargement and to broader cooperation on our continent.
The programme contains a detailed account of our aims and plans in the individual areas.
Here today I will concentrate on the main themes.
The main headings of the programme are:
Firstly: Enlargement of the EU - from Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
A decision on enlargement of the EU will be made at the summit in Copenhagen in December.
Secondly: Freedom, security and justice - we shall strengthen the fight against terrorism, crime and illegal immigration.
Thirdly: Sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.
We will work towards ensuring that economic growth goes hand -in hand with protection of the environment and improvements in employment.
Fourthly: Safe food.
We will work towards better food safety, review the agricultural policy and overhaul the common fisheries policy.
Fifthly: The EU's global responsibility.
We shall strengthen the common foreign and security policy, expand the strong links between Europe and the USA and work towards a global agreement between the rich and poor countries of the world.
At the European Council meeting in Seville a number of decisions were made concerning the frameworks for the Council's work in the light of enlargement.
I welcome these decisions.
We will seek as far as possible to implement them as early as during the Danish Presidency.
This applies not least to the decisions concerning greater openness in the work of the Council.
Overall it is our ambition to secure the greatest possible degree of openness surrounding the work of the Danish Presidency.
(Applause)
The enlargement of the EU is the most important task of the Danish Presidency.
I will deal with this important subject fully later on in my contribution, but first I would like to comment on the other topics in the Presidency's programme.
Alongside enlargement, the Danish Presidency attaches great importance to honouring other significant items on the EU's agenda.
We want to focus on four areas in particular:
Firstly, we want to work towards greater freedom, security and justice.
The Danish Presidency will give high priority to combating cross-border crime and to implementing the EU's action plan for combating terrorism.
We will attach importance to developing strong international cooperation - not least with the USA.
The Presidency will also follow up the conclusions of the European Council in Seville concerning asylum, immigration and border controls.
A number of forward-looking, concrete and balanced decisions were taken here which form a good basis for the work under the Danish Presidency.
Secondly, the Danish Presidency will work towards sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.
We will prioritise the implementation of the internal market and the development of economic cooperation between EU Member States.
A strong and competitive European economy is essential for growth, prosperity, increased employment and sustainable development.
We must be able to keep up with the global competition - not least in respect of the USA.
Further, the Danish Presidency will focus on food. We want to work to secure safe food.
Food safety - from the soil to the table - is a very important task for the EU.
Under the Danish Presidency we will seek to make concrete progress in this area.
Discussions concerning reform of the common agricultural policy will also be initiated during the Danish Presidency.
We will give this work considerable priority and seek to advance it as far as is humanly possible; but I would like to emphasise that this is a discussion which must take place independently of the negotiations concerning enlargement of the EU.
We will not accept the imposition of new conditions for enlargement.
(Applause)
Finally, the Presidency will give priority to the work on a new common fisheries policy for the Member States.
This is an extensive and difficult task.
The Commission's proposal forms a good and serious basis for further work.
The EU's global responsibility is the final main topic of the Danish Presidency.
The EU has a particular responsibility for peace and stability in a world that is coming ever closer together.
That applies not least in the fight against international terrorism and in our efforts to reduce poverty in the world.
Development of the common security and defence policy (ESDP) will also be continued over the coming six months.
Due to the Danish opt-out in the area of defence, work concerning the military aspects of the cooperation will be led by Greece and I would like to emphasise that we will endeavour to ensure that there is smooth and efficient cooperation between the two presidencies on this point.
The Danish Presidency will be marked by a number of notable international summits.
The EU must and will assume a central role at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
We will work on the basis of the frameworks laid down at the summit in Seville.
It is the intention of the Danish Presidency to secure as ambitious a result as is humanly possible.
The aim is a forward-looking global agreement that places obligations on rich and poor countries alike; a global agreement in which the rich countries provide the poor countries with better development opportunities through free trade and increased development aid, while in return the developing countries commit themselves to good governance - i.e. democracy, respect for human rights, and open and free access to information.
Relations between Europe and Asia will be developed further at the ASEM summit in Copenhagen in September.
We will also pave the way for a strengthening of relationships with Russia and the EU's new neighbours to the east - Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova.
There is a need to formulate a new policy in respect of these countries.
A solution - based on the Schengen acquis - must be found to the particular circumstances surrounding Kaliningrad.
It should be possible to reach a reasonable understanding with Russia on this basis.
A summit will be held between the EU and Russia in Copenhagen in November and this summit will be a significant step in this whole process.
Let me return to the most important task that the Presidency faces in these six months, namely the conclusion of negotiations concerning enlargement of the EU by up to 10 new Member States.
It was in Copenhagen in 1993 that the conditions for membership of the EU were defined and it may now be in Copenhagen in 2002 that the negotiations concerning enlargement are finalised.
From Copenhagen to Copenhagen.
Our aim is to conclude the negotiations with all the applicant countries that are ready by the end of the year.
This will make it possible for these countries to become members of the EU in 2004, i.e. before the next elections to the European Parliament.
At the same time, we want to advance negotiations with those countries that will not be ready for membership until a later point in time, and we want to strengthen links with the EU's new and old neighbours.
I will apply three principles in the negotiations concerning enlargement of the EU:
Firstly, we will stand by the requirement that clear criteria must be met in order for a country to become a member of the EU.
I hope that this will apply to ten countries; but I will not compromise on this fundamental requirement.
Secondly, no country shall have to wait for others.
There are differences in the size of the countries, but not in their rights or obligations.
If only some of the countries - and not all ten countries - are ready by December, we in Copenhagen must conclude the negotiations with those that are ready, and no country which is ready should have to wait for a country that is not ready.
(Applause)
Thirdly, we will stick to December 2002 as a decisive and binding deadline.
Experience suggests that the EU is best at handling one major task at a time.
The next six months have been set aside for enlargement.
New tasks will then be pressing.
In 2003 we must conclude the discussions in the Convention on the future of the European Union.
In 2004 we will have the Intergovernmental Conference and the elections to the European Parliament, and in 2005 and 2006 we are to specify the frameworks for the next budget period.
I am not saying that it is now or never; however, if we do not seize the opportunity now we risk enlargement's being substantially delayed.
We have a moral and historic duty to achieve a good and positive result.
(Applause)
However, there are number of obstacles in our path which we near to clear out of the way.
Firstly, there is the question of funding.
This applies in particular to the negotiations concerning agriculture, structural funds and budgets.
In my opinion the Commission has submitted a well-balanced and reasonable proposal.
Some Member States consider the proposal too expensive.
At the same time, the candidate countries are suggesting that the proposal is insufficient.
In my opinion the Commission has found the right balance in its proposal.
At the summit in Seville we approved an ambitious timetable.
It means that the EU must be able to notify the candidate countries of its common position on the matter of direct income subsidies to farmers by early November at the latest.
The Danish Presidency will stick to this ambitious timetable.
The second central problem is the issue of Cyprus.
Cyprus is doing well in the accession negotiations; it is one of the countries that have closed the most negotiation chapters - 28 out of 31 - and as a candidate country Cyprus has a right to become a member when the country is ready.
Yet at the same time, the fact that the island is still divided is a problem.
The European Council in Helsinki concluded that a solution to this problem would be advantageous for, but not a condition of, Cyprus's accession to the EU.
At the same time, however, it was emphasised that a final decision will be taken based on all relevant factors.
The Danish Presidency will continue the work on this basis and I would like to stress that everyone involved - on both sides - should do their utmost to find a solution as quickly as possible.
Thirdly, the Irish referendum on the Nice Treaty represents an unknown factor.
Approval of the Nice Treaty is essential if the enlargement is to be able to be implemented within the time frames set.
Negotiations are taking place on the basis of the provisions of the Nice Treaty.
Another 'no' vote in Ireland would jeopardise the entire process.
In view of this I welcome the declaration of Irish neutrality at the summit in Seville.
A clear and positive message has been sent from Europe to the Irish people.
I make no secret of the fact that we face considerable challenges, but no one should be in any doubt as to the resolve, commitment and will of the Danish Presidency.
A good starting point has been created.
This is not least a result of exhaustive work by the candidate countries and the Commission over more than ten years; similarly, the Danish Presidency will be continuing the work based on the results achieved by earlier presidencies, including the great progress made by the Spanish Presidency.
Ten years of negotiations, ten years of hard work that has borne fruit, ten years of expectations that we cannot afford to disappoint.
We must keep the promises that we have given each other. We must keep to the deadlines that we have set ourselves.
We must seize the historic opportunity that we have been given.
Over forty years of communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe have resulted in an unfortunate and artificial division of Europe.
It is this dark chapter in the history of Europe that we now have opportunity to end.
The time for speech-making has passed.
We must make sure that our words are followed by deeds.
It is now that we must deliver on our promises.
(Applause)
The banner of the Danish Presidency is 'One Europe': One Europe for all our peoples.
One Europe as a framework for future cooperation that benefits everyone.
One Europe of freedom, peace and prosperity.
The Danish Presidency will do its utmost to honour this and the other tasks with which we have been entrusted.
We cannot do it alone; we need all our partners.
After the Second World War, great Europeans such as Schuman, Monnet and Spinelli created the vision of a Europe without war, a Europe united in cooperation.
This dream has become a reality for us in Western Europe.
Enlargement of the EU is an opportunity to extend the freedom, peace, stability and prosperity that we ourselves know to include the countries of the East as well.
We must set about this task in the spirit that characterised the founders of European cooperation.
We must not get bogged down in details; we must have the courage and the will to persist in the historic vision and task ahead of us.
I appeal to everyone to see the enlargement of the EU in this historic perspective.
I call upon everyone to seize this historic opportunity to reunite a Europe that was previously divided.
I appeal for close cooperation with the European Parliament to implement this most important political task of our generation: to welcome the new democracies of Eastern and Central Europe to the European Union.
Thank you, Mr President.
Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this is the last plenary sitting before the summer recess.
The Seville European Council is behind us and the extremely important six months of the Danish Presidency have just started.
This would therefore appear to be a good point to take stock of the situation.
There are three major interlocking processes among the items on our agenda for the second half of this year. Firstly, as the Danish Prime Minister has said, enlargement.
As I said yesterday in this House, most issues still outstanding have been settled and the Commission will say which countries it regards as ready for enlargement at the October European Council.
At the same time, we also need to encourage progress among the other candidate countries. Our aim is to push ahead with the process systematically without erecting new barriers across the continent we are seeking to unify.
As things stand and assuming current progress is maintained, all ten countries in the first wave are likely to be considered ready for accession.
The criterion is still the same: no country is judged in general terms; each country is judged on its own merits.
We shall work resolutely to wind up the accession talks at Copenhagen, but first we must reach an internal agreement with the current Member States on budgetary issues and on direct payments to farmers, although these areas are not closely linked.
In this regard, I want to reiterate my conviction that the Commission's proposal is the only workable basis for reaching an agreement between the current fifteen Member States and the twenty-five of tomorrow.
I therefore call on all parties to undertake to reach an agreement that will pave the way for the reunification of the whole continent.
Meanwhile, we will update the roadmap and pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania.
As for Turkey, the Council encourages and fully supports its efforts - as stated in the Council conclusions - to fulfil the priorities defined in its Accession Partnership.
The regular report on Turkey's progress in adopting and implementing reforms to be published by the Commission in October will be a crucial factor in the decisions that will be taken at Copenhagen.
Thus, in December, the Copenhagen European Council will set a date in 2004 for the formal accession of the new Member States and will arrange for the signing of the Accession Treaty to take place in March 2003.
Of course, the whole process depends on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. The Irish will be voting on this in October.
I must therefore stress the importance of a yes vote for Europe's future.
Signing the Accession Treaty will not be the end of a successful enlargement process. On the contrary, it will only be the beginning.
From 2004, the EU must be capable of performing all its tasks properly and meeting the expectations of the European citizens, who will then number over 450 million.
The latest Eurobarometer results are clear: 67% of those interviewed are now in favour of the euro, which is a figure six points up on the previous survey.
There is huge support for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and for enlargement and the majority of the citizens are in favour of a European Union Constitution.
Ladies and gentlemen, these results also tell us that our fellow citizens want maximum effectiveness in our institutions, and that is precisely the idea behind the second topic I want us to focus on today: institutional reforms.
Once ratified, the Nice Treaty will introduce the institutional reforms needed for enlargement, but we also need to take fundamental decisions on the political nature and the institutional structure of the European Union of the future.
Indeed, Europe must be more present in three major areas: we need a stronger foreign policy and a more effective role on the world stage, closer cooperation between the Member States in the field of security and justice and in combating organised crime and illegal immigration, and better coordination of economic and financial policy.
All these issues are currently being discussed in the debate on the future of Europe within the European Convention.
Enlargement, however, is imminent and we cannot just twiddle our thumbs until a new Treaty is ratified.
How should responsibilities be divided up amongst the Commissioners once the Union has 25 or more members, in other words as things stand in 2004, not as they are now?
How will the Council be able to provide coherent, effective guidance?
The Danish Presidency has been instructed to push ahead with the procedural reforms of the Council decided upon at Seville and the Commission undertakes as of now to give its full support.
The Commission has also been moving in this direction.
As I said yesterday, I have already put forward similar ideas on reorganising the work of the Commissioners and I would like to stress now that the reforms we can carry out without amending the Treaties need to be synchronised across the institutions.
Therefore, when there are 25 Member States, we will have to take appropriate action.
We must have one single objective: to put the right men and women in the right posts.
We must think solely of the general interest of the system and optimising its performance.
Our underlying aim is still sounder, more democratic governance of the Union.
The third and last topic I wish to raise today is Johannesburg and the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
Sustainability is a recurrent theme in the Commission's work.
We often speak of sustainability and of long-term objectives for our policies in the environmental, economic and social sectors and I hope the Johannesburg Summit will be a substantial step forwards.
Apart from anything else, I know that a number of you will be attending this Summit, and that is good for the Union has a guiding role to play in trade, humanitarian aid, development aid and diplomatic relations.
Let us not, however, rest on our laurels or be content with the successes of the past.
We must build on the momentum of Monterrey and Doha, where the Union played an essential role, and we must tackle the difficult task of convincing our partners to do their bit.
We must undertake to provide practical support for development in the southern hemisphere in line with the priorities laid down by UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, of water, hygiene, health, energy, agriculture and biodiversity.
In addition, we must not neglect the social and political aspects: developing democracy, good governance, political dialogue and social and economic reform.
All these measures will ultimately assist in achieving the major goals of alleviating poverty, securing peace and improving the standard of living of what is sadly the majority of the world's population.
The income gap between the northern and southern hemispheres is widening, particularly where Africa is concerned.
We must reverse the trend and avoid setting up new walls and creating new divides across the world.
That means doing much more than we have up to now, fulfilling our commitments and adopting a more coordinated, complementary approach.
The last G8 Meeting in Canada adopted an Africa Action Plan supporting the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD).
We must not confine ourselves to just taking part in the initiative: we must also make sure our contribution is worthy of our traditional role as Africa's special partner and our historical responsibilities towards the continent.
Prime Minister, you mentioned food safety in your speech. The Danish Presidency can count on the active support of the Commission and the newly established Food Safety Authority in its endeavours to maintain the highest standards of food safety for the Union's citizens.
In the three major areas I have spoken about today - enlargement, institutional reform and sustainable development - the EU must establish itself as a model of democratic efficiency.
We must not forget that we are the only working example of democratic, supranational management of globalisation.
Other people talk about it but we are trying to make it reality.
That is why the world expects us to make a momentous contribution to the debate on sustainability, and it must come from all of us - you, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office, Mr Rasmussen, and his entire Council Presidency team, and us in the Commission.
Prime Minister, I welcome this frank, incisive, active start to our cooperation and the friendly atmosphere too. Thank you.
I would also like to thank the Members of this House and, this being the last part-session before the summer recess, wish you all a good holiday.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, may I first of all congratulate Mr Rasmussen on his great speech.
If you achieve all of this in the course of these six months then you will demonstrate once again that it is not just the large countries that can move Europe forward, but precisely a country like yours, that takes up its duties with great ambitions in mind.
On behalf of all of us, I wish Denmark every success!
You talked about going from Copenhagen to Copenhagen and spoke in terms of a single Europe.
In your speech I also discerned a certain visionary quality, because you are taking responsibility for the fact that we need to seize this opportunity now to reunite Europe.
Copenhagen 1993 meant human dignity; it meant the Rule of Law; it meant democracy, the recognition of minorities and market regulation.
Making this a reality ten years on by admitting our central European neighbours as Members is a task of truly historic proportions.
I fully agree with you that our aim has to be to admit ten countries: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia and, of course, Cyprus and Malta.
It has to be clear, however, that if a country does not meet the conditions, then those that have already fulfilled them must not be forced to wait just because the others have not yet done so.
I was very glad to hear you say that there must be no new conditions, and I would ask you to resist any pressure, from whichever country, for our side to impose them.
(Applause)
Let me make it clear on behalf of my group that if the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany is now, for electioneering purposes, to link enlargement to the agricultural issue, then we will reject that in the strongest possible terms.
I would encourage you to do likewise and firmly reject this approach.
(Applause)
On 10 July, we will hear Commissioner Fischler give us the results of the mid-term review of agricultural policy.
Then we will debate them.
You said yourself that there will be an opportunity to make decisions at a later stage.
I might also recall - and thereby give you some encouragement, Mr President-in-Office - that this Parliament adopted Mr BÃ¶ge's report on the financial impact of the enlargement of the European Union on the agricultural policy by a large majority, which means that you have the support of the vast majority of this House for your chosen approach.
I should like to make a few comments on Turkey.
There is of course a reference to Turkey in the Seville Conclusions.
We support all attempts to promote good relations between Turkey and the European Union.
However, we think that the Danish Presidency is too early to set a date for the beginning of the negotiations.
Turkey needs to undertake further reforms - and we should support it in its efforts to do so - but the time has not yet come to set a date for negotiations.
I call on the Turkish Government to withdraw its objections to the armed forces of the European Union and NATO carrying out joint missions.
As Europeans we have to be capable of taking action and Turkey must make an appropriate contribution to this.
The Danish Presidency spoke at length on openness and transparency.
It is of course precisely the Nordic countries - Finland, Sweden, but also and in particular Denmark - who lead the way here.
I should like to encourage you to implement what was decided in Seville under your presidency.
If, for example, the Seville Conclusions state that proposals should be negotiated in public at the beginning and end of the legislative procedure in the Council of Ministers, then you should define the beginning and end of the negotiations as flexibly as possible, so that there is only a short period in the middle when meetings are perhaps not public.
We need openness; we need transparency.
Access also needs to be given to the television cameras, so that we reach the public at large.
In accordance with the Seville Conclusions, before the end of 2002 we will have an interinstitutional agreement on better lawmaking.
We hope that we will also see results at the political level by the end of 2002.
We should also like an agreement - similar to the one that we have on the Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy - on the third pillar, that is Justice and Home Affairs, so that we create more transparency there too.
Mr President-in-Office, I should like to thank you for what you have said.
In the hope that you will be able to make it a reality, I wish the Danish Presidency every success.
The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats stands at your side.
Seeing Bertel Haarder, a respected former member of this House, sitting on your right, I am confident that you and your team will also be able to lead the Danish Presidency to a successful conclusion.
All our good wishes for the Danish Presidency!
(Applause)
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you know what my group thinks because you were kind enough to invite all the chairmen to Copenhagen and I believe you raised the issue at the end of your speech in the correct way, providing a historical view of the challenge we have before us.
In this respect, I must say that I believe this is a good political approach.
I hope that the Danish Presidency will act with neutrality, as was the case last time Denmark held the Presidency.
We must not lose hope that, respecting the decisions of the Danish people, you will also be fully committed to European integration.
That would be good for everybody.
With regard to the challenges we have before us, the essential challenge is enlargement.
I would repeat that we should approach it as the historic challenge for Europeans to achieve one Europe.
Parliament is doing everything it can to ensure enlargement takes place within the agreed timescales.
I was surprised by the statements by your Foreign Minister threatening to take a stick to the candidate countries if they do not behave properly.
I do not know whether the transcription in the press is correct.
But in any event, I would accept that you have a Herculean task, because - Parliament has said this about previous enlargements - we cannot make a leap of this type without reconsidering things.
We cannot go from fifteen countries to twenty-five by negotiating for a fortnight and without dealing with budgetary issues at all.
That is why you are having problems with the Council.
You are also going to need a stick to impose order within the Council.
I must say, since Mr Poettering is so determined to systematically bring the German election campaign into our debates, that we can argue about agriculture, but please tell Mr Stoiber not to bring up the Bene? Decrees all the time, since these bombshells are much more dangerous in Europe.
Therefore, Prime Minister, since the tales of your fellow countryman Andersen are so beautiful, do not let this tale end in a nightmare.
I wish you lots of luck, but you have a very difficult job.
And this relates to food safety, because what we have now is a hyper-capitalist agricultural policy that is constantly seeking to achieve higher productivity.
We have had the political courage to debate it.
We want an agricultural policy which is aimed at sustainable development, but we cannot say that that will be discussed later and we are going to wait four years.
That is the challenge facing you.
With regard to fisheries, we also have to create a sustainable development policy, but applying human principles and respecting the social fabric and cohesion, which I am sure we all agree on.
I must point out that you are a fishing power, since you fish more than anyone else in the Community.
With regard to security, justice and freedom, all I will say is that we support the fight against terrorism and organised crime.
We are very concerned because your government is pursuing a policy on asylum which has been criticised by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.
Furthermore, you have not included Tampere in your programme; you only refer to Seville.
In the work implementing Tampere we have five outstanding directives on the table?
(Applause)
?and in Seville you have had to give the Interior Ministers homework with deadlines.
Mr President, a brief reference to global responsibility.
You are right to raise global security.
It concerns me very much as well and I would like you to disown the statements of your Foreign Minister in which he states that the approach of the Quartet and the International Conference on the Middle East makes no sense.
This has been approved by Parliament, it is a European Union position and it appears in the Seville conclusions.
We believe that unilateral action by the United States is not the way to resolve this conflict.
Finally - and I will end here, Mr President - aware that the Convention we are preparing is a challenge for next year, I would like to know what you think: are you in favour of the Community method or the cabinet-based method?
Thank you very much and good luck.
(Applause)
President-in-Office, you take on the presidency of the European Council at a time when the Union faces its greatest-ever challenge: the largest expansion of our Community in the history of European integration.
If you succeed - as we are confident you will - your presidency will tear down the last vestiges of the Iron Curtain.
As you rightly point out in your programme, Europe will have come full circle, from the Copenhagen Summit of 1993, which set the accession criteria, to the Copenhagen Summit which reunites Europe in 2002.
Why are Liberals in this House confident that you will succeed?
Not only because you have prepared so thoroughly for this task but also because you assume the presidency of the Council at a time when Liberals also occupy the presidencies of the European Commission and the European Parliament.
With governments of left and right bowing to narrow national interests and placing in jeopardy this historic reunification, history appeals to the generosity of the liberal spirit.
We appeal to Blair and SchrÃ¶der on the left and to Aznar, Berlusconi and Chirac on the right to pause for a moment and ponder: what picture will Europe project to the world if you squabble like Roman soldiers under the cross over a fraction of 1% of GDP?
It is not easy to be a Liberal when greed and prejudice fill the air, but rest assured, President-in-Office, that Liberal Democrats in this House will maintain our unfailing support for enlargement under the criteria laid down in Copenhagen.
I regret that the Spanish presidency was not able to lighten your workload by making greater progress on agriculture and fisheries, which have been spoken of today.
While we strongly support reform of the CAP and the CFP, this must not be a precondition for enlargement.
Let nobody assume that in our eagerness to secure the prize of enlargement, we will allow reform to fall by the wayside.
But neither will we be held to ransom by the practice which allows the European Union's agenda to be dictated by the timetable of national elections.
The other hurdle that you must surmount is the paucity of public preparedness.
A Eurobarometer poll shows that only one citizen in five feels well informed about EU enlargement.
Ireland must approve the Nice Treaty, and beyond Copenhagen, national parliaments and this House must ratify the accession treaties.
If popular fears about candidate countries and the costs of enlargement are not addressed, the process could yet be derailed.
However, this challenge will be in large measure addressed if Denmark's proud tradition of openness and accountability is put to good use in opening up the Council beyond the timid measures agreed in Seville, and if you give your excellent European Affairs Minister free rein to take on the Eurosceptics.
In justice and home affairs the ELDR Group welcomes your detailed programme to protect our people from terrorism.
We hope that as good Liberals you will demonstrate the same zeal in taking forward measures to protect citizens' freedoms, as you show in tackling terrorist threats.
In the area of immigration and asylum, I appeal to you to use the tried and tested Community method to make progress and to overcome the short-sighted opposition of others to a European border guard corps.
In answer to the remarks of my friend, Mr Baron Crespo, I would far rather be an asylum-seeker trying to get into Denmark - where I would have a greater chance of success - than one of the huddled masses trying to get into Mr Blair's bleak Britain.
(Applause)
