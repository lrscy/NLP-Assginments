Crisis management: the Commission has already stated that there is an emergency plan.
I gather that there are indeed certain plans afoot, but what is the situation as regards human health?
The flu medicine that could help the public is now available to a limited extent.
Has the Commission consulted the Member States on how it will be used in the different countries if there are inadequate supplies of this medicine in certain other countries?
Finally, a word about the OIE.
Trade depends on trust and many aspects cannot be monitored by the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin alone, which is dependent on the information that countries pass on to the OIE.
It has now transpired that Indonesia, Vietnam and possibly China, have probably waited many months before informing the OIE.
What does the Commission intend to do in this context in order to enhance the provision of information, and to ensure that trading can take place under fair conditions, with no risk of our suddenly being faced with illegal imports of products of this kind?
Â Â  â Mr President, I am quite happy to agree with the Commissioner that his staff deserve thanks.
You said, Commissioner, that work is being done right now, on the ground, to combat the epidemic.
Good though that is, were you on the spot straightaway when the epidemic started?
Were you informed of it then, or only later on when the press picked up the story, and when there was general uproar among us?
You said, Commissioner, that small businesses have been affected, and that this could provide the impetus for industrialisation.
I take the view that it is precisely the moves towards industrialisation that have taken place in these countries that have created the conditions for this pandemic, for they have brought indigenous and adapted breeds into contact with genetically developed breeds that may have adapted to industrialisation but have genetic defects and lack resistance to this disease.
So, if you favour on-the-spot controls in this case, as we do, they must form part of a constant analytical process if these problems are to be addressed.
It is not the small-time poultry farmers who export to the European Union, but the large industrial plants, and their standards of hygiene must be equal to our own.
That will not, however, be achieved by having controls at borders or by tightening up the ones that are already in place â and always in a visible way, as the sort of reaction that Mrs Roth-Behrendt described; what we need instead is special external protection.
What this means is that prevention does not start at the border; rather, we must impose our standards, and monitor adherence to them, in the countries that supply us, enabling us to guarantee preventative observation and action to reorient production in these countries.
Thank you very much.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to us that the current epizootic disease of avian influenza in Thailand and South-East Asia again raises acutely the question of these new pandemics, with the risks of repeated health crises, as we have seen in the recent past, which have destabilised farmers and also threatened consumers.
We are told today that the whole of South-East Asia is affected, with 19 human victimsÂ âÂ 14 in Vietnam and five in ThailandÂ âÂ and 50 million birds slaughtered on the Asian continent.
One case has been reported in the United States.
We would like to know, Commissioner, what is the likelihood of contamination and to what extent it is possible to say that the virus that has appeared in the US is or is not the same one as has appeared in Asia.
I would like to mention a number of precedents: bovine spongiform encephalitis, to which my colleague MrÂ Martinez repeatedly tried to draw the Commissionâs attention over five years before it burst upon the world in the shape of the famous mad cow affair; foot and mouth disease in the UK and dioxin-contaminated chicken in Belgium.
Last year there were cases of avian influenza in the Netherlands, not to mention the swine fever that recurs in our countries.
I am glad that we have understood the full extent of the problem right away this time.
As my fellow Members have said, however, we also need to deal with the causes.
While the causes of these diseases are sometimes concealed to avoid damaging the industry or turning away the consumer, we do â at least in the previous cases â have a pretty good idea what they are.
We know it was mainly the quest for high yields and high-density farming on the one hand, as the previous speaker said, and, on the other, generalised free trade and the systematic opening of borders.
This theory, which used to be stigmatised as the âfree fox in the free henhouseâ, fits the situation perfectly, the fox here rather symbolising free trade.
Not only has it eaten the chicken but, what is far worse, it has contaminated it.
True, the Commission has proposed an embargo on imports of Thai chicken until August 2004, but that seems to us inadequate given the scale the phenomenon is assuming.
Remember, Commissioner, that the Commission hauled France before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg for refusing to lift the embargo on British beef when there was no guarantee that the British meat was harmless and BSE was still wreaking havoc in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
France, which produces 2 million tonnes of poultry a year, 35 to 45% of it for export, could return for a timeÂ âÂ and not only France but others tooÂ â to traditional markets from which it was ousted by competition from Brazil, which practices dumping prices and where, it also appears, production conditions are atrocious.
So much so, incidentally, that Europeâs number one poultry producer, Doux, has relocated to Brazil to take advantage of cheap labour and plentiful raw materials at low prices.
Systematic free trade not only destabilises our producers and our poultry farmers, it also forces us, as part of the WTO, to accept ridiculous clauses that make you wonder what they have got to do with a free economy and a free market.
I am thinking of the one that was signed at the GATT in 1994 stipulating that Europe commits itself to importing 5% of its poultry meat consumption, or one million tonnes in 2002.
For the present there has been no transmission of avian influenza between humans, but if there is a risk of a world pandemic and if the H5N1 virus were to combine with a human virus like the flu virus to create a new, highly contagious fatal strain, then I think, Commissioner, that the EUR 1 million credit you have just announced could prove tragically inadequate.
Â Â  Commissioner Byrne, thank you for the explanation, which can almost be seen as an extremely accurate description of the situation.
My speech is, I am sorry to say, based on press information, information whichÂ âÂ at least as regards ItalyÂ âÂ is awakening considerable concerns since, for example, dead peregrine falcons and migratory ducks, two species of a very resistant nature, have been discovered.
I would now like to make two simple and precise comments.
The first concerns the health aspect.
We are not being caught completely unawares by the H5N1 strain, because it was identified back in 1997 and it reappeared as H7N1 between 1999 and 2001.
Now, because the strain is continually mutating, we would ask the Commission what it intends to do as regards prevention, becauseÂ âÂ as some Members rightly stated before meÂ âÂ we always spring into action after the emergency arises.
Some Member States are equipped with their own national laboratories, but the European Centre for Infectious Diseases must set up a group to monitor the ways in which the health situation is monitored in the Member States.
The second aspect concerns the Commissionâs work.
As Commissioner Lamy announced, there is an extremely serious option, within the talks to revive the WTO, aimed at increasing the number of countries involved in the EBA initiative.
So then, what are the guarantees offered to our consumers as regards the globalisation of markets?
Does the Commission not believe that, on this subject, a think-tank should be set up, within the actual context of the WTO, concerning the relationship between globalisation and health problems?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, once again we face a new public health threat.
This illness shows that communicable diseases go beyond the framework of the Member States and impose the need for immediate measures which guarantee prevention and protect the health of European citizens.
On 1 February 2004, the World Health Organisation pointed out the danger of the flu virus spreading from human to human.
So far 19 people have died, 23 have been contaminated and the virus has emerged in ten Asian countries.
Not only is the virus highly communicable, but the delay yet again in providing the relevant information has helped it to spread.
The European Commission perhaps underestimated the danger, considering that the virus cannot be transmitted from human to human.
However, we know that flu viruses are genetically unstable and their behaviour cannot be predicted.
So this specific epidemic may change quickly and continually.
Without question, I welcome the measures taken to ban imports of meat and poultry for six months and imports of live birds as domestic animals from Asian countries.
But we must not stop at that, Commissioner.
As you well know, the virus is also carried by wild birds as their flocks move.
We need the expertise of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, so that suitable guidelines can be issued and the importance of preventive vaccination, where possible, can be highlighted.
History has taught us that, in cases where a disease has economic repercussions on the agricultural sector and may also harm human health, the risk to man must not be underestimated; it must take priority if we really want to maintain consumer confidence.
I do not feel that this is what has happened so far with the measures announced.
Finally, Commissioner, we must be certain that livestock breeders in the areas affected are in a position to obtain suitable means to incinerate animals attacked by the disease without any risk of its spreading.
Â Â  â Commissioner Byrne, thank you for your factual explanation, but still, I have to say that I wonder what it is we are actually doing exactly.
Indeed, like the Liberals, we cannot fail to observe that we do not only have one external border, but fifteen different external borders where assorted attempts are being made at controlling the possible import of avian influenza.
We have witnessed a similar scenario in the case of FMD, and we must take measures in order to prevent a similar situation from occurring again.
I need to get something else off my chest.
If our elderly are at risk of contracting flu, vaccines are available on a massive scale.
In this case too, we know that vaccines are necessary, but nothing, or far too little, is being done about it.
The only country that is working on vaccines is Italy.
I think that the European Union should make a concerted effort to develop vaccines so that we can combat this disease in a humane manner.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President.
Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was almost a year ago exactly that this House discussed SARS.
Now, as then, many Members are saying that globalisation and the European internal market, which are essentially good things, can work well only if we also take action to protect peopleâs health.
This is where Europe needs to take joint action, for viruses and bacteria do not, after all, stop at borders.
Let me pick up Mr Mulderâs example.
DÃŒsseldorfâs airport is very, very close to the Dutch border, and so it is from DÃŒsseldorf that many Dutch people fly when they go on holiday, and a lot of people from the part of North Rhine-Westphalia around DÃŒsseldorf fly from Schiphol.
People will not understand why safety measures at Schiphol have to be quite different from those in DÃŒsseldorf.
In any case, viruses do not make a stop at the borders, which are themselves established in different ways by nation-states, and so I believe this is where we need more measures taken at European level.
A year ago, I backed Commissioner Byrne when he was trying to get more competences to combat this sort of threat included in the European constitution.
Admittedly, he does often overshoot the mark, and when he did, I told him so, but, in this case, he really is right, and we should be behind him.
Although the Convention did not achieve what we actually wanted, progress has been made, and that is another reason to press for a European constitution, which will better enable us to combat these dangers.
I would like to conclude by taking up Mrs Roth-Behrendtâs point about research.
We do indeed have to do more for medical research, and when we do, we must not think only in terms of products that are capable of being used in the short term.
The protection of peopleâs health is a research objective too, one that it is worth pushing, one on which it is worth spending money if there are no firms willing to do it in the short term.
Dangers can present themselves without warning, and so we have to be prepared, even if industry has made no effort by the time the danger arises.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, I welcome your statement here this morning, but I understand that you went to Thailand and were told that it was not avian flu but chicken cholera.
It was only when you returned that you later found that it was actually avian flu.
I welcome the ban you have imposed on Thai chicken meat but you have not banned cooked meat or canned meat, and this accounts for about 75% of our imports from Thailand.
The Thai authorities have been found wanting in international compliance.
They have hidden the Thai flu for maybe two months.
If they protect their market from a deadly disease, surely they will protect it against minor infringements of EU standards.
Will they run the same risk with cooked meats?
Will we see nitrofuran residues and hormones entering the EU in this cooked meat?
Is the public health of the EU overridden by the trade interests of EU exporters?
I believe Thailand should be completely delisted from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply EU standards all the time.
Can we also have a labelling of country of origin for principal ingredients in processed food, because this is where most of this Thai cooked meat comes in?
How can we be sure that meat cooked in Thailand has reached the correct temperature?
There is perhaps a slight risk â how do we know?
Cooked chicken may come into the UK frozen, then thaw and be eaten with no further treatment from the time the Thais cooked it.
Is this a risk to our consumers?
The tariff for Thai cooked chicken meat is one seventh of that on frozen fresh chicken.
Why is this so, Commissioner?
This seems to be a loophole.
Finally, has the disease moved to the United States of America?
Â Â  â Mr President, I am grateful to the Commissioner for his introduction.
There are actually only a few questions of importance not only to the consumer, but also to the sector itself.
The very first question we have to ask is whether Europe finally determined what it is that we do not want to let in.
I sometimes feel sorry for the Commissioner, because he can only implement what has been agreed in the Member States.
The order did not become valid until 6Â February.
This means that the system governing the Commissionâs relations with the Member States â after all, you cannot always do everything â probably still leaves something to be desired.
Moreover, I wonder what the situation is as regards meat, because the order stipulates 1 January as the date on which imports are no longer permitted.
What about meat that has been imported from those countries prior to that date?
My next question is as follows.
I gather that there is now also a problem in the United States.
Admittedly, it is not the real avian influenza as we know it in Asia, but it appears to be related.
What do we do with those countries?
What do the consumers want?
They want the guarantee that they receive safe products.
They also want sound information, which states that, since you normally do not eat raw meat, chicken meat in a different composition or other method of preparation can do no harm.
Let us make sure we can provide this collective information.
A number of Members have already mentioned vaccines.
I see this as an area in which Europe should develop far more resources and scope in order to act as one.
Â Â  Mr President, Northern Ireland has a very vibrant poultry industry, which is expressing grave concern.
While what has happened in Asia is unfortunate, we have to protect the European market, because it is an extremely large market for the poultry industry.
I am concerned about the length of time it took the authorities in Asia to notify us of the outbreak.
This is a very worrying aspect.
I have to ask the Commissioner to give serious consideration to the depth of our scrutiny of the chicken Asia is producing and exporting to Europe.
There is cause for grave concern.
Our producers produce chicken and broiler chicken meat of an extremely high standard for the consumers in Europe.
But the standard of chicken, not only from the Far East but also from other parts of the world, is seriously questionable.
We can sit back on our laurels and wait and see.
Before this ban is lifted again, Commissioner, I would like your assurance that you will do everything to ensure that our veterinary inspection in the Far East where the outbreaks took place is of the highest quality, and we accept no excuses.
I would also raise the point of the import of chicken feathers.
This might not look like a problem, but I am told that it is the most serious way of exporting Asian bird flu to Europe.
You have to take that on board too when you deal with the chicken meat.
Â Â  â Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for his explanation, but there is a Dutch proverb that says: wherever an ass falls, there he will never fall again, or, in other words, âonce bitten, twice shyâ.
It is certainly not my intention to draw a comparison between our Commissioner and that animal, but it is absolutely true that the Commission is often late in responding to certain epidemics of animal diseases.
We saw this in the case of FMD and we are witnessing it again now.
The Commissioner visited Thailand in early January and stated there, during his visit, that he was pleased about how the problem was being dealt with and that there was certainly no risk of avian influenza.
Meanwhile, one month on, we are in the middle of a worldwide crisis.
We in the CDA delegation in this House demand from the Commissioner that the line of approach similar to the one we have in the Netherlands, the so-called Veerman approach, should be extended Europe-wide: a ban on the imports of all poultry, so including cooked meat, from South-East Asia, a ban on the imports of ornamental birds, tighter control on flights from Asia and disinfectant mats on all international airports with direct or indirect connections to Asia.
That is at the moment the only way of warding off this crisis.
In addition, I should like the Commissioner to shed light on the rumour that FMD has broken out in 26 towns in Vietnam.
We can now fight the problem in good time and, if that is the case, we can ensure that, this time round, adequate measures are taken and we should not wait until the disaster has spread in South-East Asia again before we take action.
We are in favour of supporting the Asian countries in the fight against avian influenza, but we in Europe should not be injecting funds into this while a number of countries ride roughshod over the quarantine measures.
Finally, the Commission should start a worldwide debate on the fight against animal diseases.
Similarly, preventive vaccination should gradually become a subject of discussion worldwide, from the point of view of both public and animal health.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome our Commissioner, Mr Byrne.
I am deeply concerned about some of the issues that have been raised in this meeting today.
Is this a matter of public health or public safety, or is it just a trade issue?
I strongly believe that this is a matter of public health.
I should like to ask the Commissioner how long it took him to decide to ban chicken from coming into the European Union?
Is chicken that is still in transit coming into the European Union, or has that also been stopped?
We heard from Mr Parish that there is a problem of cooked and chilled meats coming in.
Why has it not been decided to ban all meats coming in?
It is said that the flu virus is killed at 70 degrees â given an absolutely perfect situation â but we do not know how these products are cooked.
Can you, Commissioner, guarantee the safety of children in my constituency?
For example, schools in Bedford are using Thai chicken to prepare meals for the pupils.
Can we totally guarantee their safety?
I have three direct questions for you, Commissioner.
What are you doing to ensure the safety of meat coming into this country?
How many qualified inspectors do we have today on our borders, checking the safety and quality of products coming into the European Union?
You were asked what you were going to do about labelling.
Can we guarantee the consumer that labelling will show the country of origin of production?
It is particularly important that you look at this, Commissioner.
This is not just about trade, it is about health.
Mr Nicholson mentioned feathers.
Have you stopped the import of feathers as of today?
Â Â  Mr President, we are all mindful of the impact on the worldâs population of the atypical pneumonia that raged for much of last year.
The ongoing helplessness of the specialists in the face of this epidemic led to a further sense of insecurity and resulted in a high number of casualties and also a climate of instability in society because it emphasised the deadly risk to anyone contracting the disease.
Because I believe that life and health are the most precious assets we have, I must express my concern at this new epidemic: a form of flu whose virus comes from chickens and for which no cure has yet been found.
According to studies published recently by the scientific community, only one thing is certain: this disease is highly contagious.
What can be done to counter it?
Use vaccines?
How effective are they?
Draw boundaries around neighbourhoods, cities and countries and cut them off from the outside world?
This is what happened 80 years ago and we all know what the outcome was.
How safe are imports of this meat across the world?
We all need more complete information at least so that the population at large is not gripped by panic.
We have a duty to ensure that our actions contribute to making health policies accountable, as regards this new disease too, in the face of which we feel powerless.
We must find out whether other animals in our food chain are equally at risk, because a few days ago pigs were said to be amongst the animals most vulnerable to this type of virus.
To allay these legitimate concerns, all the necessary means must be made available to prevent and treat this epidemic.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Union must raise concerns about the unhealthy practices that have developed alongside the industrialisation and mass transportation of livestock in parts of Asia.
Animal disease now travels far and fast in types of farming and food distribution.
That makes it very difficult to control.
In the age of global trade, retailers and manufacturers source their raw materials where they are cheapest, and the European poultry industry has struggled to compete with prices from south-east Asia and Brazil, where labour costs are very much lower.
The UK alone imported 36Â 649 tonnes of poultry meat from Thailand in the first ten months of last year, a 50% increase on the previous year.
But in the light of this flu virus we must maintain the strictest food safety standards here in the European Union, ensuring that all imports meet those very same high standards.
Modern food systems mean that animal diseases travel far and travel quickly.
The outbreak of avian flu in the Netherlands last year illustrated how hard the disease can be to contain.
Does the Commission believe that all health authorities in the European Union would spot avian flu and be able to react decisively enough if it arrived on this continent?
Â Â  . Mr President, I have been asked a number of questions and I will endeavour to answer as many as possible.
First, Mrs Jackson asks whether I am satisfied with the inspection services that we have, particularly in relation to our work in Asia.
In relation to the FVO, I should say that I have not sent the FVO to Thailand in respect of this particular outbreak.
The experts who are there, who have been offered by me, have been supplying their services through the World Health Organisation and are in place working with the OIE , in Vietnam particularly.
The FVO will be involved in this exercise only when it is believed there is something profitable to be gained from it, that is in circumstances where there is the possibility of lifting the ban.
I have made it clear on a number of occasions publicly that it is not my intention to lift this ban on the importation of Thai chicken until such time as there is an independent evaluation of the situation there, in view of the history that a number of you have referred to.
The evaluation will be made as a result of a visit from the inspectors of the FVO and following a report from them as to the situation.
Mrs Jackson also asked me whether, in view of the likelihood of concealment, we are getting good information and whether we have a proper rapid response team in place.
As I indicated in my earlier remarks, there is in existence an early warning response system.
This system is in place, working from Luxembourg, and has been in operation for some time.
You will remember when I reported to Parliament last year on the SARS issue, I also pointed to the work of this committee.
There is a Communicable Diseases Network which also works in conjunction with the relevant authorities in the Member States.
I am absolutely satisfied that the system of rapid response that we have in relation to animal and human diseases is very effective.
You will remember the very quick response of the Commission and my services to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease some years ago, when the Commission responded within a matter of hours and all the relevant authorities and Member States knew within a matter of hours that there had been this outbreak in the United Kingdom.
The same is true of public health because we have this system in place.
Mention was also made of the next item on Parliament's agenda: the legislation establishing the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
I can assure Parliament that the evidence is there that the Commission and other institutions of the European Union are working well to respond quickly to these kinds of issues and to give proper information to the public and, indeed, to respond well and appropriately to outbreaks of this kind.
On the question of food labelling, there is Community law in place relating to labelling.
It may need upgrading and I am looking at that.
The legislation in place requires country of origin labelling and certification and stamps from countries such as Thailand.
So, if cooked chicken from Thailand comes pre-packed it has a stamp on it which indicates that and the label also states the country of origin which, as I indicated in this case, is Thailand.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me if we are doing enough in respect of avian flu and, in particular, blocking food products from Asia.
It is important to emphasise that we do not trade in any poultry products with any country in Asia other than Thailand, so the responses given relate to that country.
Of course we are concerned about the outbreak of animal and bird diseases in other parts of the world and we make sure that we respond properly to those issues.
As a number of people mentioned during this debate, we must not lose sight of the fact that we have had these outbreaks of avian influenza in the European Union also.
We had an outbreak in Italy two or three years ago; we had an outbreak in the Netherlands last year; there have been outbreaks in Belgium and Germany too.
Mrs Roth-Behrendt also asked me what I am doing about imports from China.
It is public knowledge that we banned imports from China some years ago; there was a lot of publicity about that at the time.
There are a number of food products we do not import from China, including poultry.
On the question of research into vaccinations, this is being done â DG Research does have a research programme on food safety.
On this same subject which Mrs Roth-Behrendt and others referred to, an informal meeting of the health ministers of the EU and accession countries will be taking place in Brussels on Thursday evening.
One of the items on the agenda is the question of the stockpiling of vaccines in respect of diseases of this kind, of which flu is obviously one.
We had a discussion in Parliament last year on appropriate responses to the bioterrorism issue, such as stockpiling vaccines against smallpox.
There is ongoing work in relation to that also.
However, I must emphasise, as MrÂ Liese has said, that the competences available to us at European Union level in respect of public health issues are quite limited.
An attempt was made to extend these competences in the European Convention and we made some progress.
I still have hopes that we might ultimately make more progress on this before the finalisation of the Constitution.
Mr Mulder asked me about the inspection systems.
In his opinion inspections are not carried out at the same level for products coming in from outside the European Union.
Under Commission Decision 2002/995/EC, all personal imports of meat in the luggage of passengers from Asia have been banned with the exception of small amounts of specialist food products, such as baby food.
Under these rules, poultry meat and meat products carried by passengers cannot be introduced into the EU without conforming to the same health requirements as commercial imports.
As I said earlier, no commercial imports of poultry meat are allowed from any Asian country where the disease is present.
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf then asked me whether I reacted quickly or only when the press publicised this issue.
As has been indicated by a number of other speakers, I was in Asia when this outbreak became public.
I had been in Vietnam, from where we do not import any poultry meat, so the issue does not arise there.
But I had also been in Thailand.
It is public knowledge that in the early part of the week when I was there, there was some lack of transparency, if could express it in that way.
I was concerned during the couple of days I was there at the mounting circumstantial evidence tending in the other direction.
Following pressing questions from me, it was made clear to me two or three days later that in fact avian flu was present, both in the human and bird populations.
I am satisfied that my presence in Thailand helped to improve transparency in relation to this issue.
As soon as the presence of avian flu was confirmed to me on 23 January, I put a ban in place within a matter of hours.
The ban went in place on that Friday at 12 o'clock, Brussels time.
Any suggestion that the Commission reacted slowly is incorrect.
I cannot imagine any greater degree of surveillance or monitoring than the Commissioner being there himself, asking questions, not being satisfied with the answers, pressing further, getting the truth and acting within hours.
Mr Gollnisch asked me about the risk of contamination of the United States virus.
It is believed, but not yet confirmed, that this virus is a low pathogenic virus and therefore would not require the same degree of response as for the Asian influenza from Thailand.
However, that is not confirmed, we are still looking at it and our response will depend on our information.
I assure him that the lifting of the ban will only take place after independent evaluation of the circumstances.
Mr Fiori asked me about pet birds and other birds.
A ban has been put in place in respect of the importation of pet birds.
He asked me about coordinating groups.
There is a regulatory committee of the EU, which includes Member States' experts, who deal with that.
He asked me about links between globalisation and diseases.
The OIE in Paris continues evaluating the situation.
The Commission is a member of that, Member States are involved.
They are meeting later this month in relation to this issue.
The SPS Agreement is also a relevant contributor to the protection of animal and public health in relation to the WTO issues.
Mr de Roo asked me about borders.
Once again, I refer back to the lack of competences that we have in relation to borders and communicable diseases, but I hope more progress will be made on this.
I refer him also to my earlier answer that the health ministers are meeting later this week to deal with many of the issues that he raised about the public health aspect and in particular vaccinations.
Mr Parish said that it was only when I returned that I discovered there was a problem and that I reacted well.
As I indicated earlier, that was not the case; I reacted while I was there and the Commission responded well to this issue.
We have not banned cooked meats for the reasons that have been stated.
I am advised that cooked meats above 60 degrees â and we put in a safety margin of another 10 degrees â are safe for human consumption.
The inspectors in the European Union, and in the Member States themselves, know what is necessary and carry out appropriate inspections to ensure that there are no breaches of Community law in relation to this issue.
He also referred to labelling and I refer him to my earlier answer.
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten asked me whether we followed the Member States' lead in this.
The actual chronology of events is that on 23 January the Commission put in place the ban in circumstances I have already outlined; Member States responded with the regulatory committee confirming that ban on 6 February; and a further ban was put in place in respect of feathers â Mr Nicholson asked me about that â on 28 January.
Mr Sturdy asked me how long it took for the ban to be put in place.
I have already answered that question.
There were a number of questions in relation to the number of inspectors at the border posts.
This is a Member State competence.
The Member States themselves make sure that they have enough officials to ensure that the importation is properly inspected.
The Food and Veterinary Office inspectors monitor this when they carry out their inspections.
They report, and the reports are public.
There are no reports of any concerns in relation to this.
On labelling, I refer you to my earlier answer.
Concerning feathers, again I refer you to my earlier answer: that ban has been in place since 28 January.
Mrs Cardoso made reference to the vulnerability of pigs and I would confirm that this is a concern and is being watched very closely.
There have been reports of some infection found in the noses of some pigs in Vietnam, but it has not extended any further and there has been no evidence of mutation of the flu virus.
This is, however, being watched very closely because of the similarity between the immune system of pigs and of humans.
Therefore, as she rightly points out, it is of considerable concern.
Mr Wyn asked me whether the health authorities are doing everything that they can to stop the spread of this disease.
I am impressed by the work undertaken by my own staff.
I have had detailed consultations and briefings and I am satisfied that their own work, their interaction with the WHO, the FAO and the OIE, and also their interaction with the experts in the Member States, indicate to me that this issue is being taken very seriously, that the officials, at both national and international level, understand the seriousness of this and that they are doing everything in their power to ensure that the disease is not spread.
One of the difficulties being faced in some poorer areas is that the stamping-out of the disease is best achieved by killing the birds in question.
This is of course a matter of concern in poor countries, because unless the authorities involved face up to the question of compensation there is a risk that a disease of this kind may be hidden.
That may be a contributing factor to the earlier lack of full transparency about this issue in that part of the world.
This has to be faced and we have to emphasise it in our relations with the authorities in Member States.
These kinds of diseases cannot be hidden, their presence will come out, will be known, and the consequences ultimately will be worse for those countries who engage in that exercise, because they undermine the confidence of the authorities engaged in food safety, like ours in the European Union.
The stringent measures necessary before the ban is lifted in Thailand, with the requirement that there will be independent evaluation, will be particularly necessary in this instance because of the lack of transparency at an earlier stage.
We must be assured that our own authorities are satisfied, which is why no lifting of the ban in Thailand will take place until the FVO has carried out an inspection on the ground and reported back that things are satisfactory.
Â Â  â Mr President, on a point of order, I have asked the Commissioner about the rumour of the FMD outbreak in 26 towns in Vietnam that are also plagued by avian influenza.
I have not had an answer to this question from the Commissioner.
I should like to know whether the Commissioner has any information on this.
Â Â  . Mr President, we are watching the situation in Vietnam very carefully and in particular the spread of this disease there.
There may be a risk that the outbreak of the disease there is more serious and more widespread than in Thailand.
I believe that to be the case.
I must emphasise that we do not import any poultry from Vietnam, so there is no risk to public health.
There is no risk to animal health from direct importation from Vietnam and therefore our concern in this relates to ensuring the containment of the spread of the disease in Asia itself as a matter of general interest, but it is not related to any further risk as a result of any importation of birds, because we do not engage in that kind of trade with Vietnam.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissioner has been very elaborate in his answer, but he has avoided answering one essential question.
Under heading 1a in the 2003 and 2004 budgets this Parliament and the Council have twice provided for extra funds to be set aside for research into better vaccines and testing methods.
The Commission was at liberty to decline that wish of Parliament.
In the light of present developments, is the Commission prepared to investigate the possibility of using funds from heading 1a for research into vaccines and testing methods and inform this House as soon as possible of the outcome of these deliberations?
It is urgent that we do something, and the Commission should not ignore the resolutions of this Parliament in this respect, nor the budget itself.
Â Â  . I know that Mr Mulder is interested in this matter and that he has had direct contact with my cabinet about it as recently as in the last few days.
The items he mentions as requiring financing are being financed.
The question is: under what heading will they be dealt with?
If it is believed to be necessary to transfer from one budget heading to another and that this is the best way of dealing with it, then this can be done.
This matter is under review.
However, it is important to emphasise that the items he mentions as requiring financing are not being under-financed.
They are being financed.
Whatever refinement may be necessary in the future can be dealt with at that time.
Â Â  â Mr President, I do not want to respond to what the Commissioner has said here, but simply to know when the minutes of yesterdayâs sitting will be adopted since I know they are not yet available.
Will it be at the start of this afternoonâs sitting or at some other time?
Â Â  â It will be at the start of this afternoonâs sitting, at 3 p.m.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0038/2004) by Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Â Â  . I am pleased to be here to discuss the Commissionâs proposal for a regulation to establish a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, submitted to the Council and the European Parliament in August 2003.
Allow me first to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work and support on this important and urgent proposal.
The SARS emergency in the early spring of 2003 served as a sharp reminder of the need to accelerate the further development of our capacity to deal with health threats.
The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia â that we have just discussed â with its potential risk to public health, reinforces the need for prompt and effective action.
The existing Community network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases is a solid basis on which we can build â to enhance cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and international organisations, in particular the World Health Organisation.
We need to have the means at our disposal to respond to emerging health threats based on the best scientific advice, in the shortest possible time.
Establishment of the centre marks the shift from ad hoc cooperation to structured coordination through a focal point, giving clear scientific leadership.
In some recent cases, in response to WHO requests for help, we have seen teams from different Member States investigating the same phenomena with slightly different methodologies, sending samples to different laboratories, with each of them reporting separately.
This divergence would end with the creation of a scientifically reputable centre with the authority to act at Community level on matters such as surveillance, networking of expert laboratories or mobilising outbreak investigation teams.
The Commissionâs text takes into account budgetary rigour and respects the Member Statesâ responsibilities on public health.
At first, the centre's core task will be to deal with communicable diseases from whatever source â deliberate or adventitious.
The question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience.
I very much hope that we can reach a speedy agreement between the institutions â during first reading â to enable the centre to become operational as soon as possible.
Â Â  .
Mr President, when I present reports to this Parliament I like to add by way of a signature a quotation and in this case I have used the Arabian proverb: 'He who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everything'.
The statement and the debate we have just been listening to show the hopes and the fears of our constituents and their concern that we do better in this area in the future.
In the case of avian flu, with the transmission from hens to ducks to pigs to humans â resulting in the deaths of 19 humans â mutation is a possibility.
When we look back at the SARS experience and when we look around at the constant threat of bioterrorism, we see the need for this centre to coordinate better, as the Commissioner has said, and we see the need for urgency in bringing this measure forward.
We are dealing with health emergencies that are within the competence of the European Union.
We are also dealing with other health areas and starting, as the Commissioner has said, with communicable diseases, not least those with drug-resistant strains, which threaten our communities.
This report provides for a later review in three years' time, which will look at the scope of the measure and the experience gained and see how best we can move forward in terms of other health monitoring.
The centre does not resemble the American Central Direction Center, but is rather a network of networks.
It is neither bureaucratic, nor is it costly.
In due course, we may need to look at its costs to see if we are adequately funding it, but for now it is certainly not costly.
It will work closely with national networks and no national network need feel threatened by this because they will fully be a part of it.
It will also work with international agencies, particularly the WHO, which is so fundamental in these areas.
In our discussions we have had two key issues before us.
One was the scope, where we found a happy and acceptable solution, and the other was the board, where there was some controversy.
I am one of those who has always argued for small boards for these authorities and agencies, as I did for the Food Safety Authority, but in this case there is a fundamental reason why we need to have every Member State represented on the board and that is because every Member State may be asked to contribute to the work of the centre.
That is sensible.
I am grateful also that we have been able to ensure that we have parliamentary representation on the board.
It is urgent that this set-up should be in place by 2005 and for that reason we have to do this in a single reading, given the complexities of the parliamentary year ahead.
It has been a complex process of consultation with colleagues and with the Council that has led to a complex set of mainly technical and linguistic amendments.
We now have two blocks of amendments; the first are those that I commend to this House, and the second those that are superseded by the first.
There are then two further amendments tabled by the ELDR Group and I have to say to the House that, whatever one thinks of those amendments, were they to be accepted it would jeopardise the possibility of having this measure brought forward by 2005.
I therefore have to ask the House to reject those two amendments.
This report has only been possible because of the collaboration with my colleagues in my Group and across the groups, and I am deeply grateful to them, to the shadow rapporteurs, to the Group, the committee and the parliamentary secretariats.
Our discussions and debates have also played a role, including those with the Commission and the Council, which have often been forceful, yet always positive.
I am grateful both to the former Italian presidency and the current Irish presidency for the work we have been able to do together.
This proposal will enhance our Community and national ability to look after public health throughout the European Union.
It will enable us to work with other countries beyond the European Union to prevent, control and defeat the health threats that we face today.
I commend this measure to the House.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to offer my warmest congratulations to the rapporteur.
Obviously I am going to say how urgent we believe it is for this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to be set up.
This is also apparent from the discussions we have just had this morning and those we had last year at a time when the health threats were severe.
We need to put a system in place that will enable us to respond both effectively and swiftly because, as everyone knows, diseases know no borders.
Not to mention that the risks of propagation are all the greater for exchanges between people and movements to the four corners of the globe being increasingly frequent.
Finally, the potential threat of bioterrorism means we need to be particularly vigilant.
Having said that, we must not worry the public, but rather prevent risk and put in place every possible means of detection and rapid response.
Such an approach therefore requires very close coordination between the Member States and concerted action to pool resources, competences and knowledge.
With this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control we are establishing a Europe of immune defence.
I therefore hope that this Centre will be able to provide objective and easy to understand information about health risks for the public at large and in particular that it will be operational as soon as possible.
We must not delay but work to see that it is set up.
In this regard, everyone must show a sense of responsibility, at all costs avoidingÂ âÂ and this is perhaps where I differ slightly from the rapporteurÂ â potential conflicts arising from interests associated with national representation, for example.
This centre is not in fact intended to replace the national authorities but to help them to network, obviously, with the competent Community agencies like the European Food Safety Authority, the European Drugs Agency and, of course, all the national authorities.
As regards the choice of headquarters, I hope it will be as operational as possible and that we will avoid fruitless arguments.
None of this, though, will do any good unless we apply our European research efforts to all these health questions.
As we are always saying in this ChamberÂ âÂ my fellow Member Mrs Roth-Behrendt said it just nowÂ â we would like the Member States to listen to us at last.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, recent developments in the health sector have shown that one Member State alone, even if it has all the necessary means, cannot efficiently address all the threats.
The transmission of epidemics is facilitated by movements of populations, environmental and social changes, globalisation and war.
The Community, alongside its obligations which derive from the Treaties, must also respond to citizens' concerns.
That is why the creation of a centre which will focus on prompt diagnosis and on evaluating and publicising existing and re-emerging risks to public health in a fast, flexible and efficient manner is long overdue.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will coordinate and reinforce the work of the European Commission, the Member States and the Network for Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases.
It will operate in cooperation with all the existing services involved in public health, such as the World Health Organisation and the European Food Safety Authority.
On behalf of my group, Mr President, and following recent developments â I refer to the previous debate which we had on bird flu â I should like to emphasise that we agree with the rapporteur's proposal to close the matter at first reading and for the centre to open in 2005, even if we are not entirely satisfied with the Council's positions.
However, I should like to thank the rapporteur for accepting my proposals to extend the scope of the regulation to other serious health threats and not just communicable diseases.
I should also like to thank him because he accepted the need for the repercussions of recent epidemics on both physical and mental health to be recorded and handled appropriately.
For funding, Commissioner, it is vital that the Centre have its own line in the budget and appropriations which will allow it to respond to its difficult mission.
Finally, I should like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur once again.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, as others have already said, a little under a year ago in this very place, when the SARS epidemic was at its height, we called for the creation of a European centre to deal with modern day epidemics; so far as its tasks were concerned, at any rate, it would be modelled on the Atlanta CDC.
Obviously this was something that needed to be done at European level, first and foremost because no fewer than 19 new emergent and fatal viruses have appeared since 1976, viruses that know no frontiers and move as fast as an aeroplane: Aids, the Ebola virus, the West Nile virus, SARS, to name but a few.
It is something that needs to be done at European level, too, because this is where Europeâs health must be defended whenever that can and must be done better here than at the other levels, be it local authorities, regions or states.
And that is clearly the case now, when we are having to combat these viruses that are transmissible to man.
The epidemic of atypical pneumonia has confirmed the courage of those researchers and doctors who have risked their lives to alert the international community, and even if Europe has escaped relatively unscathed in this case, we must remain vigilant.
SARS has not been wiped out and, as many have said this morning, other viruses are lying in wait for a new mutation that will make the leap to man, like bird flu.
That is why common sense, the relevance of the proposals made by our rapporteur, Mr BowisÂ âÂ whom I also want to thank warmly here â and the quality of the compromise reached with the Irish Presidency require that tomorrow we applaud the rapid creation of this European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
As I was saying, this organisation will have many precise and vital tasks: the ability to respond swiftly to a viral epidemic or one deliberately caused by a bioterrorist attack, information to the public on all the risks of contamination, greater international cooperation, chiefly with the WHO of course.
This centre will alsoÂ âÂ and I am not the first to say or reiterate it todayÂ â (and why not?) have to create a European network of laboratories and contribute to the search for vaccines for these diseases that are still resistant to antibiotics.
The marketing of an antiviral vaccine or antiviral drugs is always a race against the clock and sometimes takes decades.
That is why it is essential that we continue to invest as much in screening tests, I should say, as in inactivation technologies.
In this connection, I note Commissioner Byrneâs commitment âÂ as he said just nowÂ â to push the limits of the Treaty as far as he can in the matter.
Meanwhile, in the short term, in 2005 that is, the Europe of the 25 will have its Disease Prevention and Control Centre, and we must look beyond that very strong signal to the sign of a Europe of health that is advancing.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I would like to begin by complimenting MrÂ Bowis on the professionalism, determination and timeliness with which he concluded the drafting of this important report.
I also congratulate the rapporteur on his immense efforts in negotiations with the Council to reach an agreement at first reading.
I believe, in fact, that it is of the utmost importance that the Centre is operational as soon as possible in order to guarantee the health monitoring and the rapid alert system which must be provided by the Union in order adequately to tackle the challenges brought about by its imminent enlargement and by a globalised world which is increasingly unprotected against the spread of diseases still unknown to us: SARS in 2003 and the very recent bird flu are specific examples.
I therefore consider that 1Â January 2005 has to be the ultimate deadline for the launch of this Centre.
Another point that I would like to stress is the initial and refresher training for all health personnel in the Member States of the Union, and the Centre should be responsible for this.
Ready for the entrance of ten new countries, the Union should aim to provide all health systems with the instruments, means and knowledge to create an effective synergy between all Member States and, in that way, to guarantee the coherence of the Unionâs action proposed by the Centre.
I will conclude by mentioning that the ability to respond adequately to an international health threat depends, to a large extent, on pre-emptively adopting preparatory plans for rapid action, coordinated at European level.
The Centre should provide this essential service.
Â Â  Mr President, today is an important milestone because, after many years of debate and findings on the need to reinforce the Union's ability to take prompt, coordinated action on public health threats, we are finally discussing the setting up of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Over the last twenty years, there have been reports of thirty new infectious diseases, or variations on old diseases caused by mutating viruses, or even the re-emergence of old diseases such as tuberculosis, to give but one example.
All these crises in the public health sector, such as SARS and bird flu recently, have highlighted the weaknesses and gaps in existing structures.
I hope that the Centre, with its small but adequate scientific operating structure, will be able to plug these gaps efficiently.
However, if its work is to be satisfactory and efficient, it must be the central reference and coordination point for all the national surveillance centres and reference centres and laboratories of the Member States.
I should like to thank the rapporteur because not only did he accept the amendments which I proposed but, subsequently, in conjunction with them, two very important issues were approved and accepted which had not been included in the initial proposal.
The first concerns the development of the strategy of vaccinations, which are an extremely important weapon in combating the threat from infections diseases.
The second relates to the identification of topical public health issues and the promotion of the relevant, applied research, in order to reinforce our preventive capabilities and promote the efficiency of the coordinated action taken.
Mr President, I hope that we will also overcome these final hesitations and that the Centre will soon be up and running, even in its present, restricted form.
Â Â  â Thank you, Mr President; ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to avoid repeating what has already been said, and also to avoid taking a diversion into discussing communicable diseases such as influenza, viruses and so on.
Mr Bowis started his speech by saying that âhe who has health has hope, and he who has hope has everythingâ.
In that case, this morning, I feel very rich, for I have everything.
I have hope, and that is everything.
I have little more than that. I hope that the centre we are discussing today will very soon become operational.
Mrs GrossetÃªte gave a very clear description of what this centre will have to be able to do in order to be effective.
In essence, it will have to square the circle.
With relatively few people, based a long way away in the north of the European Union, in Sweden, it will have to maintain intensive contact with all the Member States; it will have to motivate their health ministries, spend money and build up information networks, at the same time as maintaining contact with the Commission and with Parliament.
Although this involves squaring a circle, I do have hope, and so, like Mr Bowis, I have everything.
I cannot do other than agree wholeheartedly with MrsÂ GrossetÃªte when she says that it is important that we do our work quickly, that it is important that we get things up and running.
It follows, though, that the people who work there will have to be highly independent, work in very unconventional ways and possess imagination and the ability to work on their own initiative.
By no means everyone can do these things.
Looking at a number of other authorities that we have set up over the past few years, I have to say that their success is not exactly self-evident.
Now there is the possibility of us coming to a different conclusion.
As my fellow-Members have spoken about this Centre in great detail, I have to say what I would have liked to have seen.
Hope, in my mind, is associated with aspiration.
Of course communicable diseases are important, and of course the fight against them is important in terms of protecting the citizens of this European Union of ours, but let us be clear-sighted about the fact that most people in the European Union do not die of communicable diseases; they die of cancer, of heart attacks, and of strokes.
How is it that it is a matter of chance whether you survive a heart attack, depending on whether you live in Berlin or in Madrid, or somewhere else?
How is it that best practice in the treatment of cancer cases is not as yet established and communicated in the European Union?
I regard that as an intolerable state of affairs.
I wish we had been more ambitious and had said that the least we need is to link up best practice within the European Union in order to fight the real diseases that we have to cope with at the moment.
Networking would have been within the competence of the European Union, and we could have afforded it.
We did not manage it the first time round, but I hope we will, at the second attempt, ensure that peopleâs recovery from serious illness is not a matter of chance and does not depend on whether they live in the North, the South, the heart of Germany or on its plains, or in some other part of the European Union.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, my colleague, John Bowis, never lets us down.
He not only nourishes our souls with the aphorism he chooses in each of his reports, but he also ensures that the report is clear, detailed and balanced.
Such is the case this time too.
The agency for communicable diseases will be an immensely important body in the Union as infectious diseases have proved to be a major safety risk.
With the enormous publicity they attract, they must be a significant factor in the insecurity the public feel.
Bird flu has been a conspicuous topic of discussion recently, and AIDS is still unbeaten, to say nothing of older communicable diseases such as tuberculosis.
Furthermore, the threat of bioterrorism is unfortunately a real one, as the anthrax letters we saw in 2001 showed.
Under the Treaties the EU has a clear obligation here, and there are functional reasons that reinforce it: joint action in the preservation of public health and prevention of disease is more effective.
For that reason, the aim to start the work of the agency promptly next year is absolutely the right one, and the report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is firmly in favour of this aim.
The regulation under discussion thus intends to establish the agency promised for Sweden in the package agreed at the European Council in December.
I would hope the farce over the multiannual aspect of the decision on the package will later on mean there will be an amendment to the decision-making process; although the decision to establish the new agency is obviously governed by the requirement of consensus in the Council, such a detail as its geographical location should be decided by a majority.
As far as the balance of competences of the Union and the Member States is concerned, only the former system has importance.
The latter only gives rise to national chauvinism, and that should be curbed where possible by revising the decision-making structures.
Â Â  Mr President, the creation of a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has never been so important.
The recent SARS outbreak, the current threat of a biological terrorist attack and even the current Asian bird flu crisis illustrate the threat from disease in the global village that we live in today.
The threat to Europe's health from the rapid spread of disease is real and present.
Every year 1.4 billion passengers fly on an international trip.
Every one of them could pose a threat to global health security.
If they were found to be carrying a new strain of influenza or SARS they could within a few hours unwittingly put the lives of millions at risk.
Global warming threatens even Britain with diseases such as malaria, while diseases such as TB are already returning.
The correct response is not to turn our backs on the benefits of globalisation â we should not give up the opportunities presented by increases in trade and travel because of biological threats any more than for reasons of terrorism â but we need coordinated action.
In today's world no one country can afford to go it alone.
That is why Labour MEPs so firmly back these proposals for a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
When it comes to tackling disease, Europe works.
The European Commission was able to ban chicken imports from countries affected by the new strain of bird flu with immediate effect.
Without the EU, it would have required an enormous effort to coordinate the actions of all 15 â and soon 25 â Member States.
We need to strengthen that coordination and not weaken it through isolation.
So I am pleased that Tory MEPs will also back this plan today.
However, I wonder how they can square that with their own hostility to Europe and their policy of attacking the EU at every turn.
The centre will contribute to the improvement and strengthening of the prevention and monitoring of human diseases in the EU.
Its technical work and research capabilities will be an asset, as will the work with the WHO.
I agree that accessibility to information for the public is vital, and that is why the centre should have its own website to communicate its work and to publish its opinions.
This is one of the EU's success stories, and we should be celebrating its creation.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to echo the thanks expressed to the rapporteur, MrÂ Bowis.
He really did have a very difficult brief, for initially it was not clear at all that our proposal would meet with general approval; the German Federal Government, for example, was very sceptical at first.
Mrs Stihler may like to note that it was, in this respect, more Eurosceptic than the British Conservatives.
Mr Bowis has managed to handle such a controversial topic in such a way that we are on the verge of reaching agreement, and that it really is possible to bring this matter to a conclusion at first reading and before enlargement.
I think it was and is inconsistent for the European Union to have very strong competences when it comes to dealing with the diseases of animals, and to be able to take direct action, but that the same is not the case as regards the combating of diseases that affect human beings, and that, when human health is endangered, the first thing said is the magic word âsubsidiarityâ.
I am all in favour of subsidiarity; I am not in favour of a European super-authority, nor of total harmonisation of health care provision, but this is where European action is right, as we saw from the many examples given in this morningâs debate on avian influenza.
Whilst we have to use the Member Statesâ competences, this is something we have to bring together at the European level.
I think it right that we should take a pragmatic approach, by starting with communicable diseases â which are the most urgent problem at the moment â and then see where we go from there.
I also think what Mr Trakatellis said was very important, namely that joint debate and the development of vaccination policies must be priorities.
My final comment is addressed to the Council, represented here not by ministers but by officials.
Many Members of this House have made reference to bio-terrorism.
Over three months ago, I addressed a question on this issue to the Council, which it should, in the normal course of events, have answered after six weeks.
I am still awaiting a reply.
Bio-terrorism is too important an issue for us to allow ourselves such delays.
Â Â  . Mr President, this interesting debate highlights the urgency and importance of this proposal.
The political pressure to have the centre set up and running as soon as possible reflects the needs and concerns of European citizens.
For the Europe of today, where millions of people cross national borders every day, we need to be in a position to take rapid, coordinated action at EU level to best protect the health of our citizens.
This is precisely what the centre aims to achieve.
By pooling our scientific expertise and reinforcing our rapid alert systems, the ECDC will allow better preparation and swifter and more effective responses to disease outbreaks.
In summing up this morning's debate, I would like to focus on three central issues in the proposal which have been key areas of concern: the mission and the tasks of the centre; the possible extension of its sphere of operation; and the composition of the management board.
There is broad agreement between the institutions on the initial scope of the centre.
We all agree that it should start with communicable diseases and be able to respond to cases of unexpected outbreaks of unknown origin.
The Council and Parliament share the view that there needs to be an external evaluation to assess the feasibility of extending the scope based on the performance and impact of the centre, as resources permit.
Clearly, the budget for the centre will dictate its expansion, and beyond 2006 this has to be decided within the new financial perspectives.
To enable the centre to start, and for it to make an impact, the Commission is prepared to accept this approach, but it means that when the question of the need to extend its remit arises we should â and would â expect Parliament and the Council to address such a proposal rapidly, under the codecision procedure.
As regards the organisational aspects of the centre, the proposal provides for responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the centre to be granted to the director.
The advisory forum is the place for the director to seek advice from his or her peers â and the forum would ensure the shared ownership of this venture with the Member States.
The Commission can accept the extension of the membership of the advisory forum to stakeholders such as non-governmental organisations and academics.
It will be an advantage for the director to have broader views when developing the operation of the centre.
The management board should steer policy and make decisions.
The Commissionâs proposal balances this dual responsibility in a way which we consider to be the most efficient and transparent.
This approach is based on the principles defined in the Commission communication on the governance of European Agencies.
In a resolution adopted last month, Parliament welcomed this communication, recognising the need to limit the size of the boards of the agencies.
The Commission wants to follow a consistent approach on this matter, as currently each agency seems to follow a different path.
I now note that the Council and Parliament have reached agreement on a board for the ECDC to consist of one representative per Member State, three from the Commission and two from Parliament.
The Commission considers that a board of 30 members is unwieldy and may hamper the decision-making process.
Although, given the competences involved and being exercised here, I agree with the rapporteur that a good case can be made for one member per Member State being on the board.
The Commission notes, however, the terms of the compromise supported by Council and Parliament and is therefore willing, despite our concerns, to go along with this compromise, given the importance that it attaches to the rapid establishment of the centre.
The Commission notes that the evaluation provided for in Article 31 of the regulation will cover the working practises of the centre, including the composition and functioning of the management board.
A full listing of the Commissionâs position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament(1).
In short, this states that the Commission accepts all amendments that are part of the compromise package as set out by the rapporteur.
I also join with the rapporteur in urging that amendments the package should not â and cannot â be accepted by the Commission.
I conclude by thanking the rapporteur and Parliament.
When I formulated this idea in my mind some years ago, I not only got the support that I would expect from my own services, but also very strong support from Parliament.
We should be proud of ourselves today.
By voting tomorrow on this issue we are reacting in a timely way in circumstances where we see communicable diseases on a global basis.
We have discussed it in the last debate here in Parliament.
We can proudly say to our citizens that we are responding well and quickly to their needs in relation to issues associated with communicable disease.
Sometimes we can be unduly pessimistic and critical of ourselves.
This is one occasion where we can stand up and say that we have done our work well and quickly, we have responded to the needs, and we can look our citizens in the eye and tell them that we have done our work well.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (Î5-0022/2004) by Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the own-initiative report on agricultural incomes is to help us review the implementation of the European agricultural model based on multifunctionality and the competitiveness of farms.
Incomes are in fact the barometer of the viability of farms.
Without sufficient incomes, farmers disappear and production moves away from the most fragile areas.
But if farmers are eliminated and concentration accelerates, we risk moving away from the European model we advocate, which involves the presence of farmers on all territories.
The analysis of incomes is therefore of obvious interest.
The relevant findings for the period 1995 to 2002 are as follows.
Firstly, the average agricultural income in the Europe of the 15 rose by 7% with large national variations, for example +32% in Portugal and â30% in the United Kingdom.
Secondly, public support accounts for more than 50% of this figure, but its distribution is debatable.
Twenty percent of farms receive 73% of aids for 59% of areas and 25% of employment.
Thirdly, producer prices fell by 1.1% while consumer prices rose 11%.
Fourthly, the slight improvement in this average income comes from the fact that the cake is shared between fewer and fewer farmers since the number of people working in this sector fell by 15.7% over the same period.
We must therefore ask ourselves whether the phenomenon can be allowed to continue without jeopardising our European model of agriculture.
This question is all the more serious because the application of multifunctionality is going to result in higher production costs even though public support is set to decline for farmers of the 15 Member States between now and 2013, chiefly because of the rise in Community support for agriculture in the ten new countries.
The European Union cannot remain indifferent to this situation.
We need to give some thought to the direction of future changes to the CAP to make it consistent with the two objectives of multifunctionality and competitiveness which we have set for farms.
From this point of view, the market must tend to reward the act of agricultural production.
As for public support, it must increasingly go to pay for the non-market services that agriculture performs for society.
The most recent CAP reform includes positive steps forward in this direction, especially with the conditionality and modulation of aids.
With decoupling, though, the CAP is establishing historically acquired rights that will have the effect of preventing remuneration for multifunctionality for all farms on all territories.
It is therefore absolutely essential to get away from these historical rights, something that will be possible gradually if modulation is substantially increased.
On the matter of market-generated income, I recommend restoring priority to pricing and market policy, taking the view that progress in product quality, necessary as it is, is only the passport giving access to those markets.
Several directions will therefore have to be opened up or reaffirmed so that the market can play its part without prices collapsing and taking incomes with them.
I will quote them: âflexible, production-based regulation of supply; the introduction of production-based safety nets; Community encouragement of sectoral policies for a better distribution of added value; our imports should be subject to the same standards as those of the Unionâ.
From this report, Members will all understand that there is still a tremendous amount to be done if the CAP is to achieve its objectives.
Our European agricultural model was legitimate in its conception.
It must become so in reality again.
That is why I regret the Commissionerâs absence from this debate all the more.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with warm thanks to MrÂ Garot for his own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union.
Speaking personally, I want to thank him especially for his frank and constructive cooperation in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
The Member States are currently engaged in implementing as part of their national policies the Luxembourg Conclusions on reform of the common agricultural policy.
Our starting point is that, in accordance with the Brussels Conclusions, the agricultural budget was capped.
The funds available must from now on be shared out among farmers in the EU of 25 rather than only in the EU of 15, and moreover, must in future be more discriminatingly applied than was previously the case, so that funds from the first pillar â direct payments, in other words â are to be moved to the second pillar, to rural development.
This is something that all of us in this House have always demanded.
Mr Garotâs report represents an outstanding assessment of the situation in that it analyses, in the light of enlargement, the factors on which agricultural incomes are currently dependent.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes the view that there are fundamental objectives to be achieved by means of the common agricultural policy.
They are as follows: firstly, to guarantee a fair level of income for those who work in agriculture. Secondly, by stabilising incomes, it must maintain agricultural activity throughout the whole area of the European Union.
It is for that reason that we believe, firstly, that the retention of the level of public subsidies for agriculture is justified, in particular to reward the multifunctional services it renders to society and to ensure that farmers remain present in all regions, as is provided for in the first pillar.
Secondly, we believe there is justification for the Community Budget guaranteeing employment, especially in less-favoured rural areas, and for farms to be rewarded for adaptation to societyâs new demands, which is what we understand by the second pillar.
In the hope of turning these principles into reality, we in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have tabled, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, a number of amendments, to which â as I mentioned at the start of my speech â we have been able to secure the rapporteurâs agreement.
For example, our specific proposals include the introduction of a system of disaster payments, which is already the practice in other great agricultural nations.
We specifically demand that a large proportion of the funds available remain, insofar as possible, in the hands of farmers.
It necessarily follows that we are in favour of the norm laid down in the Luxembourg Conclusions â in other words, the single farm payment â being applied when they are implemented at national level.
Our final demand is that no major distortions of competition within European agriculture should be allowed to result in the event of the exemption under Article 58 being chosen.
Let me conclude by saying that we have to bear in mind that competitiveness and multifunctionality must, again and again, be subjected to scrutiny and assessed, and that due regard must be paid to development.
Without an adequate income, no farmer will be able to perform his tasks in producing food and in caring for the Garden of Eden that we still â thank heaven! â have here in Europe, in a professional manner and in line with good practice.
We must therefore take the funds available in the agriculture budget and apply them, in a Europe of 25 Member States, in such a way that the competitiveness of working farmers in the market is supported.
We must never lose sight of the need to guarantee young farmers a start and to offer them good prospects.
These, more than ever, are the challenges we must take up.
The common agricultural policy adopted in June 2003 opens up interesting ways of doing this.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Garot on his excellent report; much of what has already been said I do not need to repeat.
Discussion of farmersâ incomes is long overdue; the fact is that they are far too low.
The various underlying causes I will illustrate by reference to the example of Germany.
One of the most important is that farmers are still unable to command on the market the prices that they need for their products and which would be quite justified.
The causes of this state of affairs can be traced back to the fierce competition between the six or seven food concerns that dominate the market, a turf war fought out to the detriment of farmers.
These concerns see farmers as nothing more than suppliers of cheap raw materials.
I might add that the same is true of many dairies.
To that can be added the fact that consumers, that is, most people, do not know anything about this and, indeed to some extent, do not want to.
The fact is that high-quality food, for example that produced in accordance with high standards of protection for the environment and for animals, comes at a price; it is not to be had for free.
Even the , the German Farmersâ Union, which represents the interests of most German farmers, has had its hand in this, for â in my opinion â it has for far too long not merely blocked or delayed important reforms, but has positively prevented some of them.
Its unending lamentations, which have been its stock-in-trade for decades, about how badly-off farmers have now virtually made the public deaf to farmersâ legitimate demands and needs.
Let me add that many farmers tell me these things at events once the âs functionaries have gone.
The reforms adopted over the past year are thus all the more important to farmers; they should have been adopted years ago.
The decoupling of payments from production was long overdue.
Here, in this House, we have done our bit; it is now for the Member States to properly implement these conclusions and to do away once and for all with the unfair treatment of different types of farming, such as, for example, dairy cattle and arable farming.
Let me quote you some figures.
Up to now, 20% of the farms with 59% of the land and 25% of the jobs have been getting 73% of the direct grants, and, let it be noted, relatively little was to be seen or heard of those who are now so loudly indignant about the injustice that is allegedly going to result from the agricultural reform.
We Social Democrats support compensatory payments for farmers because they have to be rewarded appropriately for the services that they perform in the general interest within a multifunctional system and which the prices paid do not cover.
This must, however, be done in accordance with transparent, open, and comprehensible rules.
None of us can evade the question of what high-quality foodstuffs are actually worth to us.
For the engine in our cars we buy only the best and most expensive petrol, but when it comes to the body, which is our own engine, without which we cannot exist and which is meant to work for at least 100 years without spluttering, most of us are completely indifferent to what we put into it.
All that matters is that there should be a lot of it and that it should be cheap.
That is not on.
Even though this may be wishful thinking at present, we do believe that it would be for the best if farmers were to be able to have a good living from the prices paid for their produce.
That is what we Social Democrats are working for.
I thank you.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Garot for a valuable contribution to the debate on farmersâ incomes.
MrÂ Garot is a committed politician on agricultural matters.
He is well informed and takes a positive view of agriculture.
I have to say that, as a Swede, I am rather envious.
We could have done with a few Social Democrats of that kind in the Swedish Government.
It would have been very useful for us.
Allow me to address a number of points I think are important.
MrÂ Garot states that agriculture should be carried on throughout the whole area of the EU.
That is very important to remember, especially when the parts of the EU concerned are those such as I myself come from, that is to say Sweden or Finland.
He also addresses another very important matter, namely the difference between cost development and price development.
A discrepancy arises that can be resolved with the help of rationalisation, but not to an unlimited degree.
It must be ensured that this discrepancy does not become too large.
We have seen how it has increased in my own country following the latterâs accession to the EU.
It is now far too large, and production is in decline.
We have defended the agricultural reform.
That has been decided upon.
It is not, however, good for it to be implemented at different speeds in different countries.
This is important, something that is also pointed out in the report.
When the agricultural reform is implemented at different speeds, there is a danger of making further changes to competitiveness or of creating an uneven playing field in the different countries where competitiveness is concerned.
It is now a matter of extreme urgency to do as much as is humanly possible in terms of environmental aid and aid for rural development.
As MrÂ Garot says in his report, there is a danger of this being undermined if the Member States are to cofinance it.
This is an area I am concerned about.
I must, however, address a number of aspects of this report that I do not think are as good. It is rather anti-reform, if I may say so.
The desire is to keep as many people as possible in agriculture.
I do not believe that this is realistic in the long term.
I do not believe it is realistic to retain far-reaching market regulation or prices set by politicians, nor to have a regulated supply of the type we have involving quotas.
We must seek to reduce border protection in order to cope with world trade.
Now that we are carrying out this disengagement, it would have been better if we could have done it completely from the beginning and, in fact, throughout the EU in the one go.
As a result of these considerations, I and many others in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will unfortunately abstain from voting.
We cannot vote in favour of this report but, in view of all the plus points I mentioned at the beginning, we cannot vote against it, either.
We shall no doubt abstain from voting in the final vote, because it is only a single vote.
Â Â  â Mr President, underlying the whole report is the fundamental idea that people in the European Community â and in all its regions, widely divergent in their structure though they are â have a job and hence an entitlement to an income commensurate with what they produce.
If I am right in my understanding of what the rapporteur said, then it is only if that is the case that one can talk of there being such a thing as social European Union.
The report rightly points out that yields vary widely across the European Union, even though Europeâs climate and other natural conditions are favourable to almost all crops.
The principal causes of the changes in costs over recent years are well-known.
My expectation of future reforms is that the Commission will take more account of their ability to influence the cost structure.
I also expect openings to be created for more investments, and I hope that a greater diversity of programmes will result in simplification and clarity of vision.
As in other reports, reference is made to the fact that direct payments to farmers, being factored in as sources of income, cannot simply be cut out without the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, and I believe, with regret, that there are those who want that to happen.
More and more people in Europeâs rural areas are doing more than one job, and so every euro that is not spent on structural planning and development in rural areas â I am talking in terms of billions â is always associated with the loss of income and jobs.
This makes it important to assess whether the work and the way the European agricultural model is applied tend towards appropriate rewards for European farmers, and what is meant by that.
About this, the rapporteur is rather reticent, the reason being that there is a lack of data.
My expectation, though, is that, as the market organisation develops further, we will be able to answer the question of what an appropriate income for farmers actually is.
In Germany, farmersâ incomes have dropped dramatically, by 6.1% and 19.8% in the last two financial years.
That amounts to an overall economic crash.
This bleak state of affairs has come about for two reasons; one is flooding and drought, but â as has already been said in this debate â it has far more to do with the price war in food retailing, in which farmers are generally on the losing side.
How are the location of production, and hence employment and income, affected by the decoupling of payments and their being linked to environmental requirements â an attempt at riding two horses, in giving the market a greater role in determining farmersâ incomes while rewarding with public funds services that are no longer in demand?
Will it ensure extensive agricultural land use?
Far from it; it is far more to be feared that it will lead to the onset of predatory competition and that we will be facing structural changes that will leave local areas worse off.
That is something I do not want.
Â Â  â Mr President, Mr Garot has produced a good report, and it is to his credit that he has brought the price of produce back to the centre of the debate.
Decoupling has facilitated the removal of the twofold price distortions brought about by payments, which tended to keep prices down and thus gave customers the opportunity to get their hands on cheap raw materials, in that the linking of grants to production â which was itself unequally distributed â meant that between 75% and 80% of this State aid was claimed by between 20% and 25% of farms.
Now, even though decoupling is in place â and it was the right step to take â it does not automatically follow that different power relations have come into being; rather, what matters is that prices should be actively negotiated.
This is not just about the distributing chains, but also about the cooperatives, some of them managed by farmers, which pursue their price and market policies in decision-making bodies, and it is about better payments for raw materials â agricultural raw materials.
You have also made it clear that we now have to talk about modulation and about different ways of distributing these funds.
Modulation must link the practice of some large and rationalised farming enterprises receiving from the state a premium amounting to EURÂ 100Â 000 per worker, to the number of employees and also to the type of production.
From this, quality criteria must be developed, in order that state funds do not contribute to the accumulation of assets and give the wrong stimuli to production, but instead, enable the continuation of rural production methods in Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, I join in congratulating Mr Garot on his report.
The recent hearing on farm income must surely have alerted all of us to the challenges facing EU farmers.
It is easy to understand their frustration as they see their purchasing power eroded and their general quality of life under attack on many fronts.
Mr Garot succeeds in his report in focusing our minds on the basics of the common agricultural policy and what it is all about.
We have a treaty basis for ensuring that farmers and their families are guaranteed a decent standard of living.
We also have an obligation to maintain the European model of agriculture, which is based on family farm units and keeping a vibrant rural community.
Those who seek to undermine the common agricultural policy sometimes forget these basics.
They forget that there is a socio-economic dimension to farming and that it is not just a business like any other sector.
Mr Garot presents these facts very clearly.
The fact that between 1995 and 2002 farm incomes in the European Union rose by an average of 7% highlights the very large disparities between countries, between crops and between producers.
It also hides the fact that during the same period income levels have been maintained largely by a fall of 15.7% in the number of farms within the European Union.
Here, surely, lies one of the most serious challenges facing the continuity of European agriculture.
Frequently farms have been able to revert to short-term measures such as foregoing necessary capital investment on farms.
There has also been huge growth in part-time farming and off-farm employment.
When we compare agricultural to industrial or service wages we can see that there is a continuing widening gap.
In conclusion, this report highlights important challenges that we legislators and policy-makers have to face up to.
It is now essential that agricultural policy should still be used to protect and improve the incomes of as many householders as possible within the European Union and to guarantee a secure future for our farmers and their families.
Â Â  â Mr President, this report is a good initiative and I congratulate its author.
In fact, it brings us up to date on agricultural incomes just before the application of CAP reform and the enlargement of the European Union.
It will therefore serve us as a reference document in a few yearsâ time, when, I hope, we shall be meeting together in this Assembly again to consider the consequences of the reform for our farmersâ incomes.
Will the accession of ten new countries that are themselves highly agricultural and the alignment of European agricultural prices with world prices bring us a better future?
I do not want to be a prophet of doom, but unfortunately I doubt it.
This report underlines some important facts, in particular the 7% increase in European agricultural incomes over seven years, which hides many disparities between regions and sectors and is rooted in a degradation of the European agricultural model, as the rapporteur pointed out in his address.
In ten years, one quarter of Europeâs farmers have vanished, farms have become larger and production has intensified.
Some French small farmers have such low incomes that the French Government gives them access to the âintegration minimum incomeâ, a system of social support reserved for the most deprived.
I come from the Vosges, a rural not far from here.
Between 1988 and 2000, the number of farms there fell by 40% and the number of dairy farms halved.
At the same time, farm areas increased 65% and the number of cows per farm 30%.
This concentration in agriculture is damaging to the European family agricultural model, as the Parliamentary report very clearly shows.
Decoupled aids are not a viable solution for the farmer.
According to the Nantes INRA study, in 2008 partial decoupling could result in as much as a 32% drop in simulated income for an intensive dairy farmer because the decoupled aids will not compensate for the 20% fall in the price of milk envisaged for 2006-2008.
The drafting of this report gave an opportunity to consult a number of experts on the subject.
They all underlined this intrinsic paradox of the latest common agricultural policy reform.
How indeed can we think of pushing up costs through multifunctionality while at the same time wanting agricultural prices to fall by bringing European prices into line with world prices?
What solution is there for farmers trapped between rising production costs and falling prices.
No expert has been able to tell us that.
Finally, the report explains a risk that is of particular concern to me, namely the eco-conditionality of aids for small farms, since their income is going to depend increasingly on aids, especially with decoupling.
A small farmer who failed to comply with one of a very large number of directives, including the Loiseau directive, would have his aids, and therefore his income, cut off.
The incomes of farmers who are already fragile and who have little capacity to invest will be reduced.
This report puts its finger on the painful points of the common agricultural policy and its latest reform, and I can only welcome these facts being brought out into the open.
However, some parts of the report remain ambiguous and I cannot support them.
I cannot ask the Member States, and I quote: âto ensure that partial decoupling is actually appliedâ, because I have always opposed any form of decoupling, be it partial or total.
Likewise, I am not in favour of, and I quote: âensuring a readjustment in favour of the second pillarâ.
The first pillar, which allows farmers to maintain a lucrative price for agricultural products, cannot be weakened in order to subsidise the second.
This Parliamentary report has the merit of clearly presenting some important and sometimes painful realities of the common agricultural policy.
However, it includes an ambiguous support for key aspects of the CAP reform, against which my group has spoken out, and that is why I will find it very difficult to support it.
Â Â  â Mr President â unfortunately I cannot add âCommissioner Fischlerâ, as his seat is empty â ladies and gentlemen, the interest of this own-initiative report on trends in agricultural incomes in the European Union lies more in the questions it raises than in the answers it seeks to give.
Its starting point is beyond dispute.
We can use whatever fine words we want about the European agricultural model â multifunctional, kind to the environment and animal welfare, guaranteeing food safety, covering all our territories â but if the players are not there to implement it, that is farmers with enough income to do what they have to do, to live from their activities and attract the next generation, then the model will remain a utopia, a mirage, semantics, a lie.
The problem the report describes is indeed the one we are going to have to face in the years ahead.
If the average income of the Community farmer â an abstract and therefore artificial statistical concept â has not already collapsed further despite the policy of systematically cutting prices, it has been at the price of very severe restructurings characterised by a dramatic reduction in the number of people working on farms and a very rapid increase in the concentration of farms together with the intensification of production.
But if we want to maintain the greatest number of farmers on all the territory of the Member States in future, we will no longer be able to have this trilogy of disappearance, concentration and intensiveness.
Europe can no longer count on those types of adjustment to maintain its agriculture and develop its agricultural model.
Neither can it count any longer on an increase in the agricultural budget to cover the extra costs that the new standards concerning multifunctionality demanded by society will entail.
Quite the contrary, that budget is set to decline over the next ten years, with no prospect of a reversal of that trend in sight.
Unlike the rapporteur, I believe that the June 2003 reform, which was inspired primarily by non-agricultural considerations âÂ the desire to reach a general agreement in the WTO and a desire to make budget savings â offers little prospect of a solution to the problem.
On the contrary, with decoupling it is more likely to accelerate concentration, intensification and land speculation, all trends which will have the effect of deterring young people from taking up farming and accelerating the monetarisation of the sector.
If we want to avoid all this, we must redefine the concept of Community preferences and we cannot put off doing so indefinitely.
When there are emergent countries with structural production conditions that utterly destroy the competitiveness of European agriculture, it is irresponsible to believe that only a policy of product quality or niche products will produce sufficient incomes to enable our farmers to continue occupying all our territories while providing society with the products and production conditions it wants.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Garot on his report.
He is one of the Members of this House whom I hold in very high esteem.
However, if I read his report, my criticism in this case is that the Socialist dimension is far too prevailing.
Too much attention has been paid to the premiums while too little consideration has been given to the competitiveness of agriculture and horticulture.
It is generally the case that the European debate on incomes in agriculture is too much dominated by the question as to the level of premiums rather than what the market problems are.
Starting with the premiums, the Netherlands receives far too small a share of the European budget.
The Netherlands accounts for 7% of agricultural production in the European Union, yet only receives 2.1% of the agricultural budget and 1% of the rural development budget.
This is out of all proportion.
Of course, there is a reason for this.
The negotiations in Berlin in 1999 were conducted by Mr Kok and Mr Zalm, neither of whom had any affinity with agriculture and horticulture.
That is not only the reason why the Dutch countryside does not receive what it is entitled to; it is also the real reason why the Dutch net contribution to the European Union is so high.
This excessive contribution is best remedied by giving the Netherlands a substantially higher amount for agriculture and rural development.
There is also another point that is given too little consideration in the development of agricultural incomes, namely the position of the so-called free products.
The high European requirements in terms of environment, food safety and animal welfare have a knock-on effect on the cost price of â for example â meat, vegetables and potatoes, and put European agriculture at a worldwide disadvantage in terms of cost price.
That is the real reason underlying a number of crises, including the current one in pig farming.
My proposal is that in the case of new European legislative proposals affecting agriculture and horticulture, an income assessment should be done in order to check the true repercussions of this legislation on the workers in the fields.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to join in the general praise for Mr Garotâs wonderful report, which is as timely as it is necessary.
Mr President, Mr Garotâs rigorous analysis provides data confirming our concern at the danger posed by the reform of the CAP if its negative impact on agricultural incomes is not neutralised.
I very much regret the seriously misguided and inconsistent way in which certain Members, on the one hand, heap great praise on the report because it is good, but, on the other, say that they are not going to support it.
Mr President, the fundamental objective of the CAP is to guarantee a fair standard of living for the agricultural population.
Europe needs multifunctional and viable agriculture, but this means that we must protect the European model, create a system of crisis management, guarantee employment and increase the resources dedicated to the second pillar.
All of this is proposed by Mr Garot in this wonderful report.
Especially worthy of note are paragraph 7 â which the Commission should apply â which points out that the costs of production are tending to increase while aid is tending to decrease; paragraph 17, which relates to guaranteeing employment; and paragraphs 24 and 25 relating to the second pillar.
Finally, Mr President, the Commission must take account of the view expressed by Mr Garot in paragraph 25 on cofinancing, as a demand which may hinder rural development, with a view to making this cofinancing requirement more flexible in the reform in the CAP.
Â Â  Mr President, the rapporteur has made a really honourable attempt to embellish the common agricultural policy and its tragic consequences for farmers, but without managing to do anything more than repeat the set of arguments which the Commission has also cited from time to time in order to justify its unjustifiable CAP and its reforms.
Arguments which have proven to be thoroughly disorientating and hypocritical in the past are being shamelessly used again today, precisely in order to continue the same anti-farming policy.
What social and multifunctional agriculture is the rapporteur talking about when, during the 1995-2002 reference period, the workforce fell by 15.7%, with a commensurate reduction in agricultural households?
Behind it, this number conceals the abandonment of entire areas, especially in the Mediterranean countries, it conceals the increase in unemployment and migration to the towns, with all the consequential problems and with incalculable consequences for environmental protection, for which the European Commission would supposedly do anything.
He notes that agricultural incomes rose by an average of 7% in the European Union as a whole from 1995 to 2002.
However, this increase is less than 1% per annum, meaning that it is much less than the average increase in GDP in the European Union over the same period and it concerns an economic sector in whose products the European Union has a deficit.
In addition, no analysis is made so that we can see which holdings reported an increase in income, how many small and medium-sized farming households had a reduction and how many went bankrupt.
That is because the technique of averages in a differentiated social stratum such as agriculture is the best means of muddying the waters, of hiding acute class divisions and of concealing important social problems.
So exactly what social and multifunctional agriculture are we talking about when the differential between agricultural incomes per worker is over 1 to 50 and when 20% of large holdings take up 73% of direct Community aid?
The unfair distribution in Community subsidies at the expense of small- and medium-sized farmers has proven over time the capitalist nature of the CAP, the objective of which is to concentrate land and production in a few capitalist farm holdings.
Of course, wiping out small- and medium-sized farming and concentrating land will be completed by the new reform of the CAP, which is even worse than all the previous reforms.
Let me quote the typical example of the decoupling of subsidies from production, which the rapporteur welcomes, together with the conversion of intervention schemes to simple insurance networks and the exit of farmers from the market to become businessmen, to quote Mr Fischler.
Reality is not consistent with the contradictory and prefabricated conclusions of the report.
It is so gloomy that it leaves no room even for legerdemain or for further misleading farmers.
The common agricultural policy of extermination will be fought against by the small- and medium-sized farmers in my country and the European Union, who are realising more and more every day that overturning it is the only way they will survive and âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the work of the rapporteur in bringing this own-initiative report together.
It strikes at the heart of the central question facing European agriculture at this crucial juncture, namely, whether the agricultural community can expect to make a fair living from its activities.
One of the report's most illustrative points is that, while agricultural incomes rose by 7% in the EU between 1995 and 2002, this was at the expense of a 15% decrease in the number of farms.
That means that small farms have been swallowed up by increasingly large farms and production that has become more intensive.
With consumers demanding more information on the means by which their food is produced, this trend is one that must be addressed.
Large farms, selling bulk commodities, with pollution risks and herd health problems represent a future that we must work to avoid.
Whilst the figures may continue to suggest that incomes are growing, they hide the impact of increasingly intensive farming methods.
This must be borne in mind each time the European Parliament â and more importantly, the European Commission â consider direct aid via the CAP.
There is something seriously amiss with a system that continues to pump money into the pockets of some of Europe's largest and wealthiest landowners through lavish subsidies.
The Duke of Westminster â Britain's richest man â receives EUR 1300 per day in agricultural subsidies, while small Welsh farmers are struggling to get by with as little as EUR 7000 per year.
Â Â  â Mr President, nature conservation, farms as family businesses, employment, safe food â these are all objectives to which we are trying to aspire with European agricultural policy.
In his report, Mr Garot was right to point out that, in the final analysis, all these fine words are not worth the paper they are written on if we do not guarantee a reasonable income for the farmer.
It is not easy to interpret the statistical income data.
Mr Garot concludes that over the past few years, agricultural incomes in the Union have risen by 7%.
I have checked with the researchers who supplied these figures whether this is correct.
They state that these figures do not take into consideration production levies, interest payable, rent and labour costs.
If one looks at the actual difference in the farmer's wallet, then between 1995 and 2001, agricultural incomes in the EU did not rise, but fell, by 6%.
This resolution argues in favour of maintaining price and market policy and associated production control, with good reason.
In this respect, extending supply does not, by definition, benefit agricultural incomes.
If the milk quota is extended, the milk price continues to drop and the incomes of dairy farmers are put under pressure unnecessarily.
The WTO Summit in Cancun has failed.
With it, a far-reaching liberalisation of trade in agricultural products has been put on hold for the time being.
Agriculture is not like a bicycle shop where demand from the market can simply be accommodated.
Protection remains necessary.
In this respect, developing countries are better served by preferential market access to the EU than unbridled free trade.
It is unfortunate that a Socialist, of all people, who, by nature, believes in a society that can be moulded to one's will, should accept the liberalisation of agriculture as a natural phenomenon.
The rapporteur fears that agricultural support from the EU is losing its legitimacy in the eyes of the WTO.
I do not share this fear, because as in football, it is not only about technique, but also about strategy.
Otherwise, the French would never be able to take a game off the Dutch team!
I regret that in this resolution, Mr Garot is already working towards another reform: the reform of decoupled support to a form of rural policy.
However much I applaud rural policy, it cannot replace European agricultural policy.
Mr Garot is wrong to seize upon European agriculture's multifunctionality as an excuse for a new form of structural policy, one that has to pump money into an area on the basis of acreage instead of production value.
If we want to sustain the family business and reject untrammelled economies of scale, our policy has to be in keeping with this.
This entails the capping of high company allowances and a systematic protection of small- and medium-size businesses.
This, at least, is something that will be of some use to the European farmer.
Â Â  Mr President, the agricultural sector of the European Union faces many problems.
Greek farmers in particular are anxious about their future.
They are anxious about whether to continue to farm their land or to join the queues of the unemployed in the towns.
However, we cannot hope for a strong Greece unless we safeguard strong regions.
And strong regions mean strong farmers.
We must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land; so that they have employment, prospects, a future, a productive horizon for their children.
Regions without farmers mean a country without a future.
Guaranteeing agricultural incomes at decent levels is not just an economic issue.
It is, at the same time, a huge social and moral issue.
We therefore need to follow an organised agricultural policy which will consistently and constantly lead to the strengthening of the agricultural sector.
It is necessary, now, without delay, for us to fight bureaucracy, to simplify procedures to integrate new farmers into Community initiatives and to encourage the development of organic products with less paperwork and more support, with cheap certification of organic products and with undivided advisory support for farmers from the agriculturalists and veterinarians of the Ministry of Agriculture.
We need to give Greek farmers the optimism which they lack today, the belief that their work has a future and that their future is close to their land, with prospects, with a serious income and with dignity.
â Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, do I take it that you are seeking the floor for a procedural motion?
Â Â  â Mr President, we have had an important debate on agricultural policy, but without Commissioner Fischler.
His absence has been the subject of criticism, and it is also regrettable.
The Commission is having a meeting on medium-term financial planning, and fairness requires that I, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, make it plain to the House that we think it important that Commissioner Fischler should be present at that meeting.
We do, though, regret that the two commitments have overlapped, it is something that we strenuously tried to avoid, but without success.
It is thus that we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of having to have this debate without Commissioner Fischler.
Â Â  â Thank you. Your comment will be passed on.
The debate on the Garot report will resume at 3 p.m.
We will now begin the vote, which, as you know, will be interrupted by a formal sitting.
Â Â  . â Ladies and gentlemen, although I am sure you do not think this regulation is important, I propose to explain to you why it is; it is intended to ensure that the Member States forward reliable data on their financial transactions to Eurostat every quarter.
This data is to include all forms of debt â in other words, not only all loans, but also general government debt.
Reliable statistics such as these are meant, among other things, to help the European Central Bank to draw up its quarterly financial accounts for the eurozone.
As I made clear at first reading in October, this regulation is overdue, not least because these essential items of data, which are now to be forwarded on a quarterly basis, are of decisive importance to the Stability and Growth Pact, on which is founded the stability of the euro â about which you have heard a certain amount said in recent months.
I had hoped that we could have spared ourselves a second reading, as we had obtained the Italian Presidencyâs agreement to some sensible amendments, which met with the overwhelming approval of this House at first reading.
The regulation could, then, have entered into force before the end of 2003, but that was not to be, mainly because a number of Member States discovered that they had not after all made sufficient preparations for the required data to be transferred so quickly.
That is in fact hard to comprehend, as one would have thought that the Member States would have an interest in knowing the state of their finances every quarter.
Nevertheless, we are willing to agree to this more flexible approach to forwarding in order to avoid the further delays that would result if we were to insist on a conciliation procedure.
That might well have suited those Member States that have difficulty keeping to the Stability Pact and therefore have an interest in drawing a veil over the actual level of their public debt.
As we do not want to do these Member States a favour, I propose that we adopt the Common Position.
Â Â  Thank you Mrs Lulling.
Thanks to you, the European Parliament is now well informed.
Under Rule 110a(4) of the Rules of Procedure, which you know by heart, you are entitled to two minutes.
â In view of the number of votes we still have to take,I think it reasonable to pause now that the initial votes have been taken.
The remaining votes will be taken at the end of the formal sitting.
(1)
Â Â  . Mr President, I have tabled Amendment No 8, which adds a new paragraph 4c, in the interests of achieving the widest possible consensus of a report that deserves support because it represents a new opening in our policy towards financial markets.
I wish to change a word that will give more flexibility to the report and make it acceptable to more colleagues.
I will read the amendment: 'Calls upon the Commission to undertake all necessary steps, including in particular a cost-benefit analysis of the effects on European capital markets, to assess the establishment of a competent European Registration '.
This word replaces 'authority'.
The rest remains unchanged.
This change gives the flexibility desired by certain colleagues and I look forward to their support.
Â Â  â Very well, MrÂ Katiforis.
Your proposal related therefore to Amendment No 8.
Firstly, we have two others to put to the vote.
When we arrive at Amendment No 8, I shall ask, in accordance with the procedure, if any Members are opposed to your oral amendment being taken into account.
I see that MrÂ Gollnisch is aching to say something.
If it is not genuinely about a procedural motion, I shall switch off his microphone immediately.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, if referring to the nature of the rules whereby our Assembly arranges to hear Heads of State speak is not a procedural motion, then I do not know what is.
In any case, I shall be brief.
I think that, of the foreign Heads of State received by our Parliament, many â beginning with Mr Bouteflika â have not, to say the least, been the representatives of completely democratic regimes âŠ
Â Â  â MrÂ Gollnisch, I had warned you.
I do not see to which rule of procedure you are referring.
This is not a procedural motion; it is a political remark, and you do not have the floor.
Â Â  . Updating and harmonising social security systems are crucial issues for the Member States and hence the need to support initiatives that will help them to achieve these aims.
The Social Protection Committee, which is intended to promote cooperation on social security policies between the Member States, the candidate countries and the Commission is one such initiative and therefore won my vote.
The committee must monitor the social security situation in the Member States and changes in this situation.
It must present reports, specifically on situations of poverty and social inclusion â deliver opinions, establish contacts and cooperate with the relevant bodies in this field.
I would stress that greater priority must be given to Parliamentâs role.
The committee should inform Parliament in an efficient way so that Parliament can follow up this issue and Parliamentâs position must be taken into account in all the activities of the Social Protection Committee.
Lastly, I would emphasise that the gender balance must be respected in the composition of the Committee Delegations.
Â Â  . This amendment on the Social Protection Committee, which was established by Council decision of 29 June 2000, is of a basically procedural nature.
It was brought about by the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, on 1Â February 2003, in particular by the new legal basis set out in ArticleÂ 144 thereof, with the Commission and Parliament having taken the opportunity to make some changes to the approach they had adopted previously.
One of the proposals that the EP has adopted and which I tabled in the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays âparticular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the EU Member States and in the accession countriesâ.
Proposals seeking to incorporate the gender dimension horizontally into the committeeâs duties, and to report on problems specifically affecting women were also adopted, particularly on the feminisation of poverty and the changes in family models.
I therefore believe it is important to establish indicators broken down by gender and to focus on the individual rather than on the household.
Â Â  . The Treaty of Nice provides for establishing a Social Protection Committee, with consultative status, to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between Member States and between these and the Commission.
A Social Protection Committee, with a similar status and aims, was established by Council decision of 29Â June 2002, and has been operational since that date.
The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural: to establish the committee in accordance with the new legal basis.
Nevertheless, we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation, of promoting the exchange of good practice and of establishing appropriate contacts with management and labour.
Equally to be welcomed is the call for an annual report to be drawn up on social protection and for this to be presented to the Council and to Parliament.
In this regard, we believe that an effective process of informing Parliament must be established to enable it regularly to monitor social protection issues, in particular those related to poverty.
For these reasons, the report won my vote.
Â Â  . As you know, the Treaty of Nice provides for establishing a Social Protection Committee, with consultative status, to promote cooperation in the field of social protection policies between Member States and between these and the Commission.
A Social Protection Committee, with a similar status and aims, was established by Council decision of 29Â June 2002, and has been operational since that date.
The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural: to establish the Council in accordance with the new legal basis.
Nevertheless, we must welcome the fact that this Council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation.
It will promote the exchange of good practice and establish appropriate contacts with management and labour.
It will also aim for a more structured engagement with NGOs and to pay particular attention to poverty-related issues.
I welcome the rapporteurâs proposal to call for a joint annual report to be drawn up and presented to the Council and the European Parliament.
This report must include a specific chapter containing Parliamentâs views on social protection issues.
An effective process of information shall be established to permit the European Parliament to follow matters up on a regular basis, and the candidate countries must be informed and consulted.
I voted in favour, of course.
Â Â  . In recent decades, various environmental disasters have taken place, including the sinking of the , off the coast of Galicia, which has had terrible consequences as regards maritime pollution.
There is a clear need for international cooperation, because no State is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident on its own, and the aim of this cooperation must be to prevent and effectively combat such pollution.
I must, therefore, support the Communityâs conclusion of this Protocol on cooperation concerning combating pollution in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the protocols appended to the Barcelona Convention (a regionally-based initiative, to which 14 Mediterranean countries have signed up).
Given its lengthy coastline, Portugal would always have to support any initiative that promotes international cooperation with the aim of preventing and combating maritime pollution.
There is no problem as regards the initiativeâs compatibility with Community legislation, because this is even more stringent than the Protocol, since the Community has stepped up and strengthened its action in the field of preventing and combating maritime pollution.
One example of this is the set of initiatives that we adopted here during the last part-session.
Â Â  â I voted in favour of the report, for it is imperative to conduct a determined and coordinated battle against all forms of pollution in the Mediterranean.
Every day, the Mediterranean is the target of maritime hooligans who see it as a dustbin.
Let us not forget that more than six million tons of pollution-producing waste is deliberately discharged into the sea every year.
Moreover, I support the European measures advanced in the field of maritime safety following the loss of the .
Efforts must, however, continue unabated in order to prevent new disasters from occurring, and people, fauna and flora from paying the price.
This fight against pollution must be accompanied by a genuine preventive policy from further up the line.
State port control and cooperation between the maritime police of different coastal states need to be strengthened.
The fight against those who pollute the sea must be more effective and be accompanied by heavy penalties, with all parties involved in the goods transportation chain having to assume their share of responsibility.
To conclude, I would invite the Member States that have still not ratified this protocol to do so as soon as possible.
Â Â  . I welcome the measures intended to achieve closer international cooperation in combating maritime pollution.
The terrible accidents that have taken place in recent decades have shown that no State on its own is able to combat the consequences of a major maritime pollution accident.
Portugal, like the other Member States of the European Union that are not part of the Mediterranean region, is not party to this regional convention or to any of the eight additional protocols.
In accordance with ArticleÂ 29 of the Barcelona Convention, a country must be party to the Convention in order to sign up to any of the Protocols.
These regional initiatives include the United Nations strategy to implement the Montego Bay Convention (the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) and are mirrored by the Lisbon Agreement to protect the Northeast Atlantic.
Nevertheless, as everyone knows, the Lisbon Agreement has not entered into force because it has not been ratified by Spain and Morocco, as a result of the dispute over the delimitation of borders between these two countries.
Â Â  . Parliament was asked to deliver an opinion on control measures applicable under the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic fisheries, ensuring a comprehensive monitoring and inspection scheme that will enable the resources in the area covered by this international convention to be exploited on a sustainable basis.
With the Stevenson report now before us, Parliament urges the Commission to be more consistent in managing sustainable fisheries, and calls for a clarification of Community competences in the field of monitoring and inspection.
The report also calls for more information to be provided on the costs of monitoring and inspection services operating in the Member States.
The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in North-East Atlantic Fisheries (NEAFC) provides for a mechanism to ensure the monitoring and inspection of fishing grounds.
The European Union chose to divide this task between the Commission and the Member States.
In practice, however, this situation has led to problems in implementation, and to some constraints, which are to be expected when responsibilities are divided.
Without completely rejecting the system chosen by the EU, Parliament must exert pressure to ensure a greater clarification of the competences of each party, the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other.
One such clarification might involve creating a Community Inspection Agency.
â MrsÂ Stihler, as this is a report that falls under Rule 110 (b) of the Rules of Procedure, the explanations of vote can in theory only be given in writing.
Having, however, made the mistake of giving the floor to MrÂ Fatuzzo, who was in the same position as yourself, I am happy to give it to you.
Â Â  Mr President, with regard to the Kindermann report, many of my constituents are concerned about the unnecessary killing of dolphins and porpoises in Europe's seas.
It is time for us to act swiftly.
That is why the Kindermann report is so important.
I am certain that these measures will make a real difference: a general restriction on the length of driftnets in the Baltic Sea from 1 July 2004, a further reduction in driftnet fishing by 1 January 2007; the compulsory use of acoustic deterrent devices and the introduction of a comprehensive system for monitoring the levels of dolphins and porpoises.
These policies show why it is important to have a common fisheries policy and if these measures become part of that policy, we will then have the full force of the law across the 25 Member States.
That shows just how important the EU and its enlargement into Eastern Europe are for all of us concerned about the environment.
Â Â  . The aim of this regulation is to reduce the incidental catching of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises in fishing nets, which is threatening the conservation of this species.
There are insufficient data to enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of by-catches of cetaceans in fishing nets and of the impact of these catches on populations.
There are, however, scientific papers proving that the majority of the fishing nets most commonly used in Europe are responsible for some cetacean by-catches.
By establishing new measures designed to combat cetacean by-catches, this proposal for a regulation not only provides a response to the scientific papers but also makes a significant contribution to eradicating catches of cetaceans whose conservation would otherwise be threatened.
Hence my vote in favour.
Â Â  . I support this proposal for a regulation, which seeks to establish measures to combat the incidental catch of cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises, during fishing activities, with the corresponding amendment to Regulation (EC) 88/98.
In fact, although the conservation of cetaceans is subject to protection under the 'Habitats' Directive, the measures contained therein have not proven sufficient to guarantee an appropriate level of protection.
Because the most serious problems appear to be caused by gill-nets and drift nets, I believe it would be appropriate to lay down rules and limits on the use of these fishing techniques, and I therefore endorse the proposals tabled to this end.
Nevertheless, and despite the findings of some existing scientific papers, I regret the fact that there are no more precise data that would enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of cetacean by-catches, and the European Union must strive to remedy this lack of information as a matter of urgency.
We must, in fact, obtain reliable data on population units and on the incidental catches of cetaceans in various fishing grounds and at a later date, draw more wide-ranging conservation measures.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this Commission proposal, the aim of which is to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in an area north west of Scotland.
Incorporating environmental requirements into the common fisheries policy also involves adopting measures designed to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems.
Recent scientific reports have shown that some deep-sea habitats are in need of protection against mechanical erosion caused by fishing gear.
I therefore support the Commissionâs ban on using these drift-nets in the Darwin Mounds.
Adopting this measure will bring substantial environmental benefits, without having a significant impact on the fisheries sector, because fishermen will be able to continue using drift-nets outside the fishing zone containing the Darwin Mounds, or, within the protected zone, using towed nets that do not come into contact with the seabed.
Â Â  The Attwooll report on the protection of the Darwinâs Mounds coral reefs from the effects of trawling has ceased to be so discriminatory and disproportionate in three crucial areas, thanks to the amendments that I tabled with the Committee on Fisheries and that have been adopted.
The Commission wanted to ban recourse to deep-sea trawlers well beyond the area of distribution of the Darwinâs Mounds.
The text now refers to the 2002 Advisory Committee on Ecosystems (ACE) report in order to define this area which, in fact, covers two distinct zones ten times less extensive than that defined by the Commission.
Deep-sea trawlers were accused of systematically destroying the corals.
It is now laid down that the measures provided for must relate exclusively â and avoiding any combination â to âfishinggear likely to cause real damageâ.
Finally, there is a demand for the interested parties and the regional advisory councilsrun by fishing professionals to participate in the decision-making process.
The issue of the legal and economic uncertainty involved in the application of the Habitats Directive to European waters arises again, however, in connection with the Commissionâs new bans on trawling in various sectors around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands.
Â Â  In the vision that I had, MrÂ President, MrÂ Pannella was condemned to go on strike about a hunger strike, that is to say he was condemned to eat, to eat and get fatter and fatter.
Then MrÂ Pannella said to me: âPlease wake up MrÂ Fatuzzo, for you it is a dream, you were dreaming, but for me it is a nightmare!â
I therefore had to vote in favour of the report so as to protect poor MrÂ Pannella.
Â Â  . The outermost regions (ORs) have specific structural and socio-economic conditions, which can result in permanent economic handicaps, including economic dependence on a few products and limited access to markets.
Their economic activities are based chiefly on tourism, agriculture and fisheries, which is the case of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and of Madeira.
This own-initiative report, which I believe is broadly to be welcomed, is, therefore, important.
I agree with the need to ensure that Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty constitutes the legal basis for all measures relating to the ORs, including the fisheries sector.
I also agree on the importance of the compensation scheme for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products and with increasing the budget of the POSEI programmes.
Aid must also be maintained for renewing and modernising the local fleet, for increasing the eligibility of new species and for fishermenâs active participation in the common fisheries policy.
The most pressing requirement for maintaining the fisheries sector in the ORs, however, concerns the management of fishery resources, ensuring that only local fleets can fish in their exclusive economic zone, as the rapporteur advocates, to some extent, in paragraphÂ 12.
We must obtain detailed information on the state of fish resources in the ORs, particularly of Black Scabbardfish.
Â Â  . This report is based on the premise that the common fisheries policy (CFP) does not pay due attention to the specific interests of the outermost regions.
The rapporteur rightly believes that there is, in many ways, a conflict between the CFP on the one hand, which was planned with the interests of continental Europe in mind and which applies to the outermost regions because of their status as an integral part of the Community, and, on the other, the specific needs of the outermost regions which came into being as a result of their specific geographical, economic and social characteristics.
It should be added that the reform of the CFP has also failed to take due account of the needs of the regions in question.
In this context, we must establish a number of priorities reflected in various support measures, which warrant our attention.
First of all, increasing the eligibility of new species of fish from the outermost regions and maintaining aid for the construction of new vessels after 2006.
Next, increasing, as a matter of urgency, scientific research into fishery resources and finally creating fishing zones reserved exclusively for local fishermen.
I have voted in favour in order to support this consistent policy, which seeks to meet the needs of the outermost regions.
Â Â  . I agree with this own-initiative report that raises the issue of the impact of the common fisheries policy (CFP) on the EUâs outermost regions.
As the rapporteur rightly points out, supported by ArticleÂ 299(2) TEC, due to factors such as climate, topography, geographical location, small size, remoteness and economic dependence on a small number of products, the outermost regions have very specific structural, social and economic conditions.
I therefore share the rapporteurâs opinion emphasising that adapting the CFP to the needs of these outermost regions must be done systematically and that defining a coherent and structured policy in this field is much-needed.
Financial aid must be granted to those regions as a means of compensating for the additional costs incurred in marketing their fishery products and the funds that are provided should be better used.
I also greatly welcome the idea of establishing a fishing observatory in each outermost region, both to supervise fishing activities and to ensure better protection of fish resources and the environment.
Â Â  MrÂ President, we are talking about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, one of the Members of which is, as you know, the Bahamas.
In 1965 I found myself in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas; Paradise Island, a fairy tale place for tourists to the Bahamas.
I was a little younger than I am toady; by the sea I met a young Bahamian who said to me: âI hear that you will become a Member of the European Parliament and I will be Co-Presidentof the Joint Parliamentary Assemblyâ.
âSo, be sureâ, I said to him, âto think about pensioners, also the pensioners of the Member States that you will represent, and remember to set up a Committee on Social Affairs and the Environmentâ.
This is something that he did, and so I voted in favour.
Â Â  We have of course voted against the report on this so-called ACP (African-Caribbean-Pacific) â EU âJointâ Parliamentary Assembly. This is just a pseudo-parliamentary front for unequal relations and, in fact, for the plundering of these regions of the developing world by the European imperialist powers.
Â Â  . Like the rapporteur, I welcome the adoption and the implementation by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) of its amended Rules of Procedure, intended to streamline its activities.
Particularly significant is the setting-up of three standing committees, which could help the Assembly to become a genuine parliamentary assembly.
I believe the attention the JPA has paid to the rights of children and in particular to child soldiers, is to be lauded, as is the positive influence that its report had on this matter in the Council, which resulted in strategic guidelines being adopted on the unacceptable use of children in armed conflicts.
I must, however, express my frustration at the JPAâs inability to exert any positive influence over the situation in Zimbabwe.
The JPA must strive to be more effective and efficient in preventing conflicts, become more actively involved in monitoring electoral and democratisation processes and promote the involvement of civil society in the work of the Joint Assembly and its standing committees, particularly when the JPA meets in ACP countries.
Despite my reservations arising from the conviction that the JPA could be more ambitious in these fields, I share the rapporteurâs view that these developments are broadly to be welcomed.
I am therefore voting in favour.
Â Â  Yesterday, MrÂ President, I closed my eyes for a moment to think about how I should explain my vote in favour of the Bowis report on disease prevention and control.
With my eyes closed, I saw that MrÂ Bowis, in the next legislative period, had become EU Commissioner for Health and, with his usual commitment and professional ability, had succeeded in obtaining a huge financial and organisational undertaking to prevent a good many diseases for EU citizens, thus reducing health expenditure across Europe, as well as disability pensions, without needing to reduce the budget for pensions and so harm pensioners.
This is whyÂ âÂ with the hope that this really happensâÂ I voted in favour of his report.
Â Â  We Moderates believe it is one of the European Unionâs tasks to prevent the outbreak of serious infectious diseases and, when they do occur, to coordinate the response.
With freedom of movement within the EU and rapid ways of transmitting infections across its borders, a European Centre could quickly take action to reduce and limit the effects and spread of outbreaks of disease.
We think it inappropriate to extend the Centreâs competence to include general public health issues.
We believe that the Commissionâs proposals on important points are better than the European Parliamentâs proposals, which is why we choose to support the Commissionâs proposals.
Â Â  . I very much support the report by the rapporteur which sets out the need to set up a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control within the territories of the EU.
This centre will be funded from the EU Budget and will come into existence next year.
As we are aware there is an EU Communicable Diseases Network which has been in existence since 1999.
It has acted as a channel for occasional cooperation between Member States when they take measures against epidemics and other health risks.
An example of this would be the cooperation that was put in place for the different Member States of the EU concerning the fight against SARS last year.
However, several studies have revealed the long-term limitations of this arrangement.
We are aware that diseases such as AIDS, Malaria and Meningitis have no frontiers.
They spread with increasing ease around the world as a result of population movements and the expansion of trade.
The only concerted action by countries inside and outside the European Union can hope to check these dangers effectively.
The aim of the new centre is to overcome the problems of the present arrangements and to develop and implement projects more coherently across the territories of what will be the 25 Member States of the EU.
Â Â  .
I congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent report on the proposal for a Parliament and Council regulation establishing a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which has my support, especially as it is designed to improve communication, coordination and cooperation with the Dedicated Surveillance Networks.
Establishing a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will enable the EU to draw up a long-term plan for Public Health, to respond quickly to epidemics and to react effectively to any potential outbreak or other incident, without teams in different Member States duplicating work.
Â Â  . I believe that communicable diseases constitute an extremely serious threat to the health of citizens and therefore support the Commission proposal to increase the means to effectively control such diseases, specifically by creating a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which would bring together epidemiologists, public health experts, microbiologists, logistics specialists and doctors.
The European Union must strive to improve cooperation and coordination between Member States in monitoring diseases.
The case of the atypical pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus demonstrated the need for this.
It is thus crucial to create synergies between national disease control centres, ensuring epidemiological surveillance, creating laboratory networks, issuing scientific advice and having a body that can provide, at European level, an Early Warning and Response System, also providing the necessary technical assistance and information on threats to health and preparing for health emergencies.
I agree with the suggestion that this centre must have a contingency budget to allow it to address unforeseeable situations.
