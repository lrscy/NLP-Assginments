Meanwhile, you act as if the thing were even in their interests, whilst avoiding mentioning those who really did guide you in drafting it, namely big businesses, in an attempt to deny small businesses the freedom that sets us apart from the American market and to prepare the way for a flattened field in which enormous profits will be achieved only by the very few.
That is not the Europe for us!
Â Â  MrÂ President, it was nice to hear someone from the Commission defend the Services Directive for once.
That is, of course, incredibly important and fundamental if it really is to be possible for the Lisbon Agenda, which the Commission talks so much about, to be turned into a reality.
The whole of Europeâs future economy is, of course, in the services sector.
How would it be if the Commission were to prepare a strategy for talking about the Services Directive?
What we now see is every Commissioner appearing to have his or her own agenda on this issue, something that is extremely unfortunate.
What is to become of the whole idea of free movement of services, if the country of origin principle is to be reformed?
Â Â  â Mr President, the proposal for a directive on services is a proposal of ill repute.
It has caused tremendous reaction and concern both in the European Parliament and in numerous Member States and, mainly, through citizens, because it promotes brutal social dumping.
If you do not want us to talk of social dumping, Commissioner, withdraw your proposal, which causes this social dumping.
Withdraw the dangerous principle of the country of origin and make full exceptions for sensitive sectors, such as health and public utility services.
Mr McCreevy, take the Bolkenstein proposal away and bring us a proposal of your own, a McCreevy proposal; do not confine yourself to the role of making minor corrections to the Bolkenstein proposal.
In your statement to the Conference of Presidents on 3 March, you were more daring and clearer.
Once you had spoken with Mr Barroso, you put a great deal of water in your wine.
I await your proposal, not your son of Bolkenstein proposal.
Â Â  Mr President, I can tell you, Commissioner, that everyone is talking about your directive in France.
It is the only thing that is talked about during the current debates on the referendum on the Constitutional Treaty.
You might say that this is a good sign: people are interested in our work.
But you are quite aware that this is not the case at all.
It is safe to say that the whole of France is opposed to this directive and in particular the country of origin principle.
As you have just told us, by maintaining this principle, you are well aware that you are dragging Europe down and that, at the end of the day, you are increasing mistrust amongst our fellow citizens, who trusted us after the European elections to create a socially aware Europe.
You are increasing mistrust and, even worse, you are going to be responsible for making France swing towards a no vote, which would be even more serious.
I therefore also ask you to withdraw your proposal, Commissioner.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, like everyone here, I listened to you very carefully.
This directive is a major first in the history of civilisation, as it is the first time in the existence of the law (strength is sufficient for the strong, the law is made for the weak) that a brutal departure has been made from the principle of territoriality of the law.
You enter a country, and when you are on its soil, you adopt its law.
It is true that in France today everybody is talking about this directive, to use our colleagueâs expression.
I listened to you very carefully.
You said: âthe directive will not be withdrawnâ.
In France, we heard your colleague Commissioner Barrot solemnly declaring that the directive was withdrawn and we heard the President of the French Republic, Jacques Chirac, trying to reassure our fellow citizens, explaining that the directive was being reviewed.
Although in France today, when we talk âŠ
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, an internal market for services needs to be created, but the directive that you are proposing needs to be significantly changed, and we congratulate you for understanding this.
What we want now is, first of all, for the scope of application to be reduced, and in particular for everything connected with cultural diversity and social rights to be excluded from it.
We want the Community method to be applied, in other words harmonisation above all other principles.
Finally, we want existing Community laws to take precedence over the new directive, in particular private international law for contractual and extra-contractual obligations and everything connected with workers rights.
This, Commissioner, is how you can regain the confidence of the European Parliament.
Work with us!
You said yourself that we are going to amend your proposal.
We are going to significantly change it.
I challenge you to accept what we are going to propose.
That is your mission if you really want an internal market for services.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, one minute is not enough for me to talk about the unease that is gripping the world of Internet users regarding the procedure for adopting the directive on the patentability of computer software.
The Luxembourg Presidency did not have the right to refuse passage from point A to point B; adoption at pointÂ A albeit following a debate, with one vote against and three abstentions is almost unprecedented.
This image is disastrous.
We have Internet users who are saying that they will use this as a reason to vote against the Constitution.
This is stupid and dangerous.
There is, however, also and above all the question of the merits.
We have listened to you and, once again, we agree with the vocabulary and the written text.
We should not just patent anything!
We should limit it.
Having said that, in the draft directive there is still no clear distinction between what is patentable and what is not.
I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following question: do you or do you not think that a clear distinction between what is patentable and what is not is essential to this text?
If so, do you think that the only possible distinction (as we do not know of any other) is whether or not energy or materials are used, as the reference to the technical contribution is tautological and allows anything to be patented.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, what we are witnessing today in this House is a breathtaking display of hypocrisy.
This House is now saying that the services directive is a bad thing because it could pave the way for the new Member States to provide services in the old Member States.
Over the past ten years the major Western companies have entered the market in Poland and other countries of the New Europe, yet where have the Members of this House been all this time?
Back then you told us that we had to agree to the liberalisation of our markets, because that was the basis of a free market âŠ
...yet you gave no thought to whether this would cause unemployment in Poland or other countries.
The present services directive is an act of justice, and I would call on the Commissioner to continue defending it.
It is an act of justice because it will make it apparent whether everyone is equal in Europe, or whether Europe only exists for the rich, and not for the poor.
If there is to be a free market and if Europe is to be free, then it must be free for everyone, not only for the rich and for the major companies.
Unfortunately even Members on the Left have spoken out in defence of the latter today.
A free Europe means a Europe that is free for everyone.
I thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur from this side of the House, I am delighted that the Commissioner has set out quite clearly a positive case for the Services Directive.
We will make that positive case, because we want the jobs and the new business start-ups.
We want the businesses Mr KamiÅski has talked about to take advantage of this.
We are delighted that the Commission is finally banishing the spectre of social dumping and all the other caricatures of this directive that have been put about by its opponents without the Commission making any case for its positive side.
As the Commissioner said, this is a key part of the Lisbon Agenda, which we support.
We will work with the Commission to deliver an effective and workable directive that will be of benefit to consumers and citizens throughout the European Union.
The country-of-origin principle is an integral part.
We will support that and get the votes in favour.
Let us work together, move forward and dispel forever the idea that the Commission is going to withdraw this proposal.
We want a workable and effective proposal for all the citizens of Europe.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to ask about the matter of software.
Stories are circulating in the Danish press to the effect that, despite vigorous protests from the Danish Government and others, the choice was made to keep the point as an A point. Are you able, Commissioner, to confirm that it was not just a question of lying down and accepting the reference to the procedure, but that vigorous protests were made?
That is the first issue.
Are you able, secondly, to confirm that you yourself were contacted by, for example, the Danish Government with a view to your supporting the Danish Governmentâs desire to have the software patent down as a B point?
Have you been subject to approaches from the Danish Government, designed to obtain support for this point of view?
This is something I should like to have clarified.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall confine my remarks to the Services Directive, and speak as a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.
Commissioner, it clearly comes as no surprise to you that the Left is strongly opposed to this particular directive and would prefer you to withdraw it, or at least neuter it.
However, please do not assume that is the wish of this House.
A matter of hours ago we voted on the Figueiredo report.
That report on the social situation in Europe was scathing about the Services Directive, and this House voted to reject it.
I suggest that the message here is clear, and you may be surprised at the strength of feeling in support of what you aim to do, surprised at the awareness that this directive could be good for consumers, good for taxpayers, good for growth and above all good for jobs.
I would therefore urge you, Commissioner, to be bold in your proposals and to press ahead.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, as co-rapporteur for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, it was with great attention and interest that I read the points where you feel the directive is indeed missing the mark.
I would go so far as to say that we all, of course, want to construct an internal market, but this directive contains many tricky points.
I am therefore delighted, Commissioner, that you have understood the criticism not only from my group, but also from across the entire spectrum of this House.
I should nevertheless like a few additional clarifications, for â as my fellow Members have already pointed out â it is not always as clear how far you are willing to go with us.
I have two points to make, Commissioner.
First of all, you claim that this directiveâs scope is probably too wide and in your speaking notes for the Conference of Presidents you mentionpublic funded services of general interest.
A moment ago, you mentioned only social services.
Could you explain exactly what you mean?
After all, services of general interest are far more comprehensive than just social services.
Secondly, it is not at all clear in which direction you would like to take the country of origin principle.
Do you share our view that the country of origin principle can work only if there is a sufficient level of harmonisation and mutual recognition â if, in other words, there is a real basis for trust?
Let me say, Commissioner, that I believe constructive cooperation to be a real option only if you more clearly clarify, for our benefit, exactly what you mean.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to tell Mr McCreevy that I have still not quite understood where exactly he wanted to take us, in particular regarding this problem of the patentability of software.
Mr McCreevy, in one minute, I can only say this.
Software is a language.
Patenting software is exactly like giving people the opportunity to become the exclusive owners of the words or grammatical rules of a language and therefore prevent other people from using them.
For example, it allows a company to become the sole owner of the common procedure of closing a file by clicking on the top right-hand corner of the image on the screen of a computer.
It is absurd, software should be protected by authorâs rights like every language.
Authorâs rights are the legitimate protection for software that will protect the freedom of small creators.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, I agree with the reasons for your action when it comes to computer-related patents.
My question concerns the Services Directive.
It is presumably still the Commissionâs role to be guardian of the Treaties.
Yet, this very day - 8 March, International Womenâs Day - the Commission is removing the whole of the health sphere - that is to say, an area dominated by women - from the Services Directive.
We know that, if there is more than one employer to choose between, there is a much greater chance of higher wages.
In view of this, you will, then, be attempting to restrict womenâs opportunities for obtaining higher wages, their having only one or very few potential employers.
Obtaining higher wages and being able to have more than one potential employer are important objectives.
What does the Commission intend to do about this?
Will the Commission present a new proposal in the health area?
It is, in actual fact, the Commissionâs role to grant the freedoms guaranteed by the Treaty to Europeans â women as well as men.
Â Â  Mr President, first of all, I should like to make a comment on the process.
I have to say that I am extremely annoyed about finding out that, unknown to Parliament, negotiations are being held with certain Member States or that, in the case of software, Parliamentâs view is simply being ignored.
My second comment concerns the content.
There has been much talk about the Lisbon strategy and the need for innovation and promoting the European services market.
I am one of the advocates of the services directive, and it goes without saying that we need clarification and improvement on a number of points, provided this is based on facts and not based on media reports which are full of false information, or with Chirac, SchrÃ¶der and others.
As for the software, the quality of legislation must not be made subordinate to the power struggle between the institutions.
The innovation that we need must not be stifled by misguided legislation.
In short, Mr McCreevy, I would argue in favour of paying more than lip service to the Lisbon strategy and also of respect for the democratic process and for the elected representatives of Europeâs people.
Â Â  MrÂ President, there are many in this House today who have come out against the Services Directive.
I therefore think it important to state that it is the most significant individual reform we now have for European integration and for giving new impetus to the Lisbon process.
It is not only a Services Directive that we need, but a directive that provides increased trade in services across European borders.
The services sector corresponds to 70% of the European economy.
We shall never obtain the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world if we do not open up the services sector.
It is against that background that there are reasons for being concerned about what the Commissioner has said, because large parts of the services sector are exempt.
It is important to analyse the issue: how much will be left of the European services sector subsequent to the exemptions now being granted?
For 50 years, half of Europe has had the advantage of living in freedom and peace and has been able to develop a services sector with a high knowledge content.
We have that competitive advantage.
Another part of Europe has other competitive advantages.
How will the Commissioner guarantee that all European countries have competitive advantages through the country of origin principle and through a free and open trade in services?
These are crucial issues if we are to succeed.
Â Â  Commissioner, I have a number of questions relating to the software patent directive, more specifically in connection with the position that the Council adopted yesterday.
What does this position actually comprise?
If it is the dry text of 18Â May, then there will not be a majority to back it even in the Council, for, at the end of the day, eight states have announced or delivered statements with critical comments on the directiveâs central points, and four national parliaments have expressed their opposition to its content.
How, then, will you take account of the objections these states have raised?
It can, of course, be done in this House, but the Council is, after all, responsible for getting the backing of a majority, and that is what the post-18 May text will not get in its present form.
No attempt has as yet been made to take on board the Member Statesâ objections.
I do not want a power struggle between Parliament, the Council and the Commission; what I want is the objections to this directive to be properly dealt with, and that is what I expect of you.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that, after this discussion, the Commissioner will not think he has given everyone a hearing and can proceed along the same course as before, as he seems to have been saying during the debate over the last few months.
I refer to both questions, services and software.
With particular regard to software, the decision taken yesterday is a serious affront to the democratic wishes of European citizens.
Instead of referring the text back to Parliament, the body you represent opted to submit the directive for approval by the Council, completely ignoring the opinion of the European Parliament, whose intention was to have the legislative process re-started from scratch.
I believe the directive lacks a clear legal framework and runs the risk of allowing the large IT multinationals to patent not only the software used in industrial applications but also other types of computer program, thereby seriously restricting the use of technological innovations in this area.
It should be clearly understood that this method of interinstitutional cooperation, which ignores the views of the European Parliament, the only institution elected democratically by universal suffrage, is not democratic and does not represent the wishes expressed by millions of European citizens.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I think that the Commissionâs position on the Services Directive is along the right lines.
The criticism has been listened to.
A few things are, however, unclear, for example concerning the labour market.
Do you share my view that it is not enough to grant exemptions through the Directive on the posting of workers?
Instead, the whole of the labour market should be exempted, in which case the host country principle should apply, should it not?
If, now, the labour market is exempted and the host country principle applies to environmental standards, consumer law and so on, then I wonder, secondly, how, in drafting a directive, it can be thought that the basic principle should be the country of origin principle.
Perhaps it is the most important areas in which, instead, the host country principle should apply.
The third question I should like to put concerns services of general interest.
I think it good that health and health care, together with social services, are to be exempt.
Can you be clear about which areas you are thinking of when you talk about the scope of the directive?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I am amazed at the lack of self-awareness and of self-respect on the part of many Members in the Chamber, and that for one simple reason.
Who makes the laws?
Does the Commission do it, or do we ourselves?
The services directive is at first reading stages, while the software patent directive, due to the Councilâs problematic way of handling it, is unfortunately being read a second time.
It is we who make the laws; both directives have to be amended.
The Common Position on the software patent directive is unacceptable, and we will be amending both directives to take account of the public interest and of the objectives of the European Union.
We want both of them.
I therefore welcome the Commissionâs statement, in that it achieves clarity.
Let us also get back to the practical work that parliaments do; let us have no more hysteria and misinformation, and let us appeal to the ETUC to support us in the lawmaking process rather than holding demonstrations next week.
We expect the same of the Commission.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, it is clear that this directive on services is of importance to the services market in Europe, but it is therefore necessary to divest it of everything that needs to be changed and there are many fundamental aspects that need to be changed.
First and foremost, clarification must be given as regards which services it applies to.
You have just said that health services should remain outside it and I believe that there are health services that should be subject to market forces and that service providers from any of the Member States should compete for those services.
Yet I also believe that if services of general interest were to remain outside, we would have to define what those services are.
Is the Commission prepared to table a framework-law, in time, which could be taken into account when we look into the directive?
Another aspect to mention is that of country of origin.
This obviously must be changed.
It can be applied to company constitutions and to the beginning of operations, but as a basic principle it must be changed.
Given that there are fundamental changes to be made, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, if it would not be better to withdraw this directive in its current form, and for the Commission, as the author of these initiatives, to table a more appropriate proposal to serve the Unionâs interests effectively?
Â Â  Mr President, I am sorry, Commissioner, that you did not make the gesture of putting forward a new proposal.
I am sorry that you did not explain to Parliament that you wanted to strongly challenge the country of origin principle.
If you had done so, you would have shown that the Commission was capable of listening to the expectations, fears and questions of our fellow citizens.
I am sorry about this and I think that it is a missed opportunity for the Commission.
I want Parliament to be in a position to conduct the detailed discussion in the future.
We will try to be equal to our responsibilities as elected representatives and not to disappoint the expectations of our fellow citizens for a Europe that should not only be a market but also, and above all, a Union of men and women.
Â Â  The Bureau has already extended the debate beyond the scheduled time.
We should already have begun Question Time.
Given that there were many Members due to speak, we have already extended the debate, but it is not possible to extend it any further.
Let us resume the agenda for the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, with regard to the speakers to whom you have given the floor during this debate, I object to the lack of balance among the different Member States.
I indicated very early on that I wanted to speak; yet, with respect to my French colleagues, you took almost a dozen French contributions and none from Members from other countries.
I think you should be more balanced and should observe the order that people indicate.
I know I indicated that I wished to speak before other colleagues who spoke â good luck to them.
But you should watch and be fair, Mr President.
Fair play is all we ask.
Â Â  We have divergent views on this matter.
The services will later distribute a breakdown of speakers by nationality.
That way, we shall be able to see if it was done in a balanced manner or not.
Â Â  .
Mr President, given the wide-ranging issues raised I do not have time to deal with all these points, but on software patents I clearly indicated that the ball is in the court of the European Parliament.
If Parliament wishes to reject it, then the Commission will respect that decision.
I have heard what Members are saying on that matter.
I said it in the committee meeting I attended.
I repeated it at the Council presidency last week and I repeat it here today in my speech.
It is up to the European Parliament to do its job on this particular matter and we will take on board your concerns.
Some questions were asked about the matter at the Council of Ministers yesterday.
The Council of Ministers issued a statement and it is now a matter for the Council of Ministers.
I turn now to the services directive.
One thing I have learned in my political life is that it is always easier to come up with reasons not to do something than it is to do something.
Secondly, I believe that there is never a right time to take a new or brave initiative.
There are always good reasons not do anything.
May I also say that it is easier for ministers or Commissioners to sit in their offices and say that they will do absolutely nothing, because the only way to avoid making bad decisions is to make no decisions!
But we in Europe do not have the option of sitting on our hands and praying and hoping that something will turn up, as in Beckettâs novel.
We have to do something to galvanise the European economy.
I respect the views of people on the left and on the right.
I respect the political philosophy of people who have looked at things differently from me over the years.
I respect the different economic philosophies that can be pursued with legitimacy.
I have my own particular ideas in that regard.
But no matter where you stand on this particular problem regarding the European economy, you have to conclude that standing still is not an option.
And if 70% of the European Unionâs economy comes from services, you do not need a higher degree in economics to realise that you must do something about services in Europe in order to galvanise the European economy.
For a number of years, the European economy has been growing at a rate less than its full potential.
That will not allow us to sustain the social model that we have built up, or to have sustainable development, unless we do something dramatic to galvanise economic activity in the Union.
Whatever perspective you take, if we keep heading in the present direction we will not be able to do the things we have taken for granted for many decades.
Nor will we be able to do things in the future, such as dealing with our ageing populations, unless we do something about the economy.
The services directive, as proposed by the previous Commission, was a noble and very innovative attempt to do something dramatic in this vital area.
I could take a pristine, pure view of this â as some Commission officials might want â and stand in my office on the ninth floor of the Berlaymont, open the window, get a trumpet and broadcast that âthis is wonderful!
I am going to stand on the barricades for ever and ever and defend this proposal from the last Commission!
It is absolutely brilliant and I am going to defend it from now until death â and into the Valley of Death I would ride!â
However, I realise that the services directive as initiated has not a snowballâs chance in hell of getting through either the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament.
I could be pristine and pure and say that I will make great speeches about it, get nothing through, offer no services directive at all and do nothing to address the problems facing us all over Europe.
However, I have taken the pragmatic view.
I have listened to what parliamentarians have to say.
I have been here on occasions.
I have met people individually and collectively and at committees and they have given me very good ideas as to what we should do.
Some people strongly believe we should continue as we started, but that will not succeed either.
Therefore, I have taken everybodyâs views into account and have stated that the Commission is willing to listen and to accept changes to ensure that we will end up with a services directive that does something positive for the European economy.
That is why I am here today, and that is what I set forth here this afternoon and last week.
It is a very important point I must say that the members of any organisation â be it a local political party, a local sports club, a local trade union or a local employersâ organisation â all like certainty and do not like change.
We always like change for the other person but not for ourselves.
Politicians are the same.
We would prefer not to have to face another election but just be elected time after time.
That would be great for the politician, but very bad for democracy.
Therefore, we do not want to create the impression that we are going to deny the new Member States that recently joined the Union the same opportunities that the existing 15 have had for a long time, including the country I know best.
I respect the views of people who look at this problem from a different perspective.
However, we cannot be here just as the voice of the âinsâ and forget about the âoutsâ.
That is not what social democracy, as I know it, is meant to be.
We must guard against people who are lulled into defending the interests of the status quo.
It is the easier political thing to do, because they are the people you are certain of and who probably voted for you before.
However, remember that there are millions of people coming on to the job market who are waiting for the opportunity to have a decent standard of living and social inclusion.
They must be given the same opportunity as the rest of us have been given.
It is important that we come up with a services directive that makes a positive economic impact and takes on board genuine concerns.
I am prepared to take those on board and to work with the European Parliament on getting a services directive through.
It is now for the European Parliament to deal with the matter.
I will be as constructive as possible.
I hope to be able to come up with the best solution possible, based on the broadest consensus, because that is what we and Europe need.
Â Â  Mr President, not for the first time I should like to ask you to communicate to the President of Parliament a request for clarification of the rules and procedures for these âcatch-the-eyeâ sessions.
Like the previous speaker, I know that my name was put forward very early on and yet I have not been called.
I know you cannot call everyone, but I have a very particular viewpoint from Scotland that has not been heard.
I will now write to Mr McCreevy about it and invite him to respond urgently, but please, Mr President, review and clarify this procedure.
Â Â  I shall certainly pass on to the Bureau your recommendation that everything be clarified.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is question time (B6-0019/2005).
We shall now take questions to the Commission.
Â Â  MrÂ President, before replying to the question, I would like to offer you my congratulations and those of the Commission on your appointment as your countryâs Minister of the Interior, which will enable you to have even more regular and fruitful dealings with me in the future.
To the Commission's knowledge, the publication of a list of the Union's ten most wanted criminals has not yet been discussed at EU level.
Currently, the Schengen Information System â SIS â enables designated law enforcement authorities of 13 Member States, plus Norway and Iceland, to have access to wanted persons alerts by means of an automated search procedure.
These alerts and accompanying supplementary information are used for the transmission of European arrest warrants between Member States.
For this purpose the Customs Information System will soon also be available to designated law enforcement authorities of the United Kingdom and Ireland and, after the second generation of the CIS has become operational, to the ten Member States that joined Europe in 2004.
The SIS-CIS can be searched by police officers of all the countries taking part in the implementation of the Schengen .
Introduction of an alert for a wanted person in SIS is under the responsibility of participating countries whose authorities issued the arrest warrant.
It is up to the issuing countries to decide whether they deem the wider dissemination of information on a wanted person, for example via publication on the Interpol website, is of added value.
With regard to the possible involvement of Europol, it should be noted that the mandate and role of Europol, based on the unique legal framework of the Europol Convention, is totally different.
Europol, as the central law enforcement authority in the European Union, is founded on the principle of sharing and analysing information and intelligence, especially in the investigation or intelligence phase prior to measures such as the issue of an arrest warrant for a criminal or a house search on a warrant from judicial authorities at a later stage.
At Europol, Member States compile information and intelligence on file to assess top criminals, groups and organisations and coordinate subsequent joint action on the monitoring and targeting of suspected criminals by the law enforcement authorities.
An arrest warrant issued by the judicial authorities is therefore normally one of the final elements in the intelligence process that the law enforcement agencies carry out in advance.
The Commission would be willing to discuss with the new Member States whether there is a need to improve the instruments at EU level for searching for persons wanted for serious criminal offences with a cross-border dimension.
At the moment, the general public cannot access alerts for a wanted person in the Schengen Information System, because SIS is only accessible to the designated law enforcement authorities of the Schengen contracting parties, due to the sensitivity of the data involved and data protection regulations.
In my view, the most appropriate forum for discussing this question with the new Member States and Europol is probably the European Chiefs of Police Task Force, which meets roughly every three months.
The first meeting in 2005 took place in February, so the Commission would therefore be in a position to provide a final reply in the second half of 2005.
Â Â  Thank you for a very complex and interesting reply, which needs to be read carefully.
The point, surely, is that organised crime bleeds the European economy; these criminals are stealing billions from us in various different ways.
It can only be beneficial to involve the public in that battle, not to do it behind the scenes in the complex way you describe.
Why not involve the public as well?
Would you please raise the question, obtain a list of the worst criminals in Europe and help the public find them?
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, accession negotiations with Croatia are due to start on 17 March.
Do you believe that the Commission will be able â through the offices of Interpol or Europol â to track down General Gotovina?
He is reported to hold a French passport.
Are there any indications as to whether he is still in Croatia, or any information as to how he might be handed over to the court?
Â Â  To follow up on Mr Newton Dunnâs question, it seems clear to me that the public are now well aware that criminal activity is international and that criminals move freely across EU frontiers.
What they are not so aware of is the coordination that takes place to try and counteract that.
I therefore urge the Commission to look into bringing the different information together on a regular basis, whether through Europol, Schengen, or the chiefs of police; and look into making public what can be safely be made public, in order to demonstrate that we are acting as a Community to tackle international crime.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I will reply to the first and third questions together.
I am not opposed to the principle of giving the public absolutely clear information on the existence of extremely dangerous individuals who may well be wanted for very serious crimes.
On the contrary, I believe that cooperation between police forces and the investigating authorities in Member States requires, in certain cases, the support of public opinion.
Obviously we need to safeguard the confidentiality of data which can be useful in investigations and which clearly must not be divulged, in order to avoid compromising investigations and to protect every citizenâs fundamental right to the confidentiality of personal data.
I shall therefore raise the question with the task force of police chiefs of Member States with a view to obtaining a satisfactory reply, which I will then report back to this Parliament.
The second question refers to the case of General Gotovina, a criminal guilty of extremely serious offences.
In my recent meeting with the President of the Republic and Prime Minister of Croatia, I pointed out that the Commission was expecting a result â namely that Gotovina should be arrested and handed over to the Hague International Tribunal.
We are obviously counting on the commitment of Croatia, and on a much wider international cooperation, so that not only Gotovina but all criminals from former Yugoslavia still at large can be quickly arrested and tried by the Hague tribunal.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like the honourable Member to note that the confiscation of nail scissors and nail clippers from air passengers is not required by Community law.
Regulation NoÂ 622/2003, as modified by Regulation No 68/2004, does not ban knives or scissors unless the blade is longer than 6 cm.
Some Member States have chosen to adopt stricter requirements, prohibiting all sharp objects, whatever their size.
ArticleÂ 6 of Regulation NoÂ 2320/2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security authorises the Member States to apply more stringent measures than those laid down in the Regulation.
Consequently, the honourable Member should raise the problem with the national authorities concerned.
It is up to the national authorities to justify the existence of more stringent measures.
Â Â  Would it be possible for the Commission to set up a complaints desk to deal with the very many complaints that we get from the public about what they see as the improper and unacceptable way in which checks are carried out, and might not recommendations about this be made to the Member States?
Â Â  . Mr RÃŒbig, the Commission fully understands the inconvenience experienced by passengers when in one Member State of the Union they are prohibited from carrying certain objects, while in another Member State those objects may be taken on board.
This is why the Commission decided upon a common list of prohibited items in Regulation NoÂ 68/2004.
It is true that the Commission refrained from setting stricter rules.
However, as you pointed out (and I will definitely point this out to the Ministers of Transport at the next Council meeting) in this area there needs to be, as far as possible, if not harmonisation, then at least a number of principles reflecting the intention of the Commission: the Member State can only impose a stricter rule if there is a significant reason.
In this respect, you are certainly right, the ministers in the Transport Council need to look closely at any measure that does not appear to be essential and makes life very difficult for European passengers.
Thank you for highlighting this problem, which is important so that in Europe, air passengers can of course benefit from all the necessary security but also be protected from pointless inconvenience.
Â Â  .
Mr President, honourable Member, the Commission became aware of the closure of the Somport road very recently, and asked the French authorities to provide it with information.
In the light of the French response, the Commission will assess whether the closure for all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes is justified.
It will then decide whether a violation procedure needs to be brought against France.
Currently, the new Pyrenees crossing is only at the stage of the initial feasibility studies to identify the route options for this cross-border corridor.
No decision has been taken at this stage by the Spanish and French Governments regarding when this new Pyrenees crossing could be opened.
The Commission is ensuring that the national authorities are taking concrete steps to research and prepare this priority project.
I would like to add on a personal note, honourable Member, that I am closely monitoring these Pyrenees crossings, which are necessary for greater mobility not only between Spain and France but between the whole of Europe and the Iberian Peninsula.
I think that, following the incident that you highlighted, we need to continue discussions and dialogue in order to move forward in the direction that you want us to take.
Â Â  I simply wished to ask the Commissioner whether he could clarify under what circumstances the Commission could or should initiate the infringement procedure against France and whether he believes the Community rules are appropriate and sufficient in this area.
With regard to the trans-European networks project which includes the central Pyrenees rail crossing, the Vignemale pass, given the interest he has expressed, and which I thank him for in particular, does he intend to meet with the regional border authorities directly affected, so that he may hear their points of view and so that they can explain to him their particular sensitivities in relation to this project?
Â Â  There is another very important pass in the Pyrenees, the Biriatou pass, which I imagine you will know well and which carries the greatest density of traffic on the Franco-Spanish border.
Every holiday period â and it will soon be Easter â there are enormous traffic jams, because within 25 km on the French side and 25Â km on the Spanish side there are six obligatory stops for motorway tolls.
Commissioner, do you not believe that we should take some measure in this regard, in order to prevent drivers from having to stop six times and kilometres of queues at this Biriatou pass?
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all I would like to reply to Mrs Ayala Sender by saying that it is true that currently there are no Community regulations on traffic restrictions applying to heavy goods vehicles involved in international transport.
A measure such as the one taken by France must be examined in the light of the objective of free movement of goods and in the light of the general principles of Community law, including the criteria of non-discrimination and proportionality.
If it is established that France is not complying with these principles of Community law and is creating an obstacle to free movement, obviously the Commission could envisage bringing an infringement procedure against it.
For the time being, I can assure you that I will pass on your concerns to the French authorities and ask them to act quickly given the importance of this route to many heavy goods vehicles.
Regarding your other point, you can also be assured that we are ensuring that all the necessary research is done in order to determine how to improve the Pyrenees crossing.
I am quite happy to talk to you about this problem.
This allows me to also answer the other honourable Member, who highlighted the problems on the Western Atlantic route between Bordeaux and Dax and obviously subsequently the crossing of the Basque Country.
I would like to say that in that respect we are also very anxious to make progress in improving these links and I also hope that we will be able to implement priority project no 3.
Therefore, with both the East and West branches, we will already have improvements of the Pyrenees crossing, which obviously does not prevent us from continuing to discuss a central crossing.
This is what I wanted to say.
In any case, we are keeping a close eye on this matter and I hope that at the next Council meeting the new Eurovignette directive will be able to move forward so that I can make progress on these fundamental issues.
You are quite right, and if we are not careful, mobility for all Europeans will be at risk.
This is why I am very committed to these different projects and I am of course available at any time to update you on their progress.
Â Â  The Commission has notified us that, in view of the fact that Mr Mandelson and Mr Kallas are unable to attend, the next questions will be answered for the Commission by Mr KovÃ¡cs and Mr Piebalgs, and I thank them for coming.
Â Â  . Thank you for the question.
Counterfeiting and piracy are very serious problems and they are of enormous and growing magnitude.
The total volume of counterfeit goods is between 5% and 10% of world trade and the value is close to EURÂ 500 billion per year.
Counterfeiting and piracy undermine jobs and result in a considerable loss of revenue.
But as more and more fake foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, car and aircraft spare parts appear on the market, counterfeiting is a growing threat to the health and safety of the consumer.
Customs play a major role in combating counterfeiting.
EU customs, with new modern legislation and operational actions, have increased by 900% the seizures of fake products in four years.
One of the most effective instruments in the fight against counterfeiting, however, is to cut it at source.
Bearing in mind that 70% of counterfeit products seized at EU borders are of Chinese origin, the Commission has been focusing on China in the fight against counterfeiting.
A promising achievement was the recently signed customs cooperation agreement between the European Union and China, which includes joint action against counterfeiting.
The significance of the cooperation is shown by a single statistic: 5Â 000 containers arrive daily from China in the major ports in the European Union.
My colleague, Commissioner Mandelson, who is responsible for trade policy, visited China recently and had the opportunity to discuss the issue with high-ranking Chinese officials, including the Deputy Prime Minister, who expressed their commitment to the fight against counterfeiting.
The Commission has regular dialogues with China at an expert level too.
The EU-China intellectual property rights dialogue had its first meeting last October in Beijing.
The next meeting of the economic and trade working group will be held on 17 and 18 March.
It will also address the intellectual property issue within a sub-group entirely dedicated to that subject.
Commissioner in charge of taxation and customs, I have high expectations for cooperation with the Chinese customs authorities, as well as for modern Chinese customs legislation.
I hope that a large proportion of the counterfeit goods will be stopped and seized prior to their export from China.
Concerning Russia, there are very few fake products seized by EU customs that have come from Russia.
The Russian intellectual property legislation is now largely compliant with the WTO TRIPS Agreement.
However, enforcement remains weak.
The Commission intends to continue its efforts on intellectual property issues with Russia through a structured intellectual property dialogue, similar to the one with China.
Â Â  Commissioner, your reply was very encouraging.
The Chinese authorities appear to make the right noise about tackling counterfeit goods.
Would it not be worthwhile for the EU to offer to place customs and other investigative officers in China to assist the Chinese in tackling this?
I suspect China will say ânoâ because I still do not believe it is serious.
However, it is an offer that we should make to test whether China is willing to respond to our initiatives.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, now that these shortcomings in customs cooperation with China have been identified, now that there are these mass imports of counterfeit products, why does the Commission and, by extension the European Union, not take measures to suspend the abolition of quotas on textile products?
And why does it not activate the safety clause for which provision is made in China's WTO accession protocol?
Â Â  . Regarding the sending of experts, the European Commission and the Tax and Customs Directorate have already taken such steps, and no exception is being made for China.I would note that the Commission has taken similar steps towards countries in the accession stage, for example by offering technical assistance and sending experts to Bulgaria and Romania.
In relation to the second supplementary question, this is not so much in connection with product counterfeiting but rather with the large proportion of Chinese imports that are clothing items.
I myself intend to put such an initiative before the Commission, working in cooperation with my colleague Mr Mandelson, for this is a question fundamentally of trade policy, not just customs, but it is causing serious problems in a good number of Union Member States, including the country I know best, Hungary.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I agree with the Commissioner that the European Union must remain active in this field, and I should like to ask if he can assure the House that the European Union will make a renewed offer to China: for example, to provide it with customs officers at the EUâs own expense.
These would assist the Chinese authorities in China itself in keeping goods not complying with world market rules away from our market.
I do think that this is a major problem.
On Friday, I visited an enterprise in my electoral district, where I learned that China is now producing copies of truck cranes â hi-tech equipment, in other words â that are indistinguishable from cranes built here.
I think that we need to act on this issue in the interests of the competitiveness of our enterprises, and an offer of manpower such as this may be a means to do so.
Â Â  . Honourable Member of Parliament! My answer to your question is a decisive yes.
I can assure Parliament and yourself that it is my personal opinion that the European Commission and the relevant Directorate will put such a proposal to China, and we are ready to bear the costs, for the Customs cooperation agreement which I referred to â and which means protection against product counterfeiting â is in harmony with steps to offer technical assistance.
Â Â  . Following the tsunami disasters, the Commission proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the future Generalised System of Preferences for all the countries affected by the tsunami, particularly Sri Lanka for textiles and Thailand, Indonesia and India.
All these countries benefited from the new GSP proposal presented in October 2004.
The Commission will continue to evaluate the GSP.
It did that in 2002, when it presented detailed trade data and major GSP trends.
However, in order to be credible, such a monitoring scheme must cover several years.
The assessment of the Generalised System of Preferences for developing countries is positive.
Between 2002 and 2003, EU GSP imports increased from 47.2 billion to 52 billion, although during this period products and commodities like coffee were no longer under a GSP scheme, since they were granted duty-free access under other international agreements.
As far as the GSP is concerned, the EU is by far the most important donor in the world.
The EUâs GSP scheme is wider than any other.
The second largest is the US scheme, which amounted to only USD 17 billion in 2003.
Nevertheless, the GSP scheme should not be taken in isolation.
The EU is also a partner in several other preferential trade arrangements that benefit developing countries, for example, the âeverything but armsâ initiative and the Cotonou Agreement.
Thanks to the various schemes, 79% of trade flows from developing countries enter the EU through a preferential tariff regime.
97% of the trade flows from ACP countries and 60% of trade flows from non-ACP least-developed countries enter the EU duty-free.
Â Â  Thank you, Commissioner, for your detailed answer, which, together with the information given by Commissioner Mandelson in the debate earlier today, has left me fully satisfied.
Â Â  . Since the United States is applying the tariff band for pliers that it negotiated in the Uruguay Round, it is in complete compliance with its current World Trade Organization obligations.
While in these negotiations the US might have got a good deal in the pliers sector, the EU certainly obtained a favourable result in other industrial sectors, in which EU exporters are better off than their US counterparts.
Looking at the whole range of industrial tariffs, the honourable Member will note that both the US and the EU maintain high import tariffs in some sectors, but not necessarily in the same ones.
I would like to add that the Commission negotiators in the Doha Development Agenda Negotiating Group on Non-Agricultural Market Access are well aware of the problem raised by the Member.
In the current WTO round, the EU has shown its clear commitment to bringing down industrial tariffs further, especially in respect of such an important EU export market as the United States.
The Commission is confident that it will succeed in this.
Â Â  Thank you very much for your reply, Mr Piebalgs.
I wish you every success in the new Doha Round, and I hope that these differences can be reconciled, because the manufacturers of hand tools for professional use are small businesses which provide employment for workers and families which live and depend on that success in the next Doha Round.
I would also like you to communicate to the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, the question relating to the similar situation in commercial exchanges with Russia, where these tools of European manufacture are penalised with taxes of 15%.
I do not believe that either the United States or Russia deserve to be in the system of generalised preferences or have assistance tariffs.
I hope that Mr Mandelson will reply to this question in writing.
Â Â  . I will definitely pass the message on to Commissioner Mandelson.
I should say, however, that when it comes to Russia the situation is different.
Russia is still not a WTO member, so we can try to solve this issue only through bilateral negotiations with Russia.
Â Â  . As the honourable Member has rightly pointed out, the United States has threatened to withdraw as of 1Â March 2005 tariff concessions on a number of EU products, including canned peaches, as a reaction to the EUâs decision to modify its WTO schedule in respect of husked and milled rice.
The United States would have such a right if the EUâs modification did not maintain a general level of reciprocal and mutually acceptable advantages and concessions no less favourable to trade than prior to the modification pursuant to ArticleÂ 28 of the 1994 GATT agreement.
However, thanks to intense negotiation between the two parties, an agreement has been reached with the result that the United States has not applied its retaliation list.
So the issue has been resolved.
Â Â  â Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his reply.
I am aware of that but, when I submitted my question, there was the threat that the United States would impose these measures against this particular industrial sector and, consequently, against peach producers in the Member States.
Â Â  . I agree that the agricultural policy of the European Communities was for a long time an obstacle to world trade, but since 1992 a successful reform of the common agricultural policy has remarkably changed the situation.
The most recent agricultural reform packages adopted by the agriculture ministers in 2003 and 2004 have to a large extent eliminated the trade-distorting nature of the common agricultural policy and contributed to more market-oriented agricultural trade.
EU trade statistics show that EU agricultural imports from the developing countries totalled more than EURÂ 37 billion in 2003. That is more or less equal to the combined imports of the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.
The European Union alone absorbs 85% of total agricultural exports from Africa and 45% of total agricultural exports from Latin America.
In the Doha negotiations, the EU committed itself to a substantial reduction in trade-distorting subsidies, eliminating export refunds and offering improved market access.
For the benefit of the poorest or less developed countries, the European Community, as well as other major agricultural producers, should introduce similar reforms.
The EU makes efforts to persuade other countries to provide quota-free and duty-free market access for agricultural products for less developed countries.
Â Â  I share the view that improvements have taken place in agricultural policy. I do not, however, think that the improvements are enough.
There are also complaints from the poorer part of the world about the EUâs and the United Statesâs agricultural policies on the grounds that we do not provide access to markets and are dumping prices on the world market.
I should like to see further improvements because I believe that fair world trade is probably just as important as aid policy.
Do you share my view that further changes are needed in order to support the poor parts of the world?
If so, how do you intend to bring such changes about?
Â Â  . Honourable Member of Parliament, I share your view and your worries.
More than that, since between the 25 Member States of the European Union there are certain differences which do not fit with the rules of open competition.
It is well known that the ten newly-acceded countries get significantly less assistance from the common agricultural policy than the fifteen old Member States, and that this holds back the farmers of the ten new Member States, and their products, in competition.
Naturally I know that developing countries face substantially larger problems, and especially the poorest countries.
But seeing how serious the problems of the ten newly-acceded countries are, I can very much feel and understand the problems of the poorest countries.
Further steps are needed for the European Union market to be accessible to the poorest countries.
Â Â  Questions Nos 24 and 25 will be replied to in writing.
Â Â  . The European Union needs a properly functioning civil service, which is able to cope with the increased number of challenges and expectations.
In fact, the Commission has gone through a long process of change during the past five years.
Upon taking office, the Prodi Commission embarked on a comprehensive programme of administrative reform with the adoption of the White Paper on 1 March 2000 and the implementation of the timetable/action plan.
The administrative reform is both a reform of structure and of mentality.
Europeâs civil service must be well organised and outward looking.
First, the Commission has taken steps to improve its own working methods, in particular by streamlining coordination between its services.
The Commission also modified its personnel policy through the adoption of new Staff Regulations on 1 May 2004.
This includes a new career system and merit-based promotion.
Second, the reform aimed to create a culture based on service.
This meant drafting a code of good administrative behaviour and led to the regulation on access to documents.
Third, in the field of financial control, the Commission has completely recast the rules and procedures that govern the management of EU funds.
This process obtained the unanimous support of the Council and backing from the European Parliament.
The reform is in progress, but it is not yet complete.
New structures have been put in place but their functioning may need further fine-tuning.
In this sense a reform is never complete.
In the process of implementation, the Commission will in particular look at the simplification of procedures in order to remove unnecessary obstacles and combat red tape.
I agree with the honourable Member that the credibility of the European project strongly relies on the capacity of its institutions to adapt their structures and rules to the needs of the general public.
Therefore, reform is a continuous process that rightly deserves the attention of the European Parliament.
Â Â  (Thank you Commissioner.
Thank you for your answer.
I am sorry to say that it was not stated entirely clearly whether the Kinnock reform was at least partially successful in this endeavour.
My impression is that we know very little about this as a matter of fact.
There are probably still a large number of procedures in the European institutions that should be substantially simplified.
The fact is that we cannot expect the Member States to effectively secure funding and fulfil their obligations and rights if the procedures are not simplified.
Â Â  I agree with the previous speaker about how important it is to make the EU more efficient.
With a view to modernising the EUâs institutions and to that implementation of sound administrative practices discussed by Commissioner Kallas, we must, however, also demand more from the tax revenue we invest.
Such greater efficiency would be possible if all EU decisions were, in actual fact, also to become a reality.
I see that a large proportion of the decisions we take in this House do not become a reality.
These may, for example, include important measures to combat environmental damage, or legislation for greater equality and justice in Europe.
My question concerns the way in which the Commission intends to work in order that the decisions taken by the EU institutions are also implemented and turned into a reality, reflected in improvements to peopleâs everyday lives.
Â Â  . I share your objectives for the Commission and all the EU institutions and services to be effective.
That is why the Kinnock reforms were implemented, and they have been producing positive results.
The EU institutions are working more efficiently than ever.
The civil servants who work for the European institutions are dedicated to their tasks.
I cannot, therefore, agree with the statement that the reform has produced no results.
With regard to simplifying procedures, one has to bear in mind that the EU institutions are publicly funded, and this means that clear procedures have to be observed.
Looked at from this standpoint, we can never achieve the same types of procedures as private businesses have.
The EU institutions will continue reforming because, although the Kinnock reforms have certainly yielded good results, one can never reform too much.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is right in his assumption that the Court of Auditors, as the financial conscience of Europe, has to meet the highest possible standards of transparency and accountability.
In that light, the Court is also subject to the scrutiny of OLAF, which carries out systematic investigations when it is informed of serious suspicions of irregularity, fraud or other illegal activities within the European Union institutions.
The Commission can confirm that the provisions of the Staff Regulations, to which the honourable Member refers, apply to personnel of all the institutions, including the Court of Auditors.
It is indeed known to the Commission that the former member of the Court of Auditors who was implicated in an inquiry carried out by OLAF took legal action in Greece against a former official of the Court of Auditors who testified against her during the OLAF investigation.
In fact, the official informed OLAF himself of his legal action, which is currently under preliminary investigation.
The Commission would like to point out that it is the duty of the institutions to protect officials or ex-officials who are the subject of discriminatory treatment.
Rules in the current Staff Regulations with regard to these whistle-blowers also apply to the Court of Auditors.
With complete respect for the rules of procedure enforced in Greece, OLAF has taken the necessary steps to provide the former official with all the information that he has requested and that OLAF can provide in order to assist him in his defence.
The anti-fraud Commissioner has indicated to me that he is more than willing to discuss this matter in greater detail with the honourable Member at a time of his choice.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his response, and I should like to apologise on behalf of Mr van Buitenen, who was unable to be here due to unforeseen circumstances.
I was actually delighted to be able to replace Mr van Buitenen, because I was the very MEP who initiated this whole affair in the previous legislature.
I have planned an enquiry with the Court of Auditors and, having handed the dossier over to OLAF, I was delighted that they examined it thoroughly.
I am very pleased with the anti-fraud Commissionerâs offer of further negotiations, believing as I do that it is of the utmost importance that the Court of Auditors should take up its responsibility and that people who are being called as witnesses by OLAF should not be penalised by a court case in their own countries for their courageous behaviour.
I am therefore keen to accept the Commissionerâs offer, together with Mr van Buitenen, to enter into further consultation with Mr Kallas.
Â Â  . I can confirm the invitation from Vice-President Kallas for a meeting with Mr van Buitenen to discuss this question and the action to be taken in more detail.
Â Â  . The enlarged EU depends on imported energy for 50% of its needs and is increasingly dependent on external energy sources.
By 2030, this dependency could grow to almost 70%, with 90% of oil and 80% of gas consumed coming from outside the EU.
Imports of gas from Russia currently make up 26% of total gas consumption in the EU and the relevant figure for oil is 25%.
In this respect it is important to know that Russia has always been a completely reliable energy supplier to the EU.
The EU-Russia energy dialogue has established a good relationship in the energy field, and the Commission believes that Russia will be the most important and reliable energy supplier to the EU for the foreseeable future.
Notwithstanding this, however, the Community needs to ensure diversity of supply and make maximum use of its own indigenous energy resources.
Such a policy makes sense in terms of security of supply, sustainable development and the pursuit of our Lisbon objectives.
For these reasons the new Commission will be pursuing the following energy priorities: first, energy efficiency.
A simple comparison of the way in which the different EU Member States have addressed energy efficiency will show the possibilities for energy savings, which will contribute significantly to meeting the EUâs Kyoto targets.
It will also enhance our competitiveness.
This spring I will present a Green Paper on energy efficiency, outlining the concrete measures to be taken at Community, national, regional and local level that will lead to those savings.
Second, supporting renewables: towards the end of this year the Commission will publish a communication on renewables, in particular assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of existing support mechanisms in the Member States.
I will closely monitor the situation so that there is a clear move towards achieving by 2010 the target of 12% of the Unionâs overall energy consumption coming from renewable sources.
Third, supporting clean coal: approximately one-third of EU electricity is produced from coal.
If we wish to retain this, a major effort needs to be made to increase the efficiency of coal generation and to succeed in developing CO2 capture and storage.
Europe should take a leading role in research in this area, and the Commission will be examining the possibility of a joint European project.
Finally, I should like to mention establishing and improving energy dialogues with a wide range of energy producers, consumers and transit countries.
Enhanced dialogue between the EU and OPEC was recently agreed upon at the regular ministerial-level meeting.
A dialogue with the Caspian countries will be pursued and the existing annual high-level meeting with Norway will be continued.
In addition to this, and to ensure that these policies fully meet this challenge, it is clear that a wide public debate should take place on increasing EU external energy dependency.
For this reason the Commission intends to adopt by the end of this year a new Green Paper on security of the EU energy supply, with the aim of promoting a large public debate.
The input of the European Parliament during the preparation and follow-up of this Green Paper will be vital.
Â Â  The Commissioner made reference to Russiaâs reliability.
Today, President Maskhadov of Chechnya, who had been democratically elected, was shot dead, and MrÂ Putin has already conferred the highest Russian decoration on the assassins.
I should just like to ask whether you regard dependence on such a regime as desirable in the long term.
More specifically, I wish to enquire whether it is true that, at the time of the upheavals in the Ukraine, the Ukrainian pipeline networks were bought by a Russian consortium, and whether this step is irreversible.
Â Â  . With regard to energy supplies from Russia, I come from a country that does not have the easiest of relations with Russia.
But on evaluating all the energy resources supplied from Russia, I discovered a continuous flow of energy resources.
So, from the point of view of energy flows, Russia has been a very reliable partner.
But we should diversify our sources.
As for concerns about Russia buying energy sectors in other countries, if the laws permit it, then this is completely legal.
In the natural gas market, for instance in Latvia, the gas is partially owned by the Gazprom company.
But this is a commercial project and I have no objections to that.
Â Â  I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his explanations.
Yesterday, we adopted the SeppÃ€nen report, which discussed how there has been liberalisation downstream, while upstream there are still the big three â Algeria, Russia and Norway â from whom we obtain our gas and a large amount of our power.
I agree with my colleague MrÂ Posselt in this regard, and so I ask you, Commissioner what efforts you are making to influence Russia, too, in particular, so that we do not just have a single supplier in Russia, which is responsible for licensing.
What are you doing upstream in that country to achieve diversification, and thus to ensure security of supply and to help bring gas prices even further down for customers here?
Â Â  . We are pursuing an EU-Russia energy dialogue and we also have an EU-Russia dialogue.
Certainly the dialogue could produce much better results, but I would say that Russia should adopt legislation that allows real competition in the market and offers scope for investments.
Russia needs to make its own decisions; our role is to encourage Russia in this and that is what the EU is doing.
So I expect the Russian energy sector to develop healthily.
Russia will, for the foreseeable future, remain our partner in buying energy resources.
Â Â  . The honourable Member is correct.
The lack of interconnection between the Baltic States and the rest of the European Union is a cause for concern.
It is an important requisite for the proper functioning of the internal electricity market and for security of supply in the region.
Therefore, an urgent task is to integrate the electricity network into the rest of Europe.
The Commission is supporting new investments through its energy trans-European network programme.
In the Baltics, the project moving forward is the Estlink project.
This underwater cable will link the Baltic States to the Scandinavian power grid and is expected to be completed in 2006.
It will help to diversify the power supply in the region and increase security of supply.
The other key electricity interconnection project in the region is the Poland to Lithuania link.
To facilitate progress, the Commission will be contributing half the cost of the study on the link.
Several options are being examined for the power bridge between Poland and Lithuania.
It is a rather complex issue and needs good cooperation between all parties involved.
The TEN energy guidelines are currently under discussion at the European Parliament, though mainly in relation to co-financing feasibility studies.
The actual construction of the interconnection is up to the countries and companies involved.
The Poland to Lithuania link is mentioned as a project of European interest, and the Commission is facilitating progress on that issue.
For instance, on 18Â March there will be a meeting between Polish and Lithuanian representatives in Brussels to discuss the current Polish and Lithuanian transmission development plan, including the power bridge between both countries.
I have had personal contacts with the representatives of the two countries and am confident that the power bridge between Poland and Lithuania will be created.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Commissioner, for your broad and business-like response.
I would like to ask if you share the opinion expressed recently by the Prime Minister of Lithuania, Algirdas Brazauskas, that Poland still has reservations about this power bridge between Lithuania and Poland.
I would also like to know what you think about the fact that there is a growing opinion in Lithuania that a situation has been reached where Lithuania's dependency is still one-sided in terms of energy, and where there is increasing talk in Lithuania about the fact that it might perhaps be possible to extend the work of the second block at the Ignalina nuclear power station.
Bearing in mind the latest scientific information on the safety of RBMK reactors and the technical prospects of the second block working for approximately another 12 years, what does the Commission think about such an extension?
Thank you.
Â Â  . To start with Ignalina, the second reactor at that plant should be closed by end of 2009.
That is not a decision by the Commission, but part of the Accession Treaty.
The situation is therefore quite clear-cut.
I recently met with the Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister and he confirmed that there are no concerns as regards the impact that closing Ignalina will have on energy production in Lithuania.
While this closure will definitely change the balance in the Baltic area, it will not create any particular difficulties for Lithuania or for other Baltic countries.
I therefore see no link between the closure of Ignalina and security of supply in the Baltic region.
It is difficult for me to comment on the position of Poland, but my contacts with the Polish Government and authorities have shown that they are open to developing this project.
I have no doubt that this will be in the interests not only of Lithuania but also of Poland.
Â Â  I should just like to ask an additional question.
Firstly, can the Commissioner envisage these electricity interconnection projects being expanded westwards, too?
Secondly, does he believe we should be retaining old nuclear power stations that fall below modern standards â in Poland and Lithuania, for example â whilst shutting down ones, those in Germany being an example, that meet many of them?
Does the Commission not see this as a problem?
Â Â  . As far as I know, there are no nuclear power stations in Poland to close down.
The situation in Lithuania is also clear: the Accession Treaty calls for the closure of the Ignalina reactors.
That was not because they are old, but during the accession negotiations it became clear that those generators could not be upgraded to meet our safety standards.
Lithuania has kept its promise and closed the first reactor on time.
I have no doubt that the second will be closed as promised in the Accession Treaty.
There is no doubt whatsoever on this.
The Baltic States have been part of the CIS electricity link.
That is why it is extremely important to provide other links for security of supply.
I have already spoken about Estlink.
This link connects the Baltic States with the EUâs energy systems.
We will have another interconnection between Lithuania and Poland.
Is this sufficient?
Definitely not, as we will need more interconnection capacities for the development of our internal electricity market.
But at least it provides interconnection between the Baltic energy grid and the Central European energy grid.
Â Â  . Major progress has been made in developing a competitive single European energy market, characterised by a level playing field.
However, as this question highlights, much remains to be done.
First, the second gas and electricity directives, which provide for common basic approaches to electricity and gas liberalisation, need to be implemented immediately by all Member States.
These directives should have been transposed by July 2004, but transposition is still pending in some countries.
I shall propose that the Commission send a reasoned opinion to these countries next week and intend to pursue these infringement cases rapidly, with the aim of moving to the final stage of the procedure: referral to the Court of Justice in summer, if nothing happens.
In addition, I have instructed my services to examine the implementing laws that have been adopted to ensure full conformity with the requirements of the directives.
Second, it is necessary to ensure a level playing field with respect to the detailed regulatory rules on issues such as tariff structures and third-party access rules.
This has been pursued through the consensus-building approach of the Florence and Madrid Forums which led to the regulation on cross-border trade in electricity that entered into force last year, and the equivalent regulation on gas, which we expect to be adopted very soon.
These new laws will make a major contribution to the rapid convergence of detailed trading rules on electricity in each country.
In this respect, the role of national energy regulators is central.
The existence of such a regulator was a key requirement of the directives, and joint action by them will be vital in ensuring that, from the point of view of the customer, there is one single European electricity and gas network, not 25.
It is for this reason that the Commission established a European regulatorsâ group, which is beginning to provide important results in this direction.
Third, we need to examine whether the present legislative provisions are adequate to achieve our objectives of a truly competitive EU-wide market with high levels of consumer and environmental protection, as well as security of supply.
In this respect the Commission will make a detailed report to the European Parliament and Council at the end of this year on both the internal market and competition elements.
This should in particular include a detailed examination of the adequacy of the already-existing measures.
The report should form a basis for a detailed, wide-ranging debate that enables conclusions to be drawn in 2006.
Finally, it should be noted that the entry into force of the new Constitution with a specific energy chapter would be of assistance in developing a coherent energy policy for the Community, strengthening the existing legal basis for action.
Â Â  Â Â Â Many thanks, Commissioner, for your answer, which is extremely significant, and for the extensive knowledge of the Polish energy sector you demonstrated in your responses to the questions by MrÂ Paleckis and MrÂ Posselt.
The latter is probably better acquainted with Bavarian pork knuckles than Polish power stations.
I should also like to thank you for your comments to the effect that the European Commission will insist that Member States honour their commitments in the energy sector.
I hope the European Commission will be guided in its actions primarily by the interests of European consumers, whether they be Polish, Lithuanian, Estonian or British, and I should like to say, on behalf of Polish consumers, that I am counting on this being the case.
Thank you for your very knowledgeable answers, Commissioner.
Â Â  . I have no comments.
Â Â  Questions Nos 31 to 55 will be replied to in writing.
That concludes questions to the Commission.
Â Â  The next item is a continuation of the debate on the report (A6-0045/2005), by MrÂ SÃ¡nchez Presedo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences [COM(2004)0699 â COM(2005)0043 â C6 0001/2005 â 2004/0242(CNS)].
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel very much in two minds about the whole preference system as such.
The fact that we are removing some of the obstacles to trade faced by the poor countries is obviously a good thing.
Trade does contribute to freedom, development and, especially, the prosperity that the poor countries are in extreme need of.
What is depressing, however, is the fact that there is any need at all for a special preference system for the poor countries and the fact that the consequences of Europeâs general trade policy are such that, in order to sleep well at night, we have to make exceptions to it for the sake of the poor.
Experience shows, moreover, that, as a policy, the preference system has, in very many ways, so far been of a symbolic nature.
Few poor countries have made use of the system, not least because it has been so complicated.
The objective must, of course, be for us to liberalise trade policy to the extent that we abandon the preference system in its entirety.
The European Union which, in spite of everything, is based upon a wise appreciation of the beneficial effects of free trade, should of course dare to go the whole way.
If we do not do so, how can trade, and indeed the world, become freer?
During the debate on this matter, I doubted, however, whether some MEPs remembered that European cooperation was based upon free trade.
More than one attempt was made in this House too to protect European sugar production and the textile industry which now already operate behind high tariff barriers â and all this at the expense of producers in poor countries.
I, for my part, obviously voted against these attempts, but there are still mumblings about our still having a long way to go.
I personally should like to see the new preference system actually go further, with already low customs duties abolished, opportunities for enhancing the regions improved and the system further simplified.
In conclusion, I wish to repeat my hope that, within the not too distant future, we shall reach a point at which European trade policy is so free, open and untrammelled that we do not in actual fact need any preference system, for European trade policy must be permeated by the same basic idea from which the EU proceeds, namely free trade.
Otherwise, we shall not experience Europe as Europe is, in actual fact, supposed to be.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate our rapporteur Mr Antolin SÃ¡nchez Presedo on his excellent work, which aims at greater transparency, clarity and above all efficiency in the generalised system of preferences.
I would also like to highlight the considerable steps forward made in this new regulation, not only in terms of simplification, with the reduction in the number of systems, while concentrating the benefits of the GSP in the countries that need them most, or in terms of encouraging compliance with practices that are in line with sustainable development and good governance, but also in terms of the quick adoption of the new regulation, in order to provide additional commercial support as soon as possible for the countries affected by the tsunami.
On this last point, I am, however, concerned about the capacity of the beneficiary countries, and particularly those affected by the tidal wave, to take the necessary administrative steps quickly in order to benefit from the new system.
Will the Commission have enough time to correctly evaluate the needs of the countries concerned?
I think that the rapporteurâs proposal of a transitional period until January 2006 is the most reasonable, especially as we know that these long and complex procedures have always limited the use of the scheme by poor countries.
Also, with regard to rules of origin, although I welcome the greater flexibility in the text, it should be a priority for the European Union to harmonise these rules at international level, in particular within the WTO.
Developing countries have to adapt to the specific rules of origin of each country that grants them a system of preferences, which makes the process very complicated and costly, to the point that sometimes it loses all commercial value.
I would also like to stress that Parliament asks the Commission to closely monitor the application of the new system, in order to determine whether it achieves its objectives, country by country.
The Commission needs to evaluate the system regularly, monitor its implementation and keep Parliament informed, which was not done in the past.
I would like to finish by saying that the GSP is not an instrument that can promote development in the poorest countries and their full integration into international trade.
If we really want to help poor countries to benefit from globalisation, we need to rethink world trade rules as a whole so that they are fairer, linking trade with sustainable development.
Â Â  Thank you, Mr President.
While talking about the scheme of generalised tariff preferences, I would like to address the question of the rules of origin and inter-regional cumulation with regards to the textile sector.
It is necessary to apply the principle of origin which has been in force until now and refrain from inter-regional cumulation.
Inter-regional cumulation would simplify the application of the rules of origin, however it would be the more competitive countries, China for example, which would gain any real benefit from this, not the least developed countries.
The abolition of the rules of origin would open the EU market to another 30 developing countries, including competitive India, while countries affected by the tsunami, for example Sri Lanka, would be unable to compete realistically.
Those EU Member States which have transferred their textile manufacturing to Asian states would benefit, while the textile industry of the EU's southern and new Member States would suffer, unemployment would increase with the collapse of the textile sector and this would not help implement the Lisbon goals.
When talking of global cumulation, the concept of the EU common market would on the whole become incomprehensible.
I would like to stress that the Committee on International Trade has rejected the proposal on inter-regional and global cumulation.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur on his work, particularly given that his first report in this Parliament relates to a sensitive and complex area on which Parliament has had to act quickly.
I would like to stress that our institution has not had sufficient time to consider and debate this complex subject in depth.
Nevertheless, the report by the Committee on International Trade improves the Commissionâs proposal and makes it more democratic, by enhancing the role of Parliament, and makes many aspects of it more balanced.
Following the imminent entry into force of the new system of generalised preferences (SGP), it will perhaps be necessary to carry out a prompt assessment in order to ascertain the scope of the modifications introduced, and Parliament's control function is going to be extremely important in relation to complex issues, such as the practical application of rules of origin.
I would like to stress my very positive view of the reference in the report to certain practical problems which may be faced by third countries in terms of immediate compliance with certain related international agreements, as in the case of El Salvador.
Furthermore, I am glad that our amendments have been incorporated, which draw attention to the sensitivity of fisheries products, in general, and tuna, in particular, which are subject to great legal requirements in the European Union and imports of which must be properly controlled, in order to prevent further problems for a very sensitive industry which, furthermore, operates in European objective 1 regions which are very dependent, economically and socially, on this activity.
I am pleased that we have persuaded the Commission to accept them, as Commissioner Mandelson acknowledged this morning.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which, as our colleague Mr Arif said, aims towards simplification and greater effectiveness of the generalised system of preferences.
More importantly, however, I wish to thank MrÂ SÃ¡nchez Presedo for considering the impact of the âEverything But Armsâ initiative, particularly in the area of sugar, especially in the light of the forthcoming reform of our common organisation of the market.
The recent example of the Balkans showed that limited access to the European market sometimes has the disadvantage of contributing to the development of an illegal triangular trade, which in the case of the fifty less advanced countries would probably generate a massive influx of sugar into the European market.
Therefore, as the reform of the COM means that European countries will now experience fluctuations and will therefore be subject to the vagaries of the market, a significant increase in the supply of sugar will result in a huge drop in prices in the Union, at the same time removing the economic value of the âEverything But Armsâ initiative for the least advanced countries.
This is why, following the repeated requests from the least advanced countries themselves and in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture, this report on the generalised system of preferences leaves open the possibility of adapting the âEverything But Armsâ initiative by allowing, if necessary, an extension of the transitional period preceding the complete opening up of the market.
This significant step forward due to the clear-sightedness of the rapporteur is necessary for the economic survival of the least advanced countries.
It will give them time, in accordance with the reform of the COM in sugar, to modernise their production structures in order to adapt to the new European order.
This is why it is imperative that the European Parliament adopts this text in order to take into account the specific nature of some sectors and so that the generalised system of preferences really fulfils its prime objective, which is the development of the countries that are most in need.
Â Â  â Mr President, the harmonious integration of developing countries into the multilateral trade system is, rightly, the stated objective of the Doha development programme.
No one can dispute the role of international trade as a necessary factor in economic development and the reduction of poverty, even more so when development is linked to other important components, such as environmental protection, social responsibility and proper governance.
The scheme of generalised tariff preferences is a very useful tool for aiding developing countries.
It is a most generous tool; however, its long period of application through renewals is leading to the unforced conclusion that it needs to focus on the countries that really need it and on fundamentally competitive products.
As far as sensitive products for the European Union are concerned, such as sugar, the abolition of duty and quotas on the basis of the timetable proposed by the Commission contains two risks.
The first risk is from mass imports of sugar on to the European market after 2009. This will harm sugar beet manufacturers and the uncompetitive sugar industries in Europe.
The second risk is inherent in the fact that the liberalisation of imports in application of the 'everything but arms' initiative, in conjunction with the strict proposal to review the COM in sugar, is expected to benefit not the less developed countries, which need a longer transitional period, nor the ACP countries, but the export interests of the oligarchies.
Consequently, it is necessary for the provision to suspend duty to be subject to longer deadlines and smaller quotas which, I hope, will be laid down when the COM in sugar is reformed.
Â Â  Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report.
Commissioner Mandelson made it clear this morning that the Commissionâs aim in bringing forward this revision of the GSP was to ensure better targeting of trade preferences to benefit the least developed and most vulnerable countries, simplify the GSP system and make it more transparent, improve access to the GSP system by improving the rules of origin and encourage good governance in the countries that benefit from the system.
All the rapporteurâs amendments take the Commission proposals further in that direction and I hope that the Commissioner will look closely at each of the amendments the rapporteur has proposed.
We have also had good cooperation between the Commission and Parliament in bringing forward the implementation date for this measure.
It was originally to come into force at the end of the year.
It is now planned to come into force from April onwards, to respond to the tsunami crisis.
While the volume of aid given to the countries affected by the tsunami has been welcomed, this measure will do more for them in the longer term.
By providing them with an opportunity to trade more easily with the European Union, we are giving them a hand up rather than a handout.
Finally, the rapporteur has indicated that he is prepared to accept an amendment that Mr Karim and myself put forward.
This would technically allow Pakistan to qualify for GSP aid.
I should to emphasise that, although that would allow them to qualify under the statistics, they will still have to meet the good governance clauses by signing up for the appropriate international agreements, so this would be a carrot to Pakistan to sign up to important international social conventions.
Â Â  First I would like to congratulate Mr Sanchez Presedo on his report.
Since being brought into being in 1971, the general preferential system has become a special instrument of European Union development policy.
At the same time it is important to stress that the European Union was the first to apply this system in practice, from its birth to today, and today the EU is still the biggest donor to this system, with the United States only the second, lagging a long way behind the Union.
I am happy that there is the opportunity for Parliament to give its opinion, and I very much hope that it will receive attention at the Commission and the Council.
Similarly it is excellent to see the system being simplified, and the switch from five pillars to three, which will probably, because of simplification, better meet its goals in developing countries.
I also want to emphasise the origination regulation, which the Commission deals with in its statement.
With regard to the form, content and procedural complexity of the origination regulation however, and its overall complexity, the result is that it is very hard to use, especially for the less developed countries.
Although the draft regulation does not bring too many changes to the current regime, the European Parliament, in its opinion of 14 October last year, which was passed with a large majority, declared that extending it to span the regions and make it fully global is absolutely necessary.
Finally I cannot stress enough the necessity of this â my colleague Mr van den Berg underlined this point this morning â that we extend the temporary period until 1 January 2006.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent report, in which he argues that development should be a basic principle underlying our trade policy, within a transparent and fair international system of trade.
The system of generalised preferences has played a fundamental role in reducing poverty and improving the economies of the developing countries.
As rapporteur on the negotiations within the WTO, within the framework of the Doha programme for development, I would like to stress that these systems can benefit each other mutually.
I believe it is necessary for this new SGP to be fully compatible with the agreement reached in Geneva last summer and with the negotiations being carried out in the WTO.
I share their rapporteurâs concern about the erosion of preferences which result from the tariff reductions agreed in the WTO.
I therefore believe it would be extremely appropriate for the Commission, once the round has finished, to produce a report on the possible impact of those agreements on the SGP and to propose appropriate measures to guarantee that the system is fully effective.
This would help to reduce the reservations of certain developing countries about the trade liberalisation proposed within the framework of the Doha negotiations, since the Union would take the necessary measures to maintain the current preferential treatment.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur for the work he has done and the Commission, obviously, for the positive changes to the scheme, by which I mean in particular its simplification and the introduction of GSP plus, which will prompt the neediest countries to adopt and apply a number of important conventions.
It is certainly also a good thing that a number of new products will be included in the scheme.
In addition, the recent change to the proposal in response to the tsunami disaster deserves our support.
As a result of it, the countries in question can enjoy the benefits of the new scheme more quickly.
Like a number of fellow Members, I should, though, make a brief comment on the date of introduction.
The countries need to submit an application to the Commission by as soon as 31 May.
This is incredibly quick, and it is therefore advisable to build in the necessary flexibility and provide for a sufficiently lengthy transitional period.
The countries that qualify for GSP plus, in particular, should be able to join the scheme after May 2005.
Moreover, the Commission should pay special attention to capacity buildingin those countries and should also, as far as possible, provide them with technical assistance in the transposition of, for example, the international conventions, thus enabling them to take optimum advantage of the GSP plus benefits.
Meanwhile, negotiations on economic partner agreements are being continued.
We must ensure that countries which do not ultimately wish to conclude an agreement in this manner still fall within the scope of GSP plus.
Finally, I should like to argue in favour of regular assessments of the schemeâs impact, both within the EU and on developing countries, since circumstances are subject to almost constant change â something of which what is currently happening in the areas of textiles and sugar provides sufficient evidence.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0040/2005) by MrÂ Wieland, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2003-2004 [2004/2090(INI)].
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report that makes an appearance in this House every year is not a final report; it is both a report on work in progress and an expression of self-imposed standards for the quality control of the work we do in the Committee on Petitions.
To summarise, I should like to say â without any of the flourish customary in this House â that we are in fact pleasingly efficient, when you compare our work with that of many committees on petitions at national level.
When the ministers for foreign affairs say that Europe needs a telephone number for the world, we can safely say that the European Parliament already has a letterbox for citizens.
We have done a very good job from various points of view.
Firstly, we have some degree of overview of various national structures.
Secondly, it is fully within our remit to intervene in processes implemented with varying degrees of success â Lisbon and Tampere, to name but two â which have not yet become well-established and are still in a state of flux.
We are able to act on a number of abuses, with the Commissionâs help, and thus also to showcase the reality of the European Union behind all the governmental channels.
A further reason why we are not doing so badly is that, compared with the national parliaments, we have very little obligation to follow majority or minority opinions, very little obligation to take account of protection and support for the relevant governing party.
Nevertheless, we should be striving for improvements, very general quality criteria for our work with regard to third parties.
Firstly â and this is one of the demands made in the report â there should be a substantial shortening of the deadline for action by the Commission in response to our enquiry.
Secondly, the deadline for a response by the Council or an individual Member State to the Commission should also be shortened.
We should also very much like a representative of the relevant Presidency to participate in the work of the Committee on Petitions.
In addition, we should like to see the appointment of a Presidency representative or coordinator responsible for petitions, ideally as early as six months before the start of the Presidency, to enable important petitions to be followed up in time.
Finally, we must take action on the issue of the distinction between the European Ombudsman â for which we now have staffing rights â as an institution, and the Committee on Petitions as an instrument.
I think that there is still a good measure of misconception in this regard.
If we can be more clearly identified, we will undoubtedly be better placed to carry out our respective duties.
However, we have to consider not only outward-looking, but also inward-looking, quality criteria.
By its very nature, the Committee on Petitions is a committee that is unique in terms of the extent and range of the work that comes its way.
I know that quite a few Members have certain reflexes regarding this unique committee and think that we expect to be given special treatment, but, in my opinion, it is in the interests of the European Parliament and of every single Member that we are able to deal with the petitions submitted as efficiently as possible.
Although I said that the work of the Committee on Petitions is good on balance, it must nevertheless be said that individual Members sometimes see the work as positively unsatisfactory.
Deficiencies are present and initial actions have been identified in three areas.
The first relates to the staff.
In our opinion, the committee has insufficient staff to achieve continuity in its work in terms of content and procedures.
Quite colloquially, I would say that the Houseâs administration sometimes gives the impression of seeing the role of the services of the Committee on Petitions as that of a punishment battalion.
This should be changed.
We also need to improve the software system that we have.

Secondly, the Members of the European Parliament have an intense desire for more specialisation in this work and, thirdly, the public have an interest in seeing a more rigorous approach with regard to the timescales mentioned above and also greater transparency. They are entitled to see an improvement in the way they are able to track the progress of their petitions.
Various initiatives are in place to do justice to the extent, range and specialisation of our work.
The extent and range of the Unionâs policies are growing, and specialisation sometimes involves difficult details.
In view of the course of the process, we need to be able to take decisions in good time.
We have therefore proposed, as a result of our deliberations, that an ad hoc committee be set up to work out further details for the next annual report.
Commissioner, we invite you most warmly to participate in this working party and to monitor its work.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Wieland for his analysis in this useful report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions in the 2003-2004 parliamentary year.
The Commission welcomes this report.
This debate represents a good opportunity to highlight why the right to petition the European Parliament is such an important way for Europeans to exercise their democratic rights.
It must be said straight away that citizensâ exercise of the right to petition does not just concern the European Parliament.
The petitions also represent a valuable opportunity for the Commission to get closer to citizens and their concerns.
Although no less than 1Â 313 petitions were tabled in the 2003-2004 period, it is clear that many citizens remain unaware of their right to petition.
Therefore I very much welcome the fact that the European Parliament is currently considering how this can be remedied and I can assure the Committee on Petitions and the rapporteur that they enjoy the total support of the Commission in that effort.
On that note, the Commission would like to congratulate the committee on its excellent work.
It is also very satisfactory to note the rapporteurâs assessment that cooperation between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions is generally good.
There is, of course, always scope for improvement, and I agree with the rapporteur on the need to further strengthen the partnership between the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman, the Council and the Commission.
I know this is particularly important since, due to resource constraints, the Committee on Petitions often has to rely on the resources of the Commission and the Council to give its petitions in-depth legal consideration.
I can assure Parliament that the Commission is pursuing its efforts to rationalise and accelerate internal procedures in response to requests for information.
As underlined in the report, the draft Constitutional Treaty confirms the right to petition.
In that context, the report refers to the need to establish common rules of conduct for all Community institutions and Member States.
It also suggests that this could be done along the lines of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour drawn up by the European Ombudsman.
The Commission can largely endorse this approach, although it draws attention to the anticipated development of the legal framework.
In particular, the text of the future Constitution introduces a legal basis that will make requests to the Committee on Petitions possible on the basis of the codecision procedure.
The report also calls on the Council and the Commission to review the 1989 interinstitutional agreement concluded with the European Parliament by an exchange of letters.
Such a review would aim to define a stronger framework for cooperation between the three institutions.
The Commission is open to that request.
To conclude, I should reiterate that I am committed to improving the way the European Union in general and the Commission in particular communicate with European citizens.
The right of EU citizens to good administration and access to documents and their right to submit complaints to the European Ombudsman and file petitions with the European Parliament all benefit communication and, ultimately, democracy.
I am available to talk to the European Parliament at any time, at the invitation of Parliament or any of its committees.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President. Commissioner, I am pleased to see you, a female Member of the Commission, here on International Womenâs Day.
First of all, however, I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ Wieland, for his excellent report.
Not only does it reflect the work of the Committee on Petitions, but it is also very informative and, above all, citizen-friendly and readable â which cannot be said about all the documents in this House.
My essential concern remains, however, how we can communicate to the public the Communityâs nature as something founded upon the rule of law.
One of the reasons for the excessively critical attitude towards the Community on the part of the public in a good few Member States is that it makes grand promises of rights and freedoms for EU citizens, but often fails to actually implement these completely, correctly and promptly.
There is still a considerable discrepancy between the EU blessings heralded to citizens with great fanfare and the way the law stands in everyday life.
What are the options open to citizens looking to fight these abuses?
One of them is their right to table petitions to the European Parliament.
Anchored in the Treaties and the new Constitution, this is one of the key Union civil rights, which is all the more important given that the Community is still not comparable with a State based on the rule of law, with all the attendant possibilities for enforcement.
For this reason, we need to work on building a Community with a real, lasting basis in the rule of law for individual citizens and enterprises, and also, as an initial step, on enabling EU civil rights to be enforced via the Committee on Petitions.
The first precondition for this is fast procedures with tangible results, which means infringement proceedings, too, with compensation for individuals.
The second is that the right of petition be made easier to use and more citizen-friendly, and the third is that all the Community institutions support it.
I see that as also meaning greater Council involvement, with it being present at sessions, and also the inclusion of Member States when it comes to their transposition of Community law.
Only this way can we be sure to build a Europe for citizens and with them, rather than without them.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and also congratulate Mr Wieland on his excellent report.
As a member of the Committee on Petitions, may I say that it is a really good example of a cross-party, consensual approach to problem-solving.
However, Member Statesâ responses are often inadequate.
Sometimes they are simply not forthcoming.
The Council is rarely present in the committees.
However, recognition is due to the Commission officials who regularly brief our committee for the work we are undertaking.
The committee is a brilliant interface between the citizens and the institutions and it brings forward solutions to problems at both EU and Member State level.
Member Statesâ intransigence is also highlighted.
I would, at this point, also like to pay tribute to our current chairman Mr Libicki, who has carried on the good work of our previous chairman.
There is only one element in Mr Wielandâs report with which I could perhaps quibble, and that is his reference in paragraph 17 to a standing working group or subcommittee.
This is, after all, a report on the previous yearâs deliberations and we should not undermine the role or the work of the Bureau and its coordinators.
But I look forward to seeing how we can address the issue of the increasing number of petitions that we have to deal with.
You will not have heard this from me before, Commissioner, but in that regard we will need additional resources.
Without the resources, we cannot serve our citizens.
The secretariat is severely understaffed, but again I have to pay tribute to its staff.
They work extremely hard and supply us with everything we need, but their job would be a lot easier if the secretariat was fully staffed.
We also need additional resources to promote the right of petition, especially in the new Member States, and to ensure that, where necessary, the Commission is fully willing and able to enforce the infringement process.
Finally, we must never forget that the right to petition enshrined in the Treaties is an important example of the exercise of citizensâ democratic rights and their ability to hold the institutions and their Member States to account.
Â Â  . Mr President, I am replacing my colleague, Mr Hammerstein Mintz, who is ill.
I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Wieland for his good work as rapporteur for the annual report on the Committee of Petitions.
This report is the first for this Parliament and because of the new Members it provides Parliament with extra information about the committee.
This committee is the most direct link between voters and Parliament.
It is like an ongoing dialogue, in which citizens should feel that they are being taken seriously and can have confidence in the EU.
In fact petitions are a strong tool for democracy.
Mr Wielandâs report reflects the serious need to develop the ability and capacity of the committee to deal with situations in which cooperation with the Commission does not work and/or the Commission does not take appropriate action.
It must be stressed that, in developing the ability of the Committee on Petitions to deal with those situations, the committee will need the support of Parliament as a whole.
Against that background, Mr Hammerstein Mintz tabled a few amendments to the report by Mr Wieland, which he as rapporteur and the committee as a whole unanimously supported.
That is very important.
They point out, firstly, that under the Nice Treaty, Parliament has the right to bring action against the Commission, for example, on the grounds of lack of competence; infringement of essential procedural requirements; infringement of the EC Treaty and of any rule of law relating to its application; and misuse of powers, irrespective of whether Parliamentâs prerogatives are concerned.
Thus the committee is also putting forward for Parliamentâs approval a statement that it is considered legitimate for Parliament to exercise its powers under Article 230 of the EC Treaty if this is necessary in order to put an end to a serious infringement of Community law that has been reviewed in the examination of a petition, and where a significant difference of interpretation persists â in spite of efforts to resolve it â between Parliament on the one hand and the Commission on the other, as regards the actions required by Community law for the protection of citizensâ rights in the case concerned.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pity that todayâs debate on this report is being held so late in the evening.
It may well be the case that not all Members of the House need to hear what we have to say, but I believe it is important that the public should have the chance to do so, even though there is unfortunately noÂ one at all in the public gallery.
The reason for this is that our committee differs from all the others.
It was set up with the express aim of making contact with people and with society.
The fact that people nowadays often feel bewildered and further removed than ever from the European institutions makes it all the more important that this committee allows them to feel part of the European Unionâs workings and its legislation, and provides them with an opportunity to resolve their problems.
I would therefore repeat that I think it is a great pity that we are holding this debate so late, in an entirely empty Chamber, and that so few people are present to hear the debate on MrÂ Wielandâs excellent report.
I should also like to thank him for this report.
Ladies and gentlemen, one point I should like to emphasise is that the number of petitions submitted to our committee has risen for the first time in the committeeâs ten-year history, or in other words since 1995.
After staying at more or less the same level during this ten-year period, there has recently been a sharp increase in petitions submitted.
Yet despite this fact, our committee is doing a good job.
This can be seen by comparing the length of time previously taken to deal with petitions with the length of time taken today.
There are a number of bodies whose work helps the committee to do such a good job.
These include the Bureau, comprising a chairman, a position I have the honour of occupying, and the vice-chairmen.
I should like to highlight the role played MrÂ Cashman as the committeeâs first vice-chairman, and the very positive contribution he makes to its work.
Other bodies involved in the committeeâs work include the coordinators, who play a key statutory role, and who perform their task very competently.
The committee also has a secretariat, which does an extremely good job.
I believe that this arrangement, namely a Bureau, comprising a chairman and vice-chairmen, together with coordinators and a secretariat, allows the committee to discharge adequately the duties incumbent upon it.
Proof of this can be seen in the ever shorter amount of time we require to carry out our work, as well as in the fact that the length of time citizens have to wait is constantly being reduced.
The only other point I have to make is that we are delighted at the excellent cooperation that exists between the committee and the European Commission.
I should like to inform the Commissioner, however, that if at all possible we would welcome more rapid responses in certain cases.
It sometimes takes a relatively long time to receive an answer on matters that are quite straightforward.
Furthermore, Commission officials sometimes provide oral answers and tell us that written answers will follow, yet we cannot give a full and binding answer to petitioners on the basis of an oral answer.
Many thanks, Mr President, and I should also like to thank all those who contribute to the work of our committee.
I should like to thank MrÂ Wieland, who is an outstanding and active member of the committee, and I should also like to thank MrsÂ WallstrÃ¶m for being present.
Many thanks.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the institution of the ombudsman, which is directly linked to the Committee on Petitions in order to ensure it is able to respond to the circumstances, as well as to the obligations of the European Parliament towards the citizens and the citizens' right to ask the extended family of the European Union for protection, fills us with responsibilities.
It is up to us to ensure that citizens do not lose their trust in the institutions which we support and try to apply to the majority of them.
The Committee on Petitions â and the rapporteur gives an excellent presentation of its work and its problems â emphasises the need for greater attention, respect and reinforcement of the services within the framework of its operation, both during preliminary work and during the processing of petitions, but is, nonetheless, important.
Citizens often complain about delays.
There is clearly a great deal of red tape in numerous Member States, which refuse or are unable to respond to the Commission's requests that they speed up the procedures for sending the information from which the Commission will draw its conclusions and judge accordingly.
We are disappointing the citizens.
We are causing them, in this way, to disdain the institutions and functions of Parliament.
We keep them away from knowledge.
They lose their trust and, as time goes by, they turn their back on us.
That is not our role.
The rapporteur proposes, denounces and clearly records the experiences of one year.
I, for my part, appreciate that the Committee on Petitions and its cooperation with the ombudsman and his services needs to be galvanised into greater action, given that, according to the initial data, there has been an increase in petitions in the order of 40% compared with the previous year.
There needs to be a qualitative increase in information for citizens and this will be achieved through cooperation between the competent European institutions, by which I mean between the European Parliament, the Committee on Petitions, the ombudsman and his counterparts in the Member States.
The authority of the Committee on Petitions depends on the respect that we show towards the four hundred and fifty million citizens who turn to us in the knowledge that procedures and appraisals, decisions and judgments come before interests and personal conduct.
We always talk very highly of you, Commissioner, and I want to ask a question.
How do you believe that the application of the justification of citizens is safeguarded by the Member States following the Commission's decision?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0044/2005) by MrÂ Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2004 [2004/2141(INI)].
Â Â  . Mr President, I shall start by expressing my thanks and paying tribute to colleagues across this House who regularly attend the ACP meetings and contribute so much to it.
I also pay equal tribute to the parliamentarians of the ACP countries, without whom this partnership and dialogue would not be possible.
In so doing, I would also like to pay tribute to the joint secretariats of our Parliament and the Assembly, the interpreters and staff who accompany us, and the Commissioners, officials and members of the presidency who attend.
This is a team effort and it is a team effort that we need to endorse and encourage.
However, this evening I would like to pay a particular tribute to the Co-President of the ACP, Glenys Kinnock, who has been away from our circle for some time.
It is very good to see her back this evening I hope in good health and ready to face the fray of the next Parliamentary Assembly.
Her contribution is fundamental to what we seek to do.
The European Parliament is a new parliament.
Slowly but steadily we have been taking on powers and becoming, I hope, more effective.
The same is true of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
That too has been slowly becoming more effective and, if not taking on powers, at least becoming more influential.
The Assembly started somewhat tentatively.
In the early days the European Parliament was perhaps dominant, but reliant all too often on separate House votes; whereas the ACP was a bit more on the defensive, often represented by ambassadors or delegations of only government parties.
Now we see change.
We see few if any separate House votes.
We see a parliament of parliamentarians.
We see the ACP gaining in self-confidence and indeed, most recently at our bureau meeting, raising issues about human rights in Europe; and quite right too.
The ACP was, for example, raising the issues of the British Government, its attitude to Guantanamo Bay and its proposals for the detention of suspects, or indeed people with mental health problems.
Now we look ahead.
We look ahead to budgetisation.
We hope that will come soon.
That will enable us to give proper scrutiny and proper control of the budget.
However, when we do that we will have to balance that scrutiny on behalf of our own taxpayers with acknowledgement of the ACP countriesâ right to a say in how money is spent; we need to be listening, as well as scrutinising.
We need to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals and the country strategy papers are adequate in themselves and adequately followed.
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly has now developed an effective system of standing committees, firing on all cylinders and getting members working together.
Despite the fact that during 2004 we had our European election and so things were more difficult, we managed with electronic communication to bring forth some effective reports.
My own with Mr Sanga of the Solomon Islands on food aid and food security was an example of that.
I would like to pay tribute to the Dutch Government for the way in which it hosted the Assembly in The Hague.
I think it learned a lot from our experience in Rome with their workshops and their visits.
I should also like to thank the Ethiopian Government for its hospitality and effective administration in Addis Ababa.
We are of a mind that, in Europe, we should continue to have one of the two Council presidencies per year hosting the Assembly, and perhaps to swap around the winter and spring to give the ACP Members a little more warmth of welcome in weather as well as politics.
But a lot has already been achieved.
In our debates we have a better balance of speakers from the floor and fewer long speeches from the platform, and we are of a mind that we should do more to support the new pan-African Parliament, perhaps with exchange of personnel.
But now we move on to Mali in April, when we will be looking at serious issues of human rights; humanitarian aid; post-tsunami development aid; working together to defeat poverty, hunger and disease; and to create the opportunities for achievement and the blossoming of those rich countries which make up the ACP of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.
Finally, I shall give the quotation from Yehudi Menuhin that I used in my report: âPeace may sound simple â one beautiful word â but it requires everything we have, every quality, every strength, every dream, every high idealâ.
That is why we seek to make the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly effective.
I believe we are doing so and I heartily endorse the work that all our colleagues put into this.
Â Â  . Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report on the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2004.
Over the last few years, the influence of the Assembly has increased.
Its role in political dialogue has strengthened and will be explicitly mentioned in the revised Cotonou Agreement.
The Assembly has become a true parliamentary forum, with lively debates.
In 2003, the Assembly took a major step forward by setting up standing committees.
It is because of those committees that cooperation between the European and ACP members has intensified and the emergence of a broad consensus within the Assembly has become possible.
The committees strengthen the role of the Assembly in monitoring implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, which states that meetings between EU and ACP Members of Parliament may be arranged at regional or sub-regional level.
That strengthens regional integration and fosters cooperation between national parliaments.
The resolution calls on the Assembly to organise these meetings.
The Commission is ready to make its contribution to the success of the new arrangements.
In conclusion, I would stress that the Commission shares your view on the Joint Parliamentary Assemblyâs role as a model of cooperation.
Â Â  . Mr President, over the past year, the seventh and eighth meetings of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly took place in Addis Ababa and The Hague, respectively.
Both were good meetings, but it was, of course, a particular delight for me, being Dutch, that the meeting in The Hague was so successful.
My compliments to all those involved.
I should like to draw your special attention to a few points.
First of all, relations with Zimbabwe.
In The Hague, we once again managed to prevent the blacklisted representatives of Zimbabwe from attending the meeting.
In Zimbabwe, human rights are being flagrantly violated and freedom of expression, association and assembly are being increasingly curbed, something that the report reflects.
In Europe, we have a list of people who are responsible for those abuses, and we have agreed that those people must be barred from meetings held in the EU.
More than once, Zimbabwe has sent representatives who feature on this list all the same.
It is a good thing that we once again managed to keep them away from the JPA.
We must persevere in our stance in order to increase the pressure on Zimbabwe.
I would also like to thank the ACP delegation for their support in this matter.
Then there is the resolution on Darfur.
The situation in Sudan is awful.
It is the longest-running conflict in Africa, and, if the information is correct, 2 million people have now been killed and 4 million people are on the run. have, over the past few days, issued a report on the occasion of International Womenâs Day in order to bring the issue of rape and violence against women once again to our attention.
It happens, and that is bad enough, in all war zones, but nowhere on the scale as is happening in Sudan.
These and other abuses were emphatically condemned in the resolution.
It is mainly thanks to Mrs HybÃ¡Å¡kovÃ¡ that we managed to adopt the resolution without any dissenting votes, and that is quite a feat, considering the large number of African countries who were involved in this.
I should like to congratulate her on this.
The ACP is a special delegation in the European Parliament, because it is a joint assembly that aims to strengthen democracy, promote good governance and protect human rights.
Moreover, its capacity to tackle difficult topics and enter into political dialogue in the right manner has grown in recent years.
The value of this has once again been borne out.
Congratulations to Mr Bowis for the report.
I am looking forward to the forthcoming meeting in Mali.
Â Â  . Mr President, you will be very familiar with the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, having been a very effective and hard-working Vice-President of it in the past.
I wish to begin by thanking Mr Bowis for his report, which reflects his own very strong personal commitment not only to the JPA but also to development.
His particular interest, knowledge and expertise in relation to health issues have been of great importance to our work in that Assembly.
His report shows that the Assembly has grown in maturity over the last few years.
Its work needs to flourish and be reinforced in the ways indicated in the report, because the Assembly forms the very democratic foundations of the ACP-EU partnership.
The Cotonou Partnership Agreement emphasises very clearly the importance of the Assembly, but omits to award enough importance, if any at all, to the role of national parliaments in our cooperation.
It is very important that the forms of cooperation we have continue beyond the meetings with our parliamentary colleagues so that we can support their efforts, as elected representatives, to conduct dialogue with their governments, to scrutinise the legislation and actions of their governments and to hold their governments to account.
Sadly, an inability to do this is often a feature of the relationship between parliaments and governments in developing countries.
As the rapporteur suggested, with reference to the Pan-African Parliament, there is often a lack of institutional capacity.
Parliaments are short on staff and equipment and often lack the basic technical knowledge needed to make their work more effective.
This is an important issue and one we shall pursue in Mali.
In fact, just the other day a Member of the Malian Parliament with whom I am in contact told me that it is difficult for parliamentarians there to exercise legislative power, because the executive branch simply does not provide them with information.
I agree with Mr Bowis that an important part of our work is to build up this critical democratic culture in the ACP parliaments with which we work.
Central to this are the links with these parliaments that transit through the EDF and financing.
As Budget Commissioner, Mrs GrybauskaitÄ will have a particular interest in ensuring that parliamentarians are aware of how this money is spent in their countries and also in the Economic Partnership Agreements.
Mr Bowis talked about the committee's bedding-down.
That is happening and the fact that people are slightly dissatisfied about the amount of time they have is merely symptomatic of how successful the whole process is.
The JPA continues to grow and flourish, nurtured as it is by our determination to increase our effectiveness and to ensure that both our political voice and that of the parliamentarians from the ACP countries are heard.
The JPA has a monitoring and supervisory role that is unique. There is nothing else like it in terms of North-South connections between parliamentarians.
We must therefore continue to ensure that we can effect change in the 77 developing countries concerned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank MrÂ Bowis for his report.
There are a lot of positive things to say about ACP cooperation and MrÂ Bowisâs work on strengthening the ACP-EU Assembly.
Given the concern felt by our colleagues in the ACP countries about budgetisation, I think it important for the role of the ACP-EU Assembly to be strengthened in those countries.
If it is acceptable to yourselves, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to propose a slight change to paragraphÂ 11 in order further to strengthen the wording.
The inclusion of the European Development Fund in the EU budget âshould be accompanied by a reinforcementâ of the Joint Parliamentary Assemblyâs role, instead of âshould enable âŠ to be reinforcedâ, the former being clearer.
In that way, we shall be expressing a clear desire to ensure that our friends from the South also have influence.
The low turnout at the committee meetings in Brussels is a major problem.
The last time, there were only a few of us from the EU, which was a disappointment to our guests.
A representative from Africa summarised the reaction: in Africa, it is regarded as impolite to invite guests through the one door and, at the same time, leave through the other oneself.
This situation damages our relations with other countries, for, as matters stand, we are forced to choose between votes on legislation and cooperation with other countries.
I would therefore ask the Conference of Presidents to review its decision and allow us to hold ACP meetings some time during the weeks in which the political groups meet, since no votes on legislation are held then and we can decide, internally in the groups, on our agendas.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I too wish to thank MrÂ Bowis for his constructive work.
It is also clear that the work in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has developed encouragingly in recent times.
We have obtained significantly more focused discussions, which largely has to do with the fact that we have a system in which we work in committees and prepare the topics.
It is also a change for the better that we have meetings in different EU countries.
There are, however, a number of problems that we need to remedy very soon.
Just as MrÂ Schlyter stated, involvement on our part in the committee work is disastrously low.
I completely agree with the demand to hold these meetings instead during the weeks in which the political groups meet so that there is a rather better presence on our part.
Certain ACP countries still send diplomats instead of parliamentarians, which is not particularly good.
Moreover, we need to be better at following up a number of the decisions we take.
A very large part of the work in the Joint ACP-EU Assembly is about human rights and attempting to solve and prevent armed conflicts.
It is therefore striking that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not mentioned even once in the entire report, in spite of its being one of the most important tools we have in this area.
We have certainly worked with the ICC on a number of occasions, but we could develop that work significantly.
It is one of the most important and most effective tools we have for holding those who commit genocide and war crimes accountable.
Because they founded this court and now operate it, the EU and a number of ACP countries have a common interest.
The first two cases taken up by the Court concern Uganda and Congo, which are ACP countries.
The biggest current obstacle to developing the International Criminal Court is the United Statesâs tough resistance.
We can see how the United States now actively punishes ACP countries in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific which dare to sign the agreement concerning the International Criminal Court.
We should do more in our Assembly to defend these countries both politically and economically when the United States withdraws its aid as a punishment.
Â Â  â (MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that almost everything which needed to be said about the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly during 2004 has already been said by previous speakers, following the excellent report submitted by Mr Bowis.
As far as I am concerned, given my recent membership of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I propose to make only three very brief points.
The first concerns the very limited response by civil society to the work of the Assembly.
I do not believe this is something we should consider as inevitable or normal.
Virtually no attention is being paid to it by the European public, which seems mistaken to me, in view of the fact that this type of experiment is original â indeed unique âin the world.
We should perhaps reflect on this fact and plan to achieve a genuine step change in the future.
The second point is related to the first and concerns the need to broaden the political dialogue, bringing it increasingly into the public domain.
Bearing in mind the current world situation, there is a powerful need to re-establish an open and frank dialogue between the countries of the North and those of the South.
The experience of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has been a positive one from this point of view, albeit not without its problems.
We need to make progress decisively and patiently in the field of human rights and towards a strengthening of the International Criminal Court, in order to achieve greater mutual understanding.
The third and final point concerns the need to understand that greater political trust between the European Union and the ACP countries can also be achieved by the parallel creation of a firm base of economic relations, able to provide substance to the Cotonou partnership agreement.
This aim should also be seen in the context of the reform of the sugar regime, achieving a fair balance between the interests of European and of ACP countries.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to lend my voice, last but not least, to the chorus of congratulations to the rapporteur MrÂ Bowis on his excellent report.
He refers to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a forum for political dialogue several times in his report, and also encourages this Joint Parliamentary Assembly to strengthen the political dialogue and its own political role.
He demonstrates that we have improved in recent years and during recent sessions and, in sectionÂ 6, welcomes the fact that we have achieved compromise amendments and compromise resolutions with our partners among the ACP states.
I should like to add, however, that it was not always the ACP states that insisted on a split vote, it was sometimes our groups, when there had been no majority vote at the plenary sitting of this ACP Assembly.
As has already been said several times, the creation of the Standing Committees is a good basis for improving the political role of the Joint Assembly, and I concur with what MrÂ Schlyter said: that we must consider how to improve their working methods.
They provide us with the opportunity of discussing our requirements in greater detail, and also of following up our political requirements as appropriate.
Following up the requirements â what has become of them, what has been transposed â is at least as important as setting them.
I believe we must consider how to fix the dates for these committee sessions, for, as has also been said before, it is disgraceful how few of us are able to participate.
This is not, of course, because we are unwilling to take part in them; in reality, though, when the committees of the European Parliament are meeting at the same time, we have to attend those, sometimes in order to take part in important votes.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Voting will take place on Wednesday at 12.30 p.m.
Â Â  The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
