That is quite a broad subject that makes no specific reference to a name or country, although we all know exactly what this is about.
It is about the human tragedies in Ceuta, Melilla and on Lampedusa.
We should simply call it by its name.
Initially, most of the groups were in favour of a proposal by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, who had stated that the debate should be entitled , and which had received the backing of most of the groups.
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Socialist Group has withdrawn support for this and the fog has lifted.
I want us to take another vote on this title, which should make it much clearer what we are talking about, and I also am relying on the Socialist Groupâs honesty with regard to the debate we will be having today.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, we must now consider some amendments to the agenda for today and tomorrow.
The first amendment relates to what Mrs Buitenweg has just explained and consists of adding, before the statements by the Council and the Commission on Iran, Council and Commission statements on the current problems in the field of immigration.
Mrs Buitenweg has just proposed an amendment to the title of this item on the agenda in order to specify certain places where the problem arises.
Â Â  Mr President, I wonder whether there might not perhaps have been a misunderstanding.
While it is the case that there are specific examples of it, it is also clear that migration to Europe, being a general and fundamental problem, cannot be solved at the locations to which MrsÂ Buitenweg has referred.
It is for that reason that we opted for this all-embracing title and are inclined to stick with it.
Â Â  In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I can allow one Member to speak in favour.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I totally support MrsÂ Buitenwegâs request, because this is not just any old debate on immigration.
We shall have other such debates, moreover.
The problem is that, this time, men have died.
On this subject, I am sorry that, at the start of the sitting, we did not pay tribute to these innocent victims.
Extremely serious acts have been committed on both sides of Europeâs southern border, acts so serious that even colleagues who do not see European immigration policy in the same terms as ourselves could, I think, join us in deploring and condemning them.
That is why I fully support changing the title and specifying âCeuta, Melillaâ.
Â Â  Mr President, I should also like to make it clear to MrÂ Swoboda, who wants to have a general debate, that such a debate will take place during the next part-session in Strasbourg, as immigration/migration is on the agenda with the report by Mrs Klamt.
Â Â  The next item on the agenda is the Council and Commission statements on current problems regarding immigration.
Â Â  . Mr President, this morning and this summer has seen an unprecedented level of irregular migration across the Mediterranean into the European Union.
The tragic loss of life of those drowned at sea and those seeking to cross the European Unionâs borders illegally has sharply brought into focus the problems we face in managing migration flows and tackling illegal immigration.
Although attention is focused on the recent events at the Spanish-Moroccan border in Ceuta and Melilla, Malta and the Italian island of Lampedusa have also faced serious problems in recent months.
The Member States that border the Mediterranean suffer a disproportionate burden in providing support for those in need of international protection whilst at the same time being responsible for intercepting and returning illegal immigrants who have no right to enter the European Union.
Dealing with these issues in a firm but fair way which meets our international commitments is a shared concern for the European Union.
Member States must shoulder this burden together.
I do not propose in the course of our debate this afternoon to comment on the specific issues in Spain, Italy or Malta.
The Commission sent a technical mission to Ceuta and Melilla earlier this week and is reporting on its findings to the Justice and Home Affairs Council today.
I am sure that Commissioner FigeÄŸ will speak in more detail on these matters in a moment or two.
It is important that we realise that these events are the symptoms of a wider problem which requires a long-term solution.
In recent years the European Union has made substantial progress in adopting common minimum standards in asylum and immigration legislation and in working together on joint border operations now in the framework of the new European Border Agency, Frontex.
However, this has clearly not been enough.
To respond to regular migration requires us to work more effectively with countries outside the European Union.
It is right that the European Union is seeking to engage its collective weight to enhance cooperation on migration with source and transit countries.
The Commission and Member States have made substantial technical and financial support available to third countries to help improve their management of migration flows.
This is happening through European Union funded programmes and through bilateral projects.
There are real outcomes such as strengthened border controls and improved capacity to manage migration, including to protect refugees and displaced persons.
In addition, the European Union has stepped up the pace of its negotiation of readmission agreements, with an agreement now finalised with Russia, an important transit country, and negotiations ongoing with Morocco.
This work needs to continue.
Last month, Justice and Interior Ministers discussed migration issues with North Africa and Africa as a whole at their informal Council in Newcastle.
They gave a strong endorsement to deeper European Union engagement.
This is a priority for the UK Presidency and we will pursue a genuine partnership with Africa on migration, including through EuroMed and the African Union.
An important example is the European Unionâs current work to enhance migration cooperation with Libya on border management and asylum protection.
The June Council described this as âurgent and essential to avoid humanitarian disasters and prevent further loss of lifeâ.
Since then there has been joint training with Libya on border guards and work on improving on search and rescue techniques.
Equally important is cooperation with Morocco, which has signed up to a joint paper with the Spanish and French setting out measures to combat illegal immigration, including early warning and aid for victims of trafficking.
Ideas from this paper will be taken forward at the EU-EuroMed Summit in November.
Finally, the European Union must work together with countries of origin and transit to build capacity for refugee protection in these regions.
Here we are making concrete progress.
The Justice and Home Affairs Council and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees are today discussing the implementation of regional protection programmes.
These regional protection programmes are designed to create the conditions for people to resettle and integrate closer to their regions of origin, or in countries that they transit through.
The European Unionâs policy on migration and asylum needs to be carefully balanced and indeed carefully considered.
Migration is a complex issue and issues of border control, illegal immigration and the protection of refugees should not be confused.
However, public support for managed migration and the welfare of migrants themselves depends on firm action against illegal immigration and the organised crime that all too often supports it.
That is why the UK Presidency feels it is important to push ahead with European Union cooperation with third countries to avoid further human tragedies in the Mediterranean and to establish managed migration that works in the interests of the European Union and indeed of its neighbours.
Â Â  . Mr President, today is a special day.
This morning we had a meeting of the two Commissions â the European Union Commission and the African Union Commission â and this issue was part of the complex agenda and strategy discussed between these two important organisations.
The European Commission recalls that since the Tampere European Council in 1999, the European Union approach towards migration and asylum issues has been a balanced one.
On the one hand it protects and enhances the right of those who reside lawfully or are in need of international protection, and on the other side it combats abuse and fights illegal immigration.
The Hague action plan confirmed and strengthened this approach to migration management.
The set of measures adopted by the Commission on 1Â September in this field bodes well with this approach.
A series of measures on integration of third-country nationals has been proposed which aims to improve the rights and status of legal migrants within the European Union.
At the same time it adopted a proposal on return which will contribute to a more effective fight against illegal immigration, while preserving full respect for human rights.
This important course of action will also be accompanied by other initiatives dealing with the external dimension of our policies and the impact they may have on the development and protection capacities of third countries.
Later this year the Commission intends to adopt a policy plan on legal migration which will constitute an important further step towards this balanced approach.
The recent tragic events mentioned by some of you and by Minister Alexander which occurred in the towns of Ceuta and Melilla remind us once again how important it is to find a comprehensive and forward-looking response to migration issues.
Failing this, migration may well turn into a humanitarian tragedy, the consequences of which are difficult to predict.
In the immediate aftermath of these events, Vice-President Frattini has decided to send a technical mission to Morocco and to Spain to get a first-hand assessment of the current migration situation and to explore ways in which the EU might assist the countries concerned in addressing this serious situation.
At tomorrowâs hearing in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Vice-President Frattini intends to provide more details on the findings of this technical mission.
He has asked me to convey to you his sincere apologies for not being able to take part in this important debate today but, as many of you probably know, Vice-President Frattini is today taking part in the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg.
It is clear that it is urgent to do more to tackle the problem of illegal immigration.
Our aim should be to work with all countries concerned with a view to avoiding further loss of life and human suffering.
We need to develop a comprehensive approach which includes a variety of instruments ranging from law enforcement to development assistance.
Fences alone are not the answer to this human tragedy.
Fences will not stop desperate people from risking their own lives in an attempt to enter the European Union.
The Commission fully understands Parliamentâs concerns, as clearly indicated in the recent report on the reception conditions of irregular immigrants in Lampedusa.
It should be stressed that this problem does not concern Italy alone.
Recent reports from non-governmental organisations and individual complaints have highlighted that several Member States, not only those particularly affected because of their geographical situation, may face problems in providing adequate standards in the reception of asylum seekers.
Following the entry into force of the directive on minimum standards for the reception conditions of asylum seekers, which came into force on 6Â February this year, the Commission is currently examining the national measures for the transposition of this directive.
Vice-President Frattini will provide more information tomorrow about the way in which the Commission intends to proceed on this issue in particular.
The Commission is aware that Parliament also intends to carry out several visits to other reception centres following the visit to Lampedusa.
The findings of the European Parliament will be taken into due account in the report to be prepared by the Commission.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen terrible things happening over recent days in Ceuta and Melilla, but Ceuta and Melilla are no more than the tip of the iceberg.
In Mayotte, Malta or Lampedusa, and all over the place, we can see streams of refugees, but the new Member States in the East of the European Union have also recorded constantly increasing numbers of people who have no legal right to be there.
The only reason why their problem has not been exposed to public view is that the images are less compressed and pack less of a punch.
All these images, though, represent human beings with their individual fates, and they put us on the spot.
One of the tasks of politicians is to prevent certain abuses from occurring in the first place, and instead to give help as quickly as possible.
What we see at present are the consequences of sins of omission and of action on the basis of false premises.
Addressing the symptoms alone is no sort of solution; we also have to face up to the underlying causes.
Both now and in the future, we will have a great deal of pressure from migration to cope with; managing the flow of migrants is one of the European Unionâs most pressing tasks.
Any European immigration policy must have as its objective the management of legal migration, the provision of humanitarian aid in accordance with the Geneva Convention on Refugees and, at the same time, the prevention of illegal migration.
It follows that any European immigration rules must guarantee not only the security of our external borders but also the consistent combating of the practice of smuggling and trafficking in people, and a clear returns policy.
Carting people off into the desert is inhumane and an admission of defeat in the face of all the things we have not yet dealt with.
Nor, though, does it help to let a few hundred or a few thousand illegals in Ceuta and Melilla into the EU in the belief that we have thereby solved the problem.
According to the UNHCR, there are 4.6Â million refugees in Africa.
Non-governmental organisations work on the basis of estimates according which 20 000 people are waiting in Morocco.
There is, unfortunately, no single solution to this; what we need is a package of solutions.
The EU must lay down unambiguous rules for migration, while, at the same time, giving more aid to the countries from which migrants come and through which they pass, but it must also be equally consistent in ensuring adherence to the rules applicable to the crossing of our external borders.
That will involve not only a consistent policy on return but also the conclusion by the EU of readmission agreements with countries of origin and of transit.
These are all things that we must resolve together; one cannot always pick out the bits that fit the passing moment and win public approval.
This is our task, and we must face up to it!
Â Â  MrÂ President, human dramas are played out at Europeâs borders; thousands of immigrants arrive ever more regularly, particularly in Malta, Lampedusa, Ceuta and Melilla, and we have received an alarming report about the situation in the Lampedusa camp following our visit, a report that confirms our worst fears.
Moreover, we have all been very alarmed over the last few days by the way in which would-be immigrants have been abandoned in the desert and by the violence to which they have been subjected.
We are talking about women and men, often accompanied by children, who have taken the painful decision to leave their countries.
They are fleeing extreme poverty, destitution or violence.
All that they want is to live in peace and dignity, and our present European asylum and immigration policy has not been able to come up with proper responses.
Our asylum policy needs to match our values.
I would remind you that respect for human dignity is the subject of the first article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Moreover, the proper response to the current challenge lies in European solidarity.
It is unacceptable that we should leave countries situated on the borders of Europe to manage these situations on their own.
We need to equip ourselves with the resources to combat the forms of destruction threatening the planet: war, terrorism, poverty and under-development, not forgetting those other forms of destruction including contempt for human rights and the growth in intolerance linked to xenophobia and to issues of national and ethnic identity.
Let us say out loud that, if we have the will and if we use the political tools available to us, we have the ability to help curb the phenomena that now appear most to threaten our human destiny.
We already have the answer.
There is a close link between consolidating peace and eliminating poverty.
Individual financial security is a basic component of culture and peace.
Eliminating poverty is basically about developing human resources and distributing them fairly, and it must be accompanied by education.
There can be no peace or controlled immigration unless poverty is reduced.
Fortress Europe does not exist. It is a fantasy.
We must understand, and quickly too, that it is necessary to show solidarity with developing countries and that it is necessary to promote peace and prosperity everywhere in the world.
That is not a fantasy and it is not utopian. Will is required, as are the resources for giving expression to that will.
Â Â  . Mr President, barely 15Â kilometres south of my Gibraltar constituency, thousands of sub-Saharan migrants are massed near the border of Fortress Europe.
Many are hungry and weak after their journey through the deserts and mountains of Africa.
They struggle against disease, violence and the exploitation of criminal gangs.
Now we learn that they are dying at the fences which separate poverty from prosperity, or that they are left in the desert without food and water.
Many of us remember such scenes from Bible study.
The difference is that this Exodus will not be solved by divine intervention â only by political action.
Africa is Europeâs backyard: our near neighbourhood.
We cannot fence ourselves off from it, closing our doors and our eyes to its social and economic problems.
In the words of the poet Thomas Gray, we must not âshut the gates of mercy on mankindâ.
The flood tide of migrants along our southern borders is upsetting our cosy calculation that inequality can be sustained without cost.
With developing countries, remember this: the hungry vote with their feet.
So either we accept their produce and allow their economies to prosper or we accept their migrants.
Our futures are interdependent.
Sustainable economic, social and political development in Africa is a common concern, essential to Europeâs future.
We recognised this in 1995, when the Barcelona Process enshrined multilateral relations across the Mediterranean as the new strategic reality.
Ten years on, Spain is negotiating a plan with Morocco to tackle immigration and promote cooperation with the countries of origin.
Partnership is certainly the way forward.
However, until Moroccoâs border guards stop shooting unarmed refugees; until Morocco stops dumping them near its borders unable to fend for themselves, the European Union cannot, and should not, offer support for these proposals.
Most of those affected today are not Moroccan nationals: they are third-country nationals who entered the Union via Morocco and who deserve the protection of our laws.
Up to now, plans for a European consensus on migration policy have been buried at the bottom of the political inbox.
Why?
Member States cannot agree on any one approach the European Union suggests.
But that does not stop them demanding European action when they face specific immigration problems of their own.
The problems facing Melilla and Ceuta are not just Spainâs problem: they are Europeâs problem.
The challenge in Lampedusa is also Europeâs problem, however much Italy seeks to hide it from visiting MEPs.
No wonder the southern countries of the Barcelona Process have run out of patience.
We need to think bigger and to recognise, as Kofi Annan said, that âmigrations are necessaryâ.
We need a consensus on economic policy.
We need Doha and Hong Kong to bring results to help Africa.
When Commissioner Louis Michel outlines his strategy for Africa later today, I hope the Member States will heed his message that it is time for a European consensus on development and immigration that respects the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.
Â Â  . Mr President, let me say that I agree with most of what Mr Watson from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has said, and it is unfortunate that we were not holding hands when the title of this debate was being discussed, but that is just by the by.
My group would like to extend heartfelt thanks to the Commission for the prompt despatch of a delegation to the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta.
The situation there is indeed a tragic one, and concerns the whole of Europe.
I would like to hear from the Commission, though, whether it has also been to take a look at the border region between Morocco and Algeria, which is where a huge number of migrants are being abandoned without food or drink in the desert, in no manâs land.
Whilst the Spanish Foreign Minister is behind the idea of bussing people back to their countries of origin, the big problem is that, very often, they never arrive at their destinations.
We in this House cannot refuse to check where people are taken.
We owe it to ourselves and to the people of the European Union to know where people are taken and whether people perish in the desert.
I would also like to know whether the delegation has looked into the legitimacy of Spain transferring migrants to Morocco.
As far as I know, the bilateral readmission agreement only allows Spain to extradite Moroccans to Morocco, not people from Ghana, Liberia or Mali, as is the case here.
Is that acceptable?
Among those migrants, are there also people who have applied for asylum?
Is that being looked into or are we talking about a kind of wholesale deportation?
In fact, why did this delegation only contain people who are mainly involved in border control?
Did it also comprise human rights experts and did it examine how people are treated by the local authorities?
Here in the European Union, we are always delighted when people seize opportunities, develop themselves or look for new prospects, but whenever those who do this are people from outside the European Union who try to seize opportunities within it, they are treated as virtual criminals.
I share Mr Watsonâs view that it is time we looked for a legal migration channel.
Have we given any consideration to the kind of people that are involved?
It is mainly young men who have learned a trade and who know that there is no future for them in their own countries.
We all need to set down to develop a legal migration channel.
That would benefit not only the channelling of illegal migration, but also the dynamism of our European economy.
Let me close by saying that the European project has to do with civilisation â a civilisation that should not be for Europeans alone.
It is really high time we rolled up our sleeves and focused, not merely on stricter border controls or tighter rules, but rather on the opportunities we can offer people who desperately want to enter the European Union.
Â Â  .
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is hypocritical to talk about immigration today without discussing the double barrier separating the enclave of Melilla from Africa; this barrier represents, in symbolic terms, the failure of our approach to building a Europe of peace, social justice and intercultural co-existence.
Only two days ago, a delegation from our group was able to see for itself the barbaric nature of this place: a militarised border, a terrifying spot that acts as a great divide between hope and death.
It is a sort of reactionary utopia to think that one can curtail the free movement of men and women with the barbed wire separating two continents.
It is a selfish folly to create a physical barrier between prosperous and comfortable Europe and the relentless desperation of those fleeing hunger and war who, instead of being welcomed and assisted, are pelted with the rubber bullets of the Spanish and the Moroccan army.
The Spanish Government bears joint responsibility both for the mass deportations carried out by the Moroccan Government and for the deaths in the desert of dozens of people.
On that point, the accusations made by many non-governmental organisations operating in Ceuta and Melilla are serious, and on behalf of my group I call for a committee of enquiry to be set up immediately to find out the truth and who was responsible for what happened in Ceuta and Melilla, as well as to investigate the way in which immigrants are received in Europe.
It is unacceptable in political and legal terms, as well as in ethical and human terms, to have mass expulsions from European territory.
The immigrants who have climbed only the first barrier at Melilla, without managing to get over the second, have been expelled from European territory without any kind of recognition, without any attempt to find out their origin and without any check as to whether they might have been entitled to refugee status.
The Commissionâs conduct with regard to what has happened is unacceptable: confining itself to preaching the protection of human rights, it is behaving like the three monkeys: it does not see, it does not hear, and it does not speak about the many violations committed by the Member States.
Spain has acted as Italy did when it carried out mass deportations from Lampedusa to Libya, with immigrants being abandoned in the desert as a result.
It is deplorable that the Council is talking today about enhanced cooperation with Libya when it should be demanding that Libya ratify the Geneva Convention.
All this, however, is being swept under the carpet.
The Lampedusa and Libya incident, which was considered to be a highly serious irregularity, is now becoming usual practice.
This Parliament, which condemned Italy and its government for the criminal act of deportation to Libya, must now act consistently, which is the reason why we are calling on the groups which voted with us for the resolution on Lampedusa to now draw up a resolution condemning the events in Ceuta and Melilla.
We cannot accept a principle whereby Europe grants the rights guaranteed by international and Community treaties only to the strongest and luckiest immigrants who have succeeded in climbing over the second barrier as well, since such rights should not be governed by a natural selection mechanism.
That would lead to Europe becoming â as Thomas Hobbes said â a state of nature.
The right to be received should be an inalienable right.
A decent and humane reception should be provided at the Melilla processing camp, which would, unfortunately, be in contrast to the reception provided on Lampedusa.
We were able to ascertain â as confirmed by an investigative report by the biggest Italian weekly paper â that human rights are being systematically violated on Lampedusa.
We believe that it is not possible to build Europe with barriers and barbed wire: what we need to do, instead, is to try to open the borders to ensure that Europe has a future and a hope of success.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is a persistent pretence of not seeing or understanding that the policy of closing the borders and preventing the invasion of illegal immigrants is the only policy that can remove the danger posed by traffickers in human beings.
All the left does is talk about human rights, without proposing the steps that need to be adopted to combat those that traffic in illegal immigrants, uprooting millions of people from their own countries.
That is what we would like to hear from anyone who upholds human rights.
Lampedusa has been spoken of as if it were GuantÃ¡namo.
That is simply ridiculous and, in view of the fact that I am one of the group of MEPs that went to Lampedusa, I can confirm that I personally heard someone say: âIt is too clean, there is something not right hereâ, because the reception centres in other parts of Europe are all much dirtier and more disorganised.
We should therefore give credit to the Italian Government â which is spending tens of billions of taxpayersâ money â for what it is doing on Lampedusa, where medical assistance is provided 24 hours a day, in contrast to the provision for European citizens.
It is shameful that certain newspapers are trying to besmirch the work of Italian volunteers and the , who should be held up as a model for the whole of Europe for the way in which they conduct themselves on Lampedusa and on the sea aiding illegal immigrants.
That is what the gentlemen of the left ought to ascertain, instead of pretending to be unaware of what the Zapatero government is doing, when in fact it is firing on illegal immigrants.
Â Â  . â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since I now know him well, I am willing to understand MrÂ Cataniaâs exaggerations, emphases and fantasies â which are all pessimistic, naturally.
I will ask Mr Watson, instead, to verify his information before talking about the conduct of the Italian Government, so that he can avoid talking rubbish in this Chamber.
In any case, Mr President, in the light of recent events in Ceuta and Melilla, I hope that all the Member States are finally becoming fully aware of the fact that illegal immigration is a European problem and that rigorous and concerted action on the immigration issue cannot be put off any longer, even for a second.
I note with pleasure that the Commission, with a view to reinforcing the European area of freedom, security and justice, intends to allocate, for the 2007-2013 period, significant resources for the management of migratory flows, laying down specific measures to combat immigration and promote integration.
I hope that, with the sums allocated for the strengthening of the external borders and for the creation of a European fund for refugees and another for those who are repatriated, an assessment will also be made of the possibility of upgrading reception centres along the model of the Lampedusa centre, which has been unfairly attacked by the left.
Unfortunately I do not have the time to dwell on what Mr Zapatero has done in recent days, but it is true to say that, with a few rare exceptions, the left has not expressed itself on this subject with the same vehemence.
Italy, which is already spending exorbitant amounts on repatriating illegal immigrants, can no longer bear the burdens and costs of these waves of immigration by itself.
EU funding is needed to upgrade and set up new centres and to foster cooperation with the countries of origin, which is the most effective way to avoid cases such as Lampedusa, which is too often forced to tackle such severe overcrowding that it is almost impossible to manage.
For that reason, and this is my final point, we should give our warm thanks to those who work at the Lampedusa centre â civilians, the forces of law and order, the police, the , religious workers and volunteers â for the humaneness and professionalism they display and the sacrifices they make every day.
We should appreciate the fact, however, and for this I would like to thank the President, that Parliament has been willing to dedicate this time â which was not programmed â to such an important and sensitive topic.
Â Â  Mr President, it is, of course, true that Spain and the other European countries are largely responsible for the fact that we are still nowhere in the fight against illegal immigration.
That is because the soft approach to illegals and, obviously, the regulations that result from it, have an enormous effect in attracting hundreds of thousands and millions of other fortune-hunters.
It is laughable, actually, that Louis Michel, like a number of other Commission spokespersons, thinks and says that a policy of limited legal immigration could solve the problems.
It is not because we receive a few dozen, a few hundred or even a few thousand doctors or engineers that the immigration of unskilled people from Developing World countries will drop off.
Quite the contrary, in fact, we must move in the direction of transparent policy, with illegality not rewarded but resulting immediately in forced return to the countries of origin.
Our refugee policy should be based on three pillars: firstly, the reception and processing of asylum applications not by us, but only in the countries or the regions of origin; secondly, the compulsory readmission of bogus asylum seekers to the countries of origin, if necessary on the pain of loss of development aid, and thirdly, the complete overhaul of development cooperation, because development cooperation should no longer help potentates to stack up billions of dollars in their Swiss bank accounts.
We are prepared to show solidarity, but we are no longer prepared to let our continent be overrun by fortune-hunters from across the globe, because our primary duty is to defend our own citizens.
Â Â  Mr President, I intend to talk about Ceuta and Melilla.
We are facing an horrendous crisis that neither this Parliament nor the European Union can ignore.
We are calling for more communitisation of all migration issues and a global and broad view of issues such as integration, asylum, legal immigration, illegal immigration and international protection.
We are facing a crisis of management, a complete failure on the part of the Spanish Government.
What is the immediate cause?
There are several: mass regularisation, the âcall effectâ.
We are facing a humanitarian crisis, a flagrant violation of human rights, a violation of Spanish and Community borders.
The army, mistakenly at the border, humiliated at the border, with no preparation and no ROAS.
Overflowing internment centres, overflowing social services (I would like to warmly applaud the NGOs and the governments of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla).
Moral crisis: a democratic government that is complacent and submissive towards another country that does not respect human rights (a new statistic: 67% of Spaniards say that the government is too tolerant with Morocco).
Crisis of responsibility: nobody is taking responsibility for the tragedy.
Confusion, premeditation, lack of information and transparency, double attitudes and double language: first they are allowed to come and allowed to mount an assault on the border, then they shoot at them, displace them and abandon them to their fate in the desert; we do not know where they go and we do not know where they are taken.
The use of the tragedy as a bargaining chip: they are sending us this message: âif we want to stop it, we can do so, but you must pay and you must look the other way and, what is more, you must not criticiseâ.
Mr Solana is right: there must be no aid without commitment, without honest cooperation, without respect for others, without respect for human beings.
What is the solution?
It is difficult, but there are a few of them: more communitisation, more information, more demands, more external borders agency, more cooperation, more common aid, more common controls, repatriations with respect for human rights and the identification and sanctioning of untrustworthy countries.
Morocco must respect human rights, offer credibility and trust and use the aid possible: otherwise the necessary neighbourliness will not be possible.
And a final comment, Mr Catania: the Spanish delegation in the Group of the European Peoplesâ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports your proposal to create a committee of inquiry.
Â Â  Mr President, in this very Chamber, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, on receiving the Sakharov Prize, drew the attention of the Europeans to the drama of emigration, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Tony Blair, said that Africa is an extremely important priority for us.
What we are witnessing at the moment is a situation that demonstrates that we are facing a drama of biblical proportions, because, as Mrs Klamt has said â and I believe she is right â there are more than four million displaced people in Africa.
We have GPS systems that show the precision of bombings; we could be looking at what is currently happening in the Sahara, in the Sahel, where, as a result of the drought, of famines, of locusts, of the destruction of crops that we protect, hundreds of thousands of people are on the move: this is the biblical drama that we must deal with.
There is therefore no place for the lamentations of a former Director-General of Police who, right here today, is owning up to his failure, his frustration and his lack of patriotism.
What we are proposing in a very concrete and direct form has also been proposed by the British Presidency: to take a step forward with regard to Africa.
This means â I believe that the Commission has approved it today â a Marshall Plan for Africa which takes account of peopleâs right to live in dignified conditions.
What we cannot do is pass our problems on to our neighbour.
Yesterday in Rabat, Minister Moratinos and Minister Benaissa made an appeal to the European Union to which I believe we must respond: we are calling for a conference with the European Union, with the European and African countries affected, with the United Nations and with the Organisation of African States, in order to deal with this problem and, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has said, in order to jointly manage migratory flows in a humane fashion.
That is the solution we must support.
We have the support of Thabo Mbeki and of Kofi Annan; we need the support of the European Union; let us see whether we can achieve it.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like you to hear this proposal.
The speaker before me has made serious false comments about me.
I would ask for your support and would like to invoke this Parliamentâs Rules of Procedure so that I can respond.
Â Â  You may speak on this matter at the end of the debate.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank the representatives of the Council and, above all, of the Commission, and we look forward to tomorrowâs work with MrÂ Fratini.
What we are now experiencing was accurately described and predicted more than a full 35 years ago by the think-tank known as the Club of Rome and by its leader, MrÂ Aurelio Peccei, who said that the South would undoubtedly make its way north.
There can be no effective and lasting policy on a purely national basis. The odd attempt at prevention or occasional measures to promote security and respect for human life are not enough.
The moment has therefore come for making policy on migratory flows an urgent European priority.
We therefore propose setting up a conference involving European, African and Mediterranean countries.
This could be held in association with, or even under the joint authority of, the UN and the European Union.
The conference should develop an emergency Marshall-style plan at UN and EU levels and in relation to the following two areas.
With famine, health issues and the protection of human life in mind, we need firstly to provide ourselves with the resources for dealing humanely with the refugees who at present die in the desert or are shot when they try to cross areas barred to them or who, in other cases, drown in the Atlantic or Mediterranean, for such things do happen.
Then, and as our main task, we need urgently to mobilise the international financial institutions to create economic activity in the countries of the South and, in particular, to offer stability there to those young people who wish to work in their own countries and to remain there.
Basic efforts are required to promote policies on education and economic stabilisation in order to prevent the populations concerned from migrating.
Subsidies, which in any case give rise to corruption, must be halted. The two international bodies â the United Nations and Europe â and, of course, a third body â the Organisation for African Unity â need to tackle this problem without delay.
Â Â  MrÂ President, obviously, everyone is concerned about what is happening in Ceuta and Melilla.
In Tijuana or in Brindisi, in Lampedusa or Ceuta, women and men in this world of ours are now on the move.
Naturally, our Spanish friends or my Moroccan friends cannot by themselves resolve this problem which, at present, has a global and not only European dimension.
As long as men and women are thirsty and hungry, they will start walking, however high the barbed wire fences are built.
What, then, can be done?
The fact is, a four-square model of humanitarianism needs now to be proclaimed. That is to say, food, water, medicines and vaccines, as well as education, need to be global public goods.
This is no longer simply a European matter, but a global one.
It is now no longer a question of pooling coal and steel, as in 1950. It is a question of sharing water, vaccines, food and education globally.
The day that that happens, the people of our planet will no longer need to pass beyond Gibraltar or to cross the Sahara or Arizona deserts or the Rio Grande.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an issue of great importance which some, however, are tackling in a controversial manner.
There are two approaches: one has also been seen in this Chamber, in a slightly different way from what has been reported in the press; the second can be observed in national events, in the press and in political actions.
I endorse the statements made by the Council and expressed in other ways by the Commission.
What is more, I visited Lampedusa together with all my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and I will go to any other European centres that we decide to visit.
There are, however, some aspects of the statements that I believe should not be emphasised.
I also agree with the position expressed by Mrs Buitenweg and, in part â for once â also that of MrÂ Catania, although I do not agree with his statements regarding deportation by Italy or journalistic action, which can certainly do nothing to aid such an important cause.
Mr President, this is an issue which should concern the whole of the European Union â just now someone referred to a âplanetary problemâ.
Currently there is no EU policy on immigration and there are countries which are not capable of tackling the problem by themselves.
Italy and Spain are large countries â Spain is even getting the army to intervene â and some countries, such as Italy, have outposts in the middle of the sea, such as Lampedusa.
Other countries, however â such as Malta, which has a population of barely 400Â 000 â find themselves under enormous pressure and are not capable of dealing with the problem.
Thus, one can talk of Lampedusa as much as one wants, one can use it for oneâs own ends to oneâs heartâs content â I refer to Mr Catania â but Lampedusa remains a small island in the middle of the sea, with only 5Â 000 residents, which is not able to tackle the situation or to create a Hilton hotel for the thousands and thousands of people arriving there. We should thank, as Mr Borghezio and Mr La Russa did, all those who are working on the island, including our friends from Malta who are also doing all that they can.
We will visit Malta in January.
Mr President, it is important to establish a policy in this field once and for all, which is the one sketched out by the Council Presidency, but this policy must be undertaken in a committed fashion.
The Council must take responsibility for it and the Commission should formulate a specific proposal.
We must set up a common immigration policy â Mr President, I am just finishing â so that, in addition to human tragedies, in addition to the needy, hungry people who need work, other aspects are also borne in mind, such as those who operate boats to carry illegal immigrants, traffickers in human beings and above all the terrorists who may benefit from these situations to infiltrate Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in all honesty we expected more from the Councilâs statement.
We expected greater clarity, in particular, since immigration requires joint, coordinated measures for European policy, focused not on the need and the means to protect ourselves from immigrants, but above all on the capability to ensure respect for the human rights of immigrants, their human dignity and agreement among the Member States.
Such a policy demands, above all, courage and truth, which is why I will just dwell on an omission in the speech by Mr Alexander which I believe to be particularly serious: he did not make a single reference, not a single word, to what has happened in recent days on Lampedusa.
I would therefore like to put four quick questions to him and to the Council.
Is the Council aware of the fact that the temporary holding camp on Lampedusa has been transformed in fact â but not by law â into a detention centre, a place where rights do not exist and where ill-treatment and violence are the order of the day?
Is the Council aware of the fact that an official delegation from this Parliament was taken for a ride by the Italian Government, which, on the day prior to our visit, had the centre evacuated?
Is the UK Minister aware that his Italian counterpart, MrÂ Castelli, the Minister for Justice, this morning hastily dismissed events on Lampedusa as a load of rubbish made up by the journalists?
Finally, is the Council aware that the current cooperation agreements with Libya provide not only for the monitoring of the borders but also for non-EU citizens who have been turned away and deported to be interned in refugee camps in the Libyan desert that are not further identified?
We await some answers.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I might just as well say that we need a policy at the European level and stop there, since we have already said everything.
We agree with the proposals for the future and the initiatives taken over recent months by Vice-President Frattini on the issue of illegal immigration, asylum policy and combating illegal immigration trafficking.
We are, however, very concerned to learn that, at the Council, Italy, France and Spain have decided to be represented not by their ministers for home affairs but by other ministers, whereas this should have been a major concern for the ministers at the highest level.
As an MEP I intend to bring pressure to bear on the Council, because the image of the torrent of migrants assaulting the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla symbolises our future demographic and political relationship.
As an MEP, I will also denounce the manipulation of the truth which took place during the visit by the delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to the Lampedusa centre and the shameful conduct revealed by the journalistsâ investigative reports.
My friends at the Commission, you will have Parliamentâs support if you proceed more swiftly.
There is no such thing as a pause for reflection when it comes to immigration to Europe.
Time is pressing and politicians have the duty to take steps in relation to peopleâs needs and the urgency of their need.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my condolences with regard to the illegal immigrants who have died, as well as my solidarity with the local authorities and people of those countries, cities and regions on the borders of Europe who are affected by immigration on a day-to-day basis.
To stop the invasion we need to remove the illusion that it is possible to enter Europe illegally and either to remain illegally or even to have oneâs situation regularised.
Espousing solidarity and the obligation to provide hospitality, persisting in the demand that privileges be given to those who are not citizens of Europe, instead of defending the rights and social guarantees of European taxpayers, is an absurd attitude which is very unfair and is also complicit with the slave traders and in the tragic consequences of journeys of doomed hope.
I thank Mr Zapatero and his socialist government for having demonstrated to other fellow Members and other governments that it is an obligation of those in power to ensure the legality and welfare of those under their administration.
I thank you, my fellow Members, if you are finally aware that it is necessary to defend oneâs own country against illegitimate invasion.
Thank you for standing up for those values of legality and public order to which we all, and MEPs , attach great importance and to which we must all be subject.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to say something about two things which, though different, are nonetheless connected.
On the one hand, all this is another demonstration of how we need, as the European Union develops, to move closer towards common rules on asylum, Schengen and other aspects of policy on legal and internal affairs.
I see this as being a matter of urgent necessity if we are to be able to take action more quickly to deal with these things.
This, though, given the way things stand, would be no more than tinkering with symptoms, for, as various Members have described today, the forces at work are quite different.
If people are in such dire straits as to think it worth risking death, then our best efforts will avail nothing unless the causes are removed.
We have to bring about a situation in which these people again have something to look forward to.
What we are dealing with is a continent in its death-throes, for we can see how Aids is cutting a swathe through some of its countries, how climate change has meant that people no longer have any means of feeding themselves, and that we have not always given the right sort of aid, or in sufficient quantities.
There is also the issue of trading conditions, which are not always fair.
If people there are to be given hope, we need to adopt an approach that is different â not only in going deeper but also in having a broader scope.
It must also be clear, though, that blame is not to be attached to us alone, and that we are doing the things that good people should do.
It is every bit as important to recognise that these countries are ruled over by elites and dictatorships that threaten their own people with armed force, oppressing them and making any kind of development impossible.
We must overcome the dictatorship in these countries that mete out such inhumane treatment to their own people.
All these things fit together if we want to deal with these things successfully, and also gain the approval of our own people.
What is clear from what is going on now is that we can also present this as a matter of our own self-interest, which is best served if these people, in their own homelands, are given a chance and a prospect of a better life.
We have to make it clear that the two are interlinked; it is a vital lesson to be learned if there is to be a change of approach.
We have known all this ever since the 1970s, ever since the reports by Edward Heath, Willy Brandt and others, in which all of this is to be found.
None of these things are new; all we need is the strength to put them into practice.
Â Â  Mr President, the status quo of illegal immigration in Europe is untenable both for Member States, which are burdened with responsibilities they cannot shoulder on their own, and for the wellbeing and dignity of immigrants themselves.
Member States such as Malta are being affected to a disproportionate degree, creating in the process an alarming situation, especially when the size and population density of the island is taken into consideration.
I wish to record here my appreciation for the initiative taken by Commissioner Frattini.
Whilst I recognise that individual Member States have to take part ownership of this problem, I feel that the Union has not treated this tragic reality with the urgency, concreteness and effectiveness it deserves.
It is clear that we are still far from implementing the burden-sharing policy.
The Union has to take immediate and urgent action and provide the necessary funds, know-how, intelligence and diplomatic support needed to tackle this global concern effectively and humanely.
This is an international problem and therefore necessitates an international solution.
In the long term, a joint endeavour by Europe and the United Nations could go a long way towards resolving this issue in a more holistic manner, especially where non-EU countries are concerned.
In this respect, I very much welcome the âMarshall Planâ as recommended by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
This is the kind of EU solidarity that EU citizens, Member States and immigrants would really relate to and appreciate.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, immigration is, together with the fight against terrorism, one of the major emergencies of the new millennium.
The events which are taking place again and again, mainly in southern Europe, demonstrate, however, that the European Union is not tackling this phenomenon of our time with sufficient determination.
Too many people believe that this is a problem that concerns only Italy, Spain or Malta.
That is not true.
Europe has a duty to take responsibility, politically and economically, for what happens along the length of the shores of the Mediterranean, because they represent the external border of the south of the Union.
The EU must not, therefore, remain deaf to this appeal, but ought to increase the number of initiatives to tackle the immigration emergency.
This is why it is not enough to tackle the issue by thinking about inevitable and necessary public order initiatives.
Although these are important, we have to do much more.
Agreements with countries of origin are needed, and we need to go further along the path that was begun in Barcelona and increase investment and initiatives for development.
This is why we are increasingly convinced that immigration ought to be one of the European Unionâs responsibilities in the future.
The words of Commissioner Figel and the initiatives taken by Mr Frattini give us cause for hope.
With regard to the events of recent days it is impossible for us not to forcefully denounce what has happened in Ceuta and Melilla.
The Zapatero government was not capable of dealing with the situation, and was not able to tackle an emergency while respecting the human rights of the immigrants who were pressing at the borders.
We do not want to see any repetitions of the scenes that have been shown on television in recent days: so many innocent victims, killed through a total inability to tackle the emergency and to know how to combine security and respect for human lives.
Finally, any comparison â and this is my final point â between what happened in Ceuta and Melilla and what happened on Lampedusa is totally unacceptable.
The Italian Government, the forces of law and order and the NGOs did not cause anyone to be killed or deported into the desert, but they continue every day to save the lives of dozens and dozens of immigrants who are victims of traders without scruples and pedlars of dreams that turn into tragedies.
Â Â  Mr President, I should also like to express my views today about the huge influx of illegal immigrants in Europe, a situation that is not only affecting my country Malta, but also Spain, Italy, and other European countries; a situation that has stretched Maltaâs resources to their limits; a situation that I fear has not been given its due importance by the European Union.
The Maltese authorities have been dealing with this problem for years, but the last couple of years have seen an increase that has made it very difficult to control.
Logistically it has become very hard â nearly impossible â to accommodate these illegal immigrants and at the same time ensure their privacy and dignity as human beings.
This year alone about 44Â boats have entered our territorial waters â a small number you may say, but when compared to Germany, for example, that would mean the equivalent of 830 boats â carrying 1600 illegal immigrants.
Compared to Germany again that would be the equivalent of almost 300Â 000 people, a situation which I am sure no European government would like to have to face.
Unfortunately the situation is a reality on our island and I urge the Commission to act as soon as possible to find a lasting solution.
Let us work together to adopt a common policy on migration that would befit the principles of a united Europe.
The problem we are facing is critical, but nevertheless I am sure that the Maltese authorities will continue to do their utmost to aid and protect these unfortunate people who in the vast majority of cases flee their countries for political, social and economic reasons.
We will continue to do our best but we need assistance, because this is not just a Maltese, Italian or Spanish problem: it is a problem that concerns the whole of the European Union.
Â Â  . Mr President, thank you for allowing me to reply to what has been an important and timely debate.
I shall respond to a number of the remarks that have been made.
Let me begin by agreeing with Commissioner Figelâ that migration requires, as he described it, a balanced approach to protect the rights of those in need of protection and to combat illegal immigration.
Mrs Klamt and Mrs Roure rightly expressed concerns about reports of migrants left in the deserts.
This is clearly unacceptable and underlines the need to cooperate with and assist third countries to provide better migration management.
In a powerful contribution Mr Watson drew attention to the proximity and importance of Africa to the interests of the European Union.
This matter was also brought up in the contributions by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, Mr Cavada and Mr Brok.
That of course is the case; it is a sentiment with which I wholeheartedly agree.
That is why it is for me a matter of immense pride that in the course of this year the European Union has shown such leadership.
This was shown ahead of the Gleneagles Summit â when decisions were taken effectively to double levels of bilateral international aid provided by European Union Member States; then once again at the Gleneagles Summit itself, where there was further action to secure multilateral debt write-off for many of the worldâs highly-indebted poorest countries; and then as recently as September at the Millennium Review Summit, where leading European nations were seen to work in concert to ensure an agenda that was progressive in advancing the interests of the United Nations as we look ahead to the challenges of the coming century.
Mr Catania criticised the Councilâs engagement with Libya, but on this point I am afraid I have to disagree with him.
The Council does not share his view.
The migration dialogue with Libya underlines the European Unionâs expectations of Libya in areas such as human rights and we believe it is important to influence Libyan behaviour and commitment to human rights by comprehensive engagement.
I shall try and draw my remarks briefly to a conclusion because I am conscious of the constraints of time.
As I said earlier, it is important that we realise that the problems faced by Spain, Italy and Malta are shared by the European Union as a whole.
They are also problems for Europeâs neighbours like Libya and Morocco, and for countries in sub-Saharan Africa where the pressures of illegal migration are perhaps greatest.
The long-term solution lies in working in partnership.
In the past the European Unionâs engagement with countries outside the European Union to combat illegal immigration has frankly not been effective enough.
That is now changing and the European Union is beginning to engage its collective weight to enhance cooperation and migration with source and transit countries.
This will be a priority for future work under the United Kingdom Presidency, including when Foreign Ministers meet to discuss the issue this coming November.
However, I warn against over-simplification of the migration issue.
The European Unionâs policy on migration and asylum needs to be carefully balanced and carefully considered.
It should not confuse the objective of stronger border controls that stop illegal immigration with the objective of protecting refugees, which is a fundamental value of our European Union.
We should push ahead with EU cooperation with third countries.
This is the only way to avoid further human tragedies in the Mediterranean and establish managed migration that works in the interests of both the European Union and our neighbours.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I have only a few words to add as I think this topic is not only to be covered today but also tomorrow and some days thereafter.
It is a question which touches on many other related issues: not only development, but also external relations and the future of Europe.
I would like to express my gratitude to the Members of the European Parliament, not only for their speeches, but also their valuable suggestions and ideas for further action.
Migration has many causes.
We have to look into, and deal with, these root causes and we need to act much more than we have until now.
This phenomenon is not only growing, but is having an increasing impact on our current situation.
Just to remind you that many years ago â 60 years ago or more â people from Europe were fleeing to other continents.
Now Europe is an attractive place.
We should not be apathetic to the results of integration.
We should be active in sharing solidarity and justice, as the cement of our European house, with the people around Europe.
I believe that respect for human rights, the culture of human rights and the mainstreaming of human rights in all other policies with our partners, with countries of origin or of transit, should become a permanent part of our relations or criteria.
We need a comprehensive approach which brings together development policy, economic cooperation, humanitarian policy and, of course, justice and home affairs.
The Commission promotes such an attitude and will promote it further together with the United Nations.
I am sure that in November, on the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, the same approach will be expressed even more deeply and intensely.
It is an important time for reflection on the future of this region.
This House will discuss later this evening the Unionâs strategy on Africa.
Today, the EU donates 60% of the total amount of aid to Africa.
This is by far the highest volume in comparison with other countries and organisations in the world.
We will help to overcome many problems â and as was mentioned, enable people to see a future in their countries â not only with aid, but also with policies which promote basic values, education and better living conditions.
I would like to conclude by assuring you, Mr President, that we will discuss the issue at the hearing tomorrow in the European Parliament.
We are increasingly interdependent and, as Mrs Buitenweg said, the European project is really about civilisation: civilisation not only for us, but for the world in general.
Â Â  Mr DÃ­az de Mera GarcÃ­a Consuegra, you have the floor on the basis of Rule 145.
Â Â  Mr President, I only wish to respond to Mr BarÃ³n by saying the following: before this afternoon, I had respect for Mr BarÃ³n, a lot of respect; having heard him, and having seen the great effort he has made to destroy that respect, he has succeeded: I no longer have any respect for him.
Another issue: for the sake of parliamentary courtesy, Mr President, I will not say that what Mr BarÃ³n has said about me makes him unworthy and indecent; I will say that he has used indecent and unworthy language, not that he is.
Finally, Mr President, in my country Mr BarÃ³n once said: âI am a State assetâ.
He has proven that he is not in fact a State asset: he is an asset of various States.
When he speaks and behaves like that, that is what Mr BarÃ³n is.
Finally, I am proud to have dedicated part of my life to the security of all Spaniards.
Many sleepless nights.
Mr President, what a shame; what a shame that when people have no arguments they have to resort to insults; what a shame that when people have no arguments or ideas they have to use that kind of language.
Mr BarÃ³n has proven that, when it comes to this and other issues, he has no idea what he is talking about.
Â Â  Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, you too have the floor on a personal matter.
We are not going to start a debate on the matter; only on something that concerns you that you wish to clarify.
Â Â  Mr President, a careful look at the Minutes will reveal that I have not referred personally to Mr DÃ­az de Mera.
In any case, I shall not respond to the inappropriate comments he has made; I would simply like to point out to him that there is a correct place to raise his serious and unfounded criticisms of the Spanish Government, which is the Congress of Deputies, in Carrera de San JerÃ³nimo, in Madrid â and I can give Mr DÃ­az de Mera the address â but our job here is to examine the European institutions, not the Spanish Government.

Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Iran.
Â Â  . Mr President, todayâs debate here in the European Parliament is indeed timely.
I know that a number of you follow developments in Iran closely and I look forward to exchanging views with honourable Members in the course of our discussion this afternoon.
Iran now has a new President and Government.
They will need to take important decisions about reform, foreign policy and Iranâs nuclear programme.
The choices they will make affect not just Iranâs future in the region, but also some of Europeâs vital interests.
Iran has vast potential: it has a young, well-educated population, two-thirds of whom are under the age of 30.
Many Iranians are highly entrepreneurial.
Combined with Iranâs immense natural resources â particularly oil and minerals â this should make for a vibrant economy and society if the new government can create a culture of opportunity based upon the rule of law.
Since 1998 the European Union has pursued a policy of engagement with Iran.
Our engagement is motivated by our strong desire to encourage progress in areas where Iranâs policies are of serious concern.
These include Iranâs nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, its approach to terrorism and the Middle East peace process, and human rights.
I would like to concentrate on two of those issues today: human rights â because I know this is of great concern to many honourable Members of this Parliament â and the nuclear issue, because it has the potential, if not handled correctly, to overshadow the entirety of Iranâs relationships with the international community, including the European Union.
Let me therefore start with the latter.
When Iranâs concealment of crucial elements of its nuclear programme came to light in 2002 and 2003, the normal procedure should have been for the International Atomic Energy Agencyâs Board of Governors to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council.
We decided to look for a way forward that would give Iran an opportunity to dispel concerns and prove that the aims of its nuclear programme were entirely peaceful.
The IAEA Board agreed to delay a report to the Security Council to give a European initiative a chance.
At the heart of this initiative was a proposal that Iran should restore confidence by suspending all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities while we discussed mutually acceptable, long-term arrangements.
I should set out that no one â not the European Union nor the wider international community â is trying to prevent Iran from generating electricity by nuclear power, as Iran has sometimes claimed.
In the proposals we made to Iran in August, the European side specifically offered support âfor the development of a safe, economically viable and proliferation-proof civil nuclear power generation and research programmeâ.
Our main objective has always been to get Iran to take the steps necessary to establish confidence that the intentions of its nuclear programme are exclusively peaceful.
As honourable Members are aware, in August Iran decided to resume uranium-conversion activities, which the IAEA Board had asked it to suspend as an essential step.
Full suspension of all nuclear fuel cycle activities was also the basis of the agreement made in Paris last November between Iran and the European side, which has provided the framework for our discussion of long-term arrangements.
We have urged Iran to reinstate a full suspension and come back to talks on the basis of the Paris agreement.
The European Union has made clear that we are willing to work with Iran and, as part of a long-term agreement, to open the door to closer economic, political and social cooperation.
The resolution passed by the IAEA Board of Governors on 24Â September makes clear the depth of international concern at Iranâs decision.
It remains to be seen how Iran will respond.
Iran has an opportunity now to come into line with requests made by the IAEA Board.
We hope it will choose that constructive path.
I will now turn to human rights, an area in which the United Kingdom Presidency has had cause to be active in the last three months, because of serious and continuing violations.
During the first term of office of President Khatami from 1997 to 2001, there emerged a lively free press, a growing civil society and embryonic political parities.
Progress was halting but nonetheless real.
Regrettably, Iran has lost ground in these areas over the last few years.
I hope Iranâs new Government will devote renewed attention to this area.
One of the areas in which Iran is not living up to its international obligations is in the punishment of juvenile offenders.
We continue to receive reports of children being sentenced to death and, in some horrendous instances, the sentences appear to have been carried out.
Sentencing people to death for crimes committed when under the age of 18 is a clear violation of Iranâs obligations under international law.
In January, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child urged Iran to end this practice.
It is clearly imperative that it should happen.
The European Union has pressed Iran to ensure that no such sentences are passed and to bring in without delay new legislation that will outlaw them.
In recent months freedom of expression has also suffered.
Numerous human rights defenders, journalists and web bloggers have been arrested.
I know that many honourable Members are equally concerned about these issues.
I want, therefore, to mention in particular the inspirational investigative journalist, human rights defender and now prisoner of conscience, Akbar Ganji, who remains in the jail where he has spent much of the last five years.
The European Union has called for his release on several occasions and I today hope the Iranian authorities will now consider this as a priority.
We are also concerned about religious freedom: many of Iranâs religious minorities continue to suffer persecution and unfair treatment.
We take the view that, by pursuing a policy of diplomatic engagement, we have a better chance of persuading Iran to improve its human rights performance.
We constantly monitor Iranâs human rights situation and the Presidency has recently made a number of urgent representations on cases requiring immediate intervention.
European Union Member States remain ready to co-sponsor United Nations General Assembly resolutions on the human rights situation in Iran, as appropriate.
The EU-Iran human rights dialogue enables the European Union to work to improve the human rights situation in Iran.
We would like to see much greater commitment from Iran to the dialogue and to ensuring that the dialogue results in real progress achieved on the ground.
We are frankly disappointed that Iran has not yet agreed dates for the next round and will continue to press it.
Iranâs attitude to human rights is damaging its reputation in the international community and I am sure that honourable Members will agree with me when I say that the Iranian Government owes it to its people to make significant progress in this area.
I think we all realise that this is a particularly crucial time for Iran and its new Government.
For our part, we remain committed to seeking progress in our areas of concern through a policy of engagement.
I know that honourable Members will also continue to maintain a keen interest in human rights, the nuclear dossier and other elements of Iranâs development in the important months and years ahead.
Â Â  .
Madam President, in the current climate it is inevitable that discussions about Iran focus on its nuclear programme.
This is one of the most serious security issues currently on the international agenda.
The international community must be united if we are to find a satisfactory solution.
This means working through the appropriate channels: first, the International Atomic Energy Agency and, if and when necessary, the United Nations Security Council.
The development of the European Unionâs relations with Iran is conditioned in large part by progress on that issue and by the approach of the international community.
Our relationship with Iran, however, does not begin and end with the nuclear track.
Other tracks with Iran should, in the Commissionâs view, continue to be pursued.
In this respect, I wish to express my appreciation for the work undertaken by the delegation for relations with Iran, under the dynamic chairwomanship of MsÂ Angelika Beer.
I hope that in the months ahead you will be in a position to develop contacts with your interlocutors from the Iranian Majlis, as well as with the widest possible spectrum of Iranian society.
People-to-people links are the best way to overcome prejudice, negative stereotypes and to foster mutual understanding.
It would be, for instance, very important to support the further development of academic, cultural and artistic exchanges between Europe and Iran, two ancient beacons of civilisations which have a lot to offer to each other.
On the official level, I first wish to draw your attention to two tracks: the comprehensive dialogue and the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights.
The comprehensive dialogue is the successor to the critical dialogue.
It is a forum designed to allow both sides to discuss a broad range of issues in the economic, political and security fields in a frank and open manner.
Since the outset, the emphasis has been placed on our four long-standing issues of concern: weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, the Middle East peace process and human rights.
We believe that this dialogue, which has played a useful role in the past, should now be continued.
The next session should be held in Tehran.
We are waiting for Iran to make practical suggestions.
As for the more specific bilateral dialogue on human rights which we set up in 2002, it provides a structured forum which allows formal discussion on individual cases, as well as on a comprehensive range of human rights issues of concern, on the basis of clear benchmarks.
It also comprises a round table involving a wide range of civil society actors, as well as parliamentarians.
It remains one of the means through which the EU can make a sustained contribution to fostering systemic change and improving the human rights situation on the ground.
However, the latest session of the human rights dialogue took place more than a year ago.
We sought to hold a session in September, but this proved impossible in the absence of any confirmation from the Iranian side.
In the margins of the United Nations General Assembly, my colleague Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner told MrÂ Manouchehr Mottaki, the Iranian Foreign Minister, that it would be important for Iran to reconfirm its commitment to the EU-Iran human rights dialogue by agreeing on a date for an early meeting.
We are still waiting for Iranâs response.
Regarding the current human rights situation in Iran, there is a growing cause for concern, as exemplified by the continued imprisonment of Mr Akbar Ganji â as MrÂ Alexander mentioned â and his supporter and lawyer, Mr Abdolfattah Soltani.
There are other serious issues of concern which have emerged recently: the juvenile death penalty cases despite the existence of a moratorium on this penalty; the arrest of members of the Bahaâi faith; the excessive use of force to suppress unrest in the provinces of Khuzestan and Kurdistan; and the continued suppressions of freedom of the press.
Each is a matter of deep concern.
The European Commission remains mobilised on each of these issues.
We are fully in line with the European Parliament in saying that, without a systemic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with Iran cannot develop properly.
Indeed, our relationship with the Islamic Republic of Iran is, at present, well below potential: Iran is one of the few countries with which the EU has no contractual relation.
A framework agreement with the EU could facilitate the reintegration of Iran into the international community and contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to economic growth and job creation.
This should, in turn, consolidate the indigenous reform process leading towards a more open society.
As the presidential campaign demonstrated, these are indeed among the most pertinent demands of the Iranian electorate.
Since 2002, the Commission has led talks for the conclusion of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement â TCA â with Iran.
They run parallel to the negotiations led by the EU Presidency for a Political Dialogue Agreement â PDA.
These two tracks are indivisible and mutually reinforcing.
They are also dependent on the overall political atmosphere.
You may recall, when the nuclear crisis first erupted back in 2003, that we had to place our TCA and PDA discussions on hold.
These were resumed only after the signature of the November 2004 Paris agreement, which helped to re-establish a more favourable political environment.
The eighth â and so far last â round of negotiations took place in Tehran on 12Â and 13Â July 2005.
Indeed, up and until the most recent crisis over the nuclear issue, our negotiators had made good progress.
This leads me to say a few words on where we stand with regard to the nuclear issue, including its implications on the TCA since the adoption of the resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency of 24Â September.
The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 3Â October confirmed that the EU remains firmly united around the European Union E3 Troika approach.
This strong sense of EU solidarity around the E3 position forms the platform around which the united international community can rally to strengthen the hand and to support the excellent efforts displayed by the IAEA and its Director-General, Mr Mohammad ElBaradei.
A united EU can also form the bedrock upon which the international community can send a clear message to Iran that, whilst as per Article IV of the Non Proliferation Treaty â NPT â Iran has the inalienable right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes â and this without discrimination â we need objective guarantees on the exclusively peaceful nature of Iranâs nuclear programme.
Indeed, the EU considers that the integrity of the NPT must be preserved, and that international cooperation must take place within the strict limits set by the NPT and the Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines.
These principles underpin the framework set up last November in Paris by the European countries.
The comprehensive package presented to Iran last August represents a solid pillar on which Iran and the international community can find a common ground for their legitimate concerns.
The Commission has also played its part.
Following the resumption of conversion activities at the Isfahan plant two months ago, we decided to put the negotiations we were leading for a trade and cooperation agreement on hold.
The Commission strongly hopes that the Iranian leadership will accurately assess what the stakes are and will, as a result, take the necessary steps to reverse the current unhelpful trend, including ensuring full cooperation with international organisations.
Â Â  . Madam President, this motion for a resolution must send a clear political signal to Teheran, not only as regards human rights but also in relation to the nuclear issues.
Where human rights are concerned, this House will not compromise.
Being generally opposed to the death penalty, we will be all the more energetic in demanding that a stop be put to the execution of juveniles and that the death penalty should not be imposed on any person who was aged under 18 when they committed the crime.
I am also grateful to the presidency for being equally forthright about the resumption of the human rights dialogue.
What we expect of the Commission is that it should make funds available from the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights to enable us to step up cooperation with Iranian civil society, and I am obliged to Commissioner Figelâ for mentioning a number of areas in which we can do that.
In the absence of any substantial improvement in the human rights situation, it will be impossible to bring negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement to a conclusion.
The same cause and effect relationship is present in relation to the nuclear issues, which are equally crucial to the further development of relations with the EU.
While we welcome every effort at cooperation with the IAEA in order to make effective monitoring possible, we do â quite independently of that â urge Iran, as a matter of priority, to completely suspend its own uranium enrichment programme, as agreed in Paris last November.
We call on the Iranians to resume dialogue with the EU before the Board of Governors of the IAEA next meet, in November.
They know that the European Union has offered to supply enriched uranium for civilian purposes.
Russia, to take one example, might well offer to do likewise â and there will then be the possibility of sending the spent fuel rods back â but Iran should take practical steps to address the mistrust in which it is held, not least in nuclear matters.
If it does that, it cannot fail; if it does not, it will have the Security Council to deal with, where its chances of successes will be slimmer.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Alexander, Mr Figelâ, the decision by the Iranian authorities to suspend negotiations with the three European countries acting as negotiators is worrying.
I would like, however, to state right away and without ambiguity that we rule out any kind of military solution to this crisis.
On that point, we call on the United States Administration to become involved in these negotiations, as it did with some success in the case of North Korea.
We are, actually, concerned by this difference in the attitude of the United States, partly because many of Iranâs concerns about its own security spring directly from the attitude of the US, its policy in the region and the pressure that is being exerted, partly in military terms, in the military bases located in areas bordering Iran.
Iran, for its part, must suspend any activity designed to obtain nuclear material for military purposes; it must do so because it has signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus also undertaking to apply its Additional Protocol.
We therefore fully support the resolution by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which mandated its Director General, Dr El Baradei â who has since been deservedly awarded the Nobel Prize for peace â to continue to pursue the path of negotiation.
We also welcome the European Councilâs resolution of 3 October.
Our endorsement is not at all a formality, since we believe that this approach is particularly wise.
Indeed, as is well known and as the Iranian authorities are well aware and as Mr Alexander also pointed out, this issue falls within the competence of the United Nations Security Council.
The decision not to launch a procedure which could lead to an escalation of the situation is thus a choice which makes the path of negotiation even more persuasive, offering Iran a chance which should not be missed.
In the interests of greater clarity I should state that Iran, like any country in the world, has the right to equip itself with nuclear capacity for non-military purposes, and that is clear both in the resolution from the International Agency for Atomic Energy and in our resolution.
I would like to conclude with an appeal to the Council on the issue of human rights, an issue that everyone has alluded to.
In our resolution we referred to the cases mentioned by you, Mr Alexander.
I would like to encourage the Commission and the Council to continue the policy of dialogue, and never to separate human rights issues from trade agreements with Iran.
Â Â  Â MadamÂ President, the drive to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons has been partially successful.
Several countries such as Argentina and the Republic of South Africa have decided not to pursue programmes of this nature.
Also, countries such as Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine that inherited nuclear weapons following the break-up of the Soviet Union have generally determined not to use them.
Unfortunately, however, this process has not received the support it needed to ensure its full success.
A number of countries failed to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and despite strong pressure by world public opinion have gone ahead and acquired such weapons.
I have in mind Israel, Pakistan and India.
As a result, other countries have determined to follow their example.
We are today discussing one such country, namely Iran.
The fears that the process may go further seem entirely justified and it is imperative to put an end to this domino effect.
The European Union has now reached an impasse in its negotiations, and it is therefore vitally important to refer the matter to the United Nations.
We must call on the UNÂ Security Council to act swiftly and efficiently in this regard.
It is also important to remember to whom we are indebted for information on the secret military nuclear programmes in Iran.
The Iranian opposition brought this activity to the attention of world public opinion, and their significant contribution to this case should be duly recognised.
I believe it would also be appropriate to consider another issue that has been outstanding for some time.
It concerns declaring the Iranian Mujahedin a terrorist organisation.
Parliament raised this thorny issue once before, and I hope the Council will take it up.
Â Â  . Madam President, Mr Alexander, Commissioner FigeÄŸ, I am obliged to you for what you have said and for giving attention to the issue of human rights, for we all know that peace presupposes human rights and vice versa.
Our debate today is being held at a time when nobody knows what is going to happen next, so â not least in view of the various resolutions we are to vote on tomorrow â we should argue them through very precisely.
It is the details that will determine whether we in this House meet our responsibility of finding a de-escalation strategy, which I would describe as being about opening up new negotiating options in furtherance of our policy objective of preventing further proliferation of weapons in the Middle East and Iranâs eventual possession of an atom bomb.
My group sees de-escalation as being achievable, but not â as we have learned from Iraq â by invoking the Security Council.
Our fear is that failure to present a united front to the Security Council will result in escalation, and that the IAEA will no longer be able to do its work in Iran without hindrance, something that we know will end up making military escalation more likely.
I do not doubt that we agree on the objective, and we must seek ways to keep the doors open, for the people of Iran â the people we are in contact with, the journalists who we know, the human rights organisations, not to mention the Nobel prize-winners â have expectations of us; they also expect us to give diplomacy a chance.
On that point, I endorse what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said.
We have spoken to them this week; we have to turn our backs on the Security Council and seek political solutions.
We are worried about human rights for the same reasons.
It is not usual for us to talk constantly about human rights, but the human rights dialogue is one of the things that have been put on ice since President Ahmadinejad was elected, and the human rights situation is getting worse.
Teheran has sent official representatives to listen to this debate, and I appeal to them to clarify for our information whether or not Akbar Ganji is still alive, to ensure that he is released at once without conditions, along with his lawyer, who was a guest of this House as recently as July and discussed these issues with us.
That is what our resolution is driving at, and I mean this very seriously.
I would be glad of support from the Commission and the Council in achieving this objective.
Â Â  . Madam President, Iranâs technical capacity to use nuclear energy is causing the rest of the world to sit up and take notice.
Apart from the serious environmental objections to nuclear energy, there is no reason why countries in Asia should not raise their level of technology to that of Europe and North America.
It only becomes an issue if that knowledge is misused to issue military threats to others.
In this case, this risk is real, because the regime that is in power in Iran owes its support to a militant minority that has driven out, and excluded, other political powers from that country.
This minority does not only want a theocratic system in Iran â one that is, among other things, characterised by the disadvantaged position of women and the widespread practice of capital punishment â but also throughout the rest of the world.
Furthermore, it intensely dislikes freedom of association, freedom of opinion, equal access to political power and scope for individual choice.
They justify their regime of terror with their own interpretation of the will of God, which makes them immune to rational argument.
The political opposition has been banished to Europe and elsewhere.
A democratic Europe must take this opposition seriously.
Attempting to delay the nuclear threat by means of a temporary compromise with the regime in Iran should never be at the expense of our solidarity with this opposition.
This opposition is our hope for a better Iran in future, where people enjoy the freedoms and rights that we in Europe take for granted.
Support for that opposition can, in time, change the situation.
That is why parts of that opposition, such as the Peopleâs Mujahedeen, should not be on the terror list.
A possible military intervention, however, similar to that initiated by the Americans against Iranâs neighbours, Iraq and Afghanistan, in recent years, would give the people in Iran the feeling that their country is being threatened from outside and should therefore be defended.
That would only play into the hands of the fundamentalist regime.
That is why Europeâs choice must be clear.
It must pledge its solidarity with the democratic opposition both within Iran and outside it, and emphatically reject any military intervention by outsiders.
Â Â  . Madam President, ten years ago, the Iranian lyricist Said published a powerful literary diary entitled âThe long arm of the mullahs, notes from my exileâ.
This long arm of those in power of the Islamic Republic is surely one with which the British Presidency is far from unfamiliar today.
Teheran's terrorist tentacles even reach as far as the south of its neighbour, Iraq.
This long arm is the cause of the brutal repression that persists at home and of the serious destabilisation abroad.
The Council and Commission ought to give due consideration to these murky credentials of Iranâs regime, particularly if this regime of terror proclaims, mysteriously, to have purely peaceful nuclear intentions.
I would like to ask the Council and Commission how we can prevent this long arm of the mullahs from resorting to nuclear weapons.
You will in any event have to make the political price for President Ahmadinejad unacceptably high.
In concrete terms, this means that we, together with the US administration, should really keep all the options open where Tehran is concerned.
After all, the mullahs are quite capable of eating humble pie on their own.
If the United Nations do not come up with an effective containment strategy against Iranâs dangerous atomic aspirations, there is no doubt that the states that feel threatened most will take measures themselves.
That option must also sound familiar to the Council and the Commission.
One thing is certain: as peace brokers for the Middle East, they must resolutely denounce and reject the blood-spattered long arm of the mullahs, both in principle and in practice.
Â Â  . Representatives of the Commission and the Council, ladies and gentlemen, a week ago the draft European Parliament report on weapons of mass destruction was discussed at the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
We should remember that it was in fact Iranâs nuclear programme that provoked the most animated debates.
The Membersâ opinions now also display both a demand for more constructive action in relation to Iran and a wish not to strain relations with that country.
Our resolution is in the same vein as announcements during recent days from the Council and the Atomic Energy Agency.
These have emphasised political dialogue as the most appropriate instrument for convincing Iran.
This confirms that, in truth, the choice of resources available for influencing Iran is extremely limited.
We should not forget, however, that this is already the third European Parliament resolution on Iran this year.
We should also bear in mind the resolutions by other international organisations.
What sort of response have these received?
Iranâs reply has been unmistakable â the violation of the Paris agreement and other agreements, the concealment of violations and the resumption of the generation of energy for nuclear weapons.
Nor is the Atomic Energy Agency wrong in stating in its resolution of 24Â September that Iranâs activities were giving rise to a lack of confidence and that further action would fall within the competence of the UN Security Council.
Given this, we have to understand that political dialogue as a preventive tool to deal with Iranâs defiant and provocative actions is approaching its critical limit.
This, however, creates the sense that both in todayâs resolution and in the Councilâs announcement of 3 October the determination to take this issue forward to the UN Security Council is lacking.
Perhaps this is because the Council and we at the European Parliament are actually not convinced about the UN Security Councilâs will to take decisions in connection with Iranâs nuclear programme.
I hope that I am wrong, but it seems that the recent decisions by the international community still allow Iranâs ruling circles to act as they see fit.
Â Â  Madam President, de-escalation, the need to favour a political solution over recourse to the Security Council and, most of all, credibility â these topics are on everyoneâs lips.
Of course they are!
If, though, we put ourselves into the other sideâs shoes, we cannot fail to regard the International Atomic Energy Agency, as being, by reason of the way it is constituted, of course, biased in favour of the established nuclear powers.
The snag is that it is simply not possible to separate peaceful from military use of atomic material with any certainty.
As I see it, the right approach for the European Union to take ought to be far more radical, which would involve putting a question mark against our own and working to de-escalate to the point where there would be âno nukesâ.
Â Â  Madam President, Minister Alexander, I can still recall the situation 15Â years ago when an Iranian delegation approached the newly-freed Czechoslovakia to buy its nuclear equipment for the Bushehr power plant.
I do not think that the situation has changed a lot since then, even though I have seen Iranians coming through Shaff al-Arab to Basra; even though we have seen British soldiers dying in southern Iraq; even though we know about Iranian support to Hizbollah; even though we know about human rights violations.
I think that being gathered here today is the only clear aim.
We have to stop Iran from completing its nuclear fuel cycle.
We have to stop enrichment as a conversion-related activity which is not allowed and covered by NPT.
No one denies the Iranian right to nuclear energy for civilian use. Nevertheless, we need to stop its military programme.
We have to bring Iran back to the negotiating table to push it to ratify the additional protocol, to adopt all transparency measures and to cooperate in a transparent way and work with the IAEA.
We strongly support here today the Council decisions and the EU Troika.
We especially support France and the UK if it is indeed true that this afternoon Iran has sent signals that it is returning to the negotiation table.
It would be great if this were to happen.
Nevertheless, we do not have the right to blame the US.
We have to blame a damaging, totalitarian, oppressive regime which is not able to prove that it is going to use its nuclear energy for civilian purposes only.
Today all of us â Parliament, the Council and Commission â have to stand firm, strong and unified.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are to decide on tomorrow is, in my opinion, a resolution of openness and dialogue; it represents a Europe that believes in politics as the art of combining vision and reality.
It is very important today to reaffirm the central role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in ensuring that there are no military developments in the Iranian nuclear programmes.
It is equally important, however, to send a clear message to the Commission, the governments of the Member States and the international community: the peoples of Europe, represented by this Parliament, wish to see the Iran issue handled with a commitment to leave the door open to negotiation.
We also need to recognise Tehranâs legitimate concerns for its security and identify Iranâs essential role as a regional power.
We need to be equally clear and determined, however, in refusing any type of bargaining over the serious contraventions of human rights which still exist, especially in the field of freedom of expression and of womenâs and childrenâs rights, where we are still very far from being secure in the rule of law.
This resolution should be seen by Tehran as a sincere, clear call for the continuation of negotiations and ought also to act as a useful step towards the involvement of the other major protagonist in this delicate issue, the United States of America.
As we are dramatically reminded every day in Iraq, the use of force, unilateralism and regime changes imposed by the use of arms are the perfect ingredients for a disaster foretold.
Only a multilateral, determined and transparent effort will make it possible to create the conditions in which Iran will no longer be seen just as a danger but, on the contrary, as an essential player that has a vital role in stabilising the worldâs most strategic region.
Â Â  Madam President, it is my view that the Islamic Republic of Iran has much to offer the region and the wider world.
She practices a more advanced form of democracy than most of her neighbours.
Theocracy or no theocracy, womenâs rights in Iran are more developed than elsewhere in the region, with education for all and jobs, up to and including the Vice-President of the State, open to all.
With regard to the arts, please come to London to visit the British Museum and see the great Persepolis Exhibition, opened by the Vice-President of Iran last month.
I believe that Iranâs reintegration into the international community is long overdue and sorely needed.
The inevitable prerequisite is and must be the essential requirement to resolve the nuclear issue.
However, to avoid the accurate potential charge of hypocrisy, it is just as important that the European Union should pursue with equal aggression the policy of nuclear non-proliferation throughout the region.
The European Unionâs single foreign policy demands no less.
Â Â  Madam President, I would like to emphasise that I am speaking on my own behalf.
I am not expressing the opinion of my Group.
In Iran the human rights situation has deteriorated after the new President was âelectedâ.
In particular, the situation of women and young people has worsened considerably.
The number of public executions has increased.
The regime has been condemned in the UN for violations of human rights more times than any other country in the world: 51Â times.
All hopes of Iran moving towards moderation have now evaporated.
There are also many reports of the Iranian regime becoming increasingly involved in Iraq in an attempt to set up a sister Islamic state.
Tehran has also decided not to respect any of its agreements with the EU with regard to nuclear programming, including the Paris agreement.
One of Iranâs main demands concerns the Peopleâs Mujahedin Resistance Movement.
They were put on the terror list about three years ago without any legal basis.
Many MEPs in the House as well as the majority in the British, Belgium and Italian Parliaments have called for the removal of the Mujahedin from this list.
We believe the only way to improve democracy in Iran is to support the main opposition.
Â Â  Madam President, we have heard about two key issues regarding Iran: its programme to develop nuclear weapons and its record on human rights.
However, a third factor is becoming apparent: Iranâs role in training and equipping insurgents in Iraq who are not only killing British and American soldiers, but also working to ensure that Iraqâs painful transformation to a democratic state is unsuccessful.
If Iraq does not successfully transform into a democratic state, then the whole region will be destabilised.
Mr FigeÄŸ had nothing much to say except to offer more of the process of proffered dialogue and cooperation.
As the British Government has discovered over the last few years, this approach has so far not yielded much success.
The seriousness of the situation and the difficulty in resolving it peacefully cannot be overstated, but it will not be solved by the European Union.
Once again the EU presumes to take on the attributes of a political state.
The serious situation posed by Iran must be addressed by the properly constituted sovereign states working within the properly constituted international institutions.
If the EU successfully develops its European defence identity â that is, an EU military force â and if Turkey becomes a member of the EU, then a militarised EU will share a border not only with Iran, but also with Iraq and Syria.
If the current situation is alarming, then just imagine that one.
Â Â  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 August, in Isfahan, Iran resumed its recycling of nuclear fuel, which constituted an unambiguous breach of the Paris Agreement.
The IAEAâs Board of Governors stated on 24Â September that past experience had led it to have no confidence that Iranâs nuclear programme was for peaceful purposes only.
What does that mean?
It surely means that it is not just our relations with Iran that are at stake, but also the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the dangers that result from more and more regimes getting their hands on nuclear weapons.
Along with the ever-increasing flow of reports of executions of juveniles under the age of 18 and of others being sentenced to death, there is also the fact that Akbar Gandji, having been arrested over five years ago, is still in jail and is in a critical condition.
One cannot fail to get the impression that Iran is using the European Union as a means of buying time for its programme.
It would also appear that Iran is working on the assumption that the European Union will, in future, still not have the capacity for joint action â something that was lamentably apparent to us from our experience with Iraq.
I am convinced that this is not the time for sympathetic resolutions and friendly visits; instead, we must present a united front in order to make it plain to Iran that it is harming itself by persisting on this perilous course.
Â Â  Madam President, the situation in Iran is on a knife edge.
However, let me start by making it clear, including to the last-but-one speaker, that we would not be where we are today without the painstaking work of the âEU-3â.
Members across this House have called for a stronger, more decisive European foreign policy.
Our negotiations with Iran have represented just such an example of what we can do when we work together.
That is why it is right that todayâs resolution calls for renewed negotiations, seeks to engage third countries internationally in support of our efforts and not as an alternative to them, and should be within the framework of the Paris agreement of last November.
In that context I am proud that the British Foreign Secretary said on 28Â September âthere is no question of us going to war against Iran, this can only be resolved by diplomatic means and by diplomatic pressureâ.
Todayâs resolution is also right in saying that the breaking-off of the EUâs human rights dialogue with Iran should be treated as seriously as the breakdown of talks on Iranâs nuclear programme.
Indeed, Tehran seeks to justify the arrest of human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani by labelling him as a nuclear spy.
Whilst Mr ElBaradei should be warmly congratulated for his Nobel Peace Prize, let us not forget today the former Nobel Prize winner, Iranian human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi, who is currently in receipt of personal threats against her because of her work.
The political and human rights issues are intertwined and again I welcome the assurances given this afternoon by the President-in-Office in this respect.
Finally, this morning further evidence came forward of the possible involvement of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in providing armour-piercing infra-red bomb technology to insurgents in Iraq.
Whilst I cannot attest to these claims with certainty, when eight soldiers from my own country, the UK, have been killed in Iraq in the last five months it is right that Europe does its utmost to dissuade Iran from the proliferation of civil as well as nuclear weapons.
Â Â  â Madam President, the question is, what do we want: do we want a new Iraq in Iran?
We should not adopt an aggressive resolution which might be used as an alibi by the Americans for a unilateral invasion of Iran.
I worry about seeing more innocent victims, as in Madrid and London.
I do not want to see oil go back up to USD 70 and 100.
So we have to proceed down another path: .
To dispel Iran's fears.
To reduce its intolerance and to disarm its fanaticism.
Fanaticism is worse than a nuclear bomb.
Deng Xiaoping said, never corner a cat, always leave it a way out.
We are cornering the cat.
I do not want the cat at my throat, I do not want the cat at Europe's throat.
What the Americans want is irrational.
The United States is asking us to put Islam in Europe with Turkey and are asking us to fight Islam in the person of Persia.
Let us at long last follow a clearly European policy.
Â Â  Madam President, Iran remains a major headache for the EU and for our ally, the United States.
There is the issue of Iranâs attempts over the last 20 years to master uranium enrichment technology in a covert fashion with aid from Pakistanâs A. Q. Khan and his nuclear technology bazaar.
It is clear to any Iran watcher that its hard-line fundamentalist government, in spite of its public denials, is determined to acquire a nuclear bomb and that enriching uranium to military grade is central to its security strategy.
Paragraph 12 of the resolution, therefore, is particularly appeasing in this respect and unacceptable.
As Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, this is also totally out of the question.
I fully support the recent resolution of the IAEA which paves the way for an eventual referral to the Security Council.
I believe all options must be left open to prevent nuclear proliferation.
We do not want a repeat of the example of North Korea, which got away with withdrawing from the NPT.
And by the way, what did Nobel Peace Prize Laureate ElBaradei and the IAEA do to prevent the DPRKâs acquiring of nuclear weapons?
If it comes to UN sanctions Iran could usefully be denied access to the uranium ore as a raw material as it has only got about 35Â tonnes of yellow cake uranium at present, which is enough to make one or two bombs at most.
I also agree that Iran has an appalling human rights record, including executing minors for sexual misdemeanours, and even pregnant women.
I believe it is the only country in the world which executes pregnant women.
Lastly, I condemn Iranâs role through its terrorist proxy Hizbollahâ which I call again on the Council to ban â in supporting the insurgency in Iraq and in supplying sophisticated bombs which are killing British and American soldiers and therefore preventing peace, the establishment of democracy and the reconstruction of that blighted country.
Â Â  MadamÂ President, the European Parliament has repeatedly raised the issue of human rights violations in Iran.
The political system in Iran does not comply with internationally agreed standards concerning fundamental human rights and political freedom.
In particular, we condemn the application of the death penalty to young offenders and the threatened application of the death penalty to juveniles in that country.
The authorities in Iran impose severe restrictions on the media.
These restrictions include censorship of the Internet, which is one of the few sources of independent information available in Iran.
We are concerned that further arrests of Internet bloggers and Internet users have taken place.
We appeal in the first instance to the Iranian Parliament to act in defence of freedom of the media and freedom of expression by the Iranian people both in traditional publications and on the Internet.
We condemn the treatment meted out to the Kurdish people by the Iranian authorities.
National minorities are guaranteed certain political freedoms under international conventions, but the Kurds are unable to enjoy these in Iran.
Iranâs infringement of international arrangements on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has caused particular alarm.
We support the IAEA in calling for the matter of Iranâs nuclear programme to be referred to the UNÂ Security Council.
Tehran must publish all the documents relating to its nuclear programme.
This is especially important because in view of the undemocratic conditions prevailing in Iran, the international community has strong reason to suspect that Iranâs nuclear ambitions may not be exclusively peaceful.
The European Union cannot condone a situation in which an undemocratic country continues to pursue a nuclear programme that could result in the manufacture of an atomic bomb.
Â Â  Madam President, the statements by the Council and the Commission, as well Parliamentâs resolution, reflect another failure of the Unionâs policies.
The joint resolution carefully presents a line of justifications for Iranâs nuclear programme.
At the same time, the well-known ultimate goal of the Iranian Government is already not a distant one.
We must state clearly that there is a real danger as the terrorist and terrorist-supporting fundamentalist state is going to obtain nuclear weaponry by âconfusing and deceiving stupid Europeansâ, as it was openly described in July 2005 by the head of Iranâs nuclear programme.
If the European Parliament marginalises this great danger to international peace and to the future of democracies, this Parliament will marginalise itself.
Paradoxically, the only effective opposition to the rulers of the terrorist state was put on the terrorist list and persecuted in Europe.
If the Mujahideen movement were taken off this list, it would be a real and sound European policy.
I now turn to the resolution.
Special pro-Iranian and American warning points, as stated in Amendment 12, if adopted, would be politically unwise and counter-productive.
Two amendments â the first and fourth â introduce the clause about the Security Council, which is to be supported.
Possible opposition to it should be explained as a service for Russia, in order to prevent it from an unpleasant veto in the Security Council.
I do not understand why the European Union should lose face in order to save Russiaâs.
In the event of such a veto, we would realise how strategically reliable our alleged strategic partner really is.
If Amendment 1 is rejected, the whole resolution has no sense but prevailing surrender.
Â Â  Madam President, looking back over the speeches made in the past hour, and particularly the last one, I have to say that I have come to understand why some other Members of this House are concerned that Iran might be pushed into a corner and no longer be prepared to engage in dialogue or negotiation.
I think it needs to be reiterated that what the troika and the EU bodies offered in the course of the dialogue is a balanced strategy in relation to Iran.
It is true to say that there is no built-in guarantee of success, but there is no alternative to it.
Any one of the military options mentioned in this debate would be politically disastrous, quite apart from the question of whether or not it would be workable.
That is something that has to be made abundantly clear.
A number of my fellow-Members who have spoken in the course of the last hour also need to be reminded that we have already had experience of a situation â in Europe, too â in which two powers, armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, were squaring up to each other.
If it had not been for their ability to consider each otherâs security interests from each otherâs point of view, there would have been neither a Non-Proliferation Treaty nor disarmament, and we might well have already been through a nuclear war.
I would have been killed in it, and so, probably, for that matter, would those who have been sounding off in a bellicose fashion.
That is something for us to think about.
It is indeed the case that we have to be able to include in our calculations the legitimate security interests of other regimes â even of this one.
It makes sense to have a strategy that offers them something, but we should not rule out the possibility of using the Security Council as a means of exerting pressure; to do so would be politically foolish.
Â Â  . Madam President, honourable Members, thank you for your contributions to what has been an important debate at an important time.
I shall try to respond to a number of the points that have been made in the course of this timely debate.
I start by echoing the contribution made by Mr Howitt and others in underlining how, over the last few months, we have genuinely shown what Europe can do by working together.
I pay tribute to the other colleagues in the E3 process who have shown the strength of Europeâs diplomatic voice in challenging circumstances.
A number of honourable Members raised the issue of human rights.
There is no reason why an Islamic political system such as Iran should deny fundamental democratic rights such as freedom of choice and freedom of expression.
There can be no excuse for any system abusing human rights.
Ms Beer and others echoed the appeal that I made earlier to Tehran to free Mr Ganji and to reinforce the significance of the wider human rights agenda within Iran.
I reaffirm that call and let me echo the comments made by Commissioner Figelâ, Mr Howitt and others on Mr Soltani.
It is important to recognise that the United Nations Security Council has a potentially significant role to play.
I recognise that a number of contributions questioned the role of the Security Council.
Let there be little doubt in this House, however, that the prospect of a report to the United Nations Security Council remains real.
The responsibility in terms of the immediate steps that now need to be taken lies directly with the Iranian authorities.
The issue of military intervention has again been raised by a number of different honourable colleagues in the course of the debate â Mr Napoletano, Ms Beer, MrÂ Howitt and others â who expressed their concern at the possibility of military action being taken against Iran.
I would simply reiterate that on 3Â October 2005, European Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the European Unionâs support for a diplomatic solution to international concerns over Iranâs nuclear programme, which should include an agreement on long-term arrangements.
Such a solution would help create the climate for a better relationship with Europe and with the wider international community.
As I mentioned earlier, working and engaging with Iran will be a challenge.
But we must all do our best to meet that challenge.
The benefits to Iran and its people, to its neighbours and to the wider international community are literally incalculable.
Our preference remains to aim for a mutually beneficial relationship based on cooperation on our shared interests.
Europe wants to see Iran realise its potential and to grow and prosper.
That is what its young population deserves.
But a relationship of this sort will also need to address the European Unionâs main concerns as reaffirmed today by so many honourable Members within this Chamber.
Those concerns unequivocally include both the issue of nuclear proliferation and the related issue of human rights.
In conclusion, Iran is at a particularly crucial juncture.
The world is watching to see how its new government will manage its economic and social policies and to see if it will be a responsible partner as judged by how it deals with international concerns such as human rights and non-proliferation.
I believe that the message from this Chamber as regards the priorities of the European Union will be clearer now than at the beginning of this debate.
Â Â  .
First, I would like to thank the distinguished MEPs for their well-considered views, the great majority of which express not only support for a common approach to the nuclear question and observation of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but which also touch very seriously upon the issues of human rights and support for dialogue with the emerging civil society in Iran.
Secondly, I would like to express my appreciation for the extensive draft resolution, which bears witness to the great amount of work done by the political groups, and which, in fact, constitutes an expression of support for the balanced, considered and responsible strategy towards Iran that we are pursuing.
Thirdly, I would like to express a wish for continuing constructive and effective unity among EU Member States, European institutions and the international community in this agenda, which is sure to bring positive results sooner or later.
Â Â  The debate is closed.
I have received six motions for a resolution(1) to close this debate pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The next item is the one-minute interventions on important political issues.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following on from the preceding discussions regarding the situation in Iran, allow me to share with you one achievement of the country that I represent in the European Parliament.
I am very proud that this week the UN General Assembly has elected my country, Slovakia, as a non-permanent member of the Security Council.
Thanks to Slovakia, from January 2006 the European Union will enjoy its greatest level of representation on the only UN body competent to take decisions over matters of war and peace.
This is a historic opportunity not only for Slovakia, but also for the entire European Union, since as many as one-third of Security Council members will be representing the EU.
At a time when the UN will be addressing the question of the future status of Kosovo and developments in Ukraine, Belarus or Moldova, the EU will have an opportunity to contribute to the security of the entire continent of Europe.
In addition to that, through the successful resolution of conflicts in the Middle East or Africa, the European Union can establish its position as a key player on the global political scene and show the world its determination and readiness for action.
Â Â  Mr President, speaking on behalf of the South Asian Delegation, of which I am Chair, I would like to express my heartfelt and deepest condolences to all the friends and families who have lost loved ones in the earthquake in Pakistan and India.
This tragedy strikes a cord as the latest in a series of natural disasters in the region, and once again the worldâs poorest need our help.
With thousands dead and many more homeless and vulnerable, the spread of disease, extreme weather conditions and even criminal opportunities pose a threat to the people of the area.
Unfortunately, the relief work is not getting through fast enough.
Although I welcome the Commissionâs pledge of EURÂ 3 million, it is not enough.
Therefore I am calling on the Commission and the Council to ensure that their response is commensurate with the scale of this tragedy.
Firstly, they need to urgently coordinate their efforts between the EU Member States, so that the right type of aid reaches the area.
Secondly, they need to provide technical expertise and equipment and to undertake detailed needs assessment, so that no more people suffer as a result of negligence on the part of the international community.
Thirdly, we need to start thinking about the future and about how we respond to these disasters.
I support the call by the Presidency for a standing international fund to respond to disasters like the tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake, as quickly and as effectively as possible.
Â Â  Thank you, Mrs Gill, I am sure we all share those sentiments.
Â Â  Mr President, avian flu is once again knocking on Europeâs door.
The cases of highly suspect mass poultry deaths reported in Romania and Turkey are very worrying.
The fear of a global avian flu epidemic is real.
Extensive plans on how to cope with this threat are being drawn up by all responsible European governments and by the Commission.
Unfortunately, the Turkish Government does not appear to be taking this problem seriously.
This has been clearly demonstrated in two instances.
Firstly, EU officials reported that the results of important tests were delayed and are still awaited because Turkey was late in sending samples to the appropriate laboratory.
Secondly, in a public statement yesterday, the Turkish Minister of Agriculture declared that âthere is no reason for concernâ.
Mr President, could you convey to the Turkish Government our deep concern at the complacent and irresponsible way in which the authorities in that candidate member country seem to be dealing with this extremely serious matter?
In addition, could you stress to the Commission that we expect drastic action to be taken in order to prevent this disease spreading from Turkey into other neighbouring countries?
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, a year has gone by since Poland became a Member of the European Union.
The situation for Polish agriculture has become steadily worse rather than better during that period and it should be remembered that Polish agriculture was already in a parlous situation following five decades of Soviet occupation.
Firstly, pursuant to the Treaty of Accession, Poland was obliged to consent to lower payments for farmers in the long term.
In practice, this meant maintaining the for farmers instead of providing them with opportunities for development.
This unfortunate situation has been further aggravated by the fact that the change in the rate of exchange for the euro resulted in a drop in the value of this yearâs direct payments in relation to last yearâs.
In addition, an influx of cheap grain to Poland led to a price reduction of approximately 35% in comparison with 2003 when Poland was not yet a Member of the Union.
The Union is currently proposing reducing the national amounts of sugar to which payments apply.
In addition, the Commissioner for Trade is planning to cut subsidies for agricultural trade by approximately 60% in the future.
All these facts testify to the Unionâs wholesale disregard of the interests of the new Member States and to its failure to support development in the east of the Community.
The Union has made only empty promises in that regard.
I appeal to the Commission to grant full payments to these areas as of 2007, in order to prevent a tragedy in the agricultural world and the emergence of social tensions in the new Member States.
Â Â  Special pleading for farmers has no sympathy from me.
Â Â  Mr President, our voters deserve to know whether their elected governments stand up for them at Council of Ministers meetings.
But, of course, they cannot, because these proceedings are held in secret.
That is why I was happy to be one of the authors of Written Declaration NoÂ 45, calling for an end to this and calling for openness and transparency in the Council of Ministers.
I would urge other MEPS to sign this written declaration.
I would say to the British Presidency that this gives it an opportunity.
It was in this very room that Tony Blair said that he wanted to give a lead in Europe and to re-engage the peoples of Europe.
Here is something that the British Presidency could do easily and painlessly: end the secrecy; chalk up a success for the British Presidency.
I suspect that by the end of December Mr Blair is going to need to have had one or two successes.
Â Â  I should just like to report that national parliaments meeting under COSAC on Monday resolved that the Council should meet in public, so you have support there too, Mr Farage.
Â Â  â I would like to talk about Kazakhstan.
Although this state is not in Europe, it is very important to the European Union, not in the least because of its oilfields.
Cooperation between the European Union and Kazakhstan in this area could greatly reduce the EUâs dependency on the supply of oil and gas from Russia.
The domination of any market by one country causes concern and is undesirable.
Presidential elections are scheduled to take place in Kazakhstan on 4 December of this year.
Moreover, this country aspires to take on the Chairmanship of the OSCE in 2009.
However, international human rights organisations report infringements of human rights and liberties there, as well as laws that do not conform to the standards of a democratic state, for example, the Law on Political Parties.
I call on the leaders of the European Parliament to send a delegation from the European Parliament to observe the elections and verify that these elections comply with international requirements and standards.
This would constitute a âlitmus testâ for assessment of the results of these Presidential elections and for determination of whether to support Kazakhstan in its drive to take on the Chairmanship of the OSCE.
Thank you.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to thank you and the Office of the President for responding to the request from the Kashmiri community in my constituency, and indeed the Kashmiri Mayor of Manchester, Afzal Khan, to send condolences and aid to the victims of the earthquake.
The death toll is rising; at least two million people are homeless with winter just weeks away.
A terrible tragedy requires dramatic and speedy action and a generosity of financing and support to meet the aims and match the funding that we gave to the victims of the tsunami crisis as well.
DM Digital Television, a TV company in my region, has been contacted by frantic relatives from across Europe seeking urgent help for orphans.
I would ask the Commission to prioritise assistance to children and to orphans, to assist families and relatives in Europe and the UK to adopt orphans if they wish to, and to get assistance from the government and immigration authorities to enable this to go ahead.
I would also ask for urgent medical attention to be provided.
I would ask the Commission and the EU to act on this request as urgently as possible to assist those children and those orphans in need.
Â Â  Mr President, following on from the recent earthquake, I also wish to send my condolences.
However, can the President of Parliament use his good offices to persuade the Governments of both India and Pakistan to allow aid to cross unheeded over the line of control?
I am delighted to hear that, so far, five families from Pakistan Kashmir and one from Indian-controlled Kashmir have been allowed to go home.
That is a step in the right direction.
However, I also understand that many individuals and organisations from the Indian side are being told that, because of the dispute that has been going on for over 50Â years between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, they are not allowed to cross the border to give help to the victims.
I hope that old enmities will continue to be put behind them and for them to concentrate only on the provision of humanitarian aid.
Â Â  Mr President, I speak on behalf of one of my constituents, John Packwood, a British citizen who has recently been extradited from Spain to Morocco to face charges of drug smuggling in spite of a complete lack of evidence.
Not only has he suffered a gross miscarriage of justice, but he is also the victim of discrimination on grounds of nationality, contrary to the letter and spirit of EU law.
Mr Packwood was extradited under a highly discriminatory treaty between Spain and Morocco.
It exempts Spanish nationals from extradition, but provides that other EU nationals can be extradited without the Spanish authorities being in any way obliged to investigate the merits of the case.
This is directly contrary to the EC Treaty ban on discrimination on the grounds of nationality and is fundamentally incompatible with the values of the EU.
I therefore call on the President of the Parliament and, in particular, Commissioner Frattini to take action to ensure the reality of an EU area of freedom, justice and security is put in place, by remedying both the injustice and the discrimination Mr Packwood is suffering.
Would the President of the Parliament please write to the Moroccan authorities to raise this?
Â Â  Â MrÂ President, the treat posed by avian influenza leads me to raise the issue of responsibility for public health in this House.
After all, public health was meant to be one of the main priorities for the European Union.
It would appear that the Commission simply wishes to govern with no regard for solidarity and responsibility, and that it is more concerned about protecting birds than about protecting people.
Europe is once again splitting into two parts.
On the one hand there is the rich half, busily stockpiling supplies of antiviral medicinal products, and on the other hand the poor half that can only afford small amounts of such products.
Coordinating their supply to the whole Union would certainly lead to price reductions, whereas producers and smugglers eager to make their fortunes at the expense of human health are the only ones to benefit from decentralisation of the purchase of Tamiflu and vaccines.
The legal situation regarding patents for Oseltamivir and other neuraminidase inhibitors and their recognition as antiretrovirals should also be standardised across the Union.
At present it seems that prolonging the lives of people affected by HIV and AIDS is more important than preventing deaths from other causes.
Â Â  Mr President, last Mayâs MalmstrÃ¶m report on Russia considers the final demarcation of all the borders between Russia and the new Member States as a precondition for the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement.
At the latest London summit, Parliamentâs position was clearly ignored.
Until now, Russia has refused to finalise a border with Latvia.
With regard to Estonia, the border treaty was signed in May and was duly ratified by the Estonian Parliament.
However, Mr Putinâs Government then made an unprecedented move: it denied the validity of its own signature on an international treaty.
This places a big question mark on the credibility of any further Russian commitment.
These issues were not even mentioned at the London Summit.
Sadly, today, we can observe the EU letting itself be split by the Kremlin rather than making the CFSP more reliable and coherent, as suggested by the MalmstrÃ¶m report
Â Â  Mr President, after speaking I would like to hand over to you a two-euro coin. This coin was minted in 2005, and it depicts the 15 old Member States â not only eurozone members, but also Britain, Sweden and Denmark, which are not members of the eurozone.
Now, a year on from their accession, I would like to see the ten new Member States being included in the map of Europe, even though we are not yet part of the eurozone either.
This would have a very important symbolic value, and I urge the European Central Bank and you, Mr President, to take steps to this end.
This is a tiny little symbolic step, but believe me, it is a very important one for us, the new Member States.
Â Â  â Mr President, negotiations on FYROM start in a month.
There is an outstanding question: the question of the name is still outstanding.
They are claiming the name of Greek Macedonia.
So we have to take certain initiatives after the failure of the American negotiator, Mr Nimitz.
I therefore call on the European Parliament to go and ask those who are enlightened, to ask the professors; I call on you to go to the library and find out what language Aristotle, Protagoras and Democritus wrote in, what language Alexandra the Great spoke and for justice to be done at long last.
We must not allow this to continue: the hijacking of a name which does not belong to them and of a history which does not belong to them either.
This nation, this friendly nation, came to the area in the eighth century A.D. How can it claim the history of Macedonia, which dates back to the fifth century B.C.?
We are calling for justice at long last.
Do you understand?
The truth is killing us.
We want an initiative by the European Union.
Europe must turn its attention to the issues on its own doorstep.
Â Â  Mr President, please allow me, as chairman of the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee, to express my delight and gratitude regarding last weekâs Council decision giving the go-ahead for Croatia to begin accession negotiations too.
Although the negotiations with Turkey will open at the same time, I believe it is important not to tie the two countries together, be it during the screening process or chapter negotiations.
Croatia must be assessed solely on its own merits and achievements.
In the case of Croatia, it will really be a process of reunification rather than enlargement, as this nation of four-and-a-half million souls has always been part of Europe; it shares our common history and culture.
We also received assurances from our Croatian colleagues at the meeting of the parliamentary delegation that they will continue to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, which was one of the conditions for the launch of accession negotiations.
I call upon you to do what you can in your own particular field to bring the negotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion, so that we can welcome our Croatian friends as new members of this House after the 2009 elections to the European Parliament.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would very much like to let the whole of Europe know about what happened to me last Monday, 10 October 2005, while I was providing telephone information to pensioners on a private Italian television channel.
A pensioner called from Genoa who started by saying that she had a widowâs survivorâs pension.
She stopped speaking because she began crying, but then went on to say that since she had not received the pension for that month, she did not know how she would manage to survive.
Then I remembered something that happened in London, where a pensioner, who had not received her pension in her post-box, since it had been removed by the UK post office, was found dead a few months later because she could no longer collect her pension.
Mr President, how much longer will the governments of any political hue in Europe carrying on treating pensioners like pieces of paper or dead branches and not as people who breathe, live, have worked and therefore have earned everyoneâs respect?
Â Â  Mr President, last week the European Court of Justice made a ruling that British prisoners should have the right to vote in elections.
This followed an appeal by a British prisoner that his human rights were being violated by the English law that prevents prisoners from voting.
The European Court of Justice is of course not a court of justice.
Its purpose is to ensure that the political will of the European Union is enforced in Member States.
This particular piece of idiocy is a direct consequence of the Labour Governmentâs decision in 1998 to incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into English law.
If enforced, this verdict means that Ian Huntley, the Soham murderer; Ian Brady, the moors murderer: Robert Black, the child killer; and every paedophile and criminal in British prisons will have a say in what kind of government we elect.
This ruling clearly demonstrates why Britain should regain control of its own affairs.
Â Â  I belong among those MEPs who can claim some familiarity with the issue of bioethics.
In 1998, MEP MikolÃ¡Å¡ik and I initiated a resolution of the Slovak Parliament dealing with the accession of Slovakia to the âOviedo Protocolâ on the prohibition of cloning.
I have also been committed to the cause of making it a criminal offence in Slovakia to perform controversial research on embryos and embryonic stem cells.
I therefore added my signature to those of the group of MEPs who addressed Commission President Barroso with the demand that this controversial research not be financed from EU budgets.
We are speaking about the use of funds for specific programmes under the 7th Framework Programme for research and development.
I would like to thank President Barroso for his reply, which promises that the European Commission will pay close attention to this issue and that our concerns will be dealt with.
I would also like to assure the President of the Commission that the group of signatories to the letter will continue to follow developments in this area closely and to maintain their standpoint.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to raise the issue of a problem that an organisation called Frontline is experiencing.
Frontline is an international foundation for the protection of human rights defenders, an organisation that seeks to help those who are working in various parts of the world defending human rights, and who themselves are at risk.
Frontline has organised a major conference in Dublin this week and eight of the participants in that conference have been denied the right to travel by their states. They include a participant from Uzbekistan; a participant from Tunisia; a participant from Palestine who has been denied the right to travel by Israel; participants from Iran and Saudi Arabia; a participant from Western Sahara who has been denied the right to travel by Morocco; a participant from Syria; and a participant from Chechnya who has been denied the right to travel by Russia.
This is clearly a situation in which people who are defending the universal declaration of human rights are being denied the right they are guaranteed under that declaration to leave and to return to their own country.
I would ask the Presidency of Parliament to intervene on behalf of these people.
I will send the details of these cases individually to the Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, VAT reductions on labour-intensive activities were used by countries to make buildings more affordable for people and families.
These reductions will end on 31Â December if we do nothing.
This would be counter-productive at this time with an ageing population which will require labour-intensive building adaptations of their homes.
Similarly, with the increasing number of persons with disability, adaptations which are labour-intensive will be needed.
It is also ironic that we are taking away the VAT reductions at the same time as the EU is requiring and encouraging energy efficiency in houses.
If we are going to make houses more energy efficient we need to be able to do very labour-intensive building, and renovation, and we are making it more, not less, expensive.
Are we serious about lowering our domestic energy use?
If we are, we need to extend the VAT reductions of labour-intensive activities, particularly in the building industry.
Â Â  Mr President, Mrs Sinnott and I have tabled two written declarations that focus Membersâ attention on the fact that the lower rates of value added tax will at the end of December 2005 unless the Council of Ministers take the right and proper decision to extend them.
We also try to extend the area of choice to make sure that the aged and the disabled will benefit from lower rates of VAT, which will give them cheaper housing accommodation, particularly when they have adaptations carried out.
At present, the construction industry â I chair the construction forum in the European Parliament â has no idea whether these lower rates of value added tax will continue in a few weeksâ time.
It is important that early decisions are made.
Â Â  Mr President, as you are well aware, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has approved a statement, on behalf of the 25 Members, in which it expresses its concern about the situation of three political prisoners in Cuba who have been tortured by the Cuban regime: JosÃ© Daniel Ferrer GarcÃ­a, VÃ­ctor Rolando Arroyo and FÃ©lix Navarro, who were on hunger strike.
While I know that the President of Parliament, MrÂ Borrell, will attend the Ibero-American Summit in Salamanca and that the dictator Fidel Castro has not been excluded from appearing in that city in the flesh, I would like to ask Mr Borrell to communicate the European Union and our Parliamentâs final position to the Cuban delegates: the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Cuba.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a party of mayors was here in Brussels last week, visiting Belgium, and one of them had his rucksack stolen in the Grandâ Place.
He wanted to report this to the police, but the officers on the Grandâ Place informed him that this would not be possible unless he gave his passport number.
This is not the only case of its kind; this sort of thing is going on all the time.
In my office, there are mounting piles of complaints about parties of visitors being attacked and having things stolen, and I would ask the House and those who run it to consider setting up a helpdesk to follow up these complaints, not least with the Belgian authorities.
Â Â  Thank you for that.
I am sure Mr Michel was listening with interest.
That concludes the one-minute speeches.
Those that require an answer will of course receive an answer from the institution.
Â Â  The next item is the Commission communication on EU policy on Africa.
Â Â  MrÂ President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, before beginning, I should like to express my sadness and indignation following this weekendâs events in Darfur.
The loss of two soldiers and two civilians belonging to the African Union peace-keeping mission in Darfur has been a shock for all of us.
The European Commission vigorously condemns this cruel and cowardly act.
I should like to express my most sincere condolences to the African Union and to all the soldiers of the mission, and I should like to say to them that Europe supports them more than ever in the quest for peace.
Mr President, honourable Members, with the adoption, today, of a European strategy on Africa, the European Commission is taking, I think, a giant step towards a new political partnership between Europe and Africa â a strategic, solid and rational partnership between, on the one hand, an enlarged Europe and, on the other hand, a renewed Africa.
For too long, relations between Europe and Africa have been characterised by a lack of consistency between the definition and implementation of policies; between, on the one hand, the policies and actions of certain Member States and, on the other, those of the European Commission; between the approach adopted in sub-Saharan Africa and that adopted in North Africa; between cooperation in connection with trade and that in connection with economic development; and between initiatives in connection with traditional socio-economic development and measures in connection with strategic policy.
Neither Europe nor Africa could tolerate this situation going on any longer.
The purpose of the new strategy on Africa that I am presenting to you today is, therefore, to provide the EU with a single, global and integrated framework for managing its relations with Africa in the long term.
For the first time, Europe is coherently addressing Africa as a whole from Cairo to the Cape.
Even if Africa has several faces, several histories and different needs, it has now embarked as a single entity on the road to the political, economic and cultural integration of the whole continent.
This commitment has been given concrete expression by the efforts to integrate the regional economic communities and by the New Partnership for Africaâs Development, or NEPAD, and the launch of the African Union.
These organisations now embody the hope of the continent.
I also remember the scepticism surrounding the creation of the African Union three years ago.
Now, remarkable progress in all areas, particularly those of peace and security, can be observed.
The African Union is a major strategic player and, I would even venture to say, a player that, as far as we are concerned, cannot be ignored on the African continent.
Europe has a duty to respond to the call from an Africa in which a lot is happening.
For the first time too, this strategy creates a framework of action for Europe as a whole.
It is not a question of eliminating the various national policies.
I shall go on repeating that these national policies have their own specific character and added value.
No, it is, rather, a question of creating a coherent framework for reinforcing collective action at European level.
Together, we are more effective and count for more.
Enlargement of the European Union to include ten new Member States has reinforced this need because it has increased the number of potential individual partners to 26: 25 Member States plus the European Community.
It is not enough for EU aid to increase. Its effectiveness needs also to be improved.
In the past, the absence of coordination and complementarity between donors has often prevented development policies leading to practical and effective results.
