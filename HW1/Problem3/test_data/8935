Today, it is also a strong state fighting for the education of its people.
On this subject I would like to remind Mrs Uca, with a heavy heart, that 30% of women in Turkey do not go to school, nor are allowed to do so, so in this way they miss out on an education.
To conclude, I would like to say that there are also bad points.
The major black cloud over the Ottoman tradition is its perception of the unlimited rights of the conqueror over the conquered.
This gives rise to the great problem of prisons and exterminations: the loss of rights of the conquered, the weaker party, rape, exterminations, silence and death.
I think that it is in this area that we should offer our help, for Turkey is a stabilising factor in this region: it is establishing agreements with Syria and is an important element in the creation of a peaceful border with Europe.
We have to contribute to the strengthening of this strategy and its improvement, with European ideas used in governance.
Mr President, here is another chance for Turkey to exploit its strategic position and use its proverbial military capabilities: let us hope that, this time, its attachment to the West will be more effectively translated into vital internal reforms.
Mr Lamassoure has painted an objective, clear picture of the country but, despite some positive elements, he does not hide his concern that Turkey might regress to a state which is worse than the current situation.
It is positive that the Turkish government has presented a programme of conditions for joining Europe and it is positive that it is working on the Constitution, but it is negative that neither the 'road map' nor the timetable for the reforms has been clearly defined.
The European Union is not asking every country to follow the same procedure, but there are certain values, certain individual and democratic rights which must be respected - and Europe does know how to be patient - in Turkey and in its prisons too.
One final point: the question of the Armenian genocide is, strangely, becoming increasingly important with the passing of time.
Today, humanity no longer tolerates lies or inaccurate accounts when it comes to the horrific events of history.
It is not necessary to say, for example, how much the descriptions of the blood baths of the two world wars by former enemy historians helped to soothe feelings and cool emotions, and this example should be followed as soon as possible by Turks and Armenians, with a view to starting to normalise relations between the two neighbouring countries.
Lastly, I am sure that Armenia would be quite willing to erect a monument in front of one of the European institutions commemorating its sacrifice and entrusting it to history.
This would also make it possible for us, too, to produce documents on Turkey without worrying about how to address the question of Armenia.
It is necessary to remember the past in order to do better in the future.
Mr President, being one of the last to speak, I am in a strange situation in which basically everything has already been said, but not by everybody.
Nonetheless, I should like to comment on two points which I think are particularly important.
First, however, I should like to thank our rapporteur.
This is a superb report, couched in very moderate terms.
We can live with it quite nicely and, more to the point, it is a report which is conducive to consensus.
We must bear in mind that this is a progress report.
I think there will be a great many more progress reports to come on the question of Turkey's pre-accession to the European Union.
Now to the points on which I should like to comment.
First, the question of the death penalty which has not, I think, been adequately evaluated in the House this evening.
The general political reforms which Turkey recently introduced are very promising and we fully acknowledge them.
However, we all know, and Turkey should also know, which is why we must say so loud and clear, that they represent enormous progress within Turkey itself.
Naturally, from our point of view, they are just a beginning.
I must say, we always get a bit carried away when it comes to Turkey.
But, perhaps, the means are basically the end at the moment, especially when we consider human rights.
But, to come back to the death penalty. We obviously feel that it must be abolished completely.
There can be no partial abolition of the death penalty from a democratic point of view.
There can only be complete abolition.
That this is difficult in Turkey at the moment for domestic political reasons is patently obvious.
The second point which I think is important is the fight against corruption within Turkey.
Because as long as sleaze runs public and social life in Turkey, the people will have no faith in politicians and as long as they have no faith in politicians, they will put more faith in the military.
But it is out of the question in a democratic community for the military, in the form of the national security council, always to have the last word, de facto, on parliament's resolutions.
I think that a great deal of work is still needed on this within Turkey.
And that can only mean fighting corruption and ensuring that the people have faith in politicians.
Mr President, I want to thank Mr Lamassoure for his sterling work.
I wish to put the following question to the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement, Mr Verheugen. Is it possible for Turkey to become a member of the European Union in view of the continued Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus, continued Turkish migration from Anatolia to Northern Cyprus and the documented destruction in that part of the island of the historic heritage in the form of monasteries, churches and cultural buildings?
If, in the future, it is possible for a country, such as Turkey, to continue to occupy a part of another future EU country, namely Cyprus, and yet remain a Member State, what will have happened to that democracy and spirit of reconciliation that forms the very soul of European cooperation and the very values that underlie it?
In that case, what will have become of our credibility in working for peace?
I also think that it is necessary for Turkey, in the same ambitious way as Germany, to deal with the dark and sombre chapters of its twentieth century history.
It is not acceptable for Turkey to go on denying the Armenian genocide of one and a half million Christians.
It is not acceptable for it to deny that Christian Assyrians, Chaldeans and Syrians were also exposed to a genocide in which hundreds of thousands of people were murdered following a fatwa concerning holy war on the Christians, issued in 1914 by the top Muslim leader.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission welcomes the broad agreement in this debate on Turkey's progress.
I hope that we can use this common ground when assessing the work in store for us.
I should also like to emphasise that the Commission agrees with the conclusions and views expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, in his report.
Here, too, there is a broad agreement and this, too, will be helpful as we continue in our work.
Several speakers have said, and I should like to stress this, that Turkey has become more, rather than less, important to us.
And this does not only have to do with its geo-strategic position.
I have always warned about reducing Turkey to a locality of special geo-strategic importance.
I prefer to believe that Turkey's uniqueness also lies in its cultural and historic heritage and in the political role which it can play at this global political interface.
The political elite in Turkey have demonstrated that they are absolutely determined to keep modernising the country and bringing it closer to European standards.
The constitutional reform which has now been decided is an important indication of this.
For me, this constitutional reform represents real progress.
Parliament adopted these important resolutions very quickly and with an overwhelming majority.
I think this large majority is particularly important, because it clearly shows that there is broad social consensus on the need for democratic and rule-of-law reforms.
These changes need to demonstrate that they are effective in practice, however.
The crucial question to Turkey is always, what has actually changed?
Which is why everyone is right who said, during the debate, that the point now, as far as they were concerned, was to see how Turkey implements these promising constitutional reforms and what actually changes.
In this respect, the Commission agrees with the European Parliament's appraisal that, the constitutional reforms and further legislative initiatives announced, notwithstanding, a great deal still needs to be done if human rights really are to be securely and permanently protected in Turkey.
Our relations have progressed well since Helsinki.
The pre-accession strategy has been implemented.
As with all the other candidate countries, the priorities for Turkey have also been set out in an accession partnership.
This year Turkey adopted a national programme for incorporating the acquis which also includes the timetable for new legislation which has been called for on numerous occasions here in the House.
This legislation will need to be in keeping with the acquis of the European Union.
We want to continue the pre-accession strategy for Turkey on the basis of the principles adopted in Helsinki.
This obviously means that there can be no talk of starting negotiations until the political criteria for accession have been met.
I would stress here that we are not in the business of offering discounts on the political criteria for accession to the European Union to anyone anywhere.
It is in keeping with the philosophy behind the Helsinki resolutions that, with the exception of negotiations, Turkey must be treated in exactly the same way in all other areas as the other candidate countries.
The Lamassoure report refers to the difficult economic situation in Turkey.
I should like to encourage Turkey to continue with the economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund.
As for us, we shall release the first tranche of EUR 75 million from the European Union structural adjustment facility for Turkey as quickly as possible.
As far as Cyprus is concerned, we continue to abide firmly by the view that the peace process should be resumed as quickly as possible under the auspices of the United Nations.
Turkey has promised to support this process.
But I must say quite unequivocally that the European Union expects this support to translate into specific action and result in our actually resolving this problem.
I am confident that accession negotiations with Cyprus will be concluded during the course of next year, which is why it is particularly important that the parties involved make every effort to find a lasting political solution.
The components for a solution, which take account of the interests and concerns of all involved, are well documented.
What we need is the political courage to grab this opportunity and resolve the Cyprus question now.
The window of opportunity is open. But, it must be said, it will probably not be open for much longer.
A solution to the Cyprus question will benefit future relations between the European Union and Turkey enormously.
Relations between Greece and Turkey have already improved considerably.
The Commission welcomes the confidence-building measures agreed.
I congratulate the two foreign secretaries, Ismail Cem and Georgios Papandreos on their initiative and their success.
Both foreign secretaries did a great deal to foster a climate conducive to further progress in the region.
As far as outstanding problems with European security and defence policy are concerned, I called on Turkey, just a few days ago, to help achieve a constructive solution as quickly as possible.
In all events, this problem should be resolved before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken in December this year.
A little extra effort and it should be possible, and I am convinced that it is possible, to reach an agreement.
We are fully aware of Turkey's concerns, especially, as regards, possible action in its neck of the woods.
But I call on our Turkish partners to take a constructive attitude so that an agreement can be reached soon.
We should be able to expect a country which is a candidate for membership of the European Union to support rather than block one of the most important future projects of the European Union.
The Commission considers that it is important to improve relations between Turkey and Armenia in order to foster security and stability in the region.
The Commission therefore welcomes the very recent initiative by the civil society in the two countries to bring the two nations closer together and, with the help of independent historians, to reappraise the tragic events of the past.
I welcome the European Parliament's position on the programme of financial assistance.
The proposed amendments are acceptable to us.
I particularly agree with the European Parliament that care must be taken to ensure that various sources of funding and programmes are properly coordinated.
It is true that we are probably now in a decisive stage of relations between the European Union and Turkey.
Once the Lamassoure Reports have been adopted we shall have all the elements needed for our pre-accession strategy to hand by the end of the year.
We can then go on to the next stage in which we shall have to focus mainly on stepping up and putting Turkish preparations for accession into practice.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Loading and unloading of bulk carriers
The next item is the report (A5-0326/2001) by Rijk van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers (7193/1/2001 - C5-0292/2001 - 2000/0121(COD)).
Mr President, our group supports the work carried out, thus far, by Mr Van Dam and the Council, together.
We feel that this recommendation is a major step forwards, particularly in the field of maritime safety, especially since the statistics of past years are extremely alarming: in the last 10 years, between 1990 and 1999, we recorded the sinking of 146 bulk carriers and the deaths of 780 crew members, all of which occurred during the loading or unloading of these carriers.
The Commission' s directive harmonises, at last, a field of legislation which has allowed too many, too dangerous exceptions in the past.
We are going to harmonise the loading and unloading procedures, the safety standards inside and outside terminals and the levels of responsibility on board vessels and ashore.
I welcome the fact that all this has served to improve quality, first and foremost; we feel that quality must be an essential, basic condition if safety standards are to be satisfactory.
I welcome the fact that a balance was found quickly between Parliament and the Council' s positions, a balance which, moreover, respects the spirit of the amendments proposed and adopted by Parliament as well.
At last, as of today, we are on the way to more stringent legislation, to a code of procedure which has the merit of courageously placing safety above all other concerns, including economic and financial concerns.
That is why we are totally satisfied with the final version of this report.
Mr President, I wish to thank rapporteur van Dam for the successful preparation of the report.
Increasing marine safety requires ongoing work.
Increasing the safety of loading and unloading of bulk carriers is an important aspect of work for the improvement of safety in the shipping sector.
As is the case in many matters concerning marine safety, these rules are also agreed at the International Maritime Organisation on a voluntary basis.
Since the regulations are currently being applied only intermittently, it is good that they are being incorporated into Community legislation.
Improving the loading and unloading of bulk carriers and the efficient performance of ports will also further the development of important intermodal transportations.
Along with a further tightening of the rules, care must be taken that the decisions made are realistic and feasible.
The biggest shortcoming in the position of the Council is that, as the rapporteur states, information need not be given on all damage caused to the structure and fittings of a vessel.
In addition, I wish to call attention to the fact that decisions to increase marine safety, which are made only within the Union, are not sufficient.
Questions of safety and liability must, as far as possible, be dealt with on a worldwide basis.
The matter needs to be given a rapid passage, even though the common position of the Council has not included all the proposals of the Parliament's first reading.
Our group supports approval of the common position as it stands.
Mr President, the Commission is delighted by the report which has been drawn up by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in relation to this proposed directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers.
I wish, in particular, to thank Mr van Dam for his report and for the help he has given the Commission in its efforts to increase the safety of bulk carriers.
This directive will transpose into Community legislation the code of the International Maritime Organisation, which is currently in force in relation to the safe loading and unloading of ships, as well as certain parts of the convention for the safety of life at sea.
This code, which is, in fact, a recommendation, was established by the IMO in 1997, but, so far, it has not been widely applied.
As soon as its application becomes obligatory in all the Union' s ports, this code will be much more widely used and will, therefore, contribute to the safety of all bulk carriers visiting the Union.
As the rapporteur has indicated, this directive is aimed at combating the phenomenon of the disappearance of bulk carriers, that is, the sinking of these ships, which suddenly break up in open sea and sink in a few minutes, thereby causing the loss of considerable human life.
As Mr Fava has said, these statistics are unfortunately quite clear: over the last ten years, these wrecks have caused the loss of 134 ships with 743 victims, and there is a consistent tendency in terms of the average age and the total annual dead weight of the ships which have disappeared.
It was, therefore, necessary to deal with this issue of the safety of bulk carriers, and it is known that bad loading and unloading methods are considered to be one of the main causes of these tragic accidents.
As the rapporteur has said, the directive is designed to ensure that the handling of cargo in our ports respects strict rules, so as to prevent damage to ships during loading or unloading of heavy bulk cargo.
Before and during loading and unloading, the crew on board and the dock personnel must be in contact and in agreement, and, furthermore, a plan must be agreed in advance in relation to the way the loading and unloading will be carried out.
Heavy equipment which is often used in these operations must be handled with caution, and, in the event of a disagreement between the two parties, the dock personnel and the crew on board, the competent authority must be able to intervene to suspend the operations in order to prevent possible damage to the structure of the bulk carriers.
The Commission is therefore very pleased that Parliament intends to accept the common position of the Council without amendments, because, if it is adopted rapidly, this directive will be able to enter into force very soon.
This also shows that, on sensitive maritime issues, the European Parliament and the Council are able to rapidly reach a decision with the greatest degree of cohesion, and the Commission hopes that the cohesion demonstrated in this case will also be demonstrated in relation to the other great issues which are currently on the agenda.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Reporting formalities for ships
The next item is the report (A5-0327/2001) by Ari Vatanen, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on reporting formalities for ships arriving in and departing from Community ports (COM(2001) 46 - C5-0051/2001 - 2001/0026(COD)).
Mr President, Commissioner, and those ladies and gentlemen who are still awake, the economic integration of Europe is an objective which many, even among those who oppose political integration, can swallow without indigestion.
The promotion of local shipping also enjoys broad favour, since preservation of the environment and a significant reduction of congestion on our roads are essential.
The Commission's proposal for a common form for ports is a sensible step (even though on this occasion it does not arouse political passions) towards the simplification of port formalities.
It must be said that the forms in use at present vary greatly between Member States.
The proposed directive would mean that the International Maritime Organisation's FAL forms would always be approved in our ports.
For once we are getting a proposal from the Commission which does not increase bureaucracy in any way. It would be nice if this could happen more often.
This stems from the fact that the Member States are by no means obliged to demand any forms; whereas, if a Member State regards it as necessary to obtain information covered by the proposed directive, it must always accept the FAL forms.
I support the Commission's proposal, and take the view that we should welcome it with open arms.
I have made a few technical adjustments which are in line with the Council of Ministers' preliminary position.
I believe that we can now, exceptionally, get by with a single reading.
I also thank the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, who succeeded in keeping the political animal which lurks in all of us under control, and did not churn out revisions of their own.
Putting our own stamp on everything must not lead to the objectives themselves being obscured and timetables being interfered with.
This time we neatly avoided this pitfall.
The general adoption of the IMO's FAL documents will promote the efficient functioning of the common market, and it definitely represents a welcome improvement.
I do not, however, wish to overestimate its importance, since what is involved here is merely a very small part of a larger whole.
We will not bring dynamism to ports merely by standardising forms; we need to introduce competition to ports as well.
The significance of my report does, in fact, largely hinge on the question of whether we will have the courage also to approve the Commission's proposal for deregulating port services.
I hope that Parliament will continue the project of building Europe by dismantling monopolies.
And, in this context, I look symbolically and appealingly in the direction of my highly esteemed colleague Mr Jarzembowski.
Finally, I wish to give thanks once again for the cooperation of the Commission and of the Council.
Europe needs constructive action and less politically-motivated confrontation.
I trust that we will be able to improve the status of shipping by the action now proposed.
Ladies and gentlemen, the rudder is set.
Let us steer Europe in the direction of competitive ports!
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports both this Commission proposal and the report by Mr Vatanen, who, having already demonstrated his adventures as a driver on roads throughout the world, now amazes us with his knowledge of a subject as difficult as maritime transport and the certificates that have to be completed when ships arrive at, or depart from, our ports.
Very gradually, people like ourselves, here, today, in this House, Mr Vatanen, myself, and all of you, are building a common Europe.
We are now eighteen, it is true, years behind with regard to 1 January 1983, which already seems like such a long time ago, when the Community institutions and the then ten Member States approved the Single European Act.
The standardisation of reporting formalities will, without a doubt, contribute to an improvement in maritime transport between ports situated in Member States, encouraging the promotion of short sea shipping.
By encouraging the transportation of goods by sea we will free up, to a certain extent, the amount of heavy traffic on our already saturated roads.
We can only regret that this proposal, as noted by Mr Vatanen in his explanatory statement, does not cover dangerous goods.
We ask the Commission not to limit this standardisation of reporting formalities to the Community.
The Community should press for this type of information to be common to the whole international community, promoting the International Maritime Organisation's Convention on the Facilitation of Maritime Traffic.
We would also invite those Member States who have not done so, to ratify this Convention, although the Commission proposal does not oblige them to do so.
I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Vatanen on his excellent work.
Mr President, I, too, would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Vatanen, for his excellent preparatory work, which aims to ensure the rapid passage of this important business.
An efficiently functioning internal market requires smooth working and more standardised practices than previously in the transportation sector.
However, the reporting obligations of ships arriving in ports and leaving them vary greatly from one Member State to another.
Most Member States have already signed the IMO's Convention on the facilitation of maritime traffic.
The proposal for a directive, now under discussion, is a good example of practices which are already internationally recognised as being good ones.
In my opinion, besides the safety of shipping, it is important to facilitate practical procedures.
By clear, uniform yet flexible procedures, shipping will be made a more attractive alternative mode of transport.
There may be a particularly positive impact on local shipping.
Improving the effectiveness of port practices will also facilitate the development of important intermodal transportation systems.
Since several forms are in use, attention needs to be given, in the future, to how electronic communications can be better utilised.
A positive aspect of this proposal is that the directive is intended to pass into law within a rapid timetable.
The rapporteur has made good revisions to the proposal for a directive.
Our group supports the approval of the report and its rapid passage through the legislative process.
Mr President, once again, I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Vatanen on this very good report, and to thank the other speakers in the debate, and also welcome the fact that all the institutions have studied this proposal within a very short timescale, and that it will be possible to reach an agreement in due course on this subject as we did on the previous one.
This demonstrates the importance which we all now attach to short sea shipping.
For several years, the Community has been implementing a complete strategy aimed at making short sea shipping a viable and realistic alternative to purely road transport.
This strategy has, furthermore, been reinforced in the White Paper on European transport policy until 2010.
One of the elements of this strategy is to remove the obstacles preventing the development of short sea shipping.
Our recent exercise in recording these obstacles showed that the complexity of the administrative documentary procedures was considered to be one of the main bottlenecks.
Mr Vatanen was kind enough to say that the Commission was dealing with the paperwork, for once.
I give credit for this U-turn to him.
The Commission has therefore presented a proposal aimed at simplifying certain documentary procedures.
We have chosen to deal with the routine procedures which ships have to go through each time they enter or leave a port.
The procedures currently in force are not in themselves unreasonable, but the methods for conforming to them are so different from one Member State to another that they often lead to confusion amongst shipowners and operators.
Moreover, the International Maritime Organisation has produced a number of standardised forms in order to harmonise these procedures, and we therefore believed that standardisation was necessary, so that ships may know what information they need to present to the authorities and the way in which they must do so, whichever port they are visiting.
Given that there are already internationally recognised standardised forms, we have opted for the simple solution of using them.
This will probably lead to the worldwide application of the IMO forms.
This proposal, therefore, simplifies the necessary complex documentary procedures in the field of maritime transport.
It does not impose new obligations on shipowners.
Instead it allows them to carry out certain obligatory declarations in a harmonised and simplified fashion.
Since these declarations will be identical regardless of the flag or sector of activity, there is no reason to exclude any of them from the scope of our proposal, which therefore applies to both short sea shipping and ocean navigation, and which will not distinguish between flags.
Thank you, once again, to Mr Vatanen.
Thanks to the amendments which he has presented in his report, we believe we will be able to reach an agreement with the Council with a view to adopting this proposal at first reading.
This is good news and we are grateful for it.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Accession to the WTO
The next item is the joint debate on the following two reports:
(A5-0366/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organisation (COM (2001) 517 - C5-0487/2001 - 2001/0218(CNS));
(A5-0367/2001) by Per Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Community position within the Ministerial Conference set up by the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation on the accession of the Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (Chinese Taipei) to the World Trade Organisation (COM(2001) 518 - C5-0488/2001 - 2001/0216(CNS)).
Mr President, the accession of the People' s Republic of China to the WTO is, without doubt, one of the major ventures and experiments of our time.
The People' s Republic of China, which is still a country formally governed by a Communist party, is now to be a part of what might be called the stronghold of the free market economy, the WTO.
If the Commission is to be believed, that is a huge victory from the EU' s point of view.
It is said that this is a one-way market opening process.
It is thought that, for the EU, China' s accession to the WTO will signal an enormous gain in enforceable rights, with no significant change in the EU' s own commitments towards China.
It is really quite a one-way process that is described in the Commission' s proposal.
China must adapt.
The EU does not need to do very much.
Certain China-specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out.
However, these are of relatively little importance.
If the Commission' s description in Paragraph 13 is to be believed, accession to the WTO will be good for China' s economy.
I have a number of doubts on that score.
Clearly, the Commission has to look after the EU' s interests, but the issue is whether, in the era of globalisation, we might not have passed the point at which trade policy could be judged as if it were a football match, in which winning is everything and there is complete indifference to how things are for the other side.
I therefore think it is quite remarkable that, in its proposal, the Commission does not say so much as a word to hint that accession might nonetheless lead to problems for the other party, namely the People' s Republic of China.
I must briefly relate a number of facts to indicate that there may be certain problems for this large, but, nonetheless, still underdeveloped, country.
Criticisms are being made in China.
When, in connection with my official visit as chairman of the European Parliament' s China delegation, I recently visited China, I was able, on the fringes of this visit, to meet authors of books which are very highly critical of China' s accession to the WTO.
Both books are published by legal publishing houses and, obviously, in Chinese.
One of the books is known in English translation as Collision: Globalisation and China' s Reality Choice.
The author, who is an economist at Beijing Aeronautic University, maintains that China will lose to a system that is dominated by transnational companies.
His sympathies are with the lower social classes, he says, and he believes that Chinese companies will be swallowed by transnational giants.
This will hit those groups of people in China which have little in the way of wealth.
His main argument is that China is not ready for accession to the WTO.
The Chinese economy is not strong enough, and it will be the poorest classes that will have to pay a heavy price in the form of unemployment and social insecurity.
This book attracted a certain amount of attention in China when it was published last year.
A relevant article was published in the journal belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the book received many positive reviews.
The second book is known in English as China in the Shadow of Globalisation and constitutes a warning to the effect that accession to the WTO might cause China to split into five parts.
That is one of the things that the Chinese leaders fear most.
The fact that the chaos which might result from accession to the WTO could lead to the division of the country touches a sensitive point in China' s understanding of itself.
In spite of the fact that China is not a democracy and, to put it mildly, does not allow complete freedom of expression, and despite the fact that the Chinese government is in favour of accession to the WTO, a book of this type was nonetheless allowed to be published.
That means that there is uneasiness, considerable uneasiness, in Chinese society.
This uneasiness is, in all likelihood, about the possible consequences within the governing party, too.
You only have to log on to the Internet.
There are many web sites: China Online, South China Morning Post and such like. There is a lot of information about what different commentators, including those outside China, believe might happen because of accession to the WTO.
China Online reported, for example, in August of this year, that approximately 18 per cent of the total number of employees within the State sector are estimated to be surplus to requirements.
It is said that they will be still more surplus to requirements following accession to the WTO.
Unemployment in city areas is already estimated at over 15 per cent.
This report from China Online also maintains that unemployment will increase further in connection with accession to the WTO.
The prospects for new jobs are very limited because those who are made redundant are often older, unqualified workers.
According to China Online, an estimated 30% of the agricultural labour force is surplus to requirements, meaning that 120 million farmers will have to look for jobs in the cities.
Agriculture was one of the most important areas raised by China in the negotiations.
China received certain concessions.
Many commentators still believe, however, that accession will lead to enormous changes in the countryside and have enormous consequences when China is opened up to imports of food and agricultural products from, for example, the United States.
China has nine hundred million people employed within agriculture.
The Chinese government itself, which does not exactly exaggerate the difficulties, estimates that, because of cheaper grain imports, 9.7 million farmers will lose their jobs within seven years of Beijing joining the WTO.
I could go on at length quoting and referring to different sources indicating the difficulties for China, but I think these examples suffice.
The point of the quotations is that I, again, wanted to emphasise how odd I think it is that the Commission should be presenting the Council and Parliament with a document in which there is not a single word to suggest that accession to the WTO might lead to difficulties in the world' s most heavily populated country.
That is an odd information policy, in my opinion.
China' s accession to the WTO may, of course, lead to problems for ourselves, too, if stability in China is seriously undermined.
What conclusions do I draw, then?
I do not draw the conclusion that we must say 'no' .
Even if China is not a democracy in our sense of the word, I think it would be unreasonable for us to try to assume the responsibilities of the Chinese government and say that, what the Chinese government has judged to be correct might, in actual fact, be wrong.
Nonetheless, I believe that we should be aware of the fact that we are embarking upon an incredibly risky game.
It places great demands upon European companies to be responsible and not misuse the opportunities they are given when they now go into China with the freedom granted to them by the latter' s membership of the WTO.
In spite of this serious criticism and these serious misgivings, I naturally recommend that we vote in favour of China' s membership.
I only have a small amount of speaking time left to devote to Taiwan.
That was intentional, because Taiwan is in a quite different situation.
Taiwan is a developed modern democracy, a developed modern market economy and industrial state and the world' s tenth largest trading power.
I cannot see any real problems with Taiwan' s accession to the WTO.
We are concerned there, with an entirely different set of problems with which no comparison can be drawn.
Taiwan will be accorded a local collective agreement with China and become a member the day after China has become a member.
I have no comment other than that we naturally ought to vote in favour of Taiwan' s membership.
Mr President, our group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports the two proposals presented without question, both for the People' s Republic of China and for the customs territory of Taipei, and agrees with all the arguments and pertinent issues put forward by Mr Gahrton, who has a profound knowledge of this issue.
For this reason, we think it is of fundamental importance that the European Union should take an extremely responsible attitude when facing this momentous challenge for the world.
The People' s Republic of China' s accession to the World Trade Organisation will have repercussions in China itself, as we have already seen.
They have now had many years to prepare for and take control of the possible consequences.
There will also be significant repercussions for the European Union: I am aware, for example, of what could happen to us with regard to agriculture.
There will also be repercussions for the functioning of the World Trade Organisation, which is going to be completely restructured, although it must be said that this is already a matter of some urgency.
For this reason, although we are aware of the whole range of problems, dangers and possibilities that this accession brings, our group supports these two proposals without reservation.
Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for the work which he has carried out.
Of course we welcome China and Taiwan, because I think we should be pleased, as the previous speaker said, that China and Taiwan are joining.
A whole host of reforms is being initiated, as the Commission has rightly pointed out.
For the rest, China will take up a key position within the WTO and this will also bring about considerable changes for the West.
I am fairly certain that this will present the Commission with further challenges.
For the rest, we are supporting the accession of China with considerable funds and I think we should do more here.
For the first time, Parliament has been consulted.
This is a result of excellent collaboration with the Commission and, of course, with the Council.
But I have one thing to say to Mr Gahrton: it is true that accession to the WTO is not without its opponents in China.
But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without, at the same time, trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China's capabilities considerably.
I rather think that the doomsday scenario which you have conjured up in your report is highly exaggerated.
I would like to see you evaluate matters in a somewhat fairer and more balanced manner in the future.
Mr President, after fifteen years of negotiations, we are now in the final stage of China and Taiwan' s accession to the WTO.
The Commission submitted the accession conditions to you for your opinion.
I would like to thank the House, in particular, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the rapporteur, Mr Gahrton, for your willingness to treat this subject as a priority.
If you accept the recommendation of your rapporteur, the Union will be in a position to give the green light to China' s accession at the next Ministerial Conference of the WTO, which, as you know, will take place in Doha on 9-13 November.
The documents you have been issued with, will have informed you of all the technical elements of the negotiation.
I will not return to them today, but I would like to share with you some thoughts of a more political nature, at the same time giving my reaction to Mr Gahrton' s document and speech; they both warrant it.
I would, firstly, like to stress the special nature of negotiations for accession to the WTO and try to correct the impression - created by your report, Mr Gahrton - that it is something which we have handled in an excessively unilateral fashion.
An accession to the WTO is not negotiated within a traditional multilateral framework, where concessions are made on the basis of the principle of reciprocity.
On the contrary, in an accession negotiation, at least to the WTO (I say that prudently, since this seat was occupied by GÃŒnter Verheugen less than an hour ago), a country puts itself forward as a candidate to join a club whose members have already negotiated commitments amongst themselves.
The candidate country must therefore pay for entry into that club by offering commitments in terms of access to markets which reflect what the members have already accepted amongst themselves.
On several occasions your report points out, and with a degree of reproach which has not escaped me, the positive tone taken by the Commission to describe the results we have achieved after fifteen years of negotiations.
Even if, contrary to what the report says, the Commission' s report is not jubilant, I nevertheless believe that we can be satisfied with these results as a job well done.
Our task was primarily to defend the interests of the Union in these negotiations, and that is what we have done.
It is also the case, however, that this agreement is not some kind of unilateral victory for the Union, which is something, if I have understood correctly, that you rather reproach us for.
If there has been any victory, I am tempted to say that it is a multilateral one, since it is the multilateral system as a whole which has been strengthened as a result.
We cannot claim that the WTO has a global vocation if it excludes a country which represents more than 20% of the world' s population.
The issue was not, therefore, whether China should join the WTO, but rather when.
Well, after fifteen long years of negotiations, the different parties involved, China and its trading partners, have reached the conclusion that that time has arrived.
One of the Union' s main objectives was that these negotiations should lead to a strengthening of the multilateral system.
It was therefore necessary for China to accept what we could describe as the multilateral acquis, and I will not make any controversial parallel here either, in other words, the advances made within the framework of GATT and then the WTO over the last half a century.
We have ensured that the level of Chinese commitments offers this guarantee.
But this accession to the WTO is also a victory for China, since we believe it to be an essential condition if she is to continue her exceptional economic development.
Chinese external trade has increased by an average of 15% per year over the last twenty years.
It is, therefore, literally an explosion.
And accession to the WTO ensures China a stable framework for her commercial policy by guaranteeing the outlets which are crucial to her.
Her status as a member will also allow her to defend her commercial interests by participating fully in the round of negotiations.
At the end of the day it is clear that accession to the WTO is only one element, perhaps an essential one, but, nevertheless, only one element in the reform process launched by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 and continued by his successors.
More than an end in itself, accession is a consequence of these past reforms and a springboard for new reforms to come.
The justification for these reforms does not lie in accession to the WTO, and I feel that it would probably be presumptuous to try to distinguish between, what would result from accession itself, and, what is connected to the reform process taking place in China.
This close connection between the timetable for internal reforms and accession to the WTO has been recognised by China' s trading partners, the Union, in particular, by means of the acceptance of transitional periods for the implementation of certain obligations.
In fact, our objective was more the eventual result rather than the speed with which that result comes about.
Mr Gahrton, you referred to two works which stress the dangers which may arise in China as a result of accession to the WTO in terms of regional tensions or social problems.
I do not believe that these problems are being underestimated by the Chinese authorities, whose fundamental political objective seems to me, to be to guarantee the stability and integrity of their country.
From the conversations I have had with them, I understand that China sees accession to the WTO as an essential element in the continuation of these twenty years of reforms, and, therefore, a continuation of this growth which has allowed internal tensions to be kept under control, here or there.
China' s per capita GDP has multiplied by four over these twenty years.
This is therefore a classic, if specific, case of the relationship between commerce and development.
We all know, and I have often said to you, that commercial liberalisation is a good thing, as long as it is accompanied by the means to translate growth into sustainable development, that is to say, internal social and environmental policies, without which the beneficial effects of commercial liberalisation are not enjoyed.
From this point or view, we believe that China' s accession promotes that type of better internal policy.
I believe that this accession will strengthen the rule of law in China.
The fundamental principles of transparency, non-discrimination, efficient administration and independent judicial control, which are included in the acquis of the WTO, will contribute, we believe, to the positive evolution of China' s economic, legal and social systems.
In any event, for our part, we have been concerned, throughout the process of negotiations, to propose progressive measures which will prevent any particular section of the Chinese economy from being exposed to foreign competition overnight.
In conclusion, I would like to insist on the fact that the result of these negotiations is balanced.
It is true that we have defended European interests, and our document to Council and Parliament reflects that strategy.
No, we have not ignored the consequences for China and for the WTO.
Yes, accession will have a positive impact in terms of the quest for economic development in China, and therefore on the quest for internal reforms.
In any event, it is the Chinese themselves who have chosen to integrate themselves into the international economy, and so much the better.
At the same time we can only rejoice at the fact that, for the first time, Taiwan is becoming a full member of an international organisation, in a way which reflects its economic development and its status as an industrialised country.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will end by saying to the House that these two results are due to the wisdom of my predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who had made these two accessions one of the priorities of the Union' s commercial policy.
All I have done is finish the work which he had largely and judiciously started.
The debate is closed.
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10 a.m.
(The sitting was closed at 11.15 p.m.)
Address by His Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama
Your Holiness, it is with great honour and emotion, and in a spirit of universal fraternity, that the European Parliament welcomes you to this Chamber of European democracy and, for the first time, in a formal sitting.
Despite the gravity of the events taking place in Central Asia which have caused you to postpone your intended tour of Europe, you have been kind enough to go ahead with your visit to the European Parliament.
Our House is very appreciative of this mark of interest, your Holiness.
For the enormous majority of the 380 million Europeans of the Union, of all backgrounds, national, ethnic, religious or political, you embody peace and tolerance between nations and religions, as well as the wise ideals of Buddhism, of which you are the highest spiritual authority.
As a young man, 42 years ago, in 1959, faced with the invasion of Tibet, you had to make the heartbreaking decision to flee Lhasa, not in order to abandon your people, but because exile was your only remaining means of defending those people throughout the world.
Inspired by an unfailing philosophical conviction, you also made the very difficult choice not to respond to the invasion with violence and to reconcile, relentlessly and enthusiastically, your unconditional condemnation of the injustice done to Tibet with your appeal to the Chinese authorities for a sincere dialogue.
You draw the strength of your resistance from your spirituality, from a profound respect for mankind and for life, and from your faith in the unity of the world' s human community.
You have brilliantly demonstrated, like Mahatma Gandhi, like Nelson Mandela and like Andrei Sakharov, that the peaceful expression of a noble cause can bring understanding, respect and sometimes victory.
In 1989, the Nobel peace prize symbolised the international community' s recognition of you and your tireless non-violent action.
Thanks to you and your people, throughout the world, Tibet' s cause has never been buried by indifference.
It is perceived as a just cause, and the younger generations are no exception to this.
On 11 September, the world was horrified to see the new face of a monstrous form of terrorism.
Since we have seen how those events have led to the danger of misunderstanding between civilisations, the message which you are to address to the Europeans today is of universal and particularly topical importance.
I am convinced that this message, by means of our Parliament, will have a profound resonance throughout Europe and beyond.
I therefore invite you to take the floor, your Holiness.
(Loud applause)
It is a great honour to speak and share some of my thoughts and feelings with you.
As my prepared statement is in Tibetan, I want to read in Tibetan to show respect for my own unique, separate language.
So I will speak Tibetan.
(Loud applause) Recently, in Calcutta, at a function, at the beginning, as usual, I spoke in Tibetan and then in my broken English.
The next day a local newspaper reported very favourably on my remarks but said that the Dalai Lama spoke at the beginning in Chinese.
So I hope you will realise that this is not Chinese, but the Tibetan language.
(Laughter and applause)
(The speaker continued in Tibetan, what follows is a translation)Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.
It is a great honour for me to address the European Parliament.
I believe the European Union is an inspiring example for a cooperative and peaceful co-existence among different nations and peoples and deeply inspiring for people like myself who strongly believe in the need for better understanding, closer cooperation, and greater respect among the various nations of the world.
I thank you for this kind invitation.
I consider it as an encouraging gesture of genuine sympathy and concern for the tragic fate of the Tibetan people.
I speak to you today as a simple Buddhist monk, educated and trained in our ancient traditional way.
I am not an expert in political science.
However, my life-long study and practice of Buddhism and my responsibility and involvement in the non-violent freedom struggle of the Tibetan people have given me some experiences and thoughts that I would like to share with you.
It is evident that the human community has reached a critical juncture in its history.
Today' s world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity.
In the past, communities could afford to think of one another as fundamentally separate.
But today, as we learn from the recent tragic events in the United States, whatever happens in one region eventually affects many other areas.
The world is becoming increasingly interdependent.
Within the context of this new interdependence, self-interest clearly lies in considering the interest of others.
Without the cultivation and promotion of a sense of universal responsibility our very future is in danger.
I strongly believe that we must consciously develop a greater sense of universal responsibility.
We must learn to work not just for our own individual self, family or nation, but for the benefit of all mankind.
Universal responsibility is the best foundation both for our personal happiness and for world peace, the equitable use of our natural resources, and, through a concern for future generations, the proper care for the environment.
Many of the worldÂŽs problems and conflicts arise because we have lost sight of the basic humanity that binds us all together as a human family.
We tend to forget that despite the diversity of race, religion, culture, language, ideology and so forth, people are equal in their basic desire for peace and happiness: we all want happiness and do not want suffering.
We strive to fulfil these desires as best we can.
However, as much as we praise diversity in theory, unfortunately often we fail to respect it in practice.
In fact, our inability to embrace diversity becomes a major source of conflict among peoples.
A particularly sad fact of human history is that conflicts have arisen in the name of religion.
Even today, individuals are killed, their communities destroyed and societies destabilised as a result of misuse of religion and encouragement of bigotry and hatred.
According to my personal experience the best way to overcome obstructions to inter-religious harmony and to bring about understanding is through dialogue with members of other faith traditions.
This I see occurring in a number of different ways.
In my own case, for example, my meetings with the late Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk, in the late 60s, were deeply inspiring.
They helped me develop a profound admiration for the teachings of Christianity.
I also feel that meetings amongst different religious leaders and joining together to pray from a common platform are extremely powerful, as was the case in 1986 during the gathering at Assisi in Italy.
The recent United Nations Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders held last year was also a laudable step.
However, there is a need for more of these initiatives on a regular basis.
On my part, to show my respect for other religious traditions I went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem - a site holy to three of the world' s great religions.
I have paid visits to various Hindu, Islamic, Christian, Jain and Sikh shrines both in India and abroad.
During the past three decades I have met with many religious leaders of different traditions and have discussed harmony and inter-religious understanding.
When exchanges like these occur, followers of one tradition will find that, just as in the case of their own, the teachings of other faiths are a source of both spiritual inspiration and as well as ethical guidance to their followers.
It will also become clear that irrespective of doctrinal and other differences, all the major world religions help to transform individuals to become good human beings.
All emphasise love, compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, humility, self-discipline and so on. We must therefore embrace the concept of plurality in the field of religion, too.
In the context of our newly emerging global community all forms of violence, including war, are totally inappropriate means of settling disputes.
Violence and war have always been part of human history, and in ancient times there were winners and losers.
However, there would be no winners at all if another global conflict were to occur today.
We must, therefore, have the courage and vision to call for a world without nuclear weapons and national armies in the long run.
(Loud applause)Especially, in the light of the terrible attacks in the United States the international community must make a sincere attempt to use the horrible and shocking experience to develop a sense of global responsibility, where a culture of dialogue and non-violence is used in resolving differences.
Dialogue is the only sensible and intelligent way of resolving differences and clashes of interests, whether between individuals or nations.
The promotion of a culture of dialogue and non-violence for the future of mankind is a compelling task of the international community.
It is not enough for governments to endorse the principle of non-violence without any appropriate action to support and promote it.
If non-violence is to prevail, non-violent movements must be made effective and successful.
Some consider the 20th century a century of war and bloodshed.
I believe the challenge before us is to make the new century one of dialogue and non-violence.
Furthermore, in dealing with conflicts too often we lack proper judgment and courage.
We fail to pay adequate attention to situations of potential conflict when they are at an early stage of development.
Once all the circumstances have progressed to a state where emotions of the people or communities involved in disputes have become fully charged, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to prevent a dangerous situation from exploding.
We see this tragic situation repeated time and again.
So we must learn to detect early signs of conflict and have the courage to address the problem before it reaches its boiling point.
I remain convinced that most human conflicts can be solved through genuine dialogue conducted with a spirit of openness and reconciliation.
I have therefore consistently sought a resolution of the issue of Tibet through non-violence and dialogue.
Right from the beginning of the invasion of Tibet, I tried to work with the Chinese authorities to arrive at a mutually acceptable, peaceful co-existence.
Even when the so-called Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was forced upon us I tried to work with the Chinese authorities.
After all, by that agreement the Chinese government recognised the distinctiveness and the autonomy of Tibet and pledged not to impose their system on Tibet against our wishes.
However, in breach of this agreement, the Chinese authorities forced upon Tibetans their rigid and alien ideology and showed scant respect for the unique culture, religion and way of life of the Tibetan people.
In desperation the Tibetan people rose up against the Chinese.
In the end in 1959 I had to escape from Tibet so that I could continue to serve the people of Tibet.
During the past more than four decades since my escape, Tibet has been under the harsh control of the government of the PeopleÂŽs Republic of China.
The immense destruction and human suffering inflicted on the people of Tibet are today well known and I do not wish to dwell on these sad and painful events.
The late Panchen Lama' s 70,000-character petition to the Chinese government serves as a telling historical document on China' s draconian policies and actions in Tibet.
Tibet today continues to be an occupied country, oppressed by force and scarred by suffering.
Despite some development and economic progress, Tibet continues to face fundamental problems of survival.
Serious violations of human rights are widespread throughout Tibet and are often the result of policies of racial and cultural discrimination.
Yet they are only the symptoms and consequences of a deeper problem.
The Chinese authorities view Tibet' s distinct culture and religion as the source of threat of separation.
Hence as a result of deliberate policies an entire people with its unique culture and identity are facing the threat of extinction.
I have led the Tibetan freedom struggle on a path of non-violence and have consistently sought a mutually agreeable solution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a spirit of reconciliation and compromise with China.
With this spirit in 1988 here in Strasbourg at this Parliament I presented a formal proposal for negotiations, which we hoped would serve as a basis for resolving the issue of Tibet.
I had chosen consciously the European Parliament as a venue to present my thoughts for a framework for negotiations in order to underline the point that a genuine union can only come about voluntarily when there are satisfactory benefits to all the parties concerned.
The European Union is a clear and inspiring example of this.
On the other hand, even one country or community can break into two or more entities when there is a lack of trust and benefit, and when force is used as the principal means of rule.
My proposal which later became known as the 'Middle Way Approach' or the 'Strasbourg Proposal' envisages that Tibet enjoy genuine autonomy within the framework of the People' s Republic of China.
However, not the autonomy on paper imposed on us 50 years ago in the 17-Point Agreement, but a true self-governing, genuinely autonomous Tibet, with Tibetans fully responsible for their own domestic affairs, including the education of their children, religious matters, cultural affairs, the care of their delicate and precious environment, and the local economy.
Beijing would continue to be responsible for the conduct of foreign and defence affairs.
This solution would greatly enhance the international image of China and contribute to her stability and unity -- the two topmost priorities of Beijing -- while at the same time the Tibetans would be ensured of the basic rights and freedoms to preserve their own civilisation and to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau.
Since then our relation with the Chinese government has taken many twists and turns.
Unfortunately, I must sadly inform you that a lack of political will on the part of the Chinese leadership to address the issue of Tibet in a serious manner has failed to produce any progress.
My initiatives and overtures over the years to engage the Chinese leadership in a dialogue remain unreciprocated.
Last September, I communicated through the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi our wish to send a delegation to Beijing to deliver a detailed memorandum outlining my thinking on the issue of Tibet and to explain and discuss the points raised in the memorandum.
I conveyed that through face-to-face meetings we would succeed in clarifying misunderstandings and overcoming distrust.
I expressed the strong belief that once this is achieved then a mutually acceptable solution of the problem can be found without much difficulty.
But the Chinese government is refusing to accept my delegation till today.
It is obvious that Beijing' s attitude has hardened significantly compared to the eighties when six Tibetan delegations from exile were accepted.
Whatever explanations Beijing may give concerning communications between the Chinese government and myself I must state here clearly that the Chinese government is refusing to talk to the representatives I have designated for the task.
The failure of the Chinese leadership to respond positively to my Middle Way Approach reaffirms the Tibetan people' s suspicion that the Chinese government has no interest whatsoever in any kind of peaceful co-existence.
Many Tibetans believe that China is bent on complete forceful assimilation and absorption of Tibet into China.
They call for the independence of Tibet and criticise my 'Middle Way Approach' .
Others are advocating a referendum in Tibet.
They argue if conditions inside Tibet are as the Chinese authorities portray it to be and if the Tibetans are truly happy, then there should be no difficulty holding a plebiscite in Tibet.
I have also always maintained that ultimately the Tibetan people must be able to decide about the future of Tibet as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, stated in the Indian Parliament on December 7. 1950: "...the last voice in regard to Tibet should be the voice of the people of Tibet and nobody else."
While I firmly reject the use of violence as a means in our freedom struggle we certainly have the right to explore all other political options available to us.
I am a staunch believer in freedom and democracy and have therefore been encouraging the Tibetans in exile to follow the democratic process.
Today, the Tibetan refugees may be among the few communities in exile that have established all the three pillars of democracy: legislature, judiciary and executive.
This year we have taken another big stride in the process of democratisation by having the chairman of the Tibetan Cabinet elected by popular vote.
The elected chairman of the Cabinet and the elected parliament will shoulder the responsibility of running the Tibetan affairs as the legitimate representatives of the people.
However, I consider it my moral obligation to the six million Tibetans to continue taking up the Tibetan issue with the Chinese leadership and to act as the free spokesman of the Tibetan people until a solution is reached.
In the absence of any positive response from the Chinese government to my overtures over the years, I am left with no alternative but to appeal to the members of the international community.
It is clear now that only increased, concerted and consistent international efforts will persuade Beijing to change its policy on Tibet.
Although the immediate reactions from the Chinese side will be most probably negative, nevertheless, I strongly believe that expressions of international concern and support are essential for creating an environment conducive for the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan problem.
On my part, I remain committed to the process of dialogue.
It is my firm belief that dialogue and a willingness to look with honesty and clarity at the reality of Tibet can lead us to a mutually beneficial solution that will contribute to the stability and unity of the People' s Republic of China and secure the right for the Tibetan people to live in freedom, peace and dignity.
Brothers and sisters of the European Parliament, I consider myself as the free spokesman for my captive countrymen and women.
It is my duty to speak on their behalf.
I speak not with a feeling of anger or hatred towards those who are responsible for the immense suffering of our people and the destruction of our land, homes, temples, monasteries and culture.
They too are human beings who struggle to find happiness, and deserve our compassion.
I speak to inform you of the sad situation in my country today and of the aspirations of my people, because in our struggle for freedom, truth is the only weapon we possess.
Today, our people, our distinct rich cultural heritage and our national identity are facing the threat of extinction.
We need your support to survive as a people and as a culture.
When one looks at the situation inside Tibet it seems almost hopeless in the face of increasing repression, continuing environmental destruction, and the ongoing systematic undermining of the culture and identity of Tibet.
Yet I believe that no matter how big and powerful China may be she is still part of the world.
The global trend today is towards more openness, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.
Sooner or later China will have to follow the world trend and in the long run there is no way that China can escape from truth, justice and freedom.
The consistent and principled engagement of the European Parliament with China will accelerate this process of change that is already taken place in China.
Since the Tibetan issue is closely related with what is happening in China, I believe there is reason and ground for hope.
I would like to thank the European Parliament for the consistent display of concern and support for the non-violent Tibetan freedom struggle.
Your sympathy and support have always been a deep source of inspiration and encouragement to the Tibetan people both inside and outside Tibet.
The numerous resolutions of the European Parliament on the issue of Tibet helped greatly to highlight the plight of the Tibetan people and raise the awareness of the public and governments in Europe and around the world of the issue of Tibet.
I am especially encouraged by the European Parliament' s resolution calling for the appointment of an EU special representative for Tibet.
I strongly believe that the implementation of this resolution will enable the European Union not only to help promote a peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue through negotiations in a more consistent, effective and creative way but also provide support for other legitimate needs of the Tibetan people, including ways and means to preserve our distinct identity.
This initiative will also send a strong signal to Beijing that the European Union is serious in encouraging and promoting a solution of the Tibetan problem.
I have no doubt that your continued expressions of concern and support for Tibet will in the long run impact positively and help create the conducive political environment for a constructive dialogue on the issue of Tibet.
I ask for your continued support in this critical time in our country' s history.
I thank you for providing me the opportunity to share my thoughts with you.
(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)
Madam President, I should like to put a point of order before Parliament today, at a time when we are about to vote on the most important act we are called upon to approve, that is, the budget.
Nine people died yesterday in the St Gotthard tunnel because of a road accident.
This places a greater onus on us when - under the heading of 'infrastructure' - we come to vote on the much-needed and now ever more pressing engineering works which must be Europe' s response to the problem of traffic across the Alpine passes.
Today we shall be debating the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel, with all the economic and environmental problems that involves.
Let us also remind ourselves of this: the incident in the St Gotthard tunnel was caused to a great extent by the additional volumes traffic that the St Gotthard, Brenner and other Alpine passes have had to absorb as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel.
We must therefore vote with conviction for the infrastructure funding to speed up the procedure involved in rebuilding the Brenner rail tunnel and the FrÃ©jus rail tunnel, and move road vehicles onto trains, with benefits for the safety of those who travel and also for the surrounding environment.
Let us remember that when we vote.
Of course, Mr Santini.
VOTE
Madam President, I am against this oral amendment.
(With more than twelve Members standing, the oral amendment was not considered) Following the vote
Madam President, there has just been some enthusiastic applause because this vote has ended.
I can understand why, as this is always a protracted event.
However, I would like to ask you to put one other amendment to the vote.
I should have said this at the beginning, but we were already proceeding with the voting.
It is about the Court of Auditors.
We have now voted on an amount of 1 million in the line to build an extension for the Court of Auditors.
As the Committee on Budgets, we would like to ask for another EUR 6 million to be entered in the reserve so that additional capital can be injected during the coming year.
This will ultimately produce considerable savings for the taxpayer and will also create extra scope in future budgets.
I would also like to ask you to put this last amendment to the vote, which entails entering a further EUR 6 million in the reserve in budget line 206.
(Parliament gave its assent)
Report (A5-0330/2001) by Mr Costa Neves, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (C5-0300/2001 - 2000/2324(BUD)) and Letter of amendment No 1/2002 (12733/2001 - C5-0495/2001) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 (Section III - Commission)
Following the vote
Mrs Buitenweg, you have an oral amendment, I think, on Paragraph 39, following the vote on the budget.
Would you be so kind as to explain this to us once more, so that we can proceed to the vote?
I will do it in English.
It is about what I originally said about the conditions under which we will release the amounts or the items which we entered in the reserve in the last vote.
These are the conditions specified in Amendment No 73 of the Committee on Budgetary Control.
This is in accordance with what we discussed earlier, and this is the most straightforward way.
We must therefore amend the text in the way we have just voted.
It says:
"The money can be released after a favourable opinion from Parliaments' committee responsible for the relations with the Court of Auditors, once the Court has given updated information on its current staffing problems and on how additional staff would enable the Court to assess the performance of financial control systems in the candidate countries, improve its cooperation with the national audit institutions (requirement of Treaty of Nice) and establish more detailed specific DAS assessment."
(The President noted that there was no opposition to the oral amendment being considered)
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
Madam President, on Tuesday Mrs Morgan raised the issue of the letter that the Bureau sent to Mr Prodi on reform of the Commission, taking a very different stance from the position taken by the Commission.
We have just voted on the report by Mrs Buitenweg and have approved Amendment No 4 by Mr Elles, which reiterates Parliament's wholehearted support for the Commission reforms.
Will you now write to Mr Prodi and convey to him the reconfirmed, wholehearted support of this Parliament for radical reforms of the Commission's staff regulations?
Madam President, I think that we have all noticed from your tone of voice that you have shown a great deal of personal stoicism in presiding over this part-session despite your ill health.
I would like to say, on behalf of all the 'budgeteers' and in the name, I believe, of all my fellow Members, that we are very grateful to you for presiding over the votes on the budget in the first and second reading.
Madam President, I of course share the sentiments expressed by Mr Bourlanges.
However, we have to look into the question asked by Mr van Hulten, because, when it was raised by Mrs Morgan earlier on this week when Mr Provan was in the chair, he said he would examine whether it was possible to see what was going to happen.
Therefore, maybe you could respond to Mr van Hulten' s question and possibly discuss this matter with the Bureau, that will meet to clarify the situation.
Mr President, I am sorry Mrs Fontaine had to leave, so perhaps you would pass on my remarks to her.
As the House will know, I spent a great deal of time studying the reform process on behalf of the House last year and continued to follow it through the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.
I understand exactly the points that Mrs Fontaine made but, I ask you, on behalf of all Members of this House, to keep us better informed of the process.
This was the point that I raised back in September when I asked the presidency to give us the same level of information about the progress of the reforms as we are receiving from the Commission.
Mr Kinnock has given us a comprehensive timetable about the progress of the reform discussions.
This House, these Members, have no information whatsoever from the Bureau about the reform process.
I ask you to be much more transparent and to give us a progress report on these reforms.
Your request will be passed on, but you will understand that, given the votes that have yet to be taken and that will take up much time, I cannot extend this debate any longer.
Have courage.
Mrs Fontaine showed hers in remaining in the chair despite her state of ill health.
Mr Fatuzzo still has much work to do this morning, so we should all take heart.

Motion for a resolution (B5-0686/2001) on EU strategy at the Marrakesh conference on climate change
On Paragraph 9
Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues in the Socialist and the Christian Democratic Group I would like to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9. It should read as follows: "...welcomes the fact that the Commission came forward with the announced packet of the three climate change proposals".
The Commission came forward the day before yesterday with the three proposals, we have to correct that.
I also want to congratulate the Commission for doing this before the very important climate change conference in Marrakesh, COP 7.

On Amendment No 8
Mr President, by agreement with the rapporteur I would like to make an oral amendment.
I only have the English text with me now.
It should read: "Insists on the immediate abolition of the death penalty..." instead of "Reiterates its call for the immediate abolition of the death penalty..."
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On paragraph 10
Mr President, for the sake of compromise here, too, we would like to propose the following, which is submitted with the rapporteur' s cooperation and agreement. It should read: " Urges Turkey to propose in the coming year a precise timetable ...", in other words we would insert: "in the coming year".

Motion for a resolution (B5-0695/2001), by Mr Wurtz, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on the conclusions of the Ghent European Council of 19 October
Mr President, I want to make a point on the European Council in Ghent.
It is a suggestion from the ELDR Group, the Greens and the Socialists on paragraph 7, where we each have tabled an amendment, Amendments Nos 13, 9 and 5 respectively.
The suggestion is an oral amendment to merge all of them to add at the end of paragraph 7: "which adequately represents women, respects their human rights and ensures that Afghan women participate fully in building such a future".
The only problem, Mrs Ludford, is that we are at present dealing with a resolution by our Group.
We have not yet moved on to the joint motion for a resolution, so you are jumping ahead.
We must first ascertain whether or not there is a majority on the first resolution.
(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)
Joint motion for a resolution on the results of the informal meeting of the European Council held at Ghent on 19 October 2001.
Mr President, I would like to ask for an explanation as to whether, when the amendments are merged, the word "commitment" should be kept in the text as set out in the Socialist amendment.
In other words, it would be "a commitment" to do this.
I think the implication is that this is the case, that the word "commitment" should also appear in the merged text.
Mr President, one of the reasons that I was motivated to suggest this oral amendment which brings the three together is that in the English text, the Socialist amendment does not read very well.
When it says we should include a "compromise in favour of Afghan women", that, in English, could be read as suggesting that we compromise the interests of Afghan women.
It is not a happy wording in English.
It means a settlement.
"Compromise" is not a good translation of "compromis".
That was one of the reasons why I ventured to suggest that we try to merge the three and therefore, in English, we get rid of the word "compromise", which is ambiguous.
Mr President, I would just like to make a correction of a linguistic nature.
The translation into English of the Spanish word 'compromiso' is 'commitment' and not 'compromise' .

Report (A5-0331/2001) by Mr DÃ©sir, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on openness and democracy in international trade ((2001/2093(INI))
On Amendment No 6
Mr President, I would like to point out that we, the Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, tabled Amendment No 6 to recital A and that we want the words "supply constraints" in the fourth line of the English text to be replaced by the word "quotas" because that is the correct term.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On Amendment No 3
Mr President, I want to move an oral amendment, with the agreement of the rapporteur, to tidy up Amendment No 3 so that it now reads: "...calls for a commitment by the world leaders gathered at the WTO to coordinate measures to help developing countries tackle the impediments to growth...", etc.
Are any Members opposed to this oral amendment being considered?
Mr President, I accept this oral amendment proposed by Mr Deva.
If this oral amendment is adopted, my Group will support Amendment No 3.

On paragraph 7
Mr President, by agreement with the proposers I would like to ask that we keep "looks to the Member States" and add "and the Council" .
Is there any opposition to the addition of "and by the Council"?
There seems not to be.
We will therefore include this oral suggestion.
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment) On Amendment No 15
Mr President, I have been requested to put an oral amendment.
In the spirit of compromise and in order for this amendment to passed, I suggest that we add on the end of paragraph 37: "and to assist in the fight against terrorism".
(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)
(Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
General Budget for 2002
. (NL) During the vote on the 2002 draft budget, the delegation of the Dutch People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the ELDR group stated that it was against the increase in the category 2 payment appropriations.
The European Commission stated that these increases could not be absorbed by the corresponding budget lines, and furthermore that these increases would result in higher contributions for Member States.
The VVD delegation therefore does not regard this increase in payment appropriations as necessary.
Nevertheless, the delegation did vote in favour of the increase in the category 2 commitment appropriations because it is of the opinion that proper programming of the structural funds is needed.
We have generally voted against the Committee' s proposal to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1.
We think it unreasonable that approximately half the EU' s total annual budget should go on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products.
Today' s common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU, it also contributes to higher consumer prices.
The agricultural sector is, moreover, well protected from competition from foreign imports.
This has a very distorting and destabilising effect on the world economy.
The EU' s common agricultural policy constitutes, above all, a problem for the developing countries, for agriculture is an area in which the developing countries are competitive in relation to the industrialised world' s producers.
The EU' s common agricultural policy presents major obstacles for the developing countries, partly due to the fact that the agriculture concerned is subsidised and protected against competition in the form of imports.
The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly anomalous.
Subsidies for tobacco cultivation should be abolished as soon as possible.
The EU' s activity and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems which the Member States themselves cannot solve.
The common agricultural policy shows a lack of solidarity with the developing countries and must be reformed immediately.
Costa Neves Report (A5-0330/2001)
Mr President, the radical Members have a certain reputation for efficiency which my explanation of vote will go some way towards dispelling, as we made a mistake, a serious mistake, in the Budget vote, in respect of Amendment No 75 on the contribution to the funding of European political parties.
Whilst being signatories to this amendment, which was intended to abolish the Budget line in question - because we not only believe that the idea of funding of European political parties is not at present justified, but there is no legal basis for it - we voted against the amendment which we had ourselves proposed.
My explanation is therefore intended to correct, as far as possible, the result of the vote.
We have already asked for the record to be adjusted.
There is a mistake in our list of votes, which we are keen to put right.
Otherwise, we judge the Costa Neves report in a positive light, but we were keen to emphasise this minor technical error with regard to Amendment No 75.
Thank you very much, Mr President.
Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba.
The House had been wondering.
Now it is completely enlightened.
Mr President, should I give up making explanations of vote just because I have lost my voice?
With regard to the budget, I should like to say something about the section on the Commission.
I voted for it, but this will be the last time, because I want to get some light on how the Commission works.
On 1 January 2002 I shall set off on a long journey, like Odysseus when the Trojan War ended, through the maze of bureaucracy in the 13 523 offices of the Commission and its 33 728 staff.
It will be a long, hard and difficult journey: I shall meet Polyphemus, I shall meet Circe, the sorceress, and perhaps in the end I shall see Penelope looking like our President Prodi.
It will certainly be a shock, but I hope to be able to vote for it again next time.
. (FR) As is the case every year, the second October part-session is principally devoted to the adoption of the Community Budget.
This is the only area in which Parliament can influence Community policy, as it possesses the power of codecision with the Council and, above all, has the right of veto.
In a Europe where technocracy reigns and the democratic deficit prevails, it is, therefore, one of the few powers exercised by representatives elected by universal suffrage.
Just like last year' s budget, the 2002 budget is a reflection of the free-market.
As a Budget, it is characterised by austerity (0.3 % of European GDP), with an overall lack of financial resources, especially for employment policy, enlargement, and the management of crises, whether they be in food supplies, Afghanistan, Palestine or the Balkans.
The rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, rubber-stamps these tendencies as a whole by proposing an increase in payment appropriations - which is something of a positive step - but, at the same time, proposes the allocation to reserve of structural funds and somewhatobscure transfers from operations to administration - which is rather a backward move
For these reasons, we cannot support either the report or the 2002 draft Budget.
Buitenweg Report (A5-0329/2001)
Mr President, I voted for Mrs Buitenweg' s report on the budget, but I should like to stress very strongly and loudly here in Parliament, with so many members present on this occasion, that the Pensioners' Party - which I have the honour to represent in this House - believes that the European Parliament, which now legislates on fifty per cent of all national laws, which are adaptations to the directives that we approve here, should have greater funding and better organisation in order to function as befits a supranational Parliament, a Parliament with so many important duties.
- (FI) I, together with my group, supported the change over to a reimbursement system based on receipted costs with regard to reimbursement of travel expenses, secretarial costs and office costs.
My group interprets the wording used in the first amendment to mean that there is now no proper procedure at all.
At the same time, the amendment totally ignores the fact that the decision is now in the hands of the Council. Parliament has proposed the procedure intended by this amendment and is prepared to adopt it, but the Council has not been able to give the necessary approval.
On the basis of the above, my group feels that the amendment puts Parliament in a bad light, unduly and unfairly.
Budget debates are great moments for Parliament because they afford us an opportunity to make a comprehensive review of past and future policy.
Unfortunately time does not allow me to do so.
I would therefore like to confine myself to just one point, that is the situation in the border regions of the Member States adjoining the candidate countries.
It is beyond question that today' s border regions will benefit from European Union enlargement in the long term since there will be totally new opportunities for economic, cultural, social and administrative regional cooperation.
Nevertheless, in the short term there will be tremendous pressure as they adjust to specific problems arising out of the very different levels of development, especially in the social field.
I need only point out that the earnings gap between East and West is around 60%.
This raises questions that did not arise with earlier enlargements and which take on a new dimension.
The anticipated problems on the local labour and service markets will not be overcome without a great deal of effort.
Large numbers of daily commuters will put enormous pressure on an already tight labour market - in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania alone unemployment rates in excess of 20% are quite common.
Cheap services with wage costs around 60% lower will be a tremendous challenge for SMEs and craft trades.
Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission' s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge.
I therefore welcome the inclusion of a special budget line for border regions.
But I also call for additional Union funding to be made available as quickly as possible to reassure the border region citizens affected that their concerns and needs are not going unnoticed.
We need a basis in law, and the Commission must create it very quickly.
SeppÃ€nen Report (A5-0342/2001)
.
(FR) As is plain to see, we voted against the ECSC budget, which, as it will do until the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, continues to pump subsidies to shareholders in the steel industry.
Substantial sums have already been handed out to the bosses in this sector, allowing them to move over to lucrative new sectors, while many of the workers whose jobs have been abolished are still unemployed.
This report proposes the integration of social security assistance into the Budget of the European Union; but there is a need to guarantee, as a minimum, that all the workers affected by future job losses will receive the whole of their salary up to the age of retirement.
van Dam Report (A5-0326/2001)
Mr President, you know - as, I believe, everybody does - that in the early years of my working life I was a seaman.
I am therefore particularly concerned about safety and the safeguarding of human life at sea, and not only at sea but also when freight is being unloaded from ships in port.
This document is attempting to do something to improve safety for the lives of the seamen who work in ports.
Ports are very important for Italy - especially the port of Genoa, where I was born, and the port of Livorno, where I was a short time ago. All ports are important, like the port of Marseille and those on the other coasts of Europe, which is the union of countries that has the largest number of seafaring people.
We must continue to do everything possible to safeguard human lives at sea, as we are doing in this document.
Vatanen Report (A5-0327/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report by my friend Mr Vatanen, who will be disappointed at having been the rapporteur of a document that can do so little for transport; it does, however, do something for bureaucracy.
Well, I would like to tell him: we have not managed to get rid of bureaucracy - and not just in sea transport - but can we manage to get rid of bureaucracy at least in the payment of pensions and the granting of pensions?
Mr President, there are pensioners who die because of bureaucracy, without having drawn their pensions.
Of course, they go to Heaven; they know when they get there.
These pensioners deserve to go to Heaven, as all pensioners do, but it would be better if their pensions arrived while they were still alive!
Lamassoure Report (A5-0338/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report on aid to Turkey, but I want to say that the Pensioners' Party and I personally ask the European Union to be braver.
The 12 countries that have applied to join the European Union should all be admitted in 2004 without any further conditions, because this would be a courageous political act: they have been waiting for fifty years to feel really European.
Did the six countries that signed the Treaty of Rome, Mr President, have to include the Community acquis in their own statute books before signing?
There was no Community directive, but even so a great Europe was formed through an important political act.
I tell you: we can let in all 12 countries in 2004, whatever their legislative situation may be.
.
I have voted against the Report on Turkey.
Turkey has not yet taken the necessary measures to fully restore the political rights of the Kurdish people, suppress torture and abolish the special security courts and prisons that drive prisoners to go on hunger strikes which have claimed more than 70 victims already.
Turkey has not even fixed a precise timetable for fulfilling the political criteria of Copenhagen.
We are giving up human rights for geopolitical and military reasons.
That is not admissible in a democratic Parliament.
. (NL) Some politicians are keen to bring Turkey into the European Union before that country has radically changed.
They are therefore prepared to turn a blind eye to a number of extremely negative consequences.
Admitting a country like this, which is an exceptional case, will have a fundamental impact on the existing standards for democratic freedom and human rights in the EU.
The rapporteur wanted to create the impression that in Turkey it was a question of minor deficiencies which could be resolved quickly and easily.
Fortunately, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy has adopted a more critical stance, but still not critical enough by far.
In fact, the announced reforms are heading in the right direction, but do not yet go very far at all.
The release of prisoners and the abolition of the death penalty apply to criminal prisoners but not yet to political opponents, whose rights they refuse to recognise.
The mass murder of Armenians is still denied or justified as a normal way of suppressing opposition, which they want to continue to be able to use in the future.
The displaced populations from 3 500 destroyed Kurdish villages in the south-east are not being allowed to return to the area.
Fear of what is called "separatism" results in a language, songs and writings being punishable.
This country is still a long way from being en route to the EU.
.
(FR) The issue of Turkey brings us back with a jolt to the question of what kind of Europe we want.
If the question is framed in terms of membership of a monolithic bloc, the Turkish question will be extremely difficult to resolve.
It will suffice to consider the example of our shared external frontier.
On the hypothesis that Europe will develop steadily towards variable geometry, nothing, then, prevents the involvement of Turkey in certain European policies in fields where there is a real commonality of interests.
If, on the contrary, we hold fast to a rigid conception of the European Union, the only outcome, in the long term, will be the reversal of the decision made at Helsinki and the resumption of an association process with Turkey of the same kind as those we are developing with the other Mediterranean States which geography and history have placed outside Europe.
I am, by the way, astonished to learn, from the Turkish Ambassador, that the rapporteur, Mr Lamassoure, was opposed to the amendments referring to the Armenian genocide, whilst the political group to which he belongs played an active part in having this crime recognised as such by the French National Assembly.
Could this be a case of 'doublespeak' ?
Lamassoure Report (A5-0343/2001)
.
(FR) We voted against the Lamassoure Report "on Turkey's progress towards accession" as we cannot see how the rapporteur manages to reconcile Turkey's inclusion and his conception of a federal Europe with strong supranational powers.
The rule of law must in fact relate to the identity of a people, and the practice of democracy falls under this heading.
To date we have still not found a European people.
What chance then of a Turco-European people?
In fact, the Lamassoure report's sole merit is that it brings into the cold light of day the contradictions of present-day Europe.
If it proves necessary to establish firm cooperative links with Turkey, this cannot under any circumstances come about through a supranational power enacting regulations uniformly applicable to all, but must result from dialogue between one nation and another, within the European variable-geometry structure.
Moreover, the Lamassoure Report finesses with the recognition of the Armenian genocide of 1917, doubtless aiming to appease Turkey.
We believe there is a need to be more frank and to ask Turkey to acknowledge that the genocide took place.
Obviously it is difficult, but it would not be the first country to regret a dark episode in its history.
Turkey would then have to act consistently with the objective of true peace-making by re-establishing diplomatic relations with Armenia.
.
(FR) There are questions that will not go away; nor will the historic wounds that remain open in the Armenian community throughout the world.
In its resolution in June 1987, the European Parliament asked Turkey to have the courage to look at its past with open eyes in order to be able to look towards the future.
Democracy is guaranteed by historical truth, which cannot be bought or sold and cannot suffer at the hands of special interests, be they financial or economic.
What is at issue today is not recognition of the Armenian genocide's reality, as this House has already had occasion to declare that in 1987.
In asking that the Lamassoure Report should make reference to the genocide, I was not seeking to revive ancestral hatreds or to blow on the embers of intolerance, but to echo the legitimate concerns expressed in Armenian communities.
The children of Armenia who were exiled to our countries at the beginning of the century expect today an act of justice.
They want a 'moral resting-place' for their ancestors.
Remembrance is an even more pressing duty at this time when the last witnesses to the exile, the last to escape the carnage, are themselves quietly dying away.
I am convinced that joining the EU implies adherence to the fundamental principles in accordance with which it was created; democracy, respect for human rights and for the rights of minorities.
Such a step invites each one of the candidate countries to take up the burden of its past in order to be able to make its peace with its own history.
I regret that this House has not followed me in doing this.
.
(FR) I abstained on this motion for a resolution.
I regret that the European Parliament has not felt able to show consistency in rejecting the amendments asking Turkey to continue dialogue on acknowledgement of the Armenian genocide.
In fact, last year, Parliament openly committed itself to calling upon the Turkish government to recognise this period of its history.
Today, under a cloak of expediency, this House has demonstrated its hypocrisy.
As regards Turkey's possible accession to the European Union, I would remind you that the real question of the frontiers of Europe is still an open one.
At a distance from the peoples involved, we carry on discussing the hypothetical accession of this country to the EU without putting the real question, which is to do with the identity and outline of Europe.
The Commission and Parliament would be better advised to explore ways by which Turkey can be associated with the EU rather than directly integrated into it.
), in writing.
(FR) This report on progress towards accession to the European Union is being presented in a very specific context.
Firstly, Turkey is weighed down by the burden of its foreign debt (over EUR 120 billion) and in consequence has to set aside almost 70% of its budget to service it.
The spiralling debt results in a programme of austerity and structural reform which has brought in its wake massive unemployment and broad cuts in social security expenditure.
As well as economic difficulties, there is a worsening political situation, especially for prisoners of conscience, a persistent denial of the rights of the Kurds, failure to acknowledge the Armenian genocide, and in more general terms a lack of regard for the democratic rights of Turkey' s population.
Despite the fact that the report takes account of the social repercussions of the prolonged economic and financial crisis, pleads in favour of rapid payment of EU financial aid to accompany reforms especially in the social sphere, especially as regards the establishment of the rule of law and the promotion of civil society and even though it considers the - admittedly increased - amount of aid granted to Turkey not yet to reflect the importance attached to Turkey's trade relations with the EU; and insists on the need for Turkey to equip itself with modern legislation on the right to strike and on collective negotiation, it is not for European governments or for the Turkish Government to determine the conditions for membership.
It is for the people of Turkey to decide and they must be consulted by means of a referendum.
It is for these reasons that we did not vote in favour of this report.
Gahrton Report (A5-0366/2001)
.
(NL) Given the characteristics of the World Trade Organisation, I wonder how a large and poor country hopes to benefit from it.
I would advise China to stay out of it and to rather rely on self-support than participation in world trade.
But I also agree that China' s accession should not be refused if she asks for it herself.
The People's Republic of China was internationally isolated for many years and was not recognised by most countries.
Since it was ultimately recognised, the territory on the island of Taiwan that is controlled by the successors to the government driven out in 1949 is regarded as a non-recognised state, which is something we should now try to find a solution for.
On the one hand, there are economic and military ties, and on the other, some people act as if she does not exist.
It is just as contrived to automatically allocate Taiwan to China as it was to allocate China's territory to Taiwan in the past.
The two territories have grown far apart over the past 50 years or more, and there have always been ethnic differences anyway.
I reluctantly endorse the proposed structures, but they will not solve the real problems.
Ghent European Council (RC B5-0696/2001)
.
(EL) The leaders of the European Union found yet another opportunity at the interim summit in Ghent to side with American imperialism and support their audacious plans in central Asia, which involve bombing and murdering the Afghans.
They clearly stated that they intend to prepare a regime (obviously which meets with their approval) to succeed the Taliban and are willing to help "reconstruct" Afghanistan, thereby revealing their ulterior motive of ensuring that they are involved in sharing out the booty when the time comes.
In addition, they are planning close collaboration with the USA on a whole series of issues, including judicial assistance.
As regards the "enemy within", the summit is planning to speed up anti-democratic legislative arrangements on a common definition of terrorism and a common European arrest warrant at a speed which is revelatory of their intentions.
As for the Middle East, the summit confines itself to a few general pronouncements on a Palestine state and talks of stopping the violence, without making any reference to Israeli aggression.

This is a summit which, just like previous summits, is brimming with anti-grass roots measures and aggressive action against the people; a summit which should give the people of the Member States and of the entire world cause for concern and every reason to step up their fight; a summit which confirms the imperialist nature of the European Union yet again and should be a lesson to all those who proclaim that the ÃU can act as a counterweight to American aggression.
The joint motion contains nothing more than sickening praise for the summit's decisions and shows absolutely no sign of sensitivity to the consequences which these decision will have both within the EU and in the world as a whole, which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it.
.
(FR) The European Council in Ghent has just taken note of a Commission report on the preparation for the changeover to euro notes and coins, which presents forty "good practices" suggested to banks, governments and retailers in Member States "in order to make up for lost time".
This parenthetical remark by the Commission must surely pull us up short.
Why has time been wasted, although the date for the changeover of notes and coins has been set for a long time, and governments had all the time in the world to prepare themselves?
The most probable explanation is this: the authorities seem to have thought that private citizens, being in any case caught in the trap, would be obliged to adapt themselves.
Under these circumstances, why should they tire themselves out?
This attitude says much about the thinking behind an operation which was deceitfully presented as being entirely centred on the improved comfort of citizens.
In addition, when you look down the list of the "forty good practices ", you notice that they are minor low-level gimmicks - ranging from the early labelling of prices in euros to longer opening hours at bank counters - whose effect can only be marginal.
But major actions that could conceivably lessen citizens' difficulties, whether financial (reimbursing tradesmen and small businesses for their efforts at adaptation) or technical (stating both the euro value and the value in the national currency on notes and coins), have been firmly excluded.
It is true that dual-denomination notes or coins would have required thought at an earlier stage and for that there would have had to be a real concern to lighten the burden on private individuals.
Nothing, though, could be more foreign to the inventors of the single currency.
Perhaps - as, after all, clouds do have silver linings - citizens will see at the beginning of next year that in fact they had counted for little in the introduction of the single currency.
And then they might learn a few truths about the true nature of Brussels.
Although we welcome some aspects of the resolution that has been adopted today by the European Parliament, we must express our reservations and criticism of some very negative aspects, specifically its support for the war strategy that the USA is implementing in Afghanistan, which will not only fail to resolve any problems but will actually worsen the humanitarian crisis and incidences of racism and xenophobia.
We are also critical of the relentless political pressure to speed up the militarisation of the EU and the communitisation of aspects of 'justice and home affairs' , through the 'creation of a genuine European judicial area.'
What is particularly worrying is the fact that proposals have been tabled for creating a 'European search and arrest warrant' or the controversial and dangerous common definition of terrorist acts as well as measures that represent a serious attack on fundamental freedoms, guarantees and rights linked to the coordination and effectiveness of law enforcement in the framework of cooperation with the USA.
Nor can we fail to mention the symptomatic absence from the resolution of any critical reference to the Ghent Council decisions on confirming compliance with the 'Growth and Stability' pact, with maintaining the policy of wage moderation, or the reform of the labour markets, the processes of liberalising public services - of which the recent decision on postal services is one example - the reform of public services in social provision or the Council' s announcement of the launch of a new round of negotiations at the WTO.
These measures will have a serious effect on the interests of workers and of the communities in the various countries of the EU.
With regard to the creation of a 'preparatory convention' for the new IGC, we feel its prime objective is an attempt to limit or impose conditions on the sovereign decisions of governments and national parliaments.
This is why we have voted against this motion for a resolution.
.
(FR) Like its predecessors, the informal summit in Ghent showed the disagreements that exist between the various Heads of State, which have been the subject of a great deal of comment in the media.
Over and above this apparent discord, though, there has been unanimity on one essential point: the EU is well and truly at war and it is going to back up its commitment to join in combat.
Its repressive arsenal is moving ahead by leaps and bounds:
The Rapid Strike Force will become reality;
A European Judicial Area will allow the creation of one public prosecution authority and harmonise punishments;
The prerogatives of Europol are going to be strengthened.
Without doubt, the most immediate threat to citizens' liberties is the introduction of a European arrest warrant, which, by creating an exceptional law for all the supposed terrorists, will make greater repression possible across the whole of the EU.
The definition of a terrorist has been made broader, and will be able to be applied to all who resist an unjust and intolerable order.
There was clearly no space at this summit for a social Europe; on the contrary, the summit demanded pay restraint and far-reaching reform of the labour market.
In Ghent, social Europe was on the streets - in the demonstrations organised by the young and by the workers.
Therefore, out of support for these events, we will be voting against this resolution on the results of the Ghent Summit.
. (IT) The fundamentalist terrorist attacks have not only destroyed the 'twin towers' in New York but also seem to have played a major part in demystifying two other 'pillars' on the eastern shores of the Atlantic: the common defence policy and the European foreign policy.
The devastating success of this latest attack was helped by the theatrical contribution of certain European governments. Throwing aside years upon years of declarations of intention to define a European foreign policy and good proposals for military integration, they have raised their banners as 'national powers' without even having either any real power by themselves to address the world crisis or the credibility to ensure European security.
The three-sided mini-summit, held an hour before the informal Summit of the Fifteen, was a demonstration of the collapse that has also hit Europe.
The statements on fighting terrorism handed out for signing at the end of the informal Summit are worthless.
We have be accustomed to reading wonderful final declarations for decades now, but these contradict the facts and create genuine bafflement about this 'non-existent Europe' , which unites around statements and then vanishes immediately when it comes to operating and acting in unity to address the crises that threaten world peace.
Given these conditions, I believe the promotion of the European Union as a political entity is the principal task we need to address.
The Ghent 'triumvirate' , which did not even invite the High Representative for European foreign policy, did not have this objective, concerned as they were - and are - with fighting for their leadership or the next elections.
One of them spoke of 'a new leading role in foreign and defence policy for Germany' , forgetting to add - as has been the case for 56 years now, as an attentive leader writer pointed out - 'within Europe' .
Just an oversight as regards 'precedents' , or clear national political will?
This 'triumvirate' would not deserve any critical mention if there were not another triumvirate looming up on the horizon, a really heavyweight one this time, formed by the USA, Russia and the People's Republic of China.
The Ghent triumvirate - 'an affront to Italy and Europe,' as Mr Prodi has said - with a Europe deprived of strength, will be a featherweight in the international ring and, what is more, will weaken the little bit of Europe that exists.
In its place there should, instead, be a new, strong Europe, proud to be so, and seen as essential in maintaining regional balances of power.
The forthcoming European Council in Laeken must cancel out the ambiguities and contradictions found in Ghent.
To achieve this goal, it must issue itself a momentous challenge: to turn words into deeds and initiate 'enhanced cooperation' in the sphere of a political Europe.
This will also benefit economic and financial stability, because it would also correct the anomaly of a European central bank without a European government behind it.
With the current situation in tatters, however, is such a challenge feasible?
I cannot help thinking that the road of integration will lead to greater cohesion of the parties involved.
15 countries acting more cohesively in the area of security and defence - and therefore with a definite foreign policy - will, without doubt, be a much more effective force in the fight against international terrorism and in peacekeeping.
Having said that, and expressing a reservation about the 'convention' method for drawing up the institutional reform project, I vote for the resolution, in the hope that declarations will, at last, be followed up with deeds.
Twenty million Afghans are being hit hard by bombings being carried out for reasons over which they have had no influence.
The UN Commissioner for Human Rights has appealed for a necessary suspension of the bombing in order to get food out to the population before the winter.
Three years of drought have made the supply situation untenable.
I have therefore supported Amendments 2 and 3 in the vote on the resolution concerning the European Council' s informal meeting in Ghent.
A further prerequisite, however, is that the Taliban should allow supplies to reach those who need them.
We also appeal to Pakistan to allow the refugees to be afforded protection.
Poos Report (A5-0308/2001)
Mr President, I voted for the report but, both personally and on behalf of the Pensioners' Party and as a convinced Europeanist, I ask that the Council should have less powers and Parliament have more powers.
We know that the Council is elected by those elected by the citizens, but the European Parliament is elected directly by the citizens.
We are Europe!
Parliament should have the power to legislate, and the Council can have some little legislative duty that affects all the Member States, like defence and foreign policy, but not too much.
I therefore insist that everything possible should be done to give the European Parliament all the power it deserves, as against the Council, whose powers should instead be reduced, since it does not deserve them.
We note that you want to pension the Council off, which is fairly normal in view of your political career.
The reason why 'the role of High Representative for the CFSP and that of the Commissioner responsible for external relations should be merged and assigned to a Commission Vice-President' is that it will be difficult in the long term to maintain the double channels of command that apply to policy in the second pillar.
It is problematic - from the points of view both of clarity and of the budget - for the EU to maintain two external relations administrations for the purpose of implementing foreign policy.
That does not however mean that we in any way support supranationalism within the areas of the second pillar.
We do not therefore want the CFSP to be incorporated into the first, or Community, pillar.
The above position also applies to the relevant passage in paragraph 3 of the report on the progress made in implementing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (A5-332/2001 Rapporteur: Mr Brok).
.
(FR) The Poos Report sets out some interesting technical reforms to enable Councils to work better "in a permanent legislative framework" without amending the Treaties.
It is, though, surprising that we do not find there the most obvious reform to make the work of the General Affairs Council easier and reduce the overload on it which is the main problem today: its division into a General Coordination Council (dealing with the general organisation of work, and issues concerning the EU institutions) and a Foreign Affairs Council, which would obviously be of a purely inter-Governmental nature.
This simple and practical reform is not endorsed by the federalists, fearing as they do that it would draw the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy from the new Foreign Affairs Council, whereas they want to bring him into the bosom of the Community by installing him at the Commission, thereby giving it powers in terms of foreign policy.
Their proposal is not realistic.
More broadly speaking, the Poos Report does not seek to anticipate what the Europe of tomorrow will be like and to work out from that how the Council should evolve.
It will be a Europe with many and diverse Member States, so it will have to be a variable-geometry Europe.
For the same reason, it will be a Europe in which the Community method will often be seen as too rigid, and in which there will be a lot of room for the intergovernmental approach, hence a Europe in which the distinction between the "pillars" of the Treaty will have long-term validity.
It will, finally, be a Europe in which the present-day appropriation of power by Brussels will have come to an end - at least let us hope so - and in which national democracies will again make their voices heard.
These broad strokes lead us to design a future central position for the Council, one which should give it a greater initiatory role (although the task of drafting legislation will have to be better shared) and one of coordinating the pillars, the various circles, the national and European levels.
It would now be useful to begin discussing these ideas.
.
(FR) The fact that we have voted against Council reform does not imply that we prefer the way it works at present.
It is not the constitutional form of the Council that is important - although much could be said about its anti-democratic character - but its essence.
The basic reason for the Council's existence is to manage the collective affairs of the property-owning classes in the various European countries, so that their respective interests do not conflict and that a general consensus may be established.
The European Council, though, no more represents the interests of the majority of the EU's population than the various governments represent the real interests of their own peoples.
The apparently democratic way in which national governments are appointed after elections does not prevent them being at the service of their countries' big bosses.
All the more is this true of Europe's executive, which is not even obliged to seek election.
We do not guarantee the present or the eventually reformed functioning of the European institutions.
.
(PT) The Poos report on the reform of the Council is controversial and contradictory and, albeit rather timidly, further clears the way for European federalism.
On the one hand, it contains positive aspects on improving transparency, not to mention the concept of change in the institutions in an enlarged European Union, in its references to the workings of the Council and to greater participation by national and regional parliaments in EU policy.
On the other hand, it puts forward some highly controversial ideas, specifically transferring the responsibilities of the High Representative of the CFSP to the Commission, thereby reducing the powers of the Council and further communitising this important policy, which we must, of course, oppose.
At the same time, it puts forward working methods for the Council that could have a damaging effect on the role of national governments, moving towards greater federalism, which include: strengthening the General Affairs Council, so that its meetings are held regularly, weekly even, attended by ministers; and a distinction being made between the legislative and executive Council, which must operate openly, which would seem to be moving towards the creation of some kind of European Union Senate.
Therefore, in voting against this motion, we confirm our opposition to this path to federalism without undermining the report' s positive aspects.
. (FR) Council reform?
Public opinion throughout Europe plainly sees evidence that this is needed, as also evidence of the democratic deficit in European structures.
The absolute requirements of this reform should be the reinforcement of democracy and transparency, the involvement of citizens and control by them.
One should also beware of explaining, as the rapporteur does, that all the dysfunctions result from disregard of the Treaties or even from the loss of power by the Commission and the "General Affairs" Council.
Over and above structural improvements such as the strengthening of Parliament's role, control and monitoring of the Commission and the Council, greater power being given to citizens, whether directly or indirectly - by way of associations, trades unions, etc - there is the need today to discuss the direction of this European project which is dominated by free-market thinking, the very antithesis of democracy and of provision for social needs.
New institutions for another Europe - that is what should be the topic put forward for the peoples of Europe to discuss and vote on.
It is for this reason that we have not voted in favour of the Poos Report.
.
I was delighted to cast my vote in favour of the excellent report by Mr Poos.
As a representative of Scotland and a member of the European Free Alliance section of my Group, I particularly welcome paragraph 13 of the report, calling for the involvement of "national parliaments and, in federal or highly regionalised States, the regional authorities including participation in the Council itself according to Article 203 of the EC Treaty."
For Scotland and similar countries this will only be a start, but it will be an important one.
This Parliament is concerned about the democratic deficit.
To remedy this, let us seek to secure a greater role for devolved parliaments in making European law.
If parliamentarians at all levels in Europe are to be engaged effectively, there must be open and public legislative debate in the Council.
We must highlight the need for publicity and openness in the Council, as stipulated in paragraph 26 of the report.
The reforms urged in this report all go in the right direction.
.
(NL) As former Luxembourg minister, Mr Poos knows how the Council works, and he has put this to good use.
He is right to raise the matter of meeting behind closed doors, which is inconsistent with the principles of democracy and openness.
He also proposes that joint committees only prepare resolutions instead of taking them themselves.
He also wants the strange new post of High Representative for the common foreign and security policy, which is developing into a European super-minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, but which cannot be called to account politically in this area, to be integrated into the European Commission's portfolio for external relations.
Mr Poos limits himself to what is feasible within the existing treaties and the current power relations, because this would be able to be achieved quickly.
I support him in this.
However, even if these reforms are implemented, the Council remains an absurdity, a remnant from the early days of the three European Communities, which is backing out of national parliaments and the EP.
National ministers used to act as negotiators on the formation of an interest grouping and were also entitled to exercise their veto rights.
They no longer have this in their current function, in which they act as a senate which cannot be called to account and a government at the same time.
The national parliaments must take over their task.
The continued existence of the Council will have an adverse effect on parliamentary democracy.
World Trade Organisation (RC B5-0691/2001)
.
(FR) We have voted against the joint resolution submitted by the European People's Party and Socialist Groups on the forthcoming ministerial conference of the WTO in Qatar in November, as it seems to us that it is yet again trapping us by agreeing to the opening of new international trade negotiations without adequate clarification of what the ground rules are and what objectives are in view.
Commissioner Lamy's speech yesterday leads us to conclude that, even though he is striving to present a wide range of objectives for future negotiations (liberalisation, regulation, the involvement of developing countries, the taking into account of sustainable development), liberalisation is still indeed the primary objective.
Moreover, the WTO's reference documents, which are centred on too strictly commercial a view of trade, inherently tend towards the adoption of this objective.
Matters would be made worse still if the negotiating mandate included investment among the WTO's competencies, as this would risk the revival of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), of infamous memory.
We would, though, not wish to suggest that liberalisation is in itself bad, as a party of the Left thinks.
We do think, though, that there is now the need for a pause.
Time must be found to draw up a clear balance sheet on the Uruguay Round.
On that basis, negotiations must indeed be opened, but with this primary mandate: to consider how to guarantee to every society, to every national democracy, the right to choose how to live.
Liberalisation will produce all its benefits only if we have first provided a definite answer to this question.
.
(EL) The demonstrations in Seattle, Prague and Genoa were an expression of the increasing anxiety at grass-roots level about the consequences of globalisation.
This massive popular reaction shows that even the regulations of the WTO are socially unacceptable.
The demonstrations, which were attended by demonstrators from around the world, were one of the deciding factors in bringing down the talks.
The WTO, the main objective of which is to fully liberalise trade, is basically promoting a process of neo-colonialism and is now one of the mainstays of the new world order.
The rules of the WTO serve to promote the interests of dominant multinational companies which already monopolise certain international markets and are therefore the stuff of nightmares for developing countries and workers as they watch their rights being eroded.
The large countries are promoting the interests of their multinationals, at the expense of the less developed countries, without so much as a word about the long-standing request of these countries to have their debts cancelled.
In the agricultural sector, rapid restructuring is being called for in order to concentrate the land in a few hands and forge another link in the chain controlled by the network of multinationals.
Furthermore, the liberalisation of trade and the abolition of duty and subsidies have hit agricultural production directly, reducing farmers' incomes, decimating farming and increasing unemployment.
Agricultural production in Greece - and elsewhere - is being sacrificed in order to protect and corner a larger share of the international market for processed products from central and northern Europe.
We believe that, rather than defending the interests of the people, the EU will again endeavour at the new round of talks to stake a bigger claim for the European monopolies, in competition with the other imperialist centres, i.e. the USA and Japan.
The rules which govern international economic relations and trade should serve the interests of the workers, leave their fundamental social rights untouched, help to develop less developed countries, respect the environment and respect the rights of all nations to exercise control and decide on their future themselves.
The WTO is, by its very nature, an imperialist structure interested in the maximum possible return on capital and more secure, flexible and unimpeded ways of moving capital, especially from trade and the stock exchange, impoverishing huge swathes of the world's population and contaminating and destroying more and more of the natural environment in the process.
Under this new world order, which uses every possible means to impose the law of the jungle and where might is right, people are beginning to understand that the only solution is resistance and counterattack.
The movement against globalisation and the WTO may be uncoordinated and disparate, but it is the first counterattack on the dictatorship of the monopolies and economies of interest.
It is sending out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers, unemployed, small and medium-sized farmers and other victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO is trying to impose.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the motion because most of it sides with the major corporations planning to bring about unbridled liberalisation, plunder even more poor countries, wipe out farming and attack the achievements of the workers and the rights of the people throughout the world.
.
(FR) I regret that Commissioner Lamy was not more explicit yesterday about the discrepancies between the Council's negotiation mandate and the draft declaration by the Ministers at the Doha conference.
I thought I heard - the Commissioner was speaking sotto voce - that they particularly related to the new reduction in external protection and internal support for our agriculture which certain States had demanded.
I also regret that the joint resolution that Parliament has just voted on commits the sin of incoherence by remaining silent on Community preference, whilst rightly emphasising the right of WTO members to apply agricultural policies adapted to their needs and conditions and especially the right of EU Member States to defend a European model of agriculture founded on family holdings, safe and high-quality food, protection of the environment and a balance between town and country.
Food safety constitutes a strategic dimension, on which the tragic events of 11 September throw a new light.
It is not feasible that the European Union should depend long-term on imports - some 75% of its requirements - of a family of products as important, vital and strategic as oilseed proteins.
How can the European Union condemn itself to zero growth in a crucial sector in which production worldwide is increasing by 5% per annum?
What would happen in the event of weather hazards in the Americas?
It is therefore imperative that the fatal error of Blair House, the absurd and severe self-limitation agreed to in Marrakech be put right in the next round of negotiations.
The complete elimination of animal fats makes it all the more necessary to be able to support the development of Community-wide production of vegetable proteins: this objective must be a priority for the European negotiator.
We will be extremely watchful on this issue.
DÃ©sir Report (A5-0331/2001)
I have, of course, voted for this report, Mr President, on democracy in international trade, but I should like to do more.
As the representative of the pensioners that I have had the chance to meet over these two and a half years, I should also like to launch a new slogan here today: 'Pensioners of the world, unite!'
Pensioners are citizens who have more money than young people and would be able to influence the trade and economy of the whole world.
I therefore appeal to all pensioners and all elderly people throughout the world to unite in an organisation that can make its weight felt - a weight they are entitled to have because of their numbers - so they can influence international trade to make it more humane and friendlier to those in need, as we all hope.
.
(FR) We voted in favour of the report on "Openness and democracy in international trade" in order to assert our demand for a reform of the World Trade Organisation towards greater transparency and fairness (especially in regard to the settlement of differences) and also the strengthening of control by the peoples.
A double ambiguity, though, exists in this regard, both at European level and at the level of the WTO.
As regards the European Union, successive reforms of the Treaties have practically excluded the national parliaments from control and ratification of the common trade policy.
The Nice Treaty, which is currently in the process of being approved, effectively completes the work while excluding them from negotiations touching on services and intellectual property.
Neither de jure nor de facto does the European Parliament take over, and in any case, even if it did gain a real right of ratification, the end result would still be the overall enfeeblement of democratic control, because of the abolition of any direct power on the part of national democracies, which are closest to the peoples.
From this point of view, the European Parliament's proposal that a consultative parliamentary assembly should be created within the WTO looks like the beginning of work on another level of dispossession.
Such an assembly would in fact risk giving greater legitimacy to the disregard of the opinions of national democracies, and the putting in place thereby of "regulations" the effect of which would be to confine them even more.
There is then a need to assert most clearly that the objective of the consultative assembly is to improve information, but not under any circumstances to replace the national parliaments in any way.
For us, in fact, the first of these "regulations" to retain, is that each and every people, expressing itself directly or through its national parliament, has the right to choose what kind of society it wants to be and what laws shall apply within it.
.
(FR) The rapporteur cannot be naÃ¯ve enough to think that the terrible inequalities in world trade are due to the fact that most member countries of the WTO "are marginalised because of non-inclusive working methods or because they are not, or not effectively, represented in Geneva" or even due "to practices inherited from the GATT" .
Economic relations between countries, and trade relations in particular, obey only one law - the law of the strongest - and certainly do not involve the type of "democracy" that the rapporteur would like to see.
The imperialist countries impose their law on third world countries and the United States impose their own, even on second-ranking imperialist powers.
Clearly, giving the poorest countries a few extra posts within the WTO or in any other international body is not going to change the balance of power.
The report' s real motives are to be found in the fact that international trade, whose laws resemble the law of the jungle, is giving rise to protest and demonstrations.
Although it does not have the power to change the substance of the matter, the European Parliament is invited to put a democratic spin on a type of relationship that is poles apart from a relationship of equality and democracy.
We have not, of course, given our support to this playacting and have voted against the report.
. (NL) The existence of a World Trade Organisation could perhaps be useful if it were limited to helping individual states to set up trade contacts with other, remote states.
Unfortunately, the pretensions of the current WTO go much further than that.
It is trying to impose standards on Member States in which the protection of jobs, the environment and public services is subordinated to freedom of trade and the protection of big multinational companies.
The WTO has become a kind of alternative United Nations, but one in which it is not the power of the number of inhabitants but the power of money that counts.
As a result of the imposed globalisation, the gulf between rich countries who export expensive, high-tech products and poor countries who are dependent on exports of cheap raw materials from agriculture and mining is widening.
The profits from investments in these countries flow back to the richest countries.
This WTO is trying to maintain these abuses, and in doing so forms a threat to welfare, the environment and democracy.
Mr DÃ©sir is making a creditable attempt to promote openness and democracy in international trade.
I support him in this, but I fear that it will be insufficient without further changes.
Brok report (A5-0332/2001)
Mr President, while I was on the plane taking me from Bratislava to Prague and then on to Malpensa, on my way back from my visit to Slovakia, I was reading the Brok report to decide on how to vote when, as often happens to me, I fell asleep.
I had a dream. Knowing that Mr Brok is so good at foreign policy, Mr President, I dreamt that he had become Foreign Minister in the Europe of the future.
I also dreamt that on the plane, as well as Mr Brok, there were some beautiful blonde hostesses from the Czech Republic.
I woke up, Mr President.
I am sure that the beautiful blondes will remain a dream, but will Mr Brok as Foreign Minister come true?
