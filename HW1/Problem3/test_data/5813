I hope that I will be here next time to discuss readmission agreements with you and that I will then have a better story to tell you.
As far as the oral question is concerned, the Commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by Member States.
I can tell you that an average of 40% of the money allocated to Member States in the European Fund for Refugees is used to finance voluntary return.
Only voluntary return comes under the provisions of the Fund for European Refugees.
According to CIREFI statistics for 2001, with returns from 12 of the 15 Member States - the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands did not provide figures - a total of around 333 000 people have been returned.
In 2002, from January to September, 98 000 people have been returned by Member States, but this figure does not include the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg which have not provided us with the figures.
I recognise that we need to have more accurate statistics on these issues.
For instance, I cannot distinguish between voluntary returns and forced returns because national Member States' statistics do not make the distinction.
I can give you the citizenship of those who have been returned but I cannot tell you to where they have been returned because, as you know, some of them have not been returned to their own country, they have been returned to the countries through which they entered the European Union.
We recognise the need for better information and, therefore, we will present a proposal during the Greek presidency to have a specific instrument for exchange of harmonised and standardised statistics so far as asylum and migration policy are concerned.
With regard to enforcement of decisions to return people, the Commission has no responsibilities so far as enforcement is concerned.
That is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States.
Nevertheless, we believe that some instruments should be adopted at European level.
For instance, mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is a key element.
There is an instrument with very limited scope in this area; we are now assessing how it has been working in practice and I hope that next spring we can present you with our evaluation of how mutual recognition of expulsion decisions works in the European Union.
The same applies to the standards for expulsion.
We believe that we should have some common standards at European level for decisions to return people; I therefore hope we will be able to present some specific proposals on this topic fairly soon.
I recognise that the Commission does not have any instrument for monitoring post-return situations.
It is not within our remit and we do not have the tools to make such an evaluation.
Of course, I welcome the idea of having a broad debate on return policy.
As you know, we have published a Green Paper, we have presented an action plan and the Council has endorsed this action plan.
I hope that, in the framework of the debate on communications about migration and development, we will be able, together with Parliament, to discuss what the key elements of return policy in the European Union are.
I am looking forward to hearing Parliament's view on this subject.
Mr President, asylum policy is particularly difficult, and has many unpleasant aspects.
One major aspect is the fact that a large proportion of asylum seekers are ultimately faced with the prospect of return - or even forced return.
This is something that always attracts a great deal of attention and arouses emotions amongst the general public.
While on the one hand enormous pressure is often exerted on politicians to turn away as many asylum seekers who may not be entirely legitimate as possible, on the other hand people are extraordinarily moved by those who ultimately have to be sent back, sometimes even after many years.
We do have to take account of the often highly contradictory emotions of the general public.
Besides, voluntary return is not always straightforward, and I have learned that an organisation such as the IOM, for example, at least in the Netherlands, is often very unsuccessful.
The number of people who have been organised to return voluntarily to their own country or to their former country is relatively low.
The whole of our asylum policy - or at the very least our return policy - must meet the requirements of human dignity in all respects.
This is a point to which we must pay much attention, and I am also pleased that we are working on the aspect of return in an orderly fashion in agreements such as the one with Hong Kong and others currently in preparation.
It goes without saying, however, that these should include other aspects than just the return clauses.
With regard to what has just been said about checking up on what happens to people who have returned, I believe that there are many things that we can do about this in an EU context as well.
Governments often say: OK, our embassy will keep in touch with people who are sent back despite the fact that they claim to be in danger in their own countries.
Such cases naturally occur in all countries.
I am of the opinion that it is important to create a particular specialism in the embassies of the Member States in order to find out whether it is possible, in some cases, to keep in touch with people who have returned so that we can be sure - really sure - that their return was a considered judgment by the person who sent them back.
As far as the Hong Kong agreement is concerned, I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Watson says about it.
It is of course a pity that we are being asked for approval at this very late stage.
Its legitimacy naturally depends on our approval.
We are therefore justifying this approval now.
This is in fact a risky reversal of procedures, but I take Mr Vitorino, whose good will has been demonstrated on several occasions in this Parliament, at his word when he says that he will ensure that other opportunities for notifying Parliament about such documents earlier on will be investigated in the future so as to enable us to make a material contribution if possible.
As far as the clarity of European policy is concerned, Mr Haarder has already spoken about this.
I think that it is very important, particularly from the point of view of human dignity in respect of third countries.
If we have a homogenous, or relatively homogenous, asylum policy, one in which we have co-ordinated many different standards, we will be able to provide information on it in third countries so that the people there will know what treatment they can expect everywhere in the European Union.
This will give asylum seekers who are really only trying their luck the opportunity not to try their luck, the opportunity not to remain in debt with their families, fellow-villagers or neighbours, but to stay where they are and not risk returning penniless.
Finally I have a question about the European Fund for Refugees that was mentioned.
Is it possible for the European Fund for Refugees to have a better future, and is it possible for the European Union itself to therefore address itself to the matter of relief in the region to a greater extent?
Mr President, Mr Haarder, at the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, thanks to the complexity of Community procedures, you adopted a very effective measure in the fight against illegal immigration, but you probably did not realise - because it was the final point on the agenda - that, without debate, you approved the conclusion of an agreement extending and increasing the quotas for the import of tomatoes from Morocco.
Apart from this decision, you have not taken any great measures, either in this Council or in any other, in relation to the field of immigration at least.
We have on the table a full range of proposals from the Commission in relation to immigration policies, a proactive immigration policy, and I will not list them since I will bore Parliament if I do so in every speech.
None of them have been adopted.
At the European Council in Seville, without having done its homework in this field, the Council once again established priorities and time limits in relation to immigration policy.
They began to talk there less about this policy and more about the fight against illegal immigration.
But we have not made much progress on that either.
In any event, what did happen there was to begin to talk about this in a different way which gives me some concern.
They began to talk about the return of immigrants, the control of external borders, in a way in which there is not much room for many concrete proposals.
There was talk of security, the term border control was introduced into this field and, listening to you, it appears that illegal immigration has to do with lack of security.
If you take a walk around our cities, you will see that illegal immigration has more to do with domestic staff, people working in agriculture and people working in our restaurants.
And we know who they are.
To give you a figure, in my country, and in just one town close to Barcelona, L'Hospitalet, which has 800 000 inhabitants, 17 670 people have been recorded, many of them illegal immigrants.
During this period, the Commission has presented two proposals which provide a global approximation of the issue, as laid down in the Tampere conclusions: the Green Paper on return, the inclusion of the immigration policy in the Union's external policy.
Of course, this global approximation must include a repressive aspect, but in order to ensure the fulfilment of an immigration policy, in order to control illegal employment - if Berlusconi will allow me - in order to establish a policy for integration of external trade.
If we do not have this global approximation, if we do not focus on this approach, we are not going to be effective in the fight against illegal immigration.
Mr President, we all acknowledge that there have been two problems in the achievement of common asylum and immigration policies: lack of speed and lack of balance.
On the speed problem, there has been a spurt on asylum policy under the Danish presidency.
I too pay tribute to the energy of Mr Haarder.
However, on the question of balance, I still feel very frustrated that legal migration and rights of migrants have been neglected.
There is so much criticism of migrants who fail to integrate, but little is done to assist them through, for example, family reunification or rights of free movement.
Let us take, for example, the reception conditions directive which highlights the classic danger of the 'lowest common denominator' approach imposed by the unanimity rule.
This is not Mr Haarder's fault.
After apparent agreement on the text last April, debate was reopened.
The result was that the Germans got their way, and consequently there is no requirement to allow asylum seekers to work if a decision on their case is not forthcoming within a year.
The British have got their way in that Member States will be allowed to refuse reception assistance where the asylum seeker cannot show that he has made his claim as soon as possible.
If there was qualified majority voting and codecision with this Parliament, neither clause - I am sure - would be in this text since a more progressive majority would have prevailed.
On the question of return, are we forcing women to return to Afghanistan, to an environment described by Human Rights Watch as being just as oppressive as it was under the Taliban?
Spied on by teenage boys, women are marched to hospital and forced to undergo abusive gynaecological examinations to prove their chastity.
They still have to wear the burkha, which is medieval.
I suggest that we cannot guarantee the security of women returned to Afghanistan.
I would like assurance that we are not returning women to Afghanistan.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that what has been said on this subject is very important.
Furthermore, I wholeheartedly support the comments made by my fellow Member, Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­.
I believe that, although we set the objective of harmonisation with the Treaty of Amsterdam and we took a huge step forward at Tampere, thanks, amongst other things, to Commissioner Vitorino's involvement, we took two steps back with the Seville European Council.
Because, rather than talking about a global harmonisation policy, about a policy which will take proper account of all the disparities, all the complex points of existing laws, and which will bring about harmonisation, everything is focused on the issue of illegal immigration instead.
What was proposed at Seville was very disturbing, because if we had carried the Seville proposals through to their logical conclusion, we would have imposed sanctions on the countries of the South that are already suffering from famine, war and violence.
We would have imposed sanctions on them to force them to take back their nationals.
This shows that we understand nothing: we do not understand that those who migrate do not leave their country out of pleasure: they leave because they are victims of violence and poverty.
There is another issue that concerns me as well, Commissioner, that of the 'brain drain' affecting the countries of the South.
Today, as we know, nobody objects to admitting young IT professionals.
Nobody objects to hiring young students either.
However, when it comes to the question of the immigration of regular and regulated flows, we will no longer accept anyone.
We fall back into the trap of these old fantasies or, quite simply, of meaningless phrases such as zero immigration or 'wide-open' borders.
In seeing people come to our countries and fall into the hands of slum landlords we clearly find the great liberal ideal which drives some of us. .
I shall conclude by also saying that I am shocked to see that the majority of immigration policies are dealt with by the Home Affairs Ministers.
I think that this issue must be a part of a co-development policy, since it does not stop at sanctions.
We know that, today, the UK army can turn people away and we know that there are refugee camps in France.
In my view, therefore, cancelling third world debt, Commissioner, and helping development with a good governance policy appear to be solutions that we must not disregard if we want to have a fairer and more humane immigration policy.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the readmission agreements that the Council is proposing stem more from a strategy for combating illegal immigration than from genuine cooperation.
Allow me to stress two points.
As far as the procedure is concerned, the lack of information given to Parliament raises the issue of the role and powers of parliamentarians: it is our democratic credibility that is at stake.
We complain about the rate of abstention, about the fact that Europe is an unknown entity to the citizens, we want to convince citizens of the need for the Union, but, as long as their representatives are scorned and are not consulted, we cannot make the Europe of the citizen that we want to build credible.
With regard to the readmission clauses, the Union reaffirmed its commitment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions at the Tampere Summit.
It is therefore unacceptable that these readmission agreements can make it possible to send back third country nationals when there is no guarantee that human rights and democratic freedoms will be respected in their country of origin.
What criteria are applied in order to verify that a country to which a national is being returned is safe?
The European Union is basing its policy on respect for fundamental rights.
This applies, in particular, to the measures which regulate the movement of individuals, and especially to the measures relating to voluntary or forced return.
How does the Commission intend to verify that these rights are respected in case of return, particularly when it is a question of mass returns?
These issues are real issues.
Today, Afghans may be returned to Afghanistan despite the fact that there is no guarantee of their safety and of peace in the region.
The closure of Sangatte has provided no solution to the problem of accepting refugees; Kurds and Iraqis continue to arrive every day.
Are the readmission agreements compatible with the obligations under international law, do they respect the principle of 'non-refoulement', on which the right to seek asylum depends?
What common control mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with the countries with which these agreements are negotiated?
We should like to have been reassured that these fundamental rights are being respected.
In spite of the quality of the work of our rapporteur, we have no guarantee regarding these questions that are fundamental for our freedoms and our rights.
The readmission clauses provide a response to the concerns regarding the interests of the countries of the Union instead of assisting the development of third countries.
They are harmful to any Community immigration and asylum policy; we are therefore unable to support them.
Mr President, there are two aspects to this issue: firstly, the problem of excluding unwanted migrants from the European Union - or at least controlling their access; and, secondly, the reasons for migration.
Excluding population pressure, political instability and regional war, it is clear that the main pressure stems from economic disparities.
In short, the bulk of immigrants seeking access to the European Union Member States are economic migrants.
Therefore, any successful policy must deal with not only the exclusion issues but also the causes of migration.
Here it seems clear the European Union is making things worse.
Virtually all its external policies in respect of third countries and its policies towards the candidate countries seem geared to causing migration from less-developed countries.
The Union has rigid quotas, tariffs and other protectionist policies restricting trade with third countries.
While it subsidies its own industries - especially agriculture through the unreformed common agricultural policy - and it dumps subsidised goods on the world market, all of this destabilises third-world economies.
In terms of fishing agreements, the Union pillages third-world waters, instead of encouraging local industries.
It also takes skilled, educated workers from these countries, depriving them of the building blocks of economic development.
All of this cruelly exposes the imperialism of the European project.
Instead of getting on with practical issues, you launch upon idealistic common policies.
These policies are making the problems worse.
It would make far more sense to stop damaging third-country economies, rather than embarking on these extraordinary new ventures.
In other words, leave immigration control to the Member States - a policy that my party supports - and address the failures of existing policies.
There it seems to me, in deference to the Council member present, you must try harder.
Mr President, credit is certainly due to the Danish Presidency for producing a more judicious immigration policy, particularly as regards questions such as the very sensitive issue of asylum, for policies on these matters have, for a long time, in practice, actually tended to encourage illegal immigration.
However, although we are more aware of the dangers related to illegal immigration, that does not mean that the Union has practically implemented all the most effective measures for opposing it, such as, for example, readmission agreements with third countries, which must progress much faster and be much more practical, given that - as we are all aware - the Union has strong tangible grounds for putting pressure on these countries.
On the coasts of southern Italy, the flow of illegal immigrants ferried to the country by sea continues, despite the adoption of new, more stringent criminal legislation against traffickers, precisely because there has been no fall in the support or complicity traffickers enjoy in countries such as Albania or Turkey.
The measures announced to combat illegal immigration include the project for a European police force to deal with all border control, not just control of sea borders, although this police force must be properly trained.
This project must be given full support and pursued without delay, and proper training in this field must be given to the police forces of the new Member States, which will very soon have to address these issues - if they are not already addressing them - for their borders will become ours in this respect too.
There is, however, another important warning bell which it is our duty to ring too: we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to a number of proven cases of active members of Bin Laden's network who have penetrated our cities as regular immigrants in order to prepare the ground, as has recently been discovered in France, for biological weapons attacks, possibly with what are known as dirty bombs containing nuclear waste.
This danger is now present within Europe.
We must take care that we do not help those intending to bring about incidents similar to those which took place in New York, Mombassa or Bali with excessively generous provision.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being in the European Parliament today to discuss issues which do not only have a large human component, but which also have a very high profile in the media and in politics; immigration and asylum.
I will refer firstly to immigration.
It is a good thing that it is said and repeated time and time again in this House that regulated migratory flows make a very positive contribution to the development of the receiving country, the situation of immigrants themselves and even the development of the country of origin.
But it should also be repeated that the unrestricted arrival of persons in an illegal manner leads to a saturation of the structures of our societies and ends up exceeding those societies' capacity for reception, resulting in situations of inequality and marginalisation.
We therefore need a coherent European policy which takes account of all the elements inherent to the phenomenon of migration.
The European Councils in Tampere, Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration.
Nevertheless, not without reason, many people have criticised the lack of agreement in non-repressive fields, as my colleague and predecessor, Mr Watson, has said; it is true that, on the basis of such tragic events as those which take place on an almost daily basis in the waters of the Straits of Gibraltar, or on Italian coasts, vigilance, border control and the fight against mafias and exploiters of illegal workers, can and must be the response to the concerns of the citizens, who are increasingly sensitive to issues such as insecurity and human trafficking.
Nevertheless, I would like to stress the importance of other aspects still awaiting substantial progress.
Firstly, the intensification and reconsideration of the policy of development aid in order to generate, in the countries of origin, a dignified and promising environment and thereby prevent the exodus of people - the majority of whom are young - who, rather than fleeing towards the unknown, risking their lives, could and should play an essential role in the development of their own countries.
Secondly, to begin work on the implementation of an observatory, which at the moment is virtual, for migration, which by means of analysis and distribution of information, would allow us to deal with the phenomenon of immigration on the basis of true facts, which are reliable and comparable between Member States, as the Commissioner has just acknowledged.
Thirdly, promoting the integration of legal immigrants, one of the keys to the success of any immigration policy, by means of measures which include family reunification, the education of children, non-discrimination, access to housing, facilities for the learning of the language of the reception country, or social or health measures.
Now, in order to prevent clashes with the receiving society, and as was acknowledged at the fourth Mediterranean forum in Bari, held on 17 and 18 June, it is necessary not to forget the twin aspects of the phenomenon, that is, the need to also work to ensure the respect on the part of the immigrants for the principles and values of the society receiving them.
Finally, cooperation with countries of origin and transit in a spirit of partnership and co-responsibility, as agreed at the aforementioned forum, on the control of migratory flows, the fight against illegal immigration, the adoption of national readmission agreements and integrated management of the Union's borders.
This is a task which, in order to be successful, must be carried out in close cooperation with the third countries bordering the European Union.
And to move on to the field of asylum, Mr President, I would like to stress the importance of, and respect for, the Geneva Convention, regulating, in a complementary manner, other necessary forms of international protection for those cases included in it.
However, I regret once again to have to make a criticism, as I did when we discussed the directive, for which I was rapporteur, in relation to the conditions for receiving and asylum because, in practice, the negotiations on the different aspects of the asylum policy are still being carried out in a confused and disorganised fashion.
There is a saying: 'do not bite off more than you can chew'; and I have the feeling that this is the current situation in the field of asylum.
It is also incongruous to discuss proposals which, in their provisions, depend on concepts regulated by others, the negotiations of which should have been concluded earlier, but which instead are making no progress.
I would therefore appeal to you to rationalise the European process, and let us not get tied up in vicious circles which are highly influenced by national interests.
Finally, Mr President, last but not least, I would like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the fact that, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, scheduled for 1 February, the Parliament-Council codecision procedure, and the qualified majority, will be applicable in such sensitive areas as all those which relate to the minimum standards regulating the different aspects of the procedures, requirements and conditions for asylum.
As many people have already said, the common asylum and immigration policy is progressing in a very unbalanced way.
Where repressive measures, including combating illegal immigration, are concerned, the Council has once again done a lot of energetic work this year.
There is, however, currently no sign of an actual common asylum and migration policy, and that is not the Commission's fault - no, it is the Council's fault.
The Council has opted for a highly unilateral approach.
It has put control of our external borders and sanctions against offering assistance to those entering and staying illegally right at the top of the agenda.
The removal and return policy has now been added to this as a priority.
In this context we are talking today about the readmission agreement with third countries, in this case Hong Kong.
Parliament was more or less left standing on the sidelines during the negotiations for this agreement, and has not been able to act in accordance with its allotted role.
This should not have been allowed to happen, particularly as this agreement will be a model for future agreements of a similar kind.
I have taken note of Mr Vitorino's promise that this will not happen again, and I intend to remind him of this.
My group can otherwise live with the content of the Hong Kong agreement, but we do endorse Mr Watson's critical approach.
Leading on from his questions, I would like to make the three following comments.
Firstly, to what extent are the deportation measures already taken effective in general, and how do we prevent people from third countries who have been deported from coming straight back into the EU countries they came from?
Or is our policy of return primarily a virtual policy intended for domestic consumption, and is it supposed to mask the fact that the political courage to tackle the real problems is lacking?
Secondly, is forced return not supposed to be a tailpiece of our policy of return, a last resort, and what instruments does the European Union actually have to promote voluntary return in order to avoid forced return?
My last point: collective deportation is forbidden, including in the European Charter of Human Rights, but how are European Union Member States supposed to ensure that decisions to deport individual illegal immigrants from third countries are individually monitored, and how do we then prevent the principle of 'non-refoulement' from being violated?
Mr President, Denmark and Mr Haarder have today received well deserved praise.
I agree with that praise.
However, I am less satisfied with the EU's refugee and immigration policy.
The proposals are more often than not about control and repression.
The global perspective is easily lost.
What is required?
Well, that poverty in the world be combated and that we obtain more aid, more trade and more democracy.
Mr Haarder is well aware of this.
We need a humane asylum policy based on respect and human dignity.
All human beings are entitled to seek asylum within the EU.
Not all will have reasons for requiring protection that enable them to stay, but all must be dealt with under the rule of law and under decent conditions, as well as having, for example, access to the labour market.
The fact that the EU is opening the door to immigrant labour should ease the pressure on asylum policy and, at the same time, give us an opportunity to cope with the increasing population problems.
The fact that the EU needs a common asylum policy is shown by the Danish example.
When Denmark tightens up its policy, the refugees come to Sweden.
A humanitarian EU must be able to do better.
That requires codecision making in this Chamber, something of which Mr Haarder is more aware than anyone else.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin as Baroness Ludford began, by saying that in the field, of asylum and immigration, there has been a lack of speed and a lack of balance.
I also agree with the words of Mrs TerrÃ³n i Cusi, who said that a global approach to these issues is needed.
A global approach means that we need to focus on the two aspects of the set of problems posed by asylum and immigration; the causes underlying them and how we can combat their abuse.
And on this point I wish to say that I do not agree with those who oppose repressive measures on the grounds that they are not necessary.
Unfortunately, they are.
Combating illegal immigration must be a priority for the Union, because this phenomenon represents the greatest threat to human dignity, it allows criminal networks and trafficking in human beings to flourish. Illegal immigration and our inability to control migratory flows allow people to react in exaggeratedly xenophobic, racist and intolerant ways.
It would probably be easier to make everything that is illegal legal, but we cannot do this.
Not everyone who wishes to enter EU territory can do so.
And therefore, as Mr Watson said, we must have a policy of repatriation that ensures the credibility of our immigration policy.
And this is crucial and must be done without any complexes of an ideological or any other nature.
What we have, therefore, is a lack of speed and a lack of balance.
As to the lack of speed, I have confidence in the energy of Commissioner Vitorino; with regard to the lack of balance, I think that this Parliament will have to shift the balance of some of its positions.
Concerning the wisdom of Commissioner Vitorino, I wish to emphasise something that he said and which I believe to be extremely important: on this matter we must have a policy made up of small steps; small steps, but steady ones.
Mr President, the will of the Commission in response to the orientations of the European Council to establish a global and integrated policy of migrations is very laudable, but the police and Interior Ministry approach, which can be gathered from the communication, clashes directly with this Parliament's view of the relations the European Union must maintain with the developing countries, whose immigrants, by the way - and according to the Commission itself - are not a problem from a quantitative point of view.
As the Commission itself points out, more than 90% of the world's immigrants live and work outside the European Union, close to their countries of origin.
At the time of the Seville European Council, we warned of the danger of making cooperation for development conditional upon the control of immigration on the part of the countries in which it is generated.
Development cooperation is not an instrument for resolving the internal problems of the donors of aid, but a tool for fighting poverty.
The origins of migration, whether legal or not, lie in poverty, political repression and armed conflicts.
These are the causes which must be combated through development cooperation, rather than using it to repress their effects.
This Commission's desire to integrate European immigration policy is a wonderful opportunity to ensure that, instead of spending development funds on monitoring borders and the forced repatriation of immigrants, they are assigned to more constructive activities in accordance with the principle of combating poverty which governs European cooperation policy.
It is a question of co-development or, in other words, contributing to the development of the areas of origin of immigrants, so that they can return with hope for the future.
In this way, the Commission would be acting coherently with itself, since it states, in the communication we are debating today, that it is aware that the European Union's relations with the developing countries must be based on solidarity.
Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement on readmission led to problems and protests.
Therefore, we say yes to negotiated readmission within the framework of global development programmes, but no to forced repatriation, especially when this is paid for from development funds.
We will be vigilant in order to prevent, by means of the reallocation of the scant resources in category 4, any modification of the development priorities established by this Parliament, especially given that the Commission's report demonstrates the concern at the lack of money available for resolving this problem.
Mr President, there is certainly no lack of suggestions when it comes to asylum policy, suggestions which can provoke feelings either of fear or of excessive generosity and tolerance.
It has, of course, been pointed out here - and I agree - that what we need instead is good sense, wisdom and, above all, a great ability to recognise the complex nature of issues.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether the position of minors, in particular, is being addressed, with regard to the right to asylum and migration issues, and if so how, and whether a huge problem known as 'Eurocracy' - in other words the fact that waiting times for both the rejection and the acceptance of certain applications relating to what are still extremely lengthy, complex procedures are excessively long and certainly do not respect what we call human rights - is being addressed, Commissioner, and if so how.
Lastly, a fundamental question. You talked about harmonising asylum laws and thus of the need for a clear legal framework and, I would go so far as to say, constitutional framework for all the European countries, for our credibility depends on this.
I agree with you on this point and I hope that you will work towards this goal.
Mr President, Parliament today appears to have become aware of the problems related to mass, illegal immigration that Europe has been experiencing for 30 years.
It is high time to realise that the sacrosanct principle of laissez-faire and laissez-passer spells disaster for Europe.
One European government after another has been incapable of managing the uninterrupted waves of immigrants, and the recent, highly publicised agreement between France and Britain regarding Sangatte is not going to change things.
The Sangatte refugee camp has closed, that is all very well.
The United Kingdom has agreed to admit one thousand illegal immigrants, but then what?
What about all the others, those who were not tagged by the Red Cross, and what about the hundreds of immigrants who arrive illegally every day?
Closing Sangatte without closing borders is obviously inconsistent, absurd and ineffective.
It is once again a matter of urgency, as a first step as a safeguard and a precaution, to restore controls at all our national borders and to condemn the irresponsible and obsolete Schengen agreements.
Mr President, at the Seville European Council, three fundamental aspects of the Union's immigration policy were specified: firstly, the necessary management of migratory flows, in cooperation with countries of origin; secondly, taking account of the integration of legal immigrants; and finally, opening up negotiations of readmission agreements at European level.
With regard to the first point, initiatives such as the proposal for a Directive on the free movement of citizens or family regrouping, or those relating to the conditions for entry for work purposes for immigrant or third-country nationals, should be approved by this Parliament as soon as possible and with the greatest possible consensus, in order to demonstrate that we are in favour of a single immigration policy.
With regard to the second point, the success of an immigration policy undoubtedly depends on the integration measures which must accompany it.
Therefore, reception and integration must be considered as an essential part of the general immigration policy and this means agreed action, not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of national and regional governments, civil society and the immigrants themselves.
We must take advantage of the generally positive impact which legal immigrants have on our economies and ensure an appropriate balance between the rights of third-country citizens and the rights of receiving communities.
I am happy to support the measures of the Danish Presidency with regard to readmission agreements.
I would point out that in one of the Convention's working groups it was said that the negotiation of readmission agreements with third countries has been shown to be more effective when carried out at European level.
Another important point is the creation of an integrated system of management of external borders.
In this regard, I would also praise the Danish Presidency, which wished to promote a rapid and secure exchange of information between the Member States, with a view to strengthening cooperation on the control of borders.
In this regard, it is appropriate to mention the report adopted last week in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on this issue.
I would like to end with a quote from Mr Vitorino, which I have often used: 'immigration is neither a problem nor a solution, it is a phenomenon of a clearly human, social, economic and political nature'.
Mr President, many things have already been said, but I would like to take this opportunity to condemn Europe's lack of unity with regard to the particularly sensitive issue of harmonising the asylum and immigration policies, an issue which is all too often supplanted by that of combating illegal immigration.
Is it worthwhile refreshing the failing memory of our governments of Article 63 of the Treaty, which defines the process leading to the harmonisation and communitarisation of questions related to the right to asylum and immigration?
I wish, for my part, to express my frustration at the pious hopes that we hear in each statement made by Council representatives on these issues, when, in reality, obviously, no EU Member State actually wishes to share with its neighbours one of the prerogatives of national sovereignty, namely the admittance of foreigners to its territory.
Until now, the proposed measures have mainly been focused on the question of illegal immigration.
On the question of establishing proper procedures for immigration, there has been a lack of consultation with the European Parliament, on the one hand, and a lack of agreement between the governments of the Fifteen on the other.
After the Tampere Summit in October 1999, however, the Commission approached the task with a positive outlook.
We believe that it is impossible to discuss combating illegal immigration unless we also consider proper procedures for immigration and the conditions for integrating foreigners.
We need a global approach, this has been pointed out.
It is essential.
It is not a fortress Europe that we want.
To sum up, I shall say that the lack of political will on the part of the EU countries leads us to confirm that we still have a great deal of work to do before we achieve the European area of freedom, security and justice which was, in fact, one of the fundamental themes of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Mr President, since I only have one minute of speaking time, I shall come straight to the point which is a subject of major concern: the re-admission agreement signed by the Commission with the Regional Government of Hong Kong, which is now an integral part of China.
First and foremost, we should welcome the signing of the first bilateral agreement enabling illegal immigrants to return home, which comes three years after the Tampere European Council's initial request.
In reality, however, when we read the agreement's explanatory statement, we are appalled to learn that, in conjunction with its signing, the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs have, in return, obviously, exonerated the holders of Hong Kong passports from the visa requirement.
We feel that the two parallel decisions are utterly disproportionate.
How many Chinese nationals are able to enter the European Union thanks to the visa exemption and stay here illegally? And how many can be returned to Hong Kong - at our expense, I might add - under the readmission agreement?
We therefore feel that this agreement is, in all respects, not at all beneficial.
We would very much like to know how many of these concessions might have been negotiated.
In any case, it is unacceptable.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, is it not absurd that there should be a Council, which appoints a Commission and entrusts it with the drafting of a common asylum and immigration policy, and that the same Council should do everything in its power to frustrate this Commission's proposals?
At present, that is what we have to deal with in this area in the European Union, and on a daily basis.
I believe that my fellow German Members who are taking no part whatsoever in this debate have good reasons for their absence.
I assume that they are celebrating the fact that, from today, Germany will no longer have a modern immigration law, because they have been successful in preventing the creation of a modern law of this sort.
That, I believe, is what the Christian Democrats should finally ask themselves - they should ask themselves what they think they are doing.
If they were to act responsibly, they would inevitably end up sharing with us a concern that there should be a common asylum and immigration policy.
But that is not what they are about.
The Christian Democratic majority in the European Union has but one objective: integration and the frustration of any reasonable immigration policy.
I very much regret this.
Mr President, I fully support Mr Watson's excellent report, particularly the text of the question in which the European Parliament calls upon the Council and the Commission to take seriously the fundamental human rights which the European Union proclaims every day.
We believe that it is possible to respect human rights while pursuing a proper policy of combating illegal immigration.
However, we do need appropriate instruments, appropriate forms of control, for otherwise a blind, bureaucratic system of rejection and forced repatriation will lead to tragedies such as that which occurred recently in Italy.
In Milan, a family travelling from Syria, in transit from Amman to Casablanca, was forced to be repatriated to Syria, where the head of the family was immediately arrested and is in danger of being tortured and may be sentenced to death.
We call upon you to ensure that similar tragedies are avoided so that nobody can say, as is stated in the minority opinion, that the Union's readmission policy leads to the death of human beings.
I call upon the Commission and the Council to make every endeavour to remedy the consequences of that tragic act carried out in my country, which can lead to a person being killed in another country.
Mr President, Commissioner, on the eve of 2003, the Greek Presidency has promised to give the very fullest attention to the decisions taken in Amsterdam, Tampere and Seville.
Greece's extensive coastline forms the external border of the European Union with the countries of Asia, countries from which immigrants are now flooding into Europe, which is why it is vital that the Greek Presidency introduce a framework policy to divide obligations and responsibilities fairly between the Member States of the European Union.
Of course, as other members have also pointed out, immigration policy means more than just guarding borders.
It means more than repressive measures, repatriation and readmission.
It also means recognising the human rights and fundamental employment and civil rights of immigrants and what they have to offer and can contribute to the development of Europe.
It means fully recognising the rights of anyone who has resided in the European Union for five years, as we have repeatedly proposed here in Parliament. It also means recognising that women who have left home under the threat of religious fundamentalism or barbaric traditions and practices which clash with the modern perception of respect for human rights have a right to apply for and be granted asylum.
. (DA) Mr President, I will start with Mrs Hazan, who complains that there is disagreement concerning asylum policy and that therefore it will not really come to anything.
I did not entirely understand this remark, because I was after all able to say that we have just reached agreement on the cornerstones of a common asylum policy.
We have agreed on the definition of a refugee, on what is to be understood by subsidiary protection and on the directive on reception conditions, and by all accounts all this will be confirmed at a Council meeting tomorrow.
In addition, we have also agreed to convert the Dublin convention into a Dublin directive.
The agreement is based on the first receiving country being responsible for the first year and thereafter the country in which the person concerned has resided for five months, and if the person concerned has not resided in any country for five months then it is the country in which the application for asylum is submitted.
That may sound very easy, but the opposing interests of the various countries are so enormous - depending on where they are situated in Europe - that it has been tremendously difficult to reach agreement.
I believe it is extremely satisfactory than we now have agreement on these cornerstones of a common asylum policy.
Mr Vitorino and I met for the first time in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. He was the chairman and I was a member.
The first thing we talked about was these things, which we wanted to lead to a common policy, and we talked a lot about Eurodac.
When will it come to something, we asked the Commissioner.
Now we can answer: something will come of it on 15 January, that is, next month.
So I think we have achieved a great deal.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat that.
Mrs Sbarbati is right that something must be done for asylum-seeking minors in particular, and I can only state that in my home parliament I have introduced a Bill which ensures that an adult is present, that a lawyer is present when necessary and that cases involving minors are processed extra quickly.
Similar efforts are in progress in other countries.
Turning to Mrs Ludford, I would say that if not much has come of a common immigration policy, that is partly to do with the number of work permits to be issued.
Most governments maintain that this must be a national decision.
This is why it has also been difficult to arrive at common rules on the right to free movement between countries.
It is only natural that reaching agreement on this point is a difficult task, not least because some countries have very high levels of employment whilst others have very low levels of employment.
We will probably make some progress, but as I have mentioned, it is not that easy.
I would go on to say to Mrs Swiebel that one specific aspect of the common asylum policy on which we have now agreed is that we ensure compliance with the conventions in every case.
With regard to Mrs Swiebel's concerns regarding forced returns, I believe that all the governments are doing everything to ensure that those whose asylum claims are rejected are returned voluntarily; likewise illegal immigrants, if the governments wish to return them.
One cannot rule out forced repatriation, however; if we were to rule that out, we might as well pack up and forget all about an asylum policy, including a common asylum policy.
Regarding what Mrs Ludford said about women being returned to Afghanistan, it is naturally the case - as it should be - that nobody must be sent back to persecution, torture or degrading treatment.
To reassure her I can state that the Afghans in most countries - this is true in my country at least - are young men from the Kabul region.
Even they are not being sent back home at the moment; but it is obvious that, when this becomes possible in the spring, then it is only reasonable that, if their asylum claim has been rejected, we ensure that the person in question returns one way or another.
I think it is great that Mr Vitorino has now achieved agreement in the Council not just on a general return policy, but also on a special return programme for Afghanistan.
For this aspect of the matter must be included.
Finally, I would say to Mr Olle Schmidt that I thank him for his interest in Danish legislation.
It already meets all the common minimum rules that we are talking about, and even goes beyond them.
So thank you for your concern.
Mr President, first of all, I shall stress that, in my view, thanks to the commitment of the Danish Presidency and that of the Greek Presidency, the possibility of gaining approval in the near future for the first phase of legislative instruments in the area of asylum is within our grasp.
Approval of these instruments is very important, because it paves the way for the full implementation of the Treaty of Nice, which provides for the development of the second stage subject to qualified majority.
I understand the difficulties and the reluctance that is felt on occasion, but for my part, it is very important to be able to say that we have completed, within the timeframe stipulated by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the first phase of legislative instruments in the area of asylum in order to be able to pave the way for the full implementation of the Treaty of Nice, including the integration, subject to qualified majority, of a common European asylum system.
As far as the contradiction between repressive policies and proactive policies is concerned, I feel that the Commission has strived to present a range of proposals that is balanced in both areas.
Regarding, for example, the policy on return, we have financial instruments for voluntary return, which is the European Refugee Fund.
We have also recently presented a proposal for the use of heading B7-667.
To this end, we shall present a proposal for a legal basis which provides for the possibility of using financial resources to support the application of re-admission agreements, including forced return.
Admittedly, a policy for the management of migratory flows must include, by definition, the existence of financial instruments for forced return.
This is precisely why we wish to adopt common rules in the area of forced return and we wish to ensure respect for certain rules in the area of fundamental rights, within the framework of the development of the policy on forced return.
In this respect, I shall respond to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and say that the Commission has no executive responsibilities in the area of return.
All Member States, in applying decisions on return, are meant to respect the relevant international instruments on fundamental rights, including the non-refoulement clause.
There are also legal instruments for judicial protection where the Member State breaches the rule on non-refoulement.
All readmission agreements must respect the Geneva Convention as well as the principle of non-refoulement.
I also support Mr Watson's approach in that we must emphasise the dimension of fundamental rights within the framework of the re-admission agreements.
That is why - and if you have an opportunity, you can verify this - the Commission has strengthened the non-appropriation clause in the new mandates for negotiating re-admission agreements with Albania, Algeria, Turkey and the People's Republic of China.
As far as the relationship between the development policy and the immigration policy is concerned, let us be clear and speak openly and honestly.
It is true that the development policy deals with the profound causes of immigration, but the development policy can only bring about long-term changes in this area.
It would be impossible to expect immediate effects from a sustainable development policy of the kind that we apply in our relations with third countries.
That is why we must not neglect the need to take short-term measures, for example in the area of managing migratory flows of qualified workers, flows are a genuine scourge for developing world countries which are thus deprived of human resources that are essential for their development.
It is this whole complex framework that we are trying to lay down in the Immigration and Development communication.
I hope that we shall have the opportunity to discuss it here at a plenary sitting of the European Parliament.
Lastly, I am wholly of the opinion that we must provide special protection for minors.
I would also draw your attention to the fact that, in all the proposals that we have made in the area of asylum and immigration, we have introduced specific rules for the protection of minors and also of women.
To sum up, I hope that we shall have the opportunity during the Greek Presidency to debate a Commission communication which is currently being prepared in conjunction with Mrs Diamantopoulou.
The communication relates to the interaction between the policy on managing migration and social policy in general, and the European employment policy in particular.
It will be an important time for clarifying the close relationship between the management of migratory flows and employment policy at European level, as Mr Watson highlighted so clearly.
Thank you very much, Mr Vitorino.
Mr Berthu has the floor for a point of order.
Mr President, I put a specific question to the Council and the Commission, but I have not been given an answer.
The question was as follows: how could they simultaneously sign visa exemptions for Hong Kong nationals on the one hand, and a re-admission agreement on the other, in the knowledge that, I fear, visa exemptions would allow many more illegal immigrants entry to the EU than the re-admission agreement could ever send back to their country?
Could I have a precise answer to this question?
Unusually, we are going to give the floor once again to Mr Vitorino.
I would ask you to be brief.
I shall give a very brief answer to Mr Berthu. The agreements were certainly not signed at the same time.
The decision on the list of visas was taken two years ago.
The decision relating to the re-admission agreement has just been signed today.
Furthermore, statistics show that the number of illegal immigrants originating from Hong Kong is really very minimal in all the Member States.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 am.
The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0510/2002).
Three reminders: firstly, the time has been reduced to one hour; secondly, we are running 25 minutes late and thirdly, the representative of the Council must leave the Chamber at 7.10 p.m.
That is our limit.
All questions which there is no time to answer, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, will be replied to in writing.
As you will understand, it is beyond my personal capacities to resolve this problem in any other way.
We will therefore begin the Questions without wasting any more time.
Question No 1 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0724/02):
Subject: Charter of Fundamental Rights: signs at the railway station in Bayonne (Basque Country, France)
The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, solemnly proclaimed at Nice in December 2000, stipulates, inter alia, that 'the Union shall respect cultural, religious and linguistic diversity' (Article 22) and that 'any discrimination based on any ground such as? language? [and] membership of a national minority? shall be prohibited' (Article 21(1)).
However, on 14 October the French Government detained a number of people in the city of Bayonne, in the northern Basque Country, for erecting a sign at the railway station in the Basque language, Euskara. The sign read BAIONAKO GELTOKIA, which simply means Bayonne railway station.
In the Council's view, is the French Government complying with the stipulations of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in suppressing the use of a language, especially in its place of origin, where its use predates that of French?
Does it not believe that the French Government itself should see to it that Basque citizens are provided with all public signs in their vernacular language so as to prevent them from suffering discrimination on grounds of language or membership of a national minority?
Mr President, thank you for drawing attention to what this question is about. I frequently have a bad conscience about answering questions that no one has heard.
As you mentioned, however, it is about the fact that French authorities have removed a sign in the Basque language which points the way to a railway station.
And the question is: does this not contravene the Charter of Fundamental Rights?
The answer is that the Charter addresses the EU authorities and the national authorities when they administer EU policy.
Consequently, I am forced to answer 'no'.
Whatever may be thought about this language dispute, this case will never become relevant to the EU's Charter of Fundamental Human Rights because the Charter is aimed at the EU and at the Member States when administering EU policy, and as we are aware, the EU has no policy on railway signage.
On 28 October, the Council of State of the French Republic approved a resolution declaring illegal the integration into the French public network of Diwan schools, which teach the Breton language, another autochthonous European language, like Basque, Catalan and also Alsatian, which originates from this very city of Strasbourg.
Does the Presidency-in-Office of the Council not believe that, in order to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was so pompously proclaimed in Nice by President Chirac and the former President of the European Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, the French Government should legally guarantee public access to the learning of these other native European languages within their respective territory?
This is an issue, Mr President, which is included in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights, which states that linguistic diversity and all cultures will be defended.
And this is not only an inter-State objective, but also a European Community objective.
Mr President, that was precisely what I was trying to say.
I have the greatest sympathy for regional languages.
I believe that they have a future and I believe that we will become more aware of them, but in this connection I am forced to say that, where the Charter talks about the Union respecting cultural, religious and linguistic diversity etc., it is talking about the Union's policies and not about the Member States' policies.
Question No 2 by Manuel Medina Ortega (H-0726/02):
Subject: Expulsions in Northern Cyprus
What action will the Council take in connection with the expulsion from Northern Cyprus of 16 Spanish citizens, including 10 journalists and two university professors, after they had held meetings with trade unionists, non-governmental organisations, journalists and television broadcasters?
Bearing in mind that the authorities in Northern Cyprus are dependent on Turkey, what consequences might such measures have for Turkey's application for membership of the European Union?
The Council was asked what measures the Council would take after 16 Spaniards were expelled from the northern part of Cyprus.
I can answer that the Council has not been informed of the event in question.
The Council, which met on 24 and 25 October, was pleased to see the significant steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the political criteria from Copenhagen.
And the Council established that the country has made progress with regard to the economic criteria and adaptation to current Community law.
The Copenhagen European Council on Friday once again called upon Turkey energetically to continue its process of reform and urged Turkey to take further practical steps.
As part of the accession partnership Turkey has undertaken fully to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem.
After the Secretary-General submitted his plan for a solution, the Council noted a declaration by the Danish Presidency in which the Presidency confirmed that the EU was willing to adapt to the terms of an overall UN solution in accordance with the principles on which the European Union is based.
On Friday, it was confirmed that the Council is willing to adapt the accession treaty to these terms, and the European Council expressed its pleasure that the Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had agreed to continue negotiations with a view to arriving at an overall solution by 28 February 2003.
I agree with the opinions expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council.
Of course, I completely disagree with the view of Mr Giscard d'Estaing that Turkey's entry should be conditional upon certain racist requirements; but what is clear is that we MEPs have an obligation to communicate to the Community institutions any cases in which a candidate country is not complying with the conditions demanded of it.
Bearing in mind that Turkey's candidature still has a long way to go, does the President-in-Office of the Council not believe that the Turkish Government should be made aware of these facts in order to demonstrate to it, in a specific manner, that this type of measure - the expulsion of journalists carrying out their work - is not compatible with membership of the European Union?
Specifically, does the Council have any type of mechanism for informing the Turkish Government of these cases, in order to prevent any repetition of these incidents, and in order to demonstrate to them in a practical way what the democratic functioning of the European institutions consists of?
As I have said, I cannot comment on the specific case, but I would like to remind you of what Mr Verheugen said in very strong terms on Friday evening shortly before midnight at the press conference and which he has repeated in even stronger terms today in this House, namely that Turkey will be assessed according to the same strict standards as the ten countries that have just been accepted, that the Commission will carry out its work zealously and meticulously, and that torture in prisons, political prisoners and the theoretical existence of what Mr Medina has spoken of are naturally unthinkable in a country which is to start negotiations for accession to the European Union.
The issue of the integration of third-country nationals is one of the priorities of the programme of work of the Danish Presidency.
Its importance and the need to prompt and encourage integration were recognised and underlined by the Council in the conclusions adopted on 14 - 15 October.
As a follow-up to those conclusions, the Presidency called upon the Member States to establish national contact points for integration by the end of this year, and all the Member States have accepted this.
Using these contact points, we will exchange best practice and learn from each other's successes and fiascos.
I would add that a major conference on integration was held in Copenhagen in July, which also provided opportunity for such exchange of experience and best practice.
The relevant bodies of the Council have considered various proposals for Council directives, which the Commission has submitted with a view to implementing the Tampere conclusions in respect of the entry and residence of third-country nationals.
These legislative instruments are aimed at creating a legal framework of rights and obligations at Community level for third-country nationals wishing to enter and reside in the territory of other Member States.
The aim is naturally that, as far as possible, they be treated in the same way and be subject to the same conditions as EU citizens are when travelling from one country to another.
This will contribute to integration but, as I said during the debate that we have just concluded, it is not that easy to reach agreement concerning these conditions.
There is no doubt as to the aim, however.
When I tabled this question two months ago I did not know that, coincidentally, there would be a debate this afternoon on immigration and asylum.
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that reply.
I do not underestimate the importance of the exchange of best practice on national integration policies and I pay tribute to the measures put in place in Denmark under his stewardship.
However, we still do not have this directive.
What kind of timetable is there to get this directive agreed?
It will give the estimated 20 million people who are legally long-term residents in the European Union the legal framework of rights and obligations that will help to integrate them.
Is it not ludicrous to keep calling for mobility of labour to boost economic growth while preventing those 20 million from going to work in another Member State?
They are a rather obvious category of people who might be inclined to do that.
Is there a timetable, is there a target date for getting this directive agreed?
Mr President, I am afraid there is no such target date.
We could easily arrange one if we were prepared to accept a bad directive, but, if we want a good directive, we need more time.
Question No 4 by Jonas SjÃ¶stedt (H-0729/02):
Subject: Common patent system
The Commission's proposal on a common patent system has been the subject of debate and negotiation in Parliament as well as talks between Member States' governments.
Some of the most difficult aspects to agree on have proved to be which languages should be used for the detailed description of an invention and the process of establishing a legal system and common case law.
Concurrently with these negotiations, the London Agreement is being implemented under the European Patent Convention.
For companies which make large numbers of patent applications, the present situation is creating uncertainty as to what rules will apply in the long term.
What is the timetable for the introduction of a common EC patent?
What steps have been taken to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion during the current presidency?
Which aspects of the Commission's proposal are causing most controversy in the negotiations?
Since the Commission tabled its proposal concerning EU patents in August 2000, the Presidency has made a significant effort to promote the work on this proposal.
In recent months, the work has been concentrated on the patent system's court-related aspects.
Its starting point has been a working document submitted by the Commission in August.
Following intensive discussions, the Presidency tried, at the meeting of 14 November, to reach agreement on a number of central principles for the court system as part of an overall compromise, but it was not possible to reach agreement on all the features.
In spite of the lack of progress, the efforts have continued.
At the meeting on 26 November, the Presidency concluded that COREPER should continue its work, giving high priority to the issue of finalising an agreement and so paving the way for a political agreement.
The Presidency also concluded, however, that the Council would do its utmost to reach such an agreement in good time before the European Council's spring summit in 2003.
Against the background of an overall political agreement, the aim is to have the matter of the EC patent finalised and adopted as quickly as possible.
The most important issues in the negotiations are as follows: the role of the national patent authorities; languages; costs and who is to pay these; the distribution of fees; and the whole court system in connection with the patent.
It may sound simple, but it is in fact fiendishly complicated, and when I think of how many debates there have been in my own Parliament in Denmark, I can readily imagine the problem that rotating presidencies will have in getting 15 - and soon, in fact, 25 - parliaments to agree on the same rules.
This must happen, however.
It is absolutely crucial, so I want to thank Mr SjÃ¶stedt for his question.
We must get this matter finalised.
I wish to thank the Council of Ministers for its answer.
I also want to express my thanks for the work that has been done in this important area.
My question concerns the remaining problems, as mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council.
These relate partly to the court system and partly to a number of other areas, for example the languages in which the work is to be done.
Are there proposals for solutions or progress in other areas - over and above that of the court system - on which the Council has worked, areas in which we now see that progress has taken place in the negotiations in the Council of Ministers?
I think it has to be said that this issue is all of a piece and that agreement on one point also requires agreement on the other points, for everything is of course interrelated.
I am not in a position to say whether one of the subjects might be more difficult than others, but I can in any case imagine that the issue of expenses is something that has a role to play.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together: Question No 5 by Camilo Nogueira RomÃ¡n (H-0731/02):
Subject: The proposals made by the Chairman of the Convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, concerning the name of the European Union
The Chairman of the Convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, is making the surprising proposal that the universally accepted name of the European Union be changed, e.g. to United Europe or United States of Europe.
Was this amongst the issues agreed on by the Laeken European Council when drawing up guidelines for the constitutional reform of the Treaties?
Has the European Council made any suggestion of this kind to the Chairman of the Convention?
Question No 6 by Hans-Peter Martin (H-0768/02):
Subject: European Constitution
On 28 October 2002, the chairman of the EU Convention, ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, presented the first outline of a future European Constitution, which provides for a Congress of the peoples of Europe.
What view does the Danish Presidency take of this?
Is it not a baffling suggestion that the significance and role of the European Parliament should be reduced by a Constitution based on this draft?
Does the Presidency of the Council agree that a Constitution along the proposed lines would be a clear expression of a new intergovernmentalism?
The Council is carefully following the work of the Convention and is of course aware of the structure for a constitution, presented by Mr Giscard d'Estaing in October.
As is well known, it will be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference that will adopt a final position on the issues raised by the two MEPs.
It is rather difficult for me here and now to predict what the Intergovernmental Conference will say.
I also believe that, as matters develop, the Convention will go a very long way towards finding a solution acceptable to all the governments.
That solution will, on the other hand, be less ambitious than some might have wished. I believe, however, that it will be viable and also be able to survive an Intergovernmental Conference.
Mr President, I wish first of all to express my surprise at the question asked by the President-in-Office of the Council.
I personally feel, as I am sure do all the Members of this Parliament, that an enlarged Europe will be a political Europe, with more democratic institutions and a Constitution, a fairer Europe, with greater internal solidarity, a Europe which takes its place in the world as a power, a force, a Europe of peace and solidarity, a Europe that improves the European Union, contributing to the historic unification of the continent, but not a Union that is institutionally different or new.
Its name must be the European Union then, a name that is furthermore clearly pleasing to the ear and appropriate.
With this in mind, I would ask, what then is the meaning of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposal - which the President has just implicitly accepted - that the European Union's name might be changed?
Is this a desire on his part to play a leading role; vanity?
Could this be a sign that the Chairman of the European Convention is attempting to reduce the Union's political power?
Can you give us a straight answer, Mr President, as to what you really think about this?
The Presidency does not share responsibility for the proposals tabled by Mr Giscard d'Estaing.
He is perfectly entitled to table them, but the Presidency has no comments to make, either on its own, or on the Council's, behalf.
What Denmark, as a nation, thinks is something we shall make known after the New Year when, in common with so many other countries, we shall declare our position, but I do not wish, here today on behalf of the Council, to adopt any kind of position whatsoever on Mr Giscard d'Estaing's proposals.
Mr President, it was not only in this House that we experienced a very active, not to say pro-active, Council Presidency, but that is how it was perceived by the world at large.
Now, inevitably, we are all the more surprised when, at the end of its term, the presidency answers questions relating to the future in such generalised and diplomatic terms that it almost calls to our minds another presidency, also from northern Europe, which was generally evaluated by this House as being far too diplomatic and general in its approach.
Let me, as a Member of this House, call on the Council to make an unambiguous statement as to how the Danish Presidency assesses the Congress of the Peoples of Europe and whether or not the latter is, when it comes down to it, an expression of a new intergovernmentalism.
In any case, Mr Haarder was himself once a Member of this House and can surely understand the extent to which that would reduce Parliament's role.
I shall simply answer your question, Mr Martin.
Does the Council also adopt that line of reasoning etc?
Is that the Council's view?
The Council has no view. Nor should it have, either, for we have left it to the Convention to prepare all these things.
I must not therefore, on behalf of the Council, stand here and evaluate the proposals that are made in the Convention.
I am certain that many here in the Chamber, including Mr Duff, would explode with rage if I did that.
I shall spare him that.
As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together: Question No 7 by Andrew Nicholas Duff (H-0734/02):
Subject: Cyprus
When did the High Representative for the CFSP last visit the island of Cyprus, and when is he next planning to go there?
What contact does Mr Solana have with the authorities in Northern Cyprus?
What is his current assessment of the security situation on the island?
Question No 8 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0746/02):
Subject: Funding for the northern part of Cyprus
At the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002, it was decided, with a view to the implementation of a political settlement in Cyprus, to set up a special programme for the northern part of the island with a total budget of 206 million euro for the three-year period 2004-2006.
Does the Council have specific priority areas which it will take into account when setting up this programme?
Will it make provision for specific control mechanisms in respect of this funding and, if so, how?
In the event that a political settlement between the two sides fails to materialise, will the funding still be made available?
I am able to state that Mr Solana has not visited Cyprus since he took office.
He has had a wide range of contacts with many of the actors involved and has taken every opportunity to call for a constructive solution.
He has expressed support for the efforts made by Kofi Annan and, on 12 November, he expressed satisfaction with Kofi Annan's decision willingly to present a proposal for solving the issue of a united Cyprus.
At the European Council meeting held on 24-25 October, it was decided that a three-year programme should be set out for the period 2004-2006 for the benefit of the northern part of Cyprus and with a view to implementing a political solution.
No practical priorities have yet been set or more specific provisions laid down.
Last Friday, the European Council called upon the Commission to cooperate with the Cypriot Government in considering how economic development might be promoted in Northern Cyprus and how Northern Cyprus might be brought closer to the EU.
In connection with the Council meeting of 19 November, the ministers debated the Cyprus issue over lunch, once the UN Secretary-General had presented his plan for a solution to the situation.
Subsequently, the Presidency presented a President's statement, warmly endorsing the Secretary-General's plans, and noted that the EU is prepared to respect the conditions of an overall solution in accordance with the principles that form the basis of the EU, and this with a view to arriving at a solution that makes it possible for Cyprus to accede to the EU as a united island.
Last Friday, the European Council meeting welcomed the fact that both Greek and Turkish Cypriots had promised to continue the negotiations with a view to reaching an overall solution on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's proposal before 28 February 2003.
In the Council's view, Kofi Annan's proposal constitutes a unique and historic opportunity to put an end now to the conflict that has devastated this beautiful island for far too long.
Mr President, I would like to thank the minister for his reply, but I must say that the fact that Mr Solana is so detached from the process of settlement of the dispute in the island of Cyprus fills me with great disquiet.
Would the minister agree that it is fear for their security that is proving the principle obstacle to Turkish Cypriot compliance with the Annan proposals?
Would he not also agree that peace-keeping on the island will be a central responsibility for the European Union, through the process of settlement and following this process, for a considerable period before tranquillity and stability truly return to that poor strife-torn place.
Mr President, just as I have the greatest respect for the engagement that the honourable Member has shown in the Cyprus issue, I can certainly follow his reasoning.
I must just underline that the Cyprus negotiations take place under the auspices of the UN and not under the auspices of the EU.
There is a perfect relationship between the UN and the EU.
Each knows exactly what the other is doing.
If the UN were to ask the EU, via Mr Solana, to work with it towards a solution, we in the EU would do so immediately.
Mr Solana would go to Cyprus straightaway.
There is, however, a division of labour and I think we should keep it as long as this is the wish of Kofi Annan.
Question No 9 by MarÃ­a Izquierdo Rojo (H-0738/02):
Subject: Repercussions of enlargement on the least-favoured regions
In the light of the most recent Council meetings on the forthcoming EU enlargement and bearing in mind the existing forecasts for agriculture and CAP reform, structural policies, policies on economic and social cohesion and the 'British cheque', can it be deduced that it will be the weakest who will end up paying the bill for enlargement?
Will enlargement have a negative impact on the least-favoured regions?
Enlargement will have no consequences for the regions in the present Member States until 2006, whereupon a decision will have to be made on the policy in relation to all the regions.
At its meeting in October, the European Council concluded that EU expenditure must be such as to ensure that the enlarged Union has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens. The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded.
It was added that multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe, in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council.
In any case, the Community must go on endeavouring to reduce the differences between the various areas' levels of development in accordance with Article 158 of the EC Treaty.
To contribute to this process, the Brussels European Council decided that, with a view to enlargement, all commitment appropriations must be added to the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund to the tune of EUR 23 000 million in the period 2004-2006.
The financial consequences of enlargement were reported on in the Presidency's conclusions arising from last Friday's European Council summit in Copenhagen.
The overall, well-balanced result forms a solid basis for integrating ten new Member States, at the same time as ensuring that the enlarged EU is able to function effectively.
I would therefore refer you to the conclusions of the summit, showing the economic situation throughout the period.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the reality is that, after 2006, the least-favoured parts of the European Union will have increased, there will be more of them and they will have been enlarged for the worse.
Please tell me which agreement or conclusion speaks of equity or redistribution.
In the Brussels agreements and in the Franco-German pact which led to them, the only thing that can be deduced is that the cost of enlargement is not going to be paid by the largest or the most powerful countries.
Copenhagen speaks exclusively of limitations.
Enlargement is very good, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, but the numbers do not add up.
It is unacceptable that most of the cost of enlargement is expected to be paid by those whose income is below the Community average.
The financial framework decided in Berlin is clearly insufficient to deal with the costs of enlargement and the greater economic and social cohesion needs.
Please give me a full answer, as is the Council's responsibility, and tell me who is going to pay this bill between 2006 and 2013.
I am able to reply neither fully nor otherwise, because enlargement will have no consequences for the regions before 2006, and that is precisely of course because a proper amount of time will be needed to adjust this policy to the new situation that will arise following enlargement.
I am also able to refer to paragraph 11 of the President's conclusions stating that EU expenditure must continue to respect both the imperative of budgetary discipline and efficient expenditure and the need to ensure that the enlarged EU has sufficient resources at its disposal to ensure the orderly development of its policies for the benefit of all its citizens.
Moreover, paragraph 12 reads: 'The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded; multifunctional agriculture will be maintained in all areas of Europe, in accordance with the conclusions of the 1997 Luxembourg European Council and the 1999 Berlin European Council.'
I cannot be more precise at the present time, but I think that a framework has in this way been set that should reassure the honourable Member, for there is of course no question of any sort of revolution.
There is no question of a huge amount of money being transferred from the one part of Europe to the other, so I would say, rest assured, there will be enough time to sort things out after 2006.
As the author is not present, Questions Nos 10 and 11 lapse.
Question No 12 by Bill Newton Dunn (H-0745/02):
Subject: EU-US 'secret agreement' on criminal matters
When will the European Parliament, and the Member States' parliaments, be consulted about the arrangements which are currently being negotiated secretly?
These arrangements were due to be debated in depth for the first time at Copenhagen on 13 September at the Informal Meeting between EU Justice and Home Affairs ministers with Mr John Ashcroft, US Attorney General. These subjects would include the death penalty, extradition, the creation of joint investigative teams, and 'a common approach to searches, seizures, and interceptions of telecommunications'.
There is really no secret about the fact that negotiations are being conducted between the EU and the United States on cooperation in criminal matters.
The Council took an open decision to embark upon these negotiations on 20 September 2001 and, following the usual relevant procedure, the Council gave the Presidency a precise negotiating mandate on 25 April of this year.
It is on this basis that the Presidency conducted negotiations.
On 28 November 2002, the Council was informed of how far the negotiations concerning a draft had progressed, and due note was taken of this.
The Council agreed upon the strategy to be followed in subsequent negotiations, and I can tell you that the issue will be on the agenda of the General Affairs Council's meeting tomorrow.
In accordance with Article 39, paragraph 2 of the Treaty on European Union, the Presidency intends to inform Parliament of the negotiations concerning this matter once the negotiations have reached an advanced enough stage for such information to make sense. It will do so even though Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union does not oblige the Council to consult Parliament.
With regard to the national parliaments, it is, in accordance with the latter's own rules, the Member States' task to inform or consult them.
That is all I can say at the present time.
Mr President, the fact that negotiations are taking place is no secret: that was why I was able to ask the question - we do not disagree on that - but the problem lies in the content.
It is awfully nice of the Council to tell us that it will inform us afterwards, but we - the only democratic body in the EU - would like to be consulted as it negotiates whether or not it is currently written in the Treaty.
The principle is real exposure.
I have a suspicion that the President-in-Office is personally in favour of transparency.
He should therefore tell us what is really going on.
I would like to wish the President-in-Office a happy Christmas and say thanks to him for being with us over the last six months, because I have a terrible feeling that we will not see him again.
Thank you very much for your kind wishes.
I can assure the honourable Member that, if these contacts with the Americans lead to any sort of legislation or any change in the acquis, all rules will be followed.
It is quite normal for governments to communicate with each other and if they agree on something that involves the parliaments this will be referred to the parliaments.
I could provide the honourable Member with written information on what the subjects are but, as stated in the question, they concern the death penalty and it is clear what the European Union's opinion on that is.
In accordance with the scheduled programme and the time available, we are going to put a final question to Mr Haarder.
Question No 13 by Paul A.A.J.G. Lannoye (H-0749/02):
Subject: Weapons used in Afghanistan
At the sitting of the European Parliament on 9 April 2002, the President-in-Office of the Council said that no weapons or munitions containing depleted uranium had been used in the military operations in Afghanistan in the autumn of 2001.
However, it is clear that guided bombs made of very high density metal were used to destroy Taliban command centres.
If this high density metal is not uranium, what is it?
As far as the Council knows, there is no ammunition of the type referred to in the question and produced in Europe that contains depleted uranium.
Various types of special steel and/or tungsten including wolfram are used for remote-controlled missiles, but not depleted uranium.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your answer is in line with that given by your predecessor from the Spanish Presidency - I asked the question to which he answered no.
According to information provided by armed troops on duty during the war in Afghanistan last year, depleted uranium munitions or weapons were not used.
All the information - both military and technical - that we have at our disposal, however, points to the fact that, in any case, a very dense metal was used, either uranium or tungsten.
This is not, to any degree, an insignificant question because, if it is uranium, whether depleted or otherwise, certain sites in Afghanistan will have inevitably been badly contaminated, sites where not only military personnel are currently based, but also NGOs, humanitarian organisations and, of course, local people.
It seems to me that you have given a cautious response.
Personally speaking, I am not convinced that you are well informed.
That is why I believe that it would be worthwhile to carry out an inquiry on the ground, in order to verify whether or not the area has been contaminated by radioactivity which may cause considerable harm to the civilian population, NGOs as well as military personnel.
I can only repeat that, as far as the Council knows, no ammunition of the type concerned, containing depleted uranium, is produced in Europe.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in a resolution, the European Parliament called for a framework directive on the safety of nuclear material and on the security of nuclear power stations.
Nuclear safety is a topic of deep concern to us all.
The Commission has now drawn up a proposal in the form of a Green Paper.
Now it is the Council's turn to do something.
There are many different suggestions as to how this directive is to be dealt with in the future.
Do you believe that it is still possible to implement this directive before the new Member States join?
That is unfortunately outside the scope of the question I have made preparations for answering, so I cannot provide any answer.
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 14 to 36 will be replied to in writing.
European Year of Education through Sport 2004
The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading by Mrs Pack (A5-0419/2002), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the European Year of Education through Sport 2004 [9605/2/2002 - C5-0498/2002 - 2001/0244(COD)].
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we used to learn at school: 'Mens sana in corpore sano' - a healthy mind in a healthy body, and we are, in theory, all acquainted with this wisdom from ancient Rome.
Of all leisure activities, sport is the most widespread, with one out of every three Europeans participating in some form of it, some of them, indeed, continuing to do so well into old age.
Physical activity promotes health, and competition in sport develops a range of social skills, such as friendship, team spirit, solidarity, commitment, perseverance and, last but not least, fair play.
As you will all be aware, you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins, but a great one by the way he loses.
Despite sport's essential social role, ladies and gentlemen, there is no policy on it at Community level.
We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already, for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties.
We can therefore unreservedly welcome the way the Commissioner has at last responded to the aspiration expressed in my last report on sport, produced as long ago as 1996, and proclaimed a year of sport.
It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport, but, for many understandable reasons, the 'Year of Education through Sport 2004'.
It is about using a large number of projects to highlight sport's role in informal learning and its educational value, and also the close partnership between school sport and the services provided by the many kinds of sporting organisations that exist in Europe.
To come to the point, the objective and rationale of the 'European Year of Education through Sport 2004' is not to show what people are capable of in the sporting arena - something that we can demonstrate to ourselves to our own satisfaction every day of the year on dozens of television channels - but to show what sport can do in human terms and for people.
There is consensus in this House as regards the Year's seven objectives. It is to promote cooperation between educational institutions and sporting organisations, the development of social skills through sport, voluntary activity, pupils' mobility by means of international competitions, a balance between mental and physical activity, as well as consideration of how the educational needs of young sportsmen and women are to be met.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage.
What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved, the EUR 11.5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do.
If everyone now plays their part - and that includes the media - then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport.
I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round.
By means of this Year, we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation.
What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects.
Research is always in progress, and that is not what this Year is for.
I believe that the only research we need is to ask ourselves, when it is all over, 'what has this Year achieved?' but otherwise not to spend money on it.
The Council shares our view on this.
It has also accepted my idea of organising a European competition in the run-up to the Olympic Games - incorporating it, not into the Treaty, but into a protocol.
I am very happy about this, and I very much hope that the Commission will respond to our concern by announcing a competition culminating in its victors being allowed to be present at the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia in 2004.
That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport.
What, ladies and gentlemen, is all this about?
It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers, institutions of state education and organisations.
We want to kick-start cross-border initiatives and networks, and we have to set up an ideas exchange, enabling exemplary projects and initiatives - that is to say best practices - to be followed by as many as possible during the preparations in 2003 and the actual Year in 2004.
The Community projects instrument will receive 80% support, and those things done at national level alone will receive 50% co-financing.
This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year's European dimension centre-stage.

I think I will leave it at that, but would like to thank the Council and the Commission and express the hope that we will all be able to take the idea of this Year of Education through Sport back to our communities, and that, eventually, the Convention will be astute enough to give sport a legal basis.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make to you, which has to do with the tragic accident to the oil tanker Prestige, which foundered off the coast of Galicia, and the final conclusions newly adopted by the Council in Copenhagen.
I have received from the Commission a proposal, relating to these events, for a regulation instituting specific measures to compensate the Spanish fisheries, shellfish industry and aquaculture affected by the oil spills from the Prestige.
In view of the circumstances of extreme urgency and the grave effects involved, the Council will do everything in its power to ensure that this proposal is adopted without delay and, if possible, during the Council meeting that is currently in progress.
Parliament should deliver the opinion required of it as soon as possible.
The proposal has been agreed with the Committee on Fisheries, and I propose that we should change the agenda in such a way that we can vote on this proposal at midday today.
As there are no objections to this proposal, that is how we shall proceed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I often have had the pleasure of speaking in this House, but I have to say that today is a special occasion and I share with you the feeling that what we are doing here is of great significance.
I would even go so far as to say that it is almost a historic moment for the young people of our countries.
Indeed, you are about to adopt the decision to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport.
This is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport, particularly one focusing on its educational value.
It is also the first time that such a clear message has been sent to our citizens, showing them that the Community institutions will henceforth be concerning themselves with the social and educational potential of sport and its fundamental role in informal education.
It was right that the recognition of this value should take place in the European Parliament, for it is the European Parliament which has been calling for years for more focus on sport.
Within the framework of the European Year, resources, good intentions and imagination will be mobilised throughout an entire year to promote a policy, to promote an approach, to enable civil society to participate.
I am sure that a European Year of Education through Sport can make a decisive contribution to the promotion of the ideals we share, the ideal of sport as having an educational role and as a means of imparting values.
Today, therefore, the decision that you are about to adopt with your vote is good news for the worlds of education and sport.
It is also the formalisation of the astute work carried out together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Our spirit of partnership, our faultless cooperation and our consensus on the text mean that, today, if this were an Olympic competition, we would have to share the gold medal.
All this means that everything is now in order and we can therefore move on and start the practical work, for the discussions have progressed quickly and well.
There has been no need for red cards to be given out, to use a football metaphor, which is clear evidence that our joint effort has been carried out in a spirit of sincere friendship.
Moreover, the European Parliament has played its part fully: our original text has been amended and altered and the result - I am not ashamed to admit - is an improvement on the Commission's text.
Ladies and gentlemen, you emphasised the need to carry through practical measures relating to basic sport.
You placed the emphasis on projects in the field rather than on reports and studies.
You highlighted the need for a partnership between sports organisations and education organisations.
Lastly, you clarified the objectives of our Year of Education through Sport and you pointed out the need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences.
All these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision.
At its last meetings, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport deemed that the Council's common position gave due consideration to Parliament's main concerns, and I believe that is the case.
I have noticed, during my travels throughout Europe and my conversations and meetings how popular this new initiative is already and how high the expectations are of our citizens, in our schools, in sports organisations and public authorities.
I am therefore quite convinced, ladies and gentlemen, that this European Year of Education through Sport will be a great Year.
If, by way of example, we consider the European Year of Languages and the way it developed through the contributions of the citizens, I am sure that, run along the same lines, the European Year of Sport will be even more effective and have an even greater effect on our different societies.
Some days ago, in Vienna, at a conference on the subject of Europe and ethics, President Prodi said: 'Europe ? needs ideas and a soul'.
Our work on the value of sport, on social and educational sport, will help to bring this about.
I am delighted to say that education and sport are at the centre of everyone's daily concerns.
The only thing we have to do, and we will succeed in this, is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies.
On a practical level, I can now tell you that my staff have already been working on the calls for proposals which need to be launched in the coming months.
We are already thinking about a schedule, events and setting up an advisory committee.
I must admit that, as you can see, this vote is not the final whistle marking the end of an impeccably played political game.
Rather, it is the starting pistol.
Of course, Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress made on the European Year.
The Commission does, of course, have a formal obligation to keep Parliament informed, but this will also give me the opportunity to hear your ideas, for you have made such a useful contribution to the initial development of the idea of the Year.
Mr President, I spoke just now of the historic vote on education through sport.
The year 2004, as everyone knows, will be a historic year in many other respects too: enlargement, then the Convention and many other major events.
In this connection, I would like to ask you to reflect on the following questions.
In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens, can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity?
Should we not take notice of the fact that sport has pride of place in the citizens' daily lives?
Is sport not an important part of any citizenship policy?
Mr President, I know that Parliament has started to discuss these questions and that you are already aware of the role played by sport in European integration and in awakening a European spirit in our fellow citizens.
In a similar way, the sporting values that we are going to promote vigorously among the younger generations and citizens of Europe will be the basis for active citizenship in which there is respect for others and respect for the European ideal.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work she has done and to say once again that sport has shown itself to be a very effective tool in education. Both in normal situations and in extreme situations, in marginalized areas, when there is a need for integration, amongst many others.
Furthermore, it is a great tool for educating on issues such as the environment, food, health, teamwork etc. We should take the greatest possible advantage of this.
We must take advantage of the fact that 2004 is the European Year of Education through Sport in order to demonstrate to the Europeans that we in the European Union are also concerned about sport and that we attach much importance, for example - since I do not want to give an interminable list - on the benefits which it brings for health, for the integration of people in our Europe and for the fight against xenophobia.
We must also take advantage of the possible impact of 2004 to demonstrate that it is entirely compatible to work for sport in the 15 Member States - or 25, when enlargement takes place - and also at Community level, at the same time, and that they must not fear that we are going to take over their competences.
What we do want is to fill the vacuum left by subsidiarity so that the Europeans can benefit from the numerous positive aspects of sport.
I therefore ask that we all make an additional effort so that, in the next review of the Treaty on European Union, an article relating to sport may be included, once and for all, so that the Europeans may see that here, in the European Parliament, in the European Commission and in all the European institutions, we care about sport as an essential tool for improving their quality of life.
Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad that sport has been put on the agenda for today without, as is so often the case, having to be deferred until the evening.
I see it as a good start that we are able, today, to discuss it during the day.
I am glad that 2004 will be so fully devoted to sport.
The Olympic Games, the Paralympics, the European Cup in football, to name but a few, will draw the attention of millions of people, filling many of them with enthusiasm, disappointing others, but also prompting people to themselves get involved or step up their involvement.
The European Year of Education through Sport can make use of this public interest in order to highlight the social value of sport.
There is already evidence, provided by numerous studies, of sport's educational value, of its capacity for preventing ill-health and rehabilitating after illness, of the social skills that it imparts to young people and the elderly, and of much else that has already been mentioned.
So I welcome the fact that we will be producing no more new studies, but will be gathering new insights from practical experience of the Year of Sport's extension of activities such as the encouragement of cooperation between schools and sporting organisations.
That is of great importance in bringing the two together and maximising the advantages to both in terms of the mobility of pupils, clubs and officials, and also supporting sport in performing its social functions and discharging its social obligations.
For me, however, it all keeps coming back to the importance of asking what we mean by fair play, which is inseparable from sport.
I believe that racism, doping, and the treatment of sportswomen and sportsmen as commodities have left deep scars on the image of fair play.
In the same way, we should be treating women in sport with a new respect, and doing something about their status in this area too.
That is also underlined by our call for clubs to be involved in the Year of Education through Sport - something not called for in the first proposals.
There are 600 000 sports clubs, with thousands of officials, and they make a very important and essential educational contribution that we can never dispense with.
Ladies and gentlemen, 2003, the Year of People with Disabilities, is almost upon us.
I believe that here too we have to make use of this issue as an early preparation for 2004, asking even now how many opportunities disabled sportswomen and sportsmen have to integrate?
What activities can the sports clubs - all 600 000 and more of them - offer these people?
This is where there is a need for public awareness and also for financial support.
All this underscores our demand for this to be incorporated into the Treaty.
I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on this important report.
Parliament has been pressing us for a European year of sport in previous resolutions, the last of which was in 1997.
Up to now, the European Union has primarily paid attention to professional sport and much less to recreational sport and its cultural, educational and social merits.
As has rightly been said, this is probably and primarily due to the fact that the Treaty still contains no articles giving the European Union explicit powers in this area.
Yet in view of the fact that a third of EU citizens actively participate in sports and that there are more than 600 000 sports clubs, sport is undeniably an important social phenomenon.
Sport is not only important on a social and cultural level but on a financial one as well.
According to estimates, the sector accounts for about 2% of the European Union's total gross domestic product.
Sport is of great significance as a disseminator of positive values such as willpower, courage, tolerance, loyalty and friendship.
In view of its enormous impact, however, sport is also often approached negatively with feelings of chauvinism, racism and violence, and it unfortunately also gets negative publicity as a result of violence, corruption or hooliganism.
In this European Year the spotlight will be on sports education and training for young people, and this is therefore something to be celebrated.
It is also true to say that less and less time and attention is devoted to sports education at school, a trend that urgently needs to be reversed.
This is where sports clubs can play a complementary, supporting role for schools.
It is therefore essential to improve links between clubs and schools.
Sport should primarily be creating a physical and mental balance as well as social integration, and, as we are heading for enlargement in 2004, this is more than important, particularly at a time when intolerance is increasingly raising its ugly head.
Mr President, I commend the rapporteur and welcome this excellent initiative.
Apart from being an important social phenomenon and a way to improve psychological and physical health, sport is also an excellent educational instrument which helps young people acquire important social skills.
That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.
I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme.
It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities.
Nevertheless, I regret that both the Council and the Commission rejected Parliament's amendments providing for the organisation of school competitions which would have allowed winning schools to attend the next Olympic Games in Greece.
That said, however, I welcome the Council's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue.
Mr President, the value of sport as a tool to promote national identity and further integration has long been recognised.
Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers' funds on sporting activities.
In terms of the construction of Europe, the role of sport was formally recognised by the Communities in the Adonino report presented to the Milan European Council in June 1985.
There can be no question that this issue was seen as a major asset, enabling the Communities to foster active engagement of the citizens of Europe in the construction of that project.
Therefore, whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House, the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration.
In other words, this is naked propaganda.
It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games.
Members of this House may think otherwise, but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda.
It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers' money is to be spent on this project.
The sum of EUR 11.5 million may be a small amount in the grander scheme of things, but it is still a lot of money.
There is no justification.
We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda.
Mr President, I feel that the presence in this Chamber, among the many esteemed Members, of a number of people whom we remember as sporting champions of history, immediately makes the meaning of what we wanted to convey in cooperating with Mrs Pack on this report clear.
Our dear friends, Mrs Zabell, Mrs Matikainen-KallstrÃ¶m and Mr Mennea, are in some way an example, evidence of the simple fact that educating people through sport means producing a generation which knows the value of things as well as the price.
Precisely because it understands their value, it is able to display a great passion for social values when it matures, displaying a strength and commitment which are not limited to the quest for results at all costs, and that is why these Members are fully entitled to sit in this Chamber and are worthy representatives of the European Union.
Our intention is to convey this concept and these values in a debate which embraces the education systems too. At the moment, if there is any severe criticism in our report, it is criticism of the European education systems, which are devoting increasingly less time to the playing of sport in schools and under which there are an ever-increasing number of schools with dilapidated sports facilities.
These must receive support and assistance. This is one reason for the rapporteur's concern to approach the matter in a practical way, promoting a practical debate on the educational potential of sport through the staging of the competitions.
In other words, I believe that the European Year of Education through Sport may be the right stimulus to get schools to do something for the European youth of tomorrow, to change the fate of a generation, so that, in the future, we have different young people who not only become champions but, more importantly, become people who see sport as a path to truth, in other words who become champions of humanity, for a champion of humanity can become a sporting champion too.
Mr President, Commissioner, the main effect of sport on those who participate in it is the promotion of physical and mental health, as well as education in tolerance, respect for rules and acceptance of a result by everybody.
These rules are profoundly democratic and promote dialogue and companionship.
In this world where single, absolute and reductionist thinking is dominant, the promotion of the values of sport is the key antidote to intolerance and xenophobia and favours social integration.
Educating through sport means ensuring democratic values for future generations and this must appear in the Treaties.
Mr President, I want to thank my colleague, Mrs Doris Pack, for the valuable work she has done in producing this report.
You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education.
It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you.
It is excellent that the Commission should have begun to organise a Year of Sport.
The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe.
Leaving aside for a moment the benefits of having a regular, wide-ranging hobby and an attitude to life that goes with it, even a little exercise prevents heart and vascular diseases, ailments that affect the organs of locomotion, rheumatic illnesses and mental health problems.
The very fact that exercise is able to prevent mental problems often gets little attention.
Exercise can help keep a nation's major economic problems in check.
An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise.
Seen in this light, the budget of EUR 11.5 million granted for the Year is at least not oversized.
Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished.
Resources to make these afternoon activities possible must be increased considerably, as there is a huge demand for what they can provide.
Afternoon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work.
Afternoon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise.
At the same time, they are doing something meaningful and social problems and exclusion are being prevented.
Why can we not talk of sport as sport?
It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles, as there is not one for sport.
It is better to call things by their own name, both now and in future.
Mr President, I will be very brief, because I know that time is flying by and that you have a very full agenda.
I would like to add my congratulations to those of all the Members who have highlighted Mrs Pack's remarkable work and her vigorous, tenacious endeavours over many years, which have, at last, brought success.
Today one might say, her baby is being taken to church to be baptised.
I would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked.
Although it has not been possible to include in the text Parliament's suggestion that schools competitions could be staged and that winners could be present at the ceremony of the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, I can let you into a secret. My co-workers are already working with the International School Sport Federation to see what can be done to accommodate Parliament's request.
I am fully aware, Mr President, that Parliament does not want an avalanche of studies on the matter.
That is all well and good, provided that it does not turn round afterwards and say that studies would have been useful after all.
While I acknowledge the need for practical work, I still feel that it is necessary for an evaluation to be carried out afterwards, as, moreover, happened in the case of the European Year of Languages, which was such a success that I feel we can use it as a model in terms of what to do and what not to do.
I can let you into another secret. I have already received numerous requests from the major European sports federations, who want to contribute to or participate in the project or to work with us.
They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise.
They will not ask us for money, for they have much more money than we have! The EUR 11.5 million budget is intended to encourage, to set in motion a driving force, for it is civil society, sportspeople and schools which will actually do the practical work.
A number of questions have been asked relating to the European Year of People with Disabilities, on which we are actively working.
The Special World Olympics will take place in summer 2003 in Dublin.
In this context, we will fund the hiring of Irish volunteers to make this major sporting festival for people with disabilities possible.
This is an experiment which will be repeated throughout 2003 and 2004: getting young volunteers - 100, 200, 300 volunteers - from all the countries of Europe to work together in the service of sport during major events of great symbolic importance.
The first experiment, in Dublin, will thus bring together 200 volunteers from all over Europe.
This will be repeated in Athens for both the Olympic Games and the Paralympics, and for all the major sporting events where the voluntary contributions, good will and idealism of our young people can come into their own.
In other words, our young people will take centre stage.
You can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken.
As I promised you, you will be kept informed of developments, and I am also counting on your contribution so that we can make this year the year of all the citizens in your regions and your countries, for, as representatives of the citizens, you have a major role to play in this sense.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m.
The next item is the Commission statement on services of general interest in Europe.
Mr President, the issue of public services is the subject of a major debate in Europe and elsewhere, and the general trend observed during the past 20 years has been a development of the role of the public authority, which no longer produces directly but regulates and establishes the rules for the game.
This is the case in Europe, in particular, where the goal - which was also a necessity - of creating a single market has certainly facilitated this development.
Experience has shown that the creation of a single market based on the system of healthy competition is fully compatible with socioeconomic concerns, of which services of general interest are one of the most practical elements.
Furthermore, a higher level of competition throughout the economy has led to an increase in the effectiveness of services of general interest.
The history of the Community has always been consistent.
At each new stage in European integration, progress has been made towards both freer movement of goods, persons, services and capital and greater inclusiveness and cohesion.
Each step forward in the area of the internal market has gone hand in hand with the introduction of measures to ensure that the weaker regions and citizens are not left lagging behind.
This was the case as regards the Single Act and the case at Maastricht and Amsterdam too.
One example is the inclusion in the Treaty of the policy of economic and social cohesion, of consumer protection and of environment policy, all of which are intended to complement and balance the strategies of opening up the markets and liberalisation.
Article 16 of the Treaty, introduced at Amsterdam, explicitly recognises the role of services of economic general interest.
It confirms the need to find a better way of reconciling harmoniously and coherently the principles relating to services of general interest and the other objectives of the Treaty, particularly the internal market and free competition.
The Commission has always recognised the primordial role of services of general interest.
In its 1996 communication on services of general interest in Europe, it proposed a reference to the promotion of these services.
The sectoral legislation adopted at Community level relating to major network industries, particularly the energy sector, contains extremely ambitious goals as regards high quality public services.
Moreover, the Commission has always applied competition and market rules in such a way as to avoid the supply and development of high quality services of general interest being hindered.
I could mention by way of example the communication on public broadcasting, introducing rules on state aid, which was drawn up by Mr Monti and myself last year and which is an example of the way we can apply competition rules intelligently while giving governments all the leeway they need to organise public services properly.
Services of general interest are thus an essential component of the European model of society.
They contribute to the citizens' quality of life and are an essential condition if the citizens are to be able to exercise many of their rights fully.
In its report to the Laeken Council, the Commission declared its intention, and I quote: 'to examine the suggestion to consolidate and specify the principles on services of general interest underlying Article 16 of the Treaty in a framework directive'
The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper.
There are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach.
Firstly, the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive.
Secondly, given the expectations and existence of very different positions with regard to the feasibility of a framework directive and the added value it would represent, it appeared essential to establish a reference framework first.
We must not underestimate the technical and conceptual problems which would certainly be raised by the establishment of a framework directive either.
The Green Paper will allow the Commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a large-scale debate on the overall issue.
Therefore, the purpose of this Green Paper is not to delay the feasibility study on a framework directive.
Quite the opposite: given the diversity of the traditions, structures and positions existing in the Member States, only a broad European-level debate will be able to draw out enough common ground for an overall Community framework to be established.
In addition, alongside the preparation of the Green Paper, we are working on other dossiers, particularly in the area of the application of rules on state aid and in the field of the evaluation of services.
This work could, moreover, be a useful contribution to the Green Paper.
As regards the timetable, the Green Paper should be adopted in March 2003 and the conclusions drawn before the end of the year.
This, Mr President, is the Commission's statement on this matter.
Mr President, Commissioner Reding's task today is a difficult one, to make a statement on the Commission's behalf on action that the Commission has been putting off for a year.
It is the case that, thirteen months ago, Parliament delivered its opinion on services of general interest by a well-supported vote, with 435 votes being cast in the final vote.
Since then, the Commission has done little.
It has submitted four documents.
The latter two of these, submitted before the Copenhagen Summit, just as the submission of the others six months ago preceded that in Seville, say nothing more than that rulings are awaited from the European Court of Justice.
I do not at all understand, Commissioner, why the Commission does not have its proposals debated here in Parliament, openly and with no holds barred.
If, as in this case, you gaze fixedly at the European Court of Justice in the same way that a rabbit gazes fixedly at a snake, you are not acting as if all options were available to you.
Although, Commissioner, you are affected by this only tangentially, this being primarily a matter for the Competition Commissioner, it is for this reason that I really do want to insist with some emphasis that the Commission should not just hand out 'non-papers' that it sends to governments - the last was on 12 November this year - but should involve Parliament in this debate.
We are not prepared to take the rap for whatever decisions the Commission comes up with if Parliament cannot be properly involved in the legislative process.
So let me say quite bluntly that, as you have already mentioned, we called for a framework directive.
We called for a framework directive on the basis of Article 95, which deals with the internal market.
That means that this public debate on the basis of Article 95 leads to a decision by Parliament and the Council by way of the codecision procedure.
What has been submitted to us so far says only that previous procedure in competition policy was being followed, in other words, that a decision by the Council would be sufficient, that Parliament would be informed and should then see what happens next.
It is exactly as you have said: the topic will give rise to a great debate on social and economic policy.
Far from being something that the Commission can sort out with the Council behind closed doors, that must be done in public view, here in the directly-elected Parliament.
The reason why I make these somewhat pointed observations is that these issues are dealt with in none of these documents, which are numerous and of varying quality, the non-paper being far and away the best of those that have been submitted.
The evaluation methodology set out in the summer was put together so carelessly, and was of such poor quality, that it cannot serve as a basis on which to raise proper awareness.
I call on the Commission to stop biding its time and do the business at long last!
The European Court of Justice's ruling in the Ferring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services.
I call upon you to be prompt in submitting decisions based on it and to delay no longer.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would naturally like to thank the Commissioner for her announcement and for the prospect of a Green Paper.
However, I do not often find myself in complete agreement with what Mr Langen has said.
My group is particularly disappointed with the Commission's reluctance to proceed with presenting the European Parliament with a framework directive.
As you yourself said, services of general interest are the cornerstone of our European social model.
I am talking about people's social rights, basic facilities such as water, energy, public transport, communication and healthcare, which are furthermore essential for social cohesion and for the proper functioning of our economies.
My group, and in fact the whole of Parliament, has been pressing for this framework directive for years.
Even the Council is ahead of the Commission, as the Council pressed for this framework directive in Nice and then much more explicitly in Barcelona.
Despite this, the Commission insists on broad consultation first via a Green Paper in the spring of 2003.
I understand that the problems surrounding services of general interest are complex.
I understand the differences in approach between the Member States.
I know that there are public and private players involved, and it is therefore true that there are differences depending on the sector.
However, in the meantime we are constantly being confronted with standpoints concerning the liberalisation of various sectors in the economy without having a framework directive that sets out the general principles.
Let there be no misunderstanding: my group is in favour of the internal market, subject to certain social and ecological adjustments.
However, the market is an instrument, and the market has its limits, and when it comes to people's basic social rights, it is not the rules of the market and competition that should be laying down the rules of play.
The Green Paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the Convention about the role of services of general interest.
We are already holding this discussion at this moment.
We will be completing it in February, and the Commission will not be presenting a Green Paper until March.
I think that the Commission will be missing the boat.
Finally, there is one last reason, one fact that causes me great concern, and that has to do with Mr Langen's comments.
So far the Commission has always assumed that Member States were allowed to finance their services of general interest as a social mandate without this being regarded as illicit state support - and rightly so, in my opinion.
However, the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity.
Recent conclusions by two advocates-general at the European Court of Justice have demonstrated that this principle is no longer above suspicion.
The Commission will now obviously conclude that they cannot give legal security to Member States in the area of the financing of services of general interest.
So what has happened to this much-vaunted autonomy to organise their own public services?
Ladies and gentlemen, the conclusion is clear to us.
Firstly, we will immediately ask the Commission to issue a framework directive, as we have repeatedly done.
Secondly, the Convention must provide the opportunity to establish the basic principles of public services with complete respect for the powers of the Member States.
Thirdly, our constitution must clearly specify that services of general interest are our people's social rights and must not be left to market rules and competition.
I hope that the Commission can support us in our ambitions.
Mr President, I was going to say on behalf of my group that we are pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming, but perhaps I am in the minority in saying that I am pleased to see that a Green Paper is forthcoming in the sense that something is actually happening.
The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed, but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing.
In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later.
Process can be important, and we must get that right.
I would like to make two points on behalf of my group, the first relating to competition.
Competition is excellent - we agree with the internal market - in that it is a way of raising standards generally and can also be a way of raising standards in the services concerned, but not for its own sake.
Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU - Switzerland - in terms of energy policy.
Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision, presently provided by their local cantons.
Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards - it might just prove confusing.
That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland.
We, on the other hand, are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across Europe.
The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision.
This guarantees social cohesion across Europe.
Taking my own constituency, for instance, and the current issue of broadband, letters are flooding into my office from constituents in rural areas who complain that broadband is available in certain cities, but not for them.
Such matters have to be resolved so that we can provide the same level of service to all our citizens and therefore guarantee the social cohesion which is so important to Europe.
It is ridiculous that the Convention and its working groups are currently discussing these issues.
These matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of Europe.
So it is good that something is actually happening, it is good that there has been a statement, but let us get on with it.
Mr President, I welcome the fact that we are debating services of general interest once again, on the occasion of the Commission's statement.
I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration, or rather that they ought to be.
Although their place and role in the Union are indeed recognised, in principle, in Article 16 of the Treaty, they are still subject to competition rules, with all the ensuing consequences.
There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors.
The Brussels European Summit, last March, was a decisive moment in this sense, moreover.
Energy, transport, a new era for the postal services sector: the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services.
This is not true, as we can see from numerous examples.
I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion.
They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price.
However, the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions.
The citizens' needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries.
The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity, particularly in view of enlargement.
The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed.
That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services.
In this connection, the European Union has a particular responsibility.
It must, first of all, allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes, country by country.
Despite calls from the European Parliament on a number of occasions, this evaluation of the consequences for safety, the environment, quality and social concerns has never been carried out.
Why?
I too believe that we cannot wait for a Green Paper to be drawn up in a few months' time to address this issue, however useful a Green Paper might be.
Although a Green Paper might serve some purpose, I feel that services of general interest should no longer be seen as an exception to competition as they have been hitherto but, quite the opposite, that they must be seen as one of the European Union's priority responsibilities. They must therefore no longer be subject to competition.
Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference.
We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty.
It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens, of the trade unions, which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services.
These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress, a more democratic Europe.
That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service.
We must be ambitious for social Europe.
We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship.
Commissioner, I am quite surprised to hear you say that it has been proven for 20 years that the single market governed by competition law is perfectly - as you said - compatible with social objectives.
I have already heard more sense from the Commission, when it started to express a doubt precisely as to this ability of competition law to bring about the achievement of all the social and environmental objectives.
I believe that, in actual fact, we, and the Commission, in particular, would find it much easier to make these self-congratulatory statements if we had an evaluation, as my fellow Members have said.
I feel that there is absolutely nothing to be gained in any quarter by underestimating the huge expectations of the European citizens, who are demanding more services, better quality and a higher level of safety.
I believe that, if we were to turn a deaf ear to the doubts being expressed today regarding the continuity and sustainability of these services, particularly since they have been called into question as a result of disasters and particularly since this deterioration is currently evident in a number of public services, we would be severely jeopardising the future of Europe and the result of the decision that its citizens will have to take on the future Constitution.
You have decided to open a broad consultation process on the Green Paper.
It is true that this initiative is very surprising, given its connection with the - extremely problematic - debates that we wish to hold within the Convention with a view to fully enshrining the right to public service in the future European Constitution.
I would therefore like to hear you speak about the organisation of the agendas, for it would appear quite incredible that a debate should be opened on the feasibility or usefulness of a framework directive under the current Treaties, even if the aim of the debate is to achieve the recognition of and basis for a European approach to public services in the future Treaty.
Moreover, as regards the consultation procedure, we have already been sufficiently traumatised by a number of proposals which were clearly going against a whole range of different interests within European society.
I would like the Commission to explain clearly which public method of hearing will be used to enable the different players - users, trade unions, NGOs, local and regional authorities etc. to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper.
Mr President, Commissioner, as regards services of general interest, the Commission is attempting to reconcile two requirements which are, in a number of respects, opposed: the need to guarantee the provision of certain services which the market is considered not to be able to provide efficiently and at affordable prices, and the need to prevent certain services becoming a source of distortion of the market or distortion of competition.
I believe that the Commission's concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second, the distortion of competition.
This is not surprising, because the governments, and, therefore, the Council, are pushing in this direction because of the existence of a clear conflict of interests.
There are key sectors, such as the telecommunications, energy, water, transport, television and media sectors, in which the governments are both referees and players, they have to juggle with a burdensome conflict of interests, they are not regulators and legislators, they themselves are entrepreneurs with large multinational businesses which are sometimes used for political and other ends.
Today, this conflict of interests has yet to be resolved in many European countries.
Indeed, in these sectors, a no-man's-land is being created where, rather than the good of the European consumer and the general interest, the specific interests of companies and of the economic and political potentates associated with them are being pursued.
There are countless cases of the allocation of inappropriate market spaces to such companies.
One example is Deutsche Post, which uses its monopolist's profit in the postal services sector to overcome competition through take-overs too, as happened in the case of DHL International, which Deutsche Post acquired, exploiting its monopolist's profit to knock a competitor out of the market. Not to mention EDF: France agreed to work towards opening up its energy sector within the country, in the sure knowledge that EDF, which was 100% state-owned and not quoted on the Stock Exchange and which could give loans guaranteed by the state, would acquire companies abroad, in Italy and elsewhere, in other words that it would go shopping, consolidating a dominant position in the European market.
Then, in Italy, there is the case of a major television company such as the RAI, financed with huge sums of taxpayers' money, which competes in every way with other television companies as a commercial channel.
This is the situation: there are public services which ultimately create state companies that distort competition.
When the states have freed themselves from all the companies, it might be easier to imagine a regulatory state, a state which contracts out or puts out to tender services which it considers that the market alone cannot provide adequately.
I would like to make one last point, Mr President, Commissioner. There is a service, the mobile telephone service, which the Commission does not deem to be a service of general interest.
I feel that this is a serious mistake and that, now, the mobile telephone service is to all intents and purposes a service of general interest.
Indeed, it is one of the services which is provided most effectively throughout Europe, extremely efficiently and with optimum prices, and it is a service of general interest which the market provides through a system of competition.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies, gentlemen, and our erstwhile lady colleague, I believe that any framework directive or Green Paper should take into account our previous experience with services of general interest.
That being so, I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear.
If we were actually to manage to at last make some progress with the legislation on local public transport, we would have done a substantial chunk of Parliament's and the Council's work.
Here, for once, I would like to give the Commission credit for submitting a very specific proposal for a regulation on local public transport as long ago as 2000. We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001.
And what is the Council doing?
It has shoved the draft in a drawer, done nothing with it, and still does not want to do anything with it.
I believe that we have to make it clear to the Council that we will not put up with further delays on matters as fundamental as the right range of services provided to people in towns and in the regions, but may well have to consider bringing proceedings against the Council in respect of its failure to act.
Why, ladies and gentlemen, is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important? The law on the situation we are in is unclear.
We have the option of awaiting rulings from the ECJ, but we want the decisions on what public transport systems should be like to be taken politically, and so we, the towns, the communities and private enterprise, need legal certainty as to how local public transport is to be organised.
The second point I want to address is as follows. I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here.
Services of general interest and competition are not mutually exclusive, but are, in my view, mutually complementary, something that we see particularly clearly in local public transport.
If, in the exercise of its responsibilities for public services, the city or the region makes the right decision and defines what is required of local public transport - its accessibility to disabled people, the timetables, the intervals between services and the fares; you can add all the social factors you want - then, Mr President, it must be put out to tender, and then the best offer must be accepted, whether it be from the public or private sector.
It is competition that decides, and the public that benefits.
Mr President, I am deeply disappointed by the Commission's statement here today.
We have had more lip service to the principle of services of general interest.
We were told that the Commission was going to produce a framework for services of general interest before the end of this year, now we get a promise of a Green Paper.
We urgently need the framework directive, not a Green Paper.
We urgently need a change in competition law which enables services of general interest, public services, to survive and to prosper, and we need a clause in our new constitution which guarantees public services right across Europe.
Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union.
I would argue that, having taken a major step this week towards the political and geographical unity of Europe, if we are to create European citizens, we must have services of general interest universally available, accessible, affordable and of high quality.
Properly understood, services of general interest are for all citizens, not just for those who are excluded, or poor or indeed disadvantaged - though obviously they are of key importance to people in that situation.
Services of general interest support and sustain growth.
They sustain environmental sustainability.
They are a key component of any serious spatial strategy which will enable us to have sustainable rural communities and indeed liveable cities.
They will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness.
They will enable citizens to commute and to communicate.
They will enable citizens to be well-informed, to be well-educated, not only in terms of technological education, but also politically literate.
All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, far too late though it is, I of course welcome the Commission's statement of its intention to submit a Green Paper on services of general interest in the first quarter of 2003.
It does, however, strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later.
Analyses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together.
Having been called upon to do so by the Barcelona Council in March 2002, the Commission, in June of that year, adopted a new methodology for evaluating the quality of public services.
You will be well aware that opinions on this are sharply divided, and I am telling you now that, in terms of its quality, this new evaluation methodology is an unmitigated disaster.
In view of the invariable tendency of the debate on public services to bring forth ritual repetitions about deregulation and privatisation, it would at least be proper to conduct, in parallel with the Green Paper, a scientifically sound analysis of the situation in those markets and enterprises that have already been deregulated and privatised.
There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved.
The questions that demand answers are, firstly, whether equal rights of access are guaranteed to all citizens of the European Union, irrespective of where they live or of their levels of income.
Secondly: has the cost of the service increased or fallen?
Thirdly: has its quality improved or got worse?
And fourthly: have the service's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions?
This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures.
There is nothing fair about the competition if the regulations on aid put enterprises with a larger than 25 % public stake in them at a disadvantage over against their private-sector counterparts.
So 'yes' to competition on the basis of the best services, and 'no' to competition on the basis of ownership!
Mr President, Commissioner, I expect your morning could have been more pleasant.
What is more, you have the task of representing the Commission and your colleagues who are directly responsible for the matter, who have delegated this task to you.
However, that is part of the job!
I am not going to talk about the content, for my fellow Members have already amply expressed what are my views too.
I have familiarised myself with the most recent Commission document, a concise text which was produced a few days ago.
It points out, in particular, that the first general document on the subject produced by the Commission dates back to 1996.
Six years on, the Commission has announced a Green Paper.
I do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave.
You have timetabling problems which have already been pointed out by many people: you have problems scheduling your work to fit in with the Convention, you have scheduling problems with regard to the implementation of sectoral directives and you certainly have scheduling problems - as Mrs Ainardi mentioned - where enlargement is concerned.
In any case, I believe that there is no point, ladies and gentlemen, in continuing to ask the Commission to produce documents.
I am being mildly provocative in saying this: the Commission is divided.
There is clearly no political leadership, which is disturbing considering that the Commission has sole right of initiative.
I feel that we Members of Parliament must now shoulder our responsibilities within the Convention.
A number of contributions have already been submitted on the subject of services of general interest and the reconciliation thereof with competition law.
In its first contribution to the Convention, in May, the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest.
Page 6 of the document even states that, without this, any changes will actually be to the detriment of the European model of society and the values recognised by the European democracies.
The Commission is therefore both aware of the problem and incapable of taking political decisions.
We who are members of the Convention or Members of the European Parliament must turn to our national governments and, within the Convention, we must fight to ensure that the future European Constitution genuinely contains legal provisions providing a framework for competition law.
Mr President, in December 2000, the Nice Council called upon the Commission to consider, and I quote: 'in close cooperation with the Member States, ways of ensuring greater predictability and increased legal certainty in the application of competition rules relating to services of general interest'.
In simpler terms, that meant that there had to be an end to the inconsistencies arising from unclear case law and the Commission's never-ending attempts to use its competences in the field of competition to meddle with the definition and functioning of services of general interest.
Two years on, after a report from the Laeken Council and a call from the Barcelona Council for work to begin on a framework directive, we are still at more or less the same point, and the Commission's only proposal is to put off resolution of the issue once again and draw up a Green Paper which will lead to a huge consultation process.
This is extremely disappointing.
Although the solution is simple, clearly, the Member States still have to impose it.
The Treaty must state clearly that, firstly, the Union recognises the freedom of administration of the States and their authorities, which includes their right to define and organise their public services, and, secondly, that the funding offsetting the additional costs of successfully providing services of general interest is not to be deemed state aid.
Similarly, there must be an end to the inconsistent behaviour of the Commission at international level.
The negotiations taking place in the WTO on a future General Agreement on Trade in Services - GATS - are currently in serious danger of going off course, drifting away from the liberalisation of private services and becoming an indirect debate on the shortcomings of public services.
These discussions are being led by the Commission with a complete lack of transparency and without a clear democratic mandate for the parties to agree on after a broad public debate.
Moreover, this situation is strangely reminiscent of what is happening in the field of agriculture as regards the application of the so-called Doha decisions, which have not been democratically ratified by anyone.
As regards all these points, Mr President, the Member States meeting at the Council must take things in hand without delay.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication bears the words 'status of work on the examination of a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest', a phrase which I feel is something of a provocation.
We do not need an examination of the need for a framework directive; rather, what we need is for the Commission to present a framework directive, in accordance with Parliament's long-standing request that it should do so.
If examination is what you want, you should read the Langen Report, the thirty-five pages of which will give you a detailed explanation of why we need a framework directive of this sort.
We therefore demand that the procedure be speeded up and that Parliament's resolutions be acted upon.
Commissioner, there is such a thing as the Lisbon process, which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective.
In my view, services of general interest serve that social cohesion.
A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job.
They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism, and, as a rule, they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector.
