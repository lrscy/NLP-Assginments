Redefinition of controlled and conditional cooperation must not be a pretext for mollycoddling but for settling down and developing a sense of responsibility.
This new cooperation will restore hope to young people in these countries so that they do not end up as illegal immigrants washed up on the shores of a Europe that is already overwhelmed by unemployment.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, regarding the vote on the issue of paediatric medicines, I should just like to point out that, after the six-month patent extension granted to the multinational drug companies at first reading, I feel that extending the transition period during which that additional protection certificate can be applied for from two years to five years is really going too far.
That is why I voted against AmendmentÂ 18, and also because the benefits to the paediatric population cannot be scientifically documented.
In addition, accepting that amendment might encourage research into paediatric indications for medicines produced for adult use, precisely going against one of the aims of the regulation.
Â Â  . The Commissionâs proposal will plug a gap in public health, which has long existed in the EU and which has, in some cases, led to dependence on the US or Asian pharmaceutical industry.
The creation of specific medicines for children, rather than the usual reduced dose, will be better suited to their metabolism and will provide faster and more effective treatment.
Along with the obligation to offer a ârisk management systemâ for such medicines prior to their introduction on the market, an extremely important measure has been created that will eliminate, or at least reduce, the risks and deliver effective treatment for a group as vulnerable as the paediatric population.
The rapporteur has attached due importance to carrying out research into ensuring that such medicines can be used by children without hindering the development of those medicines for adults.
It will also, in some cases, facilitate a deferral request regarding the submission of the âpaediatric investigation planâ, without delaying the placing on the market of the adult version.
I endorse the Commissionâs proposal and the GrossetÃªte report.
Â Â  Thanks to the adoption of this recommendation concerning paediatric medicines and the agreement between Parliament and the Council, henceforth children will be able to benefit from medicines appropriate for their specific metabolism rather than having to be prescribed weak doses of medicines intended for adults.
I believe that here we have tried to combine all the conditions necessary for the intelligent introduction, in Europe, of pharmaceutical forms specifically for children: provisions concerning support for innovation and research incentives for laboratories (notably with six monthsâ additional protection for the protection certificate), the establishment of an inventory of therapeutic needs specifically in paediatrics, the requirement to develop a paediatric form for new medicines, measures intended to ensure that medicinal products, once developed, are distributed throughout the Member States, or else special derogations to ensure that the development of paediatric products nonetheless does not hamper the development of medicinal products intended for adults.
We have here a concrete example of the added value of a Community regulation: a single Member State would never have had the means on its own to promote such a policy in relation to specific medicinal products.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the GrossetÃªte report on medicinal products for paediatric use, at second reading, because I feel that, in light of the specific nature of the childâs metabolism, medicines developed specifically for children should be promoted.
The setting up of a paediatric committee as part of the European Medicines Agency will help monitor scientific research in this area.
It will seek to limit the number of scientific tests carried out to the minimum required.
Â Â  In keeping with its response to this matter at first reading, the June List is voting against the report for reasons of principle.
We are completely in favour of women and men being treated equally in employment.
This is a crucial area, which international organisations such as the ILO are good at dealing with.
We do not believe that the EU should regulate issues of this type in far-reaching reports resembling political programmes.
The EU should not have control over working time regulations, parental leave and other significant national issues.
These are matters that the Member States are better dealing with independently and in accordance with international agreements already adopted.
Â Â  .When we know that in comparable employment a woman earns 11% less than a man, there can be no doubt that we have still to increase awareness of the effort that each of us needs to make in order not to establish parity and egalitarianism between men and women by force, which would be ridiculous, but to reach a state of justice and social balance.
Advances in this area will not be achieved by means of a frenzy of feminism or by means of coercive measures which seek to forcibly impose the presence of women, whether it be in representative bodies or in management, far too often, as we very well know, without regard for their competence or quality.
Let us show some intelligence by ensuring the promotion of women in society, particularly by allowing them to have a real choice between professional life and family life and allowing them also to be able to reconcile the demands of work and children.
Nowadays, unfortunately, far too many women have no chance of this.
Â Â  . On issues relating to the labour market, I strongly condemn the glaring inequalities between men and women in a number of areas such as pay, access to employment, vocational training, working conditions and career development.
I voted in favour of this report because it represents a step forward in implementing the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation.
A further reason for my support for the report is that more initiatives need to be adopted to help people achieve a better balance between work and private life.
The act of bringing together in one sole document the various initiatives on equal treatment will serve to simplify the existing legal framework.
Furthermore, the level of protection will be stepped up in that the development of the case-law of the European Court of Justice will become incorporated.
I regret, however, that in spite of the fact that equal treatment is enshrined in the EU Treaty and in various directives, it remains an unfulfilled dream, no more than a vague political principle with a level of implementation that leaves a great deal to be desired.
Â Â  Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and I am happy with its contents.
However, one aspect of intercultural dialogue should be underlined: in many cases we refer to ourselves as âEuropeâ and âEuropeansâ, forgetting the fact that a huge part of eastern Europe, including the largest European nation â Russia â is not a Member State of the European Union.
We share the same European culture and heritage, but we hardly know each otherâs contemporary art and culture.
There are mass media broadcasts, false images and bad clichÃ©s about the everyday life of those countries.
We should use the possibility of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue to get a true picture of the rich culture of Russia and Ukraine, as well as that of the former Yugoslav Republics.
Inviting young artists, students and journalists and encouraging cultural exchange between Member States and the eastern European nations will strengthen our common European identity.
Â Â  Mr President, in the same way as most of you, I too have been deeply shocked by the number of racially motivated murders that have taken place in some European countries recently.
These were examples of the most blatant and horrific manifestation of racism and xenophobia.
There are, however, other forms which are not so visible and yet which harm greater numbers of people.
I would like to believe that the actions planned in support of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and above all intercultural dialogue itself, will manage to subdue the nationalistic mood right across the Union.
I consider 2008 to be the right time for this, in view of the fact that by then the European Union will have increased to 27 Member States.
It is, however, necessary to create initiatives based on the sort of practical and sustainable projects that will continue even after 2008.
For these reasons I regard the report we have just adopted as a step in the right direction.
Â Â  Mr President, my group colleague MrÂ Dillen will shortly be drawing your attention to a German study in the which shows a lack of willingness to adapt among many immigrants, a trend that is also reflected in many other polls; according to an Austrian study, for example, no fewer than 45% of Muslims are hostile towards the idea of integration.
Would it not be better, therefore, if official Europe were to send out a different message, which it could do by making 2008 the year of respect for European standards and values?
With the past European capitulation to intimidation following the publication of the Danish cartoons still fresh in peopleâs minds, I hold out little hope, particularly if I remind myself of the opinion poll that was carried out in the United Kingdom for the , which shows that 40% of Muslims in Great Britain are in favour of introducing law
Â Â  Mr President, my colleagues and I have voted against this Hennicot-Schoepges report, because the so-called European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, an initiative that, by the way, is going to set us back EUR 10Â million, is yet another example of how official Europe is blind to the reality actually experienced by the public.
This reality is that Europe accommodates an ever growing number of Muslims who not only refuse to adapt to common European values, but who also want to impose their own world view and their way of life on us.
For example, German public opinion no longer believes in a dialogue with a religion that refuses to accept basic values such as gender equality.
Germans have had enough of honour killings, large-scale violence in schools and burkas on the streets.
A recent opinion poll conducted by the showed that more than 71% of Germans think that Islam is intolerant; 91% of Germans equate Islam with violence against women.
Official Europe would do well to take those signals a little more seriously.
Â Â  We have today voted in favour of the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue.
Cultural exchange is naturally enriching and is important in increasing understanding between people.
There are, however, details of the report about which we are sceptical.
We believe that the designation of a day, week or year for some particular purpose or other is of no practical significance to people.
What such initiatives can perhaps do, however, is in some way to crystallise the objectives towards which our institutionsâ efforts are directed.
As always, we are sceptical about centrally devised campaigns and opinion-forming and note that the report tightens up the Commissionâs proposals in this regard.
A ânoâ vote would mean more money for the EUâs institutions and for PR campaigns.
Â Â  The June List believes that the whole idea of a European Year of this or that is unnecessary and not something that EU taxpayers should fund.
To invest EURÂ 10Â million in a European Year of Intercultural Dialogue would be quite reprehensible, and it is difficult and perhaps downright impossible to see what would be the point of doing so.
Incredible though it may seem, the European Parliamentâs Committee on Culture and Education wishes to increase the EUâs share of the subsidies for national events and initiatives of this type from 50% to 80% (AmendmentÂ 33).
I am voting against the report as a whole.
Â Â  .How can one have a cultural exchange with another if one does not know who one is?
You recognise that âreligious identity is an essential part of the identity for all of us, even those who are not religiousâ, but you refused to recognise our Christian roots in your Constitution which is, happily for us, dead and buried.
What are we talking about then?
AmendmentÂ 9 speaks of âintercultural civilityâ, but that is a contradiction in terms, otherwise civility no longer means anything!
The addition of fine, high-flown words often just ends up meaning nothing.
The result of your approach is relativism and betrayal: you want to promote the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue at the Olympic Games in Beijing and thus serve as a spare wheel for a Communist dictatorship (AmendmentÂ 38)!
What a disgrace!
You are going to talk about intercultural dialogue with Tibet, no doubt?
This initiative on its own disqualifies your proposal.
Â Â  I am voting in favour of the report because its main purpose â that of combating discrimination - is very positive and necessary.
I am, however, voting against an increase in the budget, as well as against AmendmentÂ 18, which is particularly unfortunate in its neo-colonial desire to export views and values.
Â Â  . It is always appropriate to highlight the responsibility that falls to the law, to the Member States and to the Union to attach priority to promoting childrenâs rights, and especially so today, which is World Childrenâs Day.
Children are our future and make up around one fifth of the population of the EU.
I support the creation of this Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the EU of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children, and the amendments tabled by the rapporteur.
This is a crucial step towards improving cooperation between the Member States in protecting children.
Furthermore it has a twofold purpose:
- to improve access to information on prohibitions, through compulsory registration of prohibition in the criminal record; and
- to make it compulsory to enforce them.
It will accordingly be possible to stop a person who has been convicted of paedophilia in one Member State, and has been banned from any activity involving contact with children, from sidestepping that ban by moving to another Member State.
A disqualification of this nature handed down in one Member State will have a legal effect in the other Member States, thereby broadening the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of disqualifications and prohibitions.
Â Â  . â I strongly support the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium as an indispensable factor for effective cooperation between Member States with regard to the protection of children from sexual abuse.
The least one can say is that this initiative fills a lacuna, a vacuum â what am I saying! â the gulf there is at present.
Let us consider â and Belgium fully realised the gravity of the matter at the time of the horrifying revelation of the Fourniret affair â at the moment, when a person is convicted in one Member State for paedophile acts and is subject, in that State, to a prohibition on pursuing activities likely to bring that person into contact with children, he needs only to move to another State in order to evade this prohibition!
For the time being, therefore, there is no guarantee that a disqualification handed down in one Member State has any legal effect in the other Member States.
In the face of an appalling situation, it was time to establish a system which requires the State of residence of the person convicted of sexual offences against children to recognise the prohibitions handed down abroad and to apply them within its own territory.
I am convinced that this text will save children from the worst kind of horror.
Â Â  . I support this resolution and the commitment by the Commission and Council to deal with Palestineâs duly elected government, even if its politics are other than we might wish.
No good can come from driving Palestine into financial chaos and ruin.
Europe's policy should serve as an example to the US and others as to how to proceed in future.
I did not support the inclusion of paragraph 9 in the resolution, however.
While I have and will continue to support demands for an immediate halt to further extension of the settlements - or rather their dismantling - and no further building of the wall, I feel it does not fit well here, where we are essentially dealing with a very different issue.
Â Â  . Whilst the most recent developments in Israel have been welcome, not least the results achieved by a party that is clearly seeking dialogue and agreement, the same cannot be said of the election results in the Palestinian Authority, where the outcome, although regular from the point of view of electoral legality, is doubly worrying.
First and foremost, a political group that does not acknowledge Israelâs right to exist, and as such fails to meet one of the prerequisites for the peace process, was able to gain power.
It also showed that, in the election, the people under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority did not prioritise a negotiated settlement to this age-old conflict.
Against this backdrop, the EU and all of the Quartet must agree on the next steps.
We need to be firm with the PA government, but open to President Mahmood Abbas and his initiatives in search of a general agreement on the only acceptable solution, which is the peaceful coexistence of two States.
In view of the importance of the role of EU donor, let us hope that on this external front, 'Europeâ proves itself equal to the task of exerting a positive influence on the situation.
Â Â  . British Conservatives voted against paragraph 9 as the use of the word "condemnation" did not appear in any other part of the text dealing with, for instance, Hamas' support for recent terrorist attacks.
Furthermore, the issue of the settlements and the controversial status of East Jerusalem are not directly related to the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories.
Lastly, the security fence which has considerably reduced the number of terrorist suicide bombing missions into Israel proper is not necessarily the final border of the two states.
It has already been moved by orders of Israel's Supreme Court to accommodate local Palestinians' needs.
The final course it takes will depend upon the successful negotiated outcome to the peace process.
Â Â  . We are in no doubt that terrorism must be combated with firmness and steadfast determination.
Yet the values and principles on which our civilisation is built must not under any circumstances be undermined.
I share the concerns regarding the GuantÃ¡namo situation and endorse the request made in this House to put an end to this type of situation and to close these detention centres.
The capture of the detainees and the circumstances of their subsequent detention run counter to the Geneva Convention and to other international humanitarian instruments.
Whatever measures may be taken in relation to these detainees, they must comply fully with the principle of human rights and the rule of law.
All prisoners must be formally charged with the crimes they have been accused of and have a fair trial before a competent, impartial court.
Convictions must of course be followed by a sentence that reflects the seriousness and inhumanity of the terrible acts that have been perpetrated.
I hope that the opportunity is taken at the next transatlantic summit in Vienna to exert pressure on the USA to close down GuantÃ¡namo and to find a fairer and quicker solution to the question of the 500 or so detainees.
Â Â  . I should like to restate what I said in October 2004 on this matter.
We are vehemently opposed to terrorism, and with total solidarity, sympathise with the terrible suffering of its victims and their families.
There is no doubt whatsoever that this appalling, barbaric attack on fundamental rights is the biggest struggle currently facing democracies.
The tragedies of 11Â September and 11Â March are a major example of this and still uppermost in our thoughts.
Yet in the course of this struggle, the west also needs to maintain the highest moral standards, and must set an impeccable example in terms of the values that it holds dear.
In this respect, we would like clarifications of the cases in which there have been violations of human rights, of fundamental guarantees and of the universal conventions to which we have signed up.
We feel that the civilisation values in which we believe must be upheld.
I therefore supported the postponement of the vote in order to ensure that a more mature and better-informed decision be taken in two weeksâ time in Strasbourg.
Â Â  .The friendly relationship, quite naturally, that we have with the United States does not imply that we are trailing behind them for the sake of defending interests that are not our own.
That is what they would like.
We do not.
Our interest is to have a European currency, if indeed there has to be one in that form, which stands out as the currency of reference in relation to the dollar and not the reverse; it is that developing countries should experience balanced development, albeit in the shelter of cautious protectionism; it was to have NATO in opposition to the Warsaw Pact, but since the Warsaw Pact has disappeared, NATOâs legitimacy as a tool of American dominance is no longer justified; it is not taking part in all the wars in which we do not have to intervene; it is that Latin America, by virtue of its links with Portugal and Spain, does not constitute a backyard of the United States.
Saying all this is not to say one is an enemy of the United States, but it is being patriotic and concerned for oneâs own country.
Â Â  . New partnership?
The EU is promising the USA rearmament and close military cooperation.
By a large majority, the European Parliament has today voted for a new trans-Atlantic partnership, at the same time expressing its particular support for close military cooperation between the EU and the USA, but there has been no real criticism of the ongoing occupation of Iraq or of the escalating war in Afghanistan.
The CIAâs torture flights and the use of American military bases in Europe for the wars in the Middle East are not to be allowed to interfere with the new partnership, nor is the fact that American nuclear weapons continue to be stationed in EU Member States to be a topic for discussion at the forthcoming EU/USA summit in Vienna.
The affirmation of Europeans and Americans as brothers in arms culminates in the undertaking that âEuropeâs military capabilities are to be increasedâ âwith a view to establishing better partnership relations between the European Union and the United States in political and military termsâ.
This undertaking is an unambiguous commitment to continuing, in future, to wage war side by side with the USA, and to ongoing support for those wars that are already being fought.
Nevertheless, the real aim of those responsible for EU military policy is to be able, quite independently of NATO and without help from the USA, to conduct military interventions anywhere in the world â as is now happening in Congo.
The concept of a civilian Europe is one that the Members of this House abandoned long ago.
Â Â  . The United States of America is Europeâs biggest and best ally.
Any discussion on relations between the two sides of the Atlantic should be based on this premise, and on two other key ideas.
The fact that we are potential competitors in various areas does not dilute our alliance; nor does the fact that we are such good allies blind us to reality.
We are different entities with projects, proposals and interests that do not always coincide, but we are partners with the same view of society and the same concept of human community.
In recent years, difficulties have come to light that, in many cases, can be resolved.
The idea that the United States engendered an internal split in Europe is false.
The truth of the matter is that the EU is not itself a single whole with a single vision of the realities of external politics.
Let us therefore focus on the factors that make our relationship strong, and leave aside the ideological prejudices that are so evident in some of the disputes that will always occur when the two sides of the Atlantic come together.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues support strong transatlantic relations, both politically and economically.
However, the issue of an absolute ban on the death sentence remains a conscience-based issue for individual MEPs.
Nevertheless, we all condemn the inappropriate and excessive use of the death penalty in countries such as China and Iran.
We believe that issues of crimes against international humanitarian law should not be dealt with by the International Criminal Court but should be dealt with by UN ad hoc Tribunals.
Furthermore, we do not believe that an immediate closure of Guantanamo Bay is desirable or feasible while the war on terrorism remains a priority for both the United States and the European Union.
However, in the longer term it would be in the US's interest to do so.
Â Â  . I would congratulate my colleague, Erika Mann, on her report on EU-US economic relations.
Yet while doing so I would enter a reservation.
I have always taken the line that the deepening of the Union is as important, if not more important, than its widening.
Here there is the call for the creation of a free-trade area with the US by 2015.
I am not against it in principle. It really depends on other developments.
I have not been fighting to protect a social dimension to the Union, vital for ordinary Europeans, to allow it to be sold out via the back door by the creation of a gigantic free trade area.
I have always told progressive and trade union opponents in the OG of NAFTA that they are missing the point.
They should not be opposing close economic integration with Mexico, Canada, which will inevitably accompany globalisation, but rather demand its democratisation through the creation of a NAFTA parliamentary assembly to promote a social dimension.
Â Â  .MrsÂ Mannâs report is very critical of United Statesâ policy which, for her taste, is too concerned with national interests.
I respect, although I do not share this opinion, but I would like to see a similar degree of demands and indignation when this Parliament debates Europeâs relations with countries where concentration and forced labour camps are still in existence.
Coming back to the core of the matter, I would have no objection to strengthening economic cooperation between the United States and the countries of Europe, if that were mutually beneficial for both parties.
On the other hand, it is no use, for the sake of this, creating a âbarrier-free transatlantic marketplaceâ, a real internal market on the European model, with its share of legislative and regulatory harmonisations, and with the potential of extension throughout the whole of the American continent.
We are no longer talking about a free trade area, but, well and truly, total economic integration.
Before political integration?
This report is symptomatic of a Europe that refuses to impose respect for the interests of Member States while seeking to integrate them, merge them and make them disappear into a vast global mass.
We can only reject it.
Â Â  .A free trade area is an area without barriers, customs barriers in particular.
It is a common market, almost like that of Europe.
The transatlantic free trade area, therefore, is a common market from Warsaw to San Francisco, from Helsinki to Patagonia and from Malta to the Canadian Great North.
While European public opinion imagines that the political debate is about the future of the European Constitution, the reality is quite simply, from 2010 to 2015, that is to say in five years, the building of a political and economic body made up of 45 nations out of the 193 that there are in the world.
On the quiet, MrsÂ Mannâs report signals a transition from European integration to a political integration comprising one quarter of the world.
This would mean a Parliament of 45 nations, a common trade tribunal and the beginnings of a common legislation.
After 90 years Paul ValÃ©ryâs prediction that âEurope aspires to be run by an American committeeâ is coming true.
Farewell Europe, hello World!
MrsÂ Mann has made a double announcement: the death of the European idea and the birth of a world organisation.
Â Â  . Transatlantic relations covers a broader spectrum than just economic relations, which must be taken into account when we address this issue.
The EU and the United States of America play a unique role in world trade.
There are therefore three aspects that I consider to be fundamental in any debate on the matter.
The first of these is loyalty.
Trade relations between the two sides should be based on good faith, effective compliance with agreements and effective protection of the rights of US and European economic operators, including the various producers and consumers concerned.
The second is international-level cooperation.
Although the factors involved in disagreement and competition are clear for all to see, the only way forward is to reach a workable understanding on how best to promote fairer, more transparent and more development-friendly world trade.
The last of these aspects is the idea of sharing the main challenges facing both sides on the world stage, in terms of both concerns and solutions.
This is true of the economy itself (take, for example, the energy question, the growth of economic powerhouses such as China and India, and world poverty) and of security.
Â Â  .I wish to explain to you here why I voted against MrsÂ Mannâs report on transatlantic economic relations between the United States and the European Union.
In a general context, the report covers too many completely different sectors, sectors which, in my opinion, should be the subject of specific reports.
I think, therefore, that the content of the report ought to have been better targeted.
This report could, moreover, have dramatic consequences for Europe.
Indeed it opens the door to a free trade area between the United States and the European Union, which would increase the penetration into Europe of the United Statesâ agricultural processing model.
This goes against a principle that, as a Socialist, I feel duty bound to defend: a social Europe based on principles of solidarity!
Â Â  Mr President, I eventually voted in favour of the Langen report, but only because we have also accepted the verbal amendment of MrsÂ StarkeviÄiÅ«tÄ.
With regard to Amendments 2 and 16, I voted differently from the majority of my group.
One is an inflation criterion, and the other is the decision of the Commission regarding Lithuania.
I would like to say that my reason for this is that even the manner in which Parliament is handling this issue, without a serious debate, is absolutely revolting.
It is revolting that the Commission makes a strategic decision, and for the first time it sanctions somebody in the interest of the enlargement of the euro zone.
The Commission made a strategic decision, because it did not even submit this to us for debate.
This is unacceptable, especially when the Commission has done so on the basis of dubious inflation-related and other criteria, and it calls to account a country that has made many sacrifices, for criteria that are continuously breached by four or five Member States.
I believe that this whole procedure damages not only the credibility of the European Parliament, but also that of the European Union and of the euro zone in the states that joined in 2004 or will join in the future.
Therefore, both the Commission and that part of Parliament that did not wish to conduct a longer debate on the unilateral decision of the Commission, have a very serious responsibility.
Â Â  Mr President, the Commissionâs decision to leave Lithuania out of the eurozone and the related opportunities for rapid integration with those better advanced was based on a formal notification concerning a breach by Lithuaniaâs economy of the inflation rate limit, indeed with a minimal and disputed drop margin.
The Government in Vilnius fell yesterday, burdened as it was by greater mistakes and failures than a lack of special concern and cautiousness over keeping the inflation programme on a positive margin, avoiding the risk of getting negative zero-comma-commas.
It should not just toe the line on the European stage, especially while being new and not big.
Here I have to state, unfortunately, that unequal treatment of Member States is evident at high levels of EU management, including the Commission.
When two larger Member States did not comply with the Stability Pact â and it was not a drop margin, as in Lithuaniaâs case â those larger states were not blamed or punished, but on the contrary blessed.
The financial misbehaviour was not changed â the law was changed so that it complied with misbehaviour.
In our case, the Commission did not punish our former Government; rather, the entire nation was pushed aside.
Moreover, something bad happened with the eastern border of the EU after Russia broke the obligatory signature of President Putin under the 2003 Summit commitment to the EU to finalise agreements with Estonia and Latvia very soon.
Russia even denounced a document already ratified by the Estonian Parliament.
The position of the EU appeared rather shameful: instead of standing by its Member State, the EU instead appeased Russia, leaving Estonia to cope alone with Big Brother again.
I would like to see my country, Lithuania, acceding not only to the eurozone, but also to the common European area of energy security.
In the case of the eurozone, the European Parliament adopted some positive opinions in amendments critical of the Commission and therefore I changed my mind and voted in favour of Mr Langenâs report.
Â Â  â Mr President, the single European currency may well be helpful as a means of fostering a common European identity, and so one ought, no doubt, to welcome the admission of the Republic of Slovenia to the euro zone.
Under no circumstances, though, must the euro be used to play politics with historical emblems.
For example, when Slovenia insists that its euro coins should bear such Austrian symbols as the coronation stone of the Princes of Carinthia, then that amounts to a provocation capable of being interpreted as a claim on historic territory by Laibach, otherwise known as Ljubljana.
As there have already been problems with Turkish coins, I believe that we should, where the design of euro coins is concerned, be more rigorous in imposing our own conditions.
It is for this reason that I have voted against the Langen report.
Â Â  With regard to AmendmentÂ 9, Sweden rejected introducing the euro as its currency in a referendum in 2003.
The issue is thus settled for the foreseeable future as far as Sweden is concerned.
Our view is that the EU should not revise the Swedish peopleâs opinion by adopting a position for or against a possible opt-out clause.
Â Â  . The adoption of the euro currency should be based on determined criteria.
The time for a country to satisfy the accession criteria and the convergence period should be set. The length of time that a country spends in the ERM II mechanism needs to be determined.
A convergence rate also needs to be established.
The adoption of the euro should facilitate the convergence of countries' economies. The majority of these economies are linked to the economies of the other countries of the European Union.
The advantages of accession are: transparency in cross-border prices; an increase in competitivity for the benefit of the consumer; the abolition of transaction costs; and no risk in exchange.
The European Union must make sure that the criteria used in order for a country to join the euro zone are the same for all, and that the assessment of the criteria is transparent.
We must be wary of falling into the trap of using the issue of entry in the euro zone as a means to fight other battles which are completely irrelevant.
Entry in the euro zone should be based on the Maastricht criteria, and should have no other implications.
We need to ensure that the decisions we take here regarding certain countries do not contribute to strengthening those eurosceptics who are using the decisions of the European Union as a means to undermine its achievements.
Â Â  In the vote on the euro, I abstained from voting on whether, following its referendum, Sweden should be regarded as qualifying for a derogation.
The motion is based on the incorrect assumption that Sweden will be forced to accept the common currency in spite of the outcome of the referendum.
That is obviously not the case.
The motion also goes too far, since it is based on the absurd idea that, through referendums, individual countries will be able to opt out of parts of the common treaties.
Consistent application of such a principle is, of course, unthinkable.
Â Â  . I welcome the Langen Report, yet from a British perspective it fills me with dread.
Already, our failure to join the Single Currency area is costing us billions in inward investment and tens of thousands of jobs.
The 10 new Member States are already eager to join, as they voted for in the separate and unanimously positive referenda before accession.
It will be a sad day for Britain, its people and its economy when the likes of Slovenia and Lithuania, Estonia and Malta adopt the Euro, while Britain languishes on the sidelines adrift from the world's most successful currency, tossed to and fro by a Eurogroup making decisions vital to our economy, but independent of our input and indifferent to our interests.
Â Â  .Here is a new stage in the European Unionâs headlong rush forward: new Member Statesâ membership of the single currency.
The Langen report attempts to find a balance between dogmatic adherence to the Maastricht criteria and the Stability Pact, praise for the euro and considerations of good sense about the state of preparedness of the countries or even the euro zoneâs capacity to cope with an enlargement which will increase its heterogeneity and, consequently, its difficulties.
The single currency has a significant responsibility for poor growth in those States that have adopted it (inappropriate interest rates, disadvantageous exchange rates).
It is not necessary to drag new victims into this situation.
I wonder, also, whether the citizens of these countries, who only yesterday shook off the yoke of Communism, are aware of the irreparable loss of sovereignty involved in the adoption of the euro?
Above all, are they aware that the loss of their national currency was laid down in their accession treaty?
Informing them about the practicalities of the transition to the euro in their country is not what we should concentrate on, but rather on consulting them again, by means of a referendum, about the loss of their currency.
Â Â  I voted in favour of AmendmentÂ 9 because I believe that Sweden should demand a derogation following Swedenâs referendum on the euro in 2003.
I believe, however, that it is up to Sweden to request the derogation.
The EU should not automatically regard Swedenâs ânoâ vote as equivalent to an opt-out clause.
Â Â  . I have voted in favour of the Langen report on the enlargement of the euro zone, because I happen to believe that the Commission must hold firm to the criteria for membership in it.
Only in that way can the euro region continue to justify the trust placed in it.
My group regards Slovenia and Lithuania as being, in principle, ready for the euro.
The accession of those countries to the euro region should benefit the entire European economy.
The drive with which they have carried out economic reform in recent years should serve as an incentive to all euro countries.
Â Â  . Nobody questions the idea that any Member State wishing to enter the euro zone must meet the Maastricht convergence criteria established in the EC Treaty.
Parliament has always said it is in favour of strict compliance with these criteria, without exceptions.
Although the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided not to focus on recommendations regarding the level of preparation of specific countries in its report, the truth is that the main issue in this vote was the negative verdict on Lithuania, which meets all the convergence criteria, except for the inflation criteria.
In the last 12 months, the inflation rate in Lithuania has been slightly above the threshold value.
This has led me to vote for AmendmentÂ 2, which calls for a clear and exhaustive explanation regarding the calculation of the inflation criteria and calls on the Commission to update its report on Lithuania with a view to enabling it to join the euro zone at the earliest opportunity.
Â Â  I am abstaining in the votes on the technical ways in which countries are to implement the changeover to the euro.
However, I am voting against the proposals aimed at putting maximum effort into the fight against inflation and at setting aside other objectives.
I am voting in favour of the report because of the huge criticism of the way in which Lithuania has been treated.
Â Â  . I abstained from voting on the grounds that I believe that the same criteria must apply to all EU Member States and that the enlargement of the euro zone must not involve more stringent criteria being applied to new ones.
My abstaining from voting alters nothing, however, as regards my fundamental criticisms of the Stability Pact, which is an instrument completely unsuited to the task of resolving the EUâs economic and social problems and benefits nobody except big business and the property owning classes.
There is no need for a pact that one-sidedly favours price stability, but there is a need for a social and employment pact that meets the populationâs needs.
Joining the euro zone under present conditions will do the people in the new Member States no good at all, any more than it benefited the old ones; on the contrary, they will be damaged by it.
Â Â  We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to Parliamentâs part-sessions taking place in Strasbourg and question why Parliament has set aside a significant budget item for purchasing buildings there.
This issue is particularly controversial because an investigation is still under way as to whether irregularities took place in connection with the transactions surrounding Parliamentâs buildings in Strasbourg.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the report on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament for the financial year 2007.
We set great store by the strict approach it aims to adopt to the administrationâs proposals.
Our approval in this regard does not mean that we support every trend in the budget.
For example, we are, as previously, sceptical about the European Parliamentâs information-providing activities, which tend to take over the roles of the MEPs and political groups.
Nor do we think that the construction of a Europe House in Brussels or the European Parliamentâs purchase of buildings in Strasbourg are justified.
Â Â  This report might have contained much more of general interest regarding the European Parliamentâs budget.
The report should make it clear that in no circumstances should the European Parliamentâs budget cover deficits in the MEPsâ pension fund.
The report should also have contained a statement to the effect that the MEPsâ generous system of travel expenses should be reformed and that only actual travel costs, and nothing else, should be paid out to MEPs in connection with the journeys they make.
One of the things the report comes out in favour of is a EURÂ 4Â million increase in appropriations to the political groups and the European parties.
This is not something that I can support, which is one of the reasons that I am choosing to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . I believe that the thrust of paragraph 46 is misplaced given that the EU's institutions and its Member States have entered into agreements regarding the status of additional languages and their agreed use as working languages in these institutions, notably the Irish language.
Financial measures were put in place to finance these initiatives and they should be honoured accordingly.
Â Â  Those who vote against paragraphÂ 4 (EURÂ 50Â million for purchase of the buildings in Strasbourg and EURÂ 25Â million for propaganda) are not affecting the budget, but are merely trying to conceal waste from the electorate.
I am, however, voting against the report because I do not want the money concerned to be wasted.
Â Â  Mr President, as a shadow rapporteur I would like to say that the original premise of Mr Markovâs report was that trade has caused poverty.
This is a position that we, as a political group, could never accept.
For us, trade is one of the important tools for the fight against poverty.
We have a social responsibility towards the poorest countries.
We feel that in order to attain the Millennium Development Goals, we have to create a trade environment in which developing countries have real access to the markets of developed countries.
We believe there is a link between a countryâs wealth and its economic freedom.
We support aid programmes, but they must be effective.
We must link them to the economic and social climate in recipient countries and they must be aimed at improving democratic governance.
The aim of linking trade and development is to benefit people, and particularly those living in poverty.
Instead of spending large sums of money on direct aid, it may be better to invigorate poor countries through economic cooperation, including trade and the exchange of goods, services and skills, so that they can build their own prosperity.
Gradual liberalisation at the current stage of economic differentiation is a sensible idea.
Sudden liberalisation has not materialised in the case of China, for example.
Although the report is excessively socially-oriented in tone, it does contain many proposals that will constructively foster development through free and fair international trade.
Despite the reservations of members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as shadow rapporteur I have proposed that the report should be approved, for if used responsibly and sensibly by the players in this field, it can help to level out the differences in living standards, and raise standards in the poorest societies.
Â Â  Mr President, I am happy to concur with the previous speaker, who has already made some very valid points about the Markov report.
I should like to add that I too happen to take the view that the plea for the large-scale debt cancellation of developing world countries will bear little fruit, will offer little in the way of a solution and could even have the opposite effect, because the already restricted control on those developing countries, on the management of those developing countries by organisations such as the IMF and other international institutions would then become much more difficult, if not impossible.
I think that it is only the very corrupt, incapable and money-wasting African and other leaders who would benefit and who would become even richer.
I know that I risk setting myself up for finger wagging by the likes of Louis Michel, Bob Geldof and Bono, but I maintain â and that is the honest truth â that the huge tragedy in many developing countries, particularly in black Africa, is that they are being plundered and robbed by their own leaders; I think that that is the first conclusion we have to draw before we can start giving poor people real aid.
Â Â  . I welcome this report which discusses the role that trade policy has played and could potentially play towards development and alleviating poverty while taking into account the complexity of the relation between the two.
The salient issues of the report focus on the fact that whilst there has been a general rise of GDP per capita on a global scale, there has also been an increase in the number of people living beneath the poverty line.
The report therefore considers that a radical change of policy is needed both in developed and developing countries in order to alleviate the problems behind this perpetual increase in poverty.
The message is therefore very clear: when we are considering the merits of liberalisation we should not lose sight of the concrete reality of the gaps in wealth in the world today.
Â Â  . Whilst trade is an important tool for development and a means of reducing poverty, it is clearly impossible to attain real progress towards these objectives unless fair rules are established at international level.
Finding ways of ensuring that trade policy helps to resolve the poverty issue, however, is no easy task.
Accordingly, opening up borders to international trade brings highly significant benefits for the development of societies.
Poorer countries are clearly not always prepared to protect themselves against any adverse effects or to take advantage of any opportunities that may arise.
I therefore feel that the minor changes to the WTO trade negotiations as regards the environment, farming, raw materials, public services, health and industrialisation could help people enjoy more of the benefits of trade.
Lastly, our role should continue to be that of promoting support for development and democracy in developing countries with a view to delivering decent working conditions and opportunities for growth for the people of those countries.
Â Â  Globalisation offers a number of opportunities, especially for reducing poverty.
Trade and technical cooperation both help strengthen poor countriesâ economies.
At the same time, there are risks and problems.
The poorest countries are often in no position to participate in economic cooperation because of a lack of capacity and so forth and are in danger of getting left even further behind.
What is more, environmental legislation at international level, as well as in many poor countries, leaves a lot to be desired, leading to a rapid increase in waste products, as well as in over-exploitation and in the unsustainable use of a variety of natural resources such as forests and fish, and all these developments are intensified through swiftly growing trade.
These problems must be got to grips with as soon as possible if the advantages of globalisation are not to be turned into disadvantages.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to state why I have felt unable to vote in favour of the Vidal-Quadras report.
As long ago as 1997, the EU took the decision that it would increase the proportion of its energy drawn from renewable sources to 12% by 2010.
It would appear, though, that the best we are likely to manage is an increase to 8%.
These figures make the likelihood of successfully achieving the goal we have set ourselves â a saving of one-fifth of current energy consumption by 2020 â rather doubtful.
Instead of constantly topping up the funds for the EUâs nuclear research programme, we would, I believe, do better to put this money into the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors, which promise much for the future.
Â Â  . The Green Paper on energy efficiency forms the basis of the Commissionâs Energy Efficiency Action Plan, a highly important document that plays a key role in combating climate change, environmental pollution and the abuse of natural resources, and in safeguarding energy supplies.
The rapporteur mentions some highly important ways of reaching the objective of 20% reduction in energy consumption in the EU by 2020, as proposed by the Commission.
Simple measures that could bring major energy savings include awareness raising and educating and encouraging people to change their consumption habits, favouring the use of co-generation technologies, the fact that the public sector sets an excellent example in using cleaner transport and efficient lighting, and the use of energy saving contracts.
The rapporteur also highlights the unstable nature of the energy market and the recent oil price rises that make the current state of affairs different from the time when the Commission was drawing up the Green Paper.
I therefore support the Vidal-Quadras report.
Â Â  . We are opposed to the liberalisation of energy markets.
We do not believe it is essential to enhancing competitiveness, tackling energy prices and enhancing of security of supply and energy efficiency.
However, we have decided to vote in favourÂ of the reportÂ as it contains positive proposals relating to energy efficiency, conservation and access to energy by disadvantaged members of society.
Â Â  The report concerns the situation of Roma women in the European Union and the complex, multiple discrimination to which these women are exposed in the EU Member States.
The June List champions Roma women having access to better protection of their reproductive and sexual health.
The June Listâs basic attitude is that high priority should be given both to equality issues and to issues of ethnic discrimination, because both areas are in need of serious attention.
That does not, however, mean that it is for the EU to do this.
The June List is convinced that this work is best done at national level.
The Member States are very diverse in terms of culture and traditions.
We therefore believe that, in working to achieve the goal of equal opportunities for women and men, it is possible to have a more flexible and pluralistic approach at national level.
I have thus chosen to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues are strong supporters of equality of opportunity for all women, including Romani women across Europe.
However, we have abstained on this report today as we do not support the proliferation of new EU agencies and institutes (as outlined in paragraph 1) that will add to the burden of the taxpayer and increase bureaucracy without any proven benefit to the people they are supposed to serve.
Â Â  We have abstained from voting on the report on the situation of women in armed conflicts.
We are, of course, just as troubled as the rapporteur by the horrors of war and by the human suffering caused by war and terrorism.
However, the basis of the report is such as to give rise to some peculiar lines of argument in which the suffering of men as one group and women as another, as well as levels of blame and responsibility, are graded so as to fit in with demands that quotas be allocated to women in various contexts.
Efforts to prevent conflicts and to put a stop to terrorism must be aimed precisely at doing just that, and the best methods for achieving those aims need to be used.
The many proposals in the report, legitimate though they may be, are in danger of shifting the focus from the aims of peace work to the forms it should take.
The allocation of quotas for women in peace-keeping and peace-making bodies and in peace negotiations is in danger of getting in the way of the goal of preventing suffering.
Â Â  . I am voting in favour of the De Keyser report because it provides a useful assessment of the situation, based on the triple axis of women as victims, women as peacemakers and women and war.
The report also states that, in spite of all the resolutions laid down by all the European and international institutions, women do not take part in areas such as conflict prevention and resolution, and peace keeping operations.
The recommendation to draw up a programme of practical action that would help identify existing obstacles is therefore fully justified.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues are strong supporters of providing support to victims of sexual abuse and other crimes during and after conflict.
We support measures outlined in this report including prosecuting those responsible for genocide and war crimes and other crimes mentioned in this report.
However, we have abstained on this report today because we do not support the principle of arbitrary quotas of men or women in any sphere, including what is suggested in this report.
This principle of quotas, we believe, is demeaning to women.
Â Â  . Even though the report as a whole is progressive concerning the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in the reconstruction and democratic process in post-conflict countries, we have decided to abstain due to the paragraphs which state support for the European Security and Defence Policy.
Â Â  . The militarisation of the EU is being driven forward under cover of the deployment of women in armed conflicts.
The core elements of Mrs De Keyserâs report, which really do have to do with women in armed conflicts, are generally good in themselves, but the rapporteur has proved unable to draw a line between the actual subject of the report and general positions on the EUâs military policy.
There are no fewer than seven positive references to the current ESDP, which devalue the report and make it impossible for me to vote in favour of it.
At one point, the report goes so far as to encourage the EU to âgive greater attention to the presence, preparation, training and equipment of police forces forming part of its military missions, since police units constitute the most important means whereby the security of the civilian population, particularly women and children, may be guaranteed.â
Precisely what the ideology of what is alleged to be âhumanitarian interventionâ is doing in this report remains a secret known only to the grand coalition in the European Parliament that advocates, with neither ifs nor buts, the militarisation of the EU.
The intention is that the deployment of women in armed conflicts should be used as a pretext for manufacturing consent to the militarisation of the EU, and it is for that reason that I voted NO to the De Keyser report.
Constantly spending more and more money on armaments research and arming the EU to the teeth in order to be capable of waging war is the wrong approach.
All attempts at using allegedly humanitarian motivations to legitimise the militarisation of the EU must be rejected.
Â Â  . As rapporteur on this issue in the context of the ACP-EN Parliamentary Assembly, I addressed issues of post-conflict rehabilitation.
At the time, we felt it was of pressing importance that the issue of equality between the sexes in conflict prevention and resolution should be incorporated, and that women should take part in the political decision-making process and in defining conflict resolution strategies.
I wish to reiterate the need to offer resolute support for women combatants, refugees, victims of physical violence and victims of sexual abuse.
We must remain permanently vigilant and must show greater resoluteness and solidarity when it comes to these shocking acts.
I regret that the rapporteur emphasises the suffering of women in conflict situations in order to impose and export her notion of âsexual and reproductive healthâ, including the promotion of abortion, which is certainly not accepted by all Member States.
As I have said before, I will not vote for a text that fails to clarify this concept and that extends its remit beyond the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and beyond the provision for women of the decent conditions they need for pregnancy, childbirth and post-childbirth.
Â Â  . Even though the report as a whole is progressive concerning the situation of women in armed conflicts and their role in the reconstruction and democratic process in post-conflict countries, we have decided to abstain due to the paragraphs which state support for the European Security and Defence Policy.
Â Â  â I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 1 June 2006.
Â Â  Following the Presidency-in-Office of the Councilâs request to the Conference of Presidents, the latter decided, at its meeting on 8Â June, to organise a plenary sitting.
I would emphasise that this will be a plenary sitting in the full sense of the word, not a Conference of Presidents open to all Members, which will take place on Tuesday of next week, 20 June, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
At that plenary sitting, the President-in-Office of the Council, ChancellorÂ SchÃŒssel, will report on the last meeting and on his Presidency, and I therefore hope that an appropriate number of Members will attend that sitting in order to hear this important statement.
The only item on the agenda will be the Council and Commission statements on the results of the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I believe that, when deciding on this sitting, the Conference of Presidents did not take account of the fact that the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly would be meeting in Vienna on the same day and that 78 Members of this House will not therefore be able to attend one of the two events: either the extraordinary sitting being scheduled or the plenary sitting of the Joint Assembly, which we are obliged to attend.
I find it regrettable, to say the least, that account has not been taken of this situation, because 78 is more than 10% of the Members of this House.
Â Â  Thank you, MrÂ MartÃ­nez.
The clash is regrettable, but it is not regrettable that no thought has been given to it, because, in fact, thought has been given to it.
Â Â  â Mr President, I would just like to ask whether I have understood this correctly: are we talking here about an extraordinary plenary session?
That is just utter nonsense.
A long time ago, we introduced the practice of having a Conference of Presidents that was open to Members.
Surely that is what is required.
Is that so or is it not?
Anything else would be nonsensical.
We do not need a plenary session.
Â Â  MrÂ Posselt, that is not a point of order, but rather an opinion.
It is a very respectable opinion, but it cannot be taken into account.
The Conference of Presidents, which is the body that schedules plenary sittings, has discussed the issue and has taken a decision.
I appreciate that there are all sorts of different opinions in this Chamber.
Those who wish to applaud it can do so, and those who want to reject it can reject it, but do not express your personal opinions in the form of points of order.
The Conference of Presidents has taken account of the clash that MrÂ MartÃ­nez has mentioned.
Sometimes we cannot harmonise all agendas.
The alternative would have been to schedule a Conference of Presidents open to all Members.
The effect would have been exactly the same, because the Members present in Vienna would still not have been able to take part.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Despite the issues that have been raised, the plenary sitting will take place on 20Â June at 11 a.m.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the June part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 8Â May 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
The following amendment has been proposed.
The Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has requested that no resolution on Bulgaria and Romania be voted on this week.
MrÂ Brok has the floor in order to explain this request.
Â Â  â Mr President, after the Commission had presented its report for the sixteenth time, we said that we did not want a resolution in advance.
Now, since it turns out that - according to the report - the Commissionâs final proposals will be made in October at the earliest, then it is in October too, and not before then, that this House should express its opinion on the basis of this report.
Neither in the Committees nor in most of the groups has the question been debated; since it was obviously only discussed for the first time on Thursday by the Conference of Presidents, and so to decide upon it now does not seem to me to be appropriate, given the significance of this topic.
Parliament should attend to such a major issue with great seriousness, in order, later on, to be able to welcome both of these countries into our midst in the appropriate manner.
I would therefore like to ask you to delete this item from the agenda.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am very surprised at the accusation that MrÂ Brok has laid at our door.
We cannot just renounce a right that we have earned through struggle.
We absolutely have to make a statement.
I am very surprised at this change.
Of course I must take note of it, becoming cleverer is also a good democratic right.
However, we stand by our opinion that there should be a resolution.
As for the result of the vote, we shall have to see.
In any case, we believe that it certainly does make sense to state our opinion before a session of the Council, our opinion being that we are endeavouring to do everything we can to ensure that accession takes place on 1Â January 2007.
(1)
Â Â  Mr President, last week some families were massacred as they picnicked on a beach in Gaza.
Massacred, there is no other word for it.
It seems that, this session there is an abundance of interesting subjects, to the point where it is not even possible to talk about this subject, let alone make it an urgent topic.

I should like to say to you that if this was a blunder, it is of such magnitude that it deserves an independent enquiry. If it was not a blunder, but a deliberate act, then it is a crime that deserves to be tried by international courts.
I want our Parliament to take it up.
In 1987, the first intifada was started by a less serious incident. This time, considering the current state of tension in Palestine, it amounts to actual provocation.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, 14Â June this week is the 65th anniversary of a brutal criminal act and the most unimaginable violation of human rights in Europe.
In Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania over 30Â 000 completely innocent children, old people, women and men were treacherously herded into cattle trucks to be deported to the Siberian death camps.
I am proud of the Latvian people, which pulled through the painful years of occupation and always did everything they could to enable us to be proud of how we live today.
I do not want Europeâs sympathy; what I want is for European society to understand the misery caused by Soviet totalitarian Communism to Latvia and to Europe as a whole.
On 14Â June, I and my colleagues MrÂ Kelam and MrÂ Landsbergis are presenting to the European Parliament a memorial plaque in memory of the victims of Soviet totalitarian Communism, dedicated to the 65th anniversary of the 1941 mass deportations in the Baltic States.
You are all most welcome to attend at this time of commemoration at 4 p.m. on Wednesday. Mr Borrell, Parliamentâs President, has also been officially invited to honour the deportees and to receive the plaque in their memory.
Â Â  â Mr President, 2006 is the European Year of Workers' Mobility.
Within the framework of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, the actions programmed aim to change the attitude of Europeans to the possibility of living in the European Union and looking on it as a single market, of trying to acquire the means that give them the right to move from one job to another and from one Member State to another for a specific period of time or for more permanent establishment.

Why, however, have the measures programmed since 2000 been of limited success? The policies of the Member States do not converge in promoting quality education.
European citizens are not being told that 45% of future jobs will go to university graduates, 40% will go to people who have completed secondary school and that only 15% of jobs will go to people who have completed compulsory education and that this compulsory education does not reduce the percentage of those who abandon it.
Adults are not participating satisfactorily in lifelong learning programmes.
Only those who work illegally have achieved mobility. For the rest it is a utopia.
Â Â  Mr President, two weeks ago, the police in Sweden carried out a fifty-man raid in order to shut down a website that facilitated file-sharing. A large number of servers were confiscated in a string of different companies that had nothing to do with the activity in question, and operations in these small businesses were shut down.
In addition, a number of people were forced to give DNA samples on the grounds of being suspected of committing what is a very minor crime.
Even more serious is the fact that a political opponent of the music industry â and it was the music industry that had forced this raid to occur â had his website taken offline in the middle of our election campaign and was thus unable fully to participate in the open debate by advocating a liberal form of legislation in respect of file-sharing for private use where there is no intent to make a profit.
In the past, the music industry has always attempted to put a stop to every technical development, such as cassettes, digital music players and writable CDs. It has always been wrong â all of these new inventions have always led to increased sales.
It is therefore regrettable if the police are assisting in stifling the debate.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to bring to the attention of the House that a second poultry processing industry has closed down in my constituency in the last two weeks, with the loss of 300 to 400 jobs.
That comes after a loss of 600 jobs in a small place like Northern Ireland.
When I enquired about the reason for this, I was told in no uncertain terms that it was mainly because of cheap imports from Thailand and Brazil.
We have serious questions to ask ourselves in Europe. I believe very strongly that there must be strict standards for food and how chickens are produced.
Europe cannot and must not stand by and allow our producers to be forced out of the market. We need clear labelling to show where food is produced.
We must give the consumer the choice.
Let us at least give our farmers, our producers, half a chance to solve this problem.
Â Â  â Mr President, huge deposits of gold, silver and copper are thought to exist beneath various glaciers on the border between Chile and Argentina. Unemployment in the surrounding region is very high, and the people live almost exclusively from farming.
Several firms are now proceeding to mine these mineral resources in a way that gives great cause for concern.
Substances containing arsenic are being used, and some glaciers are to be partly removed and rebuilt in new locations, which I find very hard to envisage.
Environmental agencies fear harmful effects â especially due to arsenic â on the Huasco valley, in which 70Â 000 smallholders cultivate crops using irrigation. Environmental groups and the inhabitants of the region have protested against this, but the Chilean Governmentâs regrettable response to them has been to give the go-ahead for the mining to commence.
In doing so, it knowingly accepts that the ecological balance of the region will be destroyed. I therefore call upon the Commission to give its attention to this problematic project and to submit proposals as to how its abandonment might be brought about.



Â Â  â Mr President, I congratulate my honourable friend MrÂ Cashman on the report which he is presenting to the European Parliament, because the exercise of the right to petition by European citizens must be considered a basic means of strengthening awareness of European nationality.
The Commissioner presented in great detail the views of the European Commission for the part of the report which concerns the Commission.
It is true that European citizens use both charges to the Commission â as the Commission's 22nd report on the control of the application of Community law shows â and petitions to the European Parliament as a means of strengthening their wish to see Community law applied.
On the one hand, we wish European citizens to be conscientious judges of the common ; on the other hand, however, we do not give them the possibility of having the same treatment both from the Commission and from Parliament's Committee on Petitions given that, as is clearly understandable from Mr Cashman's report, their officially elected representatives cannot check petitions from the first stage.
Transparency is also missing in the decisions of the European Commission, the presence of the Council is missing and we support the view expressed in the report that the method and procedure for receiving and examining petitions need to be changed, so that European citizens feel that their petition really is being examined without party political or other criteria by a secretariat which remains neutral and does not interfere in the work of the MEPs.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I would like to welcome Mr Cashmanâs report, which is as good as we expected it would be. The European Union is facing a malaise in citizensâ confidence.
The strongest message was the rejection of the Constitution a year ago.
The message that citizens are sending is clear.
They demand more transparency and more openness from us. They want politicians and institutions to show more interest in problems that affect citizens personally.
It is clear that various consultation exercises that have been undertaken at European level have had some effect: we are hearing the message now, but we should also listen.
In order to do that, more resources must be provided for the various bodies that have the most direct contact with citizens and, without excluding any other body, personally I would start with the Committee on Petitions.
As Mr Cashmanâs report makes clear, the role of that committee is very significant in bringing citizensâ concerns and problems to the attention of European institutions.

But as well as Parliament providing more resources for the Committee on Petitions, other institutions, especially the Commission, must provide more resources for reducing delays in responding to citizens.

I therefore particularly support paragraphs 20 to 23 of the report and I hope that there can be a debate in all the political groups, as well as in the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, on how to reinforce our work to assist citizens.
Parliament should give that high priority during the second half of the parliamentary term.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one year after the 'no' of the French and Dutch to the Constitutional Treaty, we are going though a period of confusion as to how we can bring Europe closer to its citizens. However, Europe means precisely its citizens; it means precisely its institutions.
For its citizens, Europe means the institutions, except that the institutions often give the impression that they are working a long way from the world.
If the Union is defending the rights of its citizens, this must be perceptible in their everyday life.
The right to petition is one of the most important means for everyone to feel active within the European construct.
The right to petition is one of the most important tools in highlighting a social and people-orientated Europe.
The establishment of our committee and the European Ombudsman are steps which were made because we have recognised our imperfections and weaknesses.
We must make more use of these facilities for communication with the citizens. Our rapporteur quite rightly calls for the Committee on Petitions to be strengthened both at the level of the secretariat and at the level of political staff.
Indeed, we must inform the citizens better of our existence and, in all events, the Commission and the Council or the Member States must stop fearing further cooperation with us. They should know that highlighting problems by resolving them creates credibility.
In other words, it creates citizens who are gradually won over to the European idea, all those who are against transparency or who do not want Europe or who are eurosceptics.

Congratulations Michael.

Â Â  (MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, apart from your valued personal commitment, what we have heard is insufficient.
In my opinion, Europe needs to adopt two interconnected approaches in order to persevere with this matter.
The aim of the first approach must be to break up the vicious triangle linking victims, traffickers and clients.
This would certainly require a concrete and binding programme of action: an example of true European cooperation which, as you have said, can exist only in the medium or long term.
We shall listen attentively to whatever future course you may suggest to us, bearing in mind that this problem will certainly not go away once the World Cup championship is over.
Nevertheless, we must enlist the participation of European citizens in hard-hitting, high-visibility campaigns that have major symbolic significance, so that your wishes in this matter become a political priority for all of us.
In this way we shall affirm the idea of a true European people and construct a concept of supranational citizenship.
It has to be admitted that this second feature is missing from the Commissionâs leadership.
Steps have been taken by the political parties with the campaign of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, by the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality, and by Parliament itself; but the Commission has done nothing. The opportunity could have been taken to create a space for self-representation of the Community ethos that we are trying to construct, which provides the ethical framework for our European public space.
Europe is not present at the World Cup championship.
That weakens the very communication plan that the Commission has proposed with great ceremony: that is to say, Plan D.
I should be concerned to think that the Commission had in fact made no attempts to use its imagination and commitment, thinking that it would be unseemly to spoil the party â a party that involves so many economic and advertising interests.
Perhaps the Commission thinks that the party should not be used to make millions of spectators understand the need to apply the framework law that provides for the indictment of those who coerce individuals into prostitution.
If that were the case I should be concerned; but I hope that things are not as I have described. Commissioner, I hope that you will help us in this matter and also make some symbolic gestures.
For example, you too could hold up the red card before going to support your team and mine.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will remember, the question of forced prostitution during the World Cup was debated at the initiative of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on 8Â March, International Women's Day.
The debate was held not only for symbolic and anniversary reasons; it was a political choice by our committee to sound once again the alarm bell for principles, security and the protection of human rights, women's dignity and the image of Europe in the eyes of its citizens and in the eyes of the citizens of the entire world.
Today we endorse the initiative by MrsÂ ZÃ¡borskÃ¡ to debate the matter once again during the course of these sports activities following accusations of incidents of forced prostitution in Germany. Today we are expressing once again our deep concern about the spread of this disgusting phenomenon.
We are also expressing our concern about the efficacy of our policies.
I am delighted, Commissioner, that you share our positions on the extent of this phenomenon and on the need to combat it with every preventive and repressive measure in the host country and in the countries of origin.
Recently, a delegation from our committee visited Athens and discussed with the competent government agencies and parliamentary colleagues the need for transnational cooperation, the need to apply laws and the need to train police and court officers. We realised the importance of protecting the victims and raising the awareness of society.
I have paid close attention to the plans which you explained, Commissioner, about studying the phenomenon and the specific measures which you mentioned, as we also discussed on 8Â March.


However, the specific situation which has arisen in Germany constitutes an opportunity for us to check how aware we are and how determined we are to become effective, both the political agencies and society, by which I mean society in the Member States and the European community.


Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, I fear that you have confined yourself â and that we have confined ourselves â to statements, descriptions, studies and more remote, future policies on the taking of fundamental decisions on combating forced prostitution gangs.

Even in your references to the work of the German Government, which truly is an achievement today, these days, you did not clarify how the national local authorities should work in order to dismantle or combat these gangs at once and not with cross-border cooperation now that the goods have left the factory gate.
FIFA, on the other hand, is doing nothing, while it could have informed supporters and national teams months ago, it could have run an information campaign for the people who follow these matches and FIFA knows it.
Why? Because FIFÎ may consider that forced prostitution is bad advertising for these football matches.
We as the European Union did not even manage to convince an organisation like FIFÎ of this.
On the other hand, the European Union has, if you like, a strong communications policy, but you, MrÂ Frattini, did not over these months apply a major, resounding communications strategy with TV spots during the matches being held, in cooperation with the advertising companies, in cooperation with FIFA itself, with the result that these red cards are the only communications policy, the policy which is community policy against forced prostitution.
I therefore consider, MrÂ Frattini, that we left the German Government without help.
It is fighting a huge fight with no means of communication. Above all, however, I fear that we shall confine ourselves to studies, we shall abandon the victims and we shall say that the operation was a success but the patient died and every day, women and children will die behind locked doors.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, buying sex is not a sport. Football and sex do not go hand in hand.
The European Union must call on Angela Merkelâs German government to combat the organised trafficking of women for the purposes of prostitution during the World Cup.
Sex workers, whom Germany considers perfectly legal, and who normally receive many clients a day, will not be able to satisfactorily meet the extra demand of potential clients there will be from the millions of male World Cup spectators.
What, therefore, could be more natural than for the sex industry to import some 45Â 000 women from Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America in order to satisfy the wishes of these gentlemen?
It is not a matter of going against German laws, but of putting an end to this openly organised trafficking of women.
The trafficking of women constitutes a violation of the fundamental rights of the individual and, in particular, of the right to dignity and respect for physical and mental integrity and of the right not to be subjected to violence.
Governments must ensure protection and respect for the rights of individuals who are victims of trafficking and, in particular women and young girls who are forced into prostitution. Therefore, we must concentrate more on the traffickers and their networks of organised crime which exploit these women, and not on the women themselves.
This sexual exploitation must cease and appropriate and effective measures must be put in place against this mafia of sex.
I am especially delighted by the petition launched by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament (PSE) to put a stop to this organised prostitution and this iniquitous treatment of thousands of women.
I am very much in support of this initiative and strongly condemn the organised trafficking of women, which turns them into commodities.

In this context, Commissioner, are you going to take into account some of our proposals, such as the launch of a prevention campaign targeting potential victims and informing them of the dangers and risks of recruitment into these networks, or the installation of a direct multilingual telephone line backed up by a vast publicity campaign?
Â Â  The debate is closed.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is proclaiming today how important water is to us.
We are therefore all in agreement in this House that the question is precisely how we intend to protect groundwater.
We know from the European Environment Agency that 87% of groundwater already contains excessive nitrate concentrations. In Germany, groundwater can contain one to seven times the permitted level of nitrates, especially in areas where large-scale livestock farming takes place.


In the body, nitrates are converted into toxic nitrites, which increase the risk of cancer and can lead to life-threatening cyanosis, especially in infants.

We must surely all agree that we cannot continue to allow exceptions. That is another point at issue in this vote.
We certainly shall not vote for exceptions to the ceiling of 50 milligrams of nitrates per litre of groundwater, since such exceptions are likely to result in widespread contamination.
We really must emphasise strongly today that we have no intention of permitting exceptions and that we attach great importance to the preservation of the precautionary principle, for we know that treating contaminated water is ten times more expensive than applying the precautionary principle.
We must vote accordingly.
Forty per cent of groundwater in Europe is already polluted. That must be a warning signal to us, deterring us from any notion of enshrining the right, in exceptional cases, to engage in the bad practices that are still prevalent in many Member States and to exceed the prescribed limits.
That is not an option.
We must put a stop to the daily contamination of groundwater and, above all, we must put an end to the excessive discharges of nitrogen by industrial agriculture, as the previous speaker indicated. The pesticides industry will be doing itself a disservice if it does not take a lively interest in the pursuit of these aims.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my political group agrees that groundwater constitutes the most vulnerable ecosystem, the most important source of water for human consumption and also a basic part of other ecosystems, such as rivers and lakes.
Over 2/3 of drinking water comes from reserves of groundwater and a great deal of damage has already been done.
The quality of groundwater has deteriorated greatly and this deterioration has affected the environment and public health and the economy.
More than half of all groundwater, according to specialist scientists, has already been polluted and any fundamental prospect of cleaning it up would be extremely time-consuming and extremely expensive; hence, we need to act promptly, because a great many consumers, our fellow European citizens, have now lost their confidence in tap water, preferring bottled water, which sometimes costs up to one thousand times more. Apart from this, we do not have enough information on the connection between the development of the animal ecosystem and the use of groundwater, which means that we do not know the damage that contamination of the groundwater is doing to the animal ecosystem.
My political group considers that the directive we are debating on the protection of groundwater constitutes the most important legislative tool for maintaining clean groundwater in Europe.
We therefore need a strong directive and not a simple declaration of good intentions, as contained in the extremely inadequate common position of the Council. That is why my political group would like to thank the rapporteur, MrsÂ KlaÃ, on a job well done, although this does not mean that in the stage of the debate and the procedure up to second reading there were not also points with which we disagreed.
However, we have a satisfactory compromise and we have also come very close to the Commission. What is needed is for the Council to agree at long last, because if we leave it to the discretion of the Member States to prevent the contamination of groundwater from dangerous substances, we shall set this issue a long way behind existing legislative texts whereas, on the contrary, we need to push forward, to deal effectively with serious pollution from nitrates and to become more effective in our prevention policy.
My political group therefore wants a legally binding text, which is clear and has strict consequences for those who infringe it, based on prevention and on continual control by the European Commission.
To deny this common responsibility towards European citizens and consumers would be a dangerous mistake.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I warmly welcome this proposed directive, the intention of which is to ensure that groundwater quality is monitored and evaluated across Europe in a harmonised way.
It sets out an inherently flexible approach to establishing quality criteria, taking account of local characteristics and allowing for further improvements.


I welcome the measures established in the directive, which lays down mandatory criteria for assessing the chemical status of groundwater and for identifying trends in the pollution of groundwater bodies, while also introducing measures for protecting groundwater from indirect pollution.
I agree with the rapporteur that the directive should be made more ambitious and effective.
In many parts of the European Union and Ireland where there are no rivers or lakes, or these are polluted, groundwater is often the only source of fresh water.
We are fortunate in my country to have fresh water resources, and must ensure that future generations have access to the same quality and supply of that water.
As we develop, pressure on that resource has increased and will continue to do so.
Groundwater is a resource that we need to protect because once it is polluted it cannot be used for many years.
This generation â or any other for that matter â has no right to destroy or deplete such a rare and precious resource.
Â Â  .
Mr President, Commissioner Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, I should first of all like to say a word of thanks to MrsÂ KlaÃ for the work she has done in expertly piloting this dossier through second reading. The fact that her report has received unanimous approval in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety demonstrates that she has taken a line with which many can identify.
We cannot do other than conclude that the common position adopted by the Council last year is out of synch with the line this Parliament took at first reading.
Particularly with regard to the definition of decline, this common position could do with some further sharpening-up.
Fortunately, tomorrow, we will be adopting many amendments which will considerably improve the common position.
One that springs to mind is AmendmentÂ 30, which concerns the harmonisation of measuring methods.
We know that certain Member States achieve excellent results because they over-adjust their measurements.
AmendmentÂ 30 will in any event mean that those methods are monitored, which is a welcome development.
In the Netherlands too, groundwater is used for extracting drinking water.
It is also a back-up supply for future generations.
Since pollution destroys resources, it must be avoided at all costs. I should like to ask for your support for AmendmentÂ 44, which was tabled by my group colleague, MrÂ Bonde.
An identical amendment was accepted in respect of the fluorine gas directive, and eventually ended up being incorporated into it. Should you feel that this amendment goes too far, I would urge you to support AmendmentÂ 37 in any case.
I am still left with a question for CommissionerÂ Dimas.
He claimed that the objectives of the nitrate directive and this groundwater directive are the same.
My question is then whether it would be necessary for this nitrate directive to continue to exist alongside this groundwater directive in future.
I look forward to his response.
Â Â  MrÂ President, groundwater has been a central issue for the environmental movement right since the movement began in the 1970s.
We warned that both industry and agriculture were endangering this precious resource.
âProphets of doomâ they shouted at us, âit will take at least 30 yearsâ.
Well, thank you very much indeed.
In many places things went much quicker than that, but in some Member States we have, however, been able to keep the groundwater clean and to avoid having the dubious permits sought by all those who, instead of clean water, talked of healthy water with an in-built allowance for what humans and animals can tolerate.
The attacks on our clean water continue. We have had a more or less serviceable Groundwater Directive, which allowed the Member States to preserve the requirement for clean water.
Then we got a really good Water Framework Directive â a directive that has been a credit to the EU. What happens, however?
The agriculture lobby is now attempting to demolish the Water Framework Directive by the ugly tactic of weakening it wherever possible, as we see with the proposal for the new Groundwater Directive.
Fortunately, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was able to repair the demolition work.
It is now absolutely critical that its emendations be adopted.
The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) has pointed out that 87% of European agricultural land is more polluted than the current guidelines recommend.
In May, the EEB sent us a letter containing a powerful recommendation to support the reinstatement proposal on which we will be voting on Wednesday.
At issue, in particular, are AmendmentÂ 22, partÂ 1 and Amendments 24, 26 and 38, all of which are aimed at clarifying the regulations, and also Amendments 36, 42 and 43, which remove the absurd exemptions from the directive applying to agriculture â exemptions that would be an outright disgrace in terms both of the groundwater and of the reputation of the EU.
If these amendments are not adopted, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will never be able to support proposals that undermine what we already have.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to emphasise a few points about groundwater which we have to keep in mind, even at this stage.
The distinction between groundwater and surface water is not always clear.
Water is not neatly compartmentalised in every location, so where these sources of water are linked, where they mingle, polluted surface water will pollute groundwater and vice versa.
The pollution of ground and surface water is a concern in my constituency of Munster, particularly in view of environmental disasters like the deserted tailings pond in Silvermines, County Tipperary, the red mud and salt lake ponds which get bigger every day at Aughinish, an alumina extraction factory in Limerick, and Kilworth, North Cork, where liquid toxic waste is dumped in trenches and left to seep into the earth.
Another concern is that Irish governments have systematically polluted surface and groundwater for the past 40 years in the water fluoridation programme, with the daily addition of hexafluorosilic acid, a bio-accumulating toxin.


But there is another issue that we should take seriously.
In this proposed directive, we deal with quality standards and pollutant levels in groundwater.
However, we seem to waive sensible levels if the pollutant occurs naturally in groundwater. No matter how much of the pollutant is in the water, we seem to want to call that the baseline, the acceptable level.
This will not work.
Just because something is natural, it does not necessarily mean it is healthy.
This mistake was made in India in 1970s and 1980s, in attempting to solve water shortages.
International development funds were spent boring a large number of deep wells. The wells supplied a lot of water, but babies in the vicinity of many of those wells were born with congenital bone malformations.
Skeletal diseases began to afflict the children and the adult populations too.
Many of the wells had to be closed.
The water was natural, but that did not make it safe. It had a significant content of fluoride that had no time to filter through the layers of mineral rock, which would have bound the fluoride to stabilising minerals like calcium, making them less toxic and less absorbable.
A hundred years ago, people thought that water that was highly, if naturally, radioactive, was good and flocked to spas to drink and bathe in it. At first it made them feel wonderful, then it made them ill and then it killed them.
Is it not possible that, theoretically, an industry with a particular type of toxic discharge could choose to locate itself in an area that had naturally polluted but natural groundwater?
We should consistently base our acceptable levels of polluting substances on what is acceptable, that is, what is safe and non-polluting and what is healthy if the water is to be drunk.
Â Â  Mr President, may I offer my sincere thanks to MrsÂ Klass for her fine work. I can enthusiastically endorse 99% of her report.
I should also like to come back to what MrÂ Mulder said about our requiring comparable standards in Europe, not necessarily standards like those in Germany or the Netherlands but standards which ensure that comparable rules apply to all clay soils and to all sandy soils.
When I hear my honourable colleagues, however â some of whom have already decamped again â I am quite astonished to note that the Nitrates Directive evidently has not yet been transposed in their respective countries, otherwise they would not be raising such a hue and cry.
If their governments had transposed the Nitrates Directive â and I say this as one of the few farmers in this House who is still running a real farm â this situation could not arise. In the fields of Europe today, farmers can only use as much fertiliser as their crops will actually absorb.
We can therefore conduct this debate again with those who really know the ropes and who do not believe it is enough simply to impose standards.
It is certainly not enough. That is why the link with the Nitrates Directive is badly needed as a basis for intervention.
The Commission had no option but to present a good proposal of this type, because as a farmer you can only influence what you yourself actually do in your own fields.
With the best will in the world, you cannot influence the deposits that result from geogenic processes rather than your own agricultural activity; try as you might, the best you can hope for is that trends will be reversed over many decades, perhaps in 50 to 100 years. This is why I believe that the combination of a nitrates directive and a groundwater directive must be preserved, and I shall campaign actively for that.
Moreover, my fellow campaigners are not confined to those who always champion the cause of clean air. The desire for pure air, water and soil were the crucial reasons for the decision I took 17 years ago to go to Brussels rather than stand for election to my national parliament.
It was for this, MrsÂ Auken, that I fought with a will alongside your brother, who was Minister for the Environment at that time, and we managed to secure progress in many areas. He was involved, as you know, in the negotiation of the Nitrates Directive.
Â Â  Mr President, I should like to associate myself with the numerous congratulations offered to the rapporteur for her good work.
With this report and the unanimous backing it has received from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have a good basis for drawing the fangs from the common position. Our vote tomorrow must send a clear signal on health and the environment, while our amendments, which are very likely to be adopted tomorrow, strengthen ArticleÂ 6, thereby making it a clear sign of intent to protect the environment more effectively.
May I also stress that it is essential to avoid any exceptions.
The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources.
It is important that the amendment relating to this provision should be adopted.
Such an exception would complicate the monitoring of diffuse sources and lead to legal uncertainty.

One of the keys to the protection of our groundwater is a set of uniform European standards for the main pollutants.
Only with such standards can distortions of competition and environmental dumping be prevented.
The ceiling for nitrates should be set at 50Â milligrams, and there must be no exceptions for agricultural activity, which is primarily responsible for the pollution of groundwater in many parts of Europe.
I therefore wholeheartedly support the amendments formulated to this effect.

Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to add my voice to the thanks that have been expressed to MrsÂ Klass, who has set out a very ambitious stall in pursuit of this important aim, despite having to swim against a fairly strong tide, of course, from within our own ranks.
I had, however, expected a more ambitious proposal from the Commission and the Council and in particular a clearer, more targeted and more enforceable common position. I do not believe that this common position of the Council does justice to ArticleÂ 17 of the Water Framework Directive.
Why?
Because it ignores the fact that groundwater is an ecosystem in its own right. Moreover, the requirements it makes regarding the protection of groundwater are not geared to the conservation of groundwater in the most natural state possible.
Let us bear in mind that people throughout most of the territory of Europe obtain their drinking water from groundwater reserves and that this water can still be extracted fresh from the source without any treatment. That is how it must stay, and indeed there is even a need to improve the situation.
Another main point of criticism is that the Member States are given wide discretionary powers, particularly with regard to the assessment of the chemical status of groundwater, to the specification of criteria for the reversal of growth in pollutant concentrations and to the definition of a starting point for the reversal of this trend.
This naturally rules out the uniform implementation of the provisions of both the Water Framework Directive and the present daughter directive â with regard to the trend reversal, for example â from the outset.
If the Member States already have to provide a full description of every substance as part of the measuring process â which is an extremely good requirement, in my view â we must surely see to it that Community or simply national quality standards are defined.
Sampling procedures must be improved, and the wording of the instrument as a whole must be tightened in order to close loopholes that the Member States might exploit and to ensure that the whole directive is not watered down.
Â Â  Mr President, when we talk about treasures hidden in the ground, these days everybody thinks of oil, natural gas or rare minerals, although we also have a more fundamental treasure: groundwater.
In many countries, including Hungary, groundwater provides most of the drinking water, almost 90% of it.
Therefore, it is important to protect this treasure from pollution, and this is only possible within the framework of cooperation between countries, because groundwater bodies do not take into account country borders. Also, the natural processes affecting the composition of groundwater extend over several decades, which means that pollution will not only affect us, but future generations, as well.
Therefore it is important to create a strict law setting several definite limit values, which â let us admit it honestly â has only been partially successful, due to resistance from a few Member States.
All is not lost yet, however.
This is why I support the proposals regarding the specification of a separate nitrate limit value, and for the same reason I believe that we cannot exempt agriculture, either, because the exemption of agriculture would undermine the efficiency of the Directive.
Obviously, the strict measures I advocate do not mean that we should forget about the different natural characteristics of each country.
Just as clean natural waters can be a rare treasure of a country, natural pollution is also a characteristic that we must accept, especially when there is nothing we can do about it. There is no point in burdening such areas with regulations that cannot be complied with, and which pose unjustified restrictions on human activity.
âSanus per aquamâ (health through water) is a very relevant Roman saying.
Let us do everything in our power to ensure that it stays true.
Thank you very much, and I would like to congratulate MrsÂ KlaÃ, the rapporteur, on her excellent work.
Â Â  Mr President, chemical pollution of groundwater has been happening for years, but with the development of the chemical industry the problem has got significantly worse.
Subterranean waters migrate, and it will be difficult to achieve positive results in their preservation without changes in regions of other EU Member States, both near and more distant.
For that reason I would like to raise one of many important issues.
The proposal for a directive proposes upper limits for pesticide content.

However, in addition to the pesticides used for current production, there are tens of thousands of tons of old pesticides stored in individual countries, the majority of them poorly protected â if at all â from the effects of rainfall, wind and humans who continue to use these combinations of various pesticides to protect their plants.

It may appear that the quantity of pesticides used on the surface is falling, but we know that there are also large quantities in groundwater.
If we want to protect groundwater, and therefore our health, we can, and indeed must, find the funding to deactivate and eliminate such stores of pesticides.
Â Â  .
Mr President, I should like to put a supplementary question to the Commissioner.
Did I hear correctly just now that the Commission can accept Amendments 36 and 43?
That is precisely what we have been discussing from such diametrically opposed positions here.
Perhaps the translation has confused the issue somewhat.
Could you explain what you said, Commissioner?
I should be delighted if you could accept these amendments too, because they relate, of course, to the mutual compatibility of the directives. What I heard seemed to be open to interpretation, and a few explanatory words would be welcome.
Â Â  â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Tuesday at noon.

Â Â  .
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Seeber for his very effective work on this important report.
What we have now is a proposed directive, which is strong enough to offer people protection without duplicating the work done by other authorities, particularly at the regional and the local levels and which is also good for the environment.
I was particularly interested in this proposal because some years ago a region in Wales suffered very serious flooding, and that highlighted the inadequate measures then in place to prevent or to cope with such a natural disaster.
Much of the suffering and disruption created could have been avoided.
With the increasing effects of climate change on our environment, it is essential for us to have a coordinated and well thought-out approach to flooding, which is increasing in both frequency and intensity in the EU.
Of course, we do not want to prevent all flooding.
Floods are a natural phenomenon and they are important for maintaining the ecological functioning of an ecosystem. But we need sustainable flood risk management and relevant policies and financial mechanisms to deliver that.
With flood levels increasing, dykes, dams and other infrastructure measures are failing to provide protection, so these need to be assessed in a comprehensive way.
Cost recovery measures also need to be introduced, making economics work for the environment.
We have to promote measures that work with nature in managing floods, not against it, and must understand, for example, that areas currently with no flood risk may be of huge flood mitigation value in the future, and include them in the maps and plans.

Finally, in order for this directive to be effective and enforceable and to reduce bureaucracy, it should fully respect the Water Framework Directive, and I would ask colleagues to support the amendments I have put forward for my group, which would ensure the compatibility of the two.

Â Â  Mr President, the directives of the European Parliament and of the Council on the assessment and management of floods relate to phenomena that have been known for centuries.


The flow of water changes as a result of the regulation of rivers, farming, the felling and disappearance of forests, and therefore training on how to react in the event of floods is needed to limit the effects and the threats.
In places where dykes, embankments and polders have been built and there are no obstructions to the flow of water, far less damage was suffered during the âflood of the centuryâ. Their roads were not destroyed, because they have large culverts and high bridges.
The programmes for counteracting floods at the level of catchment areas within municipalities, districts and regions of the European Union need to be carried out with a great deal of imagination and make use of existing experience. The directives support all these activities.
I would like to thank MrÂ Seeber for his work.


Â Â  Mr President, this directive of the European Parliament is an important step towards the safety of the whole of Europe.
In July 1997 Poland suffered the worst floods seen in 200 years, which covered 2% of the countryâs territory.
This cataclysm had a huge economic, social and moral cost, with 55 deaths and the destruction of hundreds of thousands of homes, factories, water treatment plants, schools and historical buildings.
The losses caused by the floods were estimated at PLN 13 billion, or in other words approximately EURÂ 3Â billion.
The floods later affected other European countries.
The proposal for a directive emphasises that the planâs main priority is the protection of human life.

Between 1997 and 2005 more than 700 people died as a result of floods in Europe.
To this is added the economic cost of flooded farms, costs associated with damage to transport networks and the environmental cost of chemical contamination, the flooding of landfill sites and soil erosion.
This directive contains specific actions aimed at minimising the damage caused by floods, but we should also remember the ecological and environmental impact they have.
The post-flood renovation carried out in many parts of the European Union led to significant and irrecoverable losses of river fauna and forests.
Hydraulic engineering works were carried out using methods that led to a permanent imbalance in river and forest ecosystems. For this reason we need to pay serious attention to the methods of flood reconstruction so that they preserve, rather than destroy, the ecological balance.
Â Â  Mr President, last year we saw huge floods all over Europe and we cannot forget those sad pictures of the endangered families, countryside and cities.

Flood victims ask politicians, with good reason, to act at national and at European level to prevent disasters.

Floods do not stop at borders.
The flood prevention programme and flood risk maps should be set up not just for individual states, but for river basins.
Large international river basin plans must be coordinated at sub-basin level and measures taken in one country should not raise the flood risk in other states.
This should be a basic criterion for any cooperation inside and outside the EU.
Floods are often followed by environmental pollution caused by industrial, agricultural and other facilities in the area, and sometimes the pollution is more dangerous than the flood itself.
That is why flood risk management maps and plans need to take potential pollution sources into account.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first express my thanks to MrÂ Seeber for his commendable treatment of this draft directive.
We all know how many reasons there are for these increasingly horrific flood disasters. Fortunately, not all of us have had to experience such disasters.
Eighty per cent of our European rivers cross borders and are thus international watercourses, which means that we can all benefit from a set of European rules.
At the same time, we have to emphasise that subsidiarity is a very basic principle and must not be infringed. I am therefore torn between these two positions.
Flood prevention is a classic example of solidarity. I live by the lower stretches of a river, and I know what it means when there are no flood defences upstream, when there are no compensation areas, detention basins or the like, when the upper reaches are constantly being penned in, with the accompanying increase in the speed of flow.
The draft directive guarantees a minimum level of protection of common interests and a degree of solidarity â through the Solidarity Fund, for example, which actually disbursed some 100 million euros to Romania, Bulgaria and the Tyrol in 2005. I believe that the draft takes subsidiarity into consideration, albeit insufficiently.
It could go a bit further in this direction. Needless to say, subsidiarity does not mean that the Member States are released from their responsibilities.
The three-step approach we have outlined is logical: assessment of cross-border risks, compiling of flood maps and preparation of contingency plans for effective risk management.
Even if there were no revision clause, I should be happy to see us discuss after the first five years whether the European approach has actually delivered the desired benefits.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it has been a case of âwater, water everywhereâ this evening, with no end in sight!
I welcome the call for international coordination of flood-risk management measures, and I thank my honourable colleague MrÂ Seeber for his balanced report.
Water knows no boundaries, not only groundwater but also, and especially, the water carried by rivers, and for many of these rivers there are already cross-border plans and, as a result, cross-border measures too.
Anyone who looks at the Rhine and the Moselle, which flows through my native region, as international European rivers will be aware that flood problems can only be tackled through the joint action of all the riparian states. If you observed peopleâs responses to flooding in our area, you might think that the inhabitants of the Moselle area had mastered flood management, that they had, as it were, become well practised in the art.
However, anyone whose family has ever had to clear out their cellar, barn or indeed their entire dwelling on hearing an announcement from Trier that the water level is set to rise within the next hour by a certain number of centimetres, knowing that this will bring it into the hallway of their home â and thank God we can obtain such accurate information these days â will know what it means to be on constant standby whenever there is heavy or prolonged rainfall and will know all about the physical effort, the cost and the time involved in coping with these trials and tribulations.
No region ever gets used to floods.
Now we have been struggling with these problems for many years and during that time have found cross-border allies too.
There have been rewarding experiences upon which we can build. Prevention and management in areas prone to flooding must be the task of the competent local bodies operating on the basis of internationally harmonised rules.
In line with the aim of cutting red tape, the obligations of all authorities and tiers of government to the Commission must be kept to a minimum.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, greater involvement of the European institutions is essential if tourism is to be developed in a more sustainable fashion.
I therefore share the concerns that prompted the question by my fellow Member MrÂ QueirÃ³, particularly because I come from a country, Portugal, and more specifically from an outermost region, Madeira, where tourism is one of the most significant factors for its economic and social development. In addition, although tourism lies within the competence of the Member States, the Union has an important role to play in this field through political guidelines and actions at a European level.
The Unionâs action, in supporting, coordinating and supplementing the Member Statesâ actions â as indeed is laid down in the Treaty that has yet to be ratified â adds significant value to national policies and actions aiming at the sustainable development of the tourist industry.
I shall mention two points in support of European action: the major economic and social significance of tourism, associated with the importance of the new information and communications technologies and with the innovation that it promotes, will make this one of the sectors that will contribute most to competitiveness and job creation, in line with the Lisbon Strategy.
Secondly, the European Union is the principal world tourist destination, and EU citizens are the ones that most use tourism services and most visit the EUâs tourist destinations.
Lastly, in view of the Unionâs and the Member Statesâ competences in the tourism field, as mentioned before, and bearing in mind the need for greater integration and cohesion of the actions carried out by the Union, the Member States and the regions, I call for closer cooperation, coordination and the provision of information not only between the Union and the Member States and regions, but also among the institutions themselves: Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Hence the importance of this moral issue in drawing the necessary commitment from the Commission and the Council to follow up the relevant initiatives proposed by Parliament for sustainable development, particularly through the creation of Destination Europe, the European Union brand, and an assurance that touristsâ rights will be protected and safeguarded.
Â Â  Mr President, not only has tourism been somewhat forcibly tacked on to the Committee on Transport like a spare wheel, but on top of that we are discussing it so late at night.
It is hard to associate tourism with the night.
Some of the most interesting programmes, with great significance for tourism, are the ârural renewalâ programmes.
They have a long tradition in Germany and Austria, and are slowly being introduced in other countries such as Poland. They are, however, exclusively local in nature, sometimes benefiting from regional support.
However their acknowledged value means that they should become the focus of the European Unionâs interest, and of course an object of financial interest.
Hence my very specific question: could the European Commission not consider establishing a special programme of promotion and financial support for rural renewal? Would it not be worth attending to such initiatives to a significantly larger extent than now?
In my view these are rhetorical questions, but I would like the Commissionâs answer to be more than just rhetorical.
Â Â  â The next item is the joint debate on:
1. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0202/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013) (COM(2005)0119 â C6-0099/2005 â 2005/0043(COD)), and
2. the report by Jerzy Buzek (A6-0203/2006), on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for nuclear research and training activities (2007 to 2011) (COM(2005)0119 â C6-0112/2005 â 2005/0044(CNS)).
Â Â  . Mr President, today is an important day for science.
With your support, we can look ahead to a EURÂ 54.5 billion research programme to be launched by the end of this year.
EURÂ 54.5 billion in current prices is less than we had proposed, but it is a substantial increase on the current programme and we also have to thank Parliament for that.
Together, we are making the Seventh Framework Programme a programme for boosting growth and jobs, for promoting a sustainable and healthy Europe.
It is also a programme for a stronger Europe: research unites in diversity.
For that to happen, we need cooperation, ideas, people and capacities and those are the titles of the four main axes in the Framework Programme.
The cooperation programme will bring together our best talents from across Europe to research and develop and find answers on economic opportunities and societal challenges, for example in the areas of health and energy.
The ideas programme will introduce a new mindset in supporting and conducting research in Europe.
The people programme will attract and motivate the best scientists to work across Europe or beyond, for the benefit of European research.
The capacities programme will ensure that Europe can rely on excellent capacities for conducting research in all parts of Europe.
Our continuous efforts towards simplification will ensure that we attract the best participants, irrespective of size or origin, and that we get the best value for our investment.
I am impressed by the consensus that has emerged in Parliament on Framework Programme that delivers on the ambition.
I wholeheartedly thank Mr Chichester, chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the rapporteur, Mr Buzek, the shadow rapporteurs and all other Members of Parliament who made this possible.
Your objective is to further improve the Seventh Framework Programme.
I am pleased to say that the Commission will be able to accept no less than two thirds of your amendments, either as a whole or in principle.
Some other amendments are, in our assessment, too detailed for the Framework Programme, or they go beyond the remit of research and development.
We will quickly come to an agreement on those.
Some amendments create difficulties for the Commission.
They concern topics for which we have a shared understanding of their importance and priority, but not yet on how to realise them.
I do not think that they should become stumbling blocks.
They relate, for example, to keeping space and security together as one priority, avoiding the definition of a quantitative target for SME participation, preventing the introduction of support in the people programme for interregional mobility within the same country and ensuring that technology platforms remain flexible, bottom-up and industry-driven in defining strategic research agendas and guiding their implementation.
Let me spend a little time on two issues which have been the subject of your intense debate.
I should like to start with the European Research Council.
This is probably the most exciting new development in the European research landscape.
Parliamentâs strong support will help to make it a reality.
We have to get the structure right, so that independence is guaranteed in support of scientific excellence and administrative capacity is available in support of efficiency.
The Community method can guarantee this and it is for this reason that we have proposed to set up the ERC within the remit of the Community institutions.
I am sure that we will be able to accommodate much of the substance of Parliamentâs amendments in a way that will also help to create common ground with the Council.
However, I am afraid that a review in 2008, after only one year of operation, will not be very meaningful.
Much as I understand Parliamentâs wish to be associated with the European Research Councilâs success, I do not think we have the appropriate legal basis to decide on the follow-up to the review in codecision.
I am most concerned, however, about proposals to predetermine the future structure of the European Research Council even at this stage.
What message would we give out with such an automatic change of structure?
That we got it wrong in the first place?
That the ERC we set up will not be independent?
I simply cannot accept that logic.
It would not help us in our joint aim to create a European Research Council of which we can all be proud.
I believe that we are enabling the ERC to be independent and efficient.
I have heard Professor Kafatos, chairman of the ERC Scientific Council, say on several occasions that the structure proposed by the Commission, as well as the stance taken by the Commission, ensures precisely that.
We propose that an independent review should be carried out, with the full involvement of various parties, not least the Scientific Council, in time for the future structure of the ERC to be considered not later than 2010.
The review should look explicitly at the advantages and the disadvantages of a structure based on an executive agency and a structure based on ArticleÂ 171 of the Treaty.
The ERCâs structures and mechanisms should be modified in accordance with its findings. This should be done in consultation with Parliament, but always with a view to maintaining the total independence of the ERC from any political influence.
As regards the administrative and staffing costs of the ERC: yes, we want a lean and cost-effective implementation structure, but, no, at this stage we do not know enough to impose strict and specific limits for administrative costs that might risk undermining the functioning of the ERC at its outset.
Let me turn to the issue of stem cell research.
I know that this has been a matter of intense discussion amongst many of you and I should like to say at the outset that I have profound respect for each personal opinion.
The Commission learned from the intense debate on this issue during the negotiations on the Sixth Framework Programme.
We are convinced that, in view of the diversity of approaches existing in Europe, we can only propose a responsible, cautious and practical approach, evaluating and selecting this type of research on a case-by-case basis and excluding certain specific research areas.
The procedure established for the Sixth Framework Programme ensures that some major health challenges and the hopes of the patients concerned are addressed through this research.
At the same time, it guarantees respect for fundamental ethical principles in a way that it is unique for a research programme covering 25 countries or more.
This procedure has proved to work and to be acceptable to Member States and to the scientists.
What we propose is nothing less and nothing more than that the procedure be continued for the Seventh Framework Programme.
The Commission acknowledges very positively the outcome of the vote on this issue by the ITRE Committee, which is entirely in line with the Commissionâs proposal and provides even more useful clarification.
It would be misleading to present a deviation from this approach as a true compromise between proponents and opponents of embryonic stem cell research.
For example, introducing a so-called cut-off date that would make human embryonic stem cell lines eligible or not eligible for Community funds would have far-reaching consequences.
Such a cut-off date has no scientific or objective basis.
It might prevent the European researchers from using the lines they have created and force them to work with lines produced outside Europe.
In addition, it might severely compromise access to the best quality lines which, in this very new field of research, are generally considered to be those most recently produced.
It might unduly limit access to the specific stem cell lines which are indispensable for patients.
In other words, it has to be clear that any date will compromise the label of scientific excellence in this sector which I am personally eager to attach to this Seventh Framework Programme, as long as ethical concerns are taken fully into consideration, which I believe is entirely the case with our proposal.
One last word on subsidiarity: the current strict procedures and limitations on embryonic stem cell research entirely respect the subsidiarity principle.
Relying on the ethical standards of either the most restrictive or the most liberal countries would simply be against the basic principles of the European Union.
I cannot end this introduction without mentioning the very broad agreement on the Euratom programme, which includes the important international scientific project on ITER, and the Joint Research Centre, whose mission you considered very important.
I am very curious to listen to the debate now and hope that it will be possible to add some short concluding remarks afterwards.
This Parliament has truly made excellent progress.
I hope we can maintain this momentum.
Getting FP7 started in time will require an increased effort from all of us.
Time matters!
FP7 is a central part of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs.
It is on that count that Europe can and should deliver on time.
This will be an important signal to our partners in the world, to the whole of Europe and to our scientific community.
I think that our three institutions have never been so close to each other in deciding a Framework Programme.
With your support, we will be able to reach our current goals on time and mobilise our researchers to start participating, as from the end of this year, in the Seventh Framework Programme and in the realisation of the European research area that turns knowledge into true growth and true jobs.
Together we can prove that Lisbon is back again.
Â Â  . Mr President, after over a year of intensive debate, the European Parliament will vote the day after tomorrow on the first reading of the Seventh Framework Programme.
The report is the result of the efforts of many people.
I would like to express my warm thanks to these people today, namely the Luxembourg, UK and Finnish Presidencies and, above all, the Austrian Presidency, the European Commission, and Commissioner PotoÄnik in particular, the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and its chairmen, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs who are here today, who drafted the opinions of eight parliamentary committees.
I would like to thank the coordinators of and advisors to the political groups and the advisors and officials of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.
The debate in the European Parliament has been open and transparent.
During certain periods, the working groups met every day for a number of hours.
Everyone had the time and the opportunity to express their opinions and comments.
I believe that our joint work has borne fruit in the form of a good report.
I also took part in a large number of conferences, seminars and meetings outside the European Parliament, organised by the European Commission, the Member States, universities, regions and non-governmental organisations.
A high level of interest in research and learning at European level was evident everywhere.
We should take advantage of this enthusiasm and potential, as well as fulfilling expectations related to the Seventh Framework Programme.
The debate was not easy, especially due to the absence of a financial perspective.
The cooperation with CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik and the Commission was a great help, however.
The negotiated budget is not an ideal budget, but the earmarking of more than EUR 50Â billion for research, learning and innovation is a step in the right direction for the European Union.
It is the direction set by the Lisbon Strategy and a knowledge-based economy.
The European Parliament strongly supports the structure and the main principles of the Seventh Framework Programme.
This programme takes into account the guidelines featured in the Kok and Marimon reports and especially the Locatelli report, which was presented by the European Parliament at the start of 2005.
The Seventh Framework Programme therefore contains completely new ideas and instruments, such as the European Research Council, which will be concerned with fundamental research, joint technology initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation between science and industry and at innovation, or initiatives such as investment in research infrastructure.
We also have new thematic priorities, namely security and space, and also socio-economic research.
The Seventh Framework Programme also ensures an appropriate continuation of the Sixth Programme with regard to the building of a European Research Area, begun by the previous Commissioner, MrÂ Busquin.
The continuity of the programme affects current thematic priorities, and excellent experience is being built on with regard to the mobility and training of scientists, and especially the Marie SkÅodowska-Curie Programme.
The European Parliament has its own priorities within the Seventh Framework Programme. I will name the four most important ones.
The first priority is excellence as a criterion for all projects and decisions within the scope of the programme.
In order to achieve this, we also have to exploit the potential of each project in terms of experience, research infrastructure, recruiting the best scientists, achievements in various European Union countries and regions and the effective use of financial resources.
The second priority is the chapter âPeopleâ and all initiatives related to the full development of research personnel in Europe and preventing brain drain.
Parliamentâs third priority is fundamental research, described in the chapter on âIdeasâ, and linked with the European Research Council.
Scientists in the European Union have been waiting for such an initiative for many years.
The fourth European Parliament priority is an emphasis on innovation, and overcoming the European paradox of good research but relatively weak innovation.
We need to bring science closer to technology and universities closer to industry, and so we need to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises and their role in research.
We strongly support European technology platforms.
Preparations for the Seventh Framework Programme in the European Parliament were linked with the âCompetitiveness and Innovationâ programme.
I would like to thank the rapporteur working on that programme, MrÂ Chatzimarkakis, for a particularly fruitful collaboration.
Around 1Â 700 amendments were tabled, which reflects the enormous amount of interest in the programme.
Each amendment was the result of talks and meetings in sometimes distant parts of Europe.
Thanks to compromises we eventually managed to reduce the number of amendments to 315, and these will not affect either the structure or the basic principles of the programme.
As far as the content of the amendments is concerned, I would like to highlight a few of the most important issues.
Firstly, in Parliamentâs view, the compromise amendments play a key role, and the greatest emphasis will be placed on these amendments during our negotiations with the Council and Commission.
Secondly, the budget amendment is particularly important as it reflects the priorities of the European Parliament, namely people, the European Research Council, fundamental research, small and medium-sized enterprises, energy and health.
Thirdly, there is no doubt as to the need to ensure the full independence and autonomy of the European Research Council.
Fourthly, it is important to simplify procedures and to facilitate the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme.
Fifthly, emphasis needs to be placed on scientists in the development phase, as it is often the scientists who show the greatest creativity and inventiveness.
We therefore must ensure the development of their scientific careers in Europe.
In sixth place, the division of the thematic priorities security and space seems indispensable.
Finally, as rapporteur I tried to reach as broad a compromise as possible concerning embryonic stem cell research.
It has not been easy, and I hope that on Thursday we will be able to find a solution that a clear majority in Parliament will support.
As far as EURATOM is concerned, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was happy to adopt the proposal of the European Commission by a significant majority.
At this point, I would like to express my admiration for the work of the Joint European Research Centre.
The research carried out by this centre forms part of the framework programmes and yields extremely valuable results.
Finally, I would like to state that in its work on the Seventh Framework Programme, the European Parliament has acted quickly, effectively and decisively.
It has shown great maturity and political responsibility.
I hope that the momentum will be maintained and the Seventh Framework Programme will be launched on 1Â January 2007.
The European scientific community and industry are waiting for a favourable start to the Seventh Framework Programme.
Everyone in the European Union awaits the success of the Lisbon Strategy.
Â Â  . â Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, MrÂ Buzek, on his excellent work.
Our debate today on the Seventh Framework Programme is particularly important.
It relates to the potential for Europe to implement an effective strategy of sustainable development, by investing in knowledge and the future, a policy which will allow it to stand up to international competition not by reducing employment standards and abolishing the social state, but by investing in education, research, innovation and excellence.
In this direction, we as the European Parliament support in principle the need for a significant increase in the appropriations for the seventh framework programme.
Unfortunately, at the European Council in December the restrictive, accounting mentality prevailed, for the financial perspective as a whole and for research and technology in particular.
It is, of course, a question of the governments' credibility, when they blithely set important objectives for the development and competitiveness of the European economy and then fail to express the political will to finance research and technology policies adequately.
With persistent negotiation on the part of Parliament, we achieved a compromise of EUR 50Â 521Â 000, which marginally improves the programme's prospects but is a far cry from the real requirements that need to be covered.
It is certainly positive that an additional EUR 100Â 000Â 000 has been secured for access for small and medium-sized businesses to innovation technologies, as we all recognise their contribution to development and employment.
It is also important that the energy sector has received a further EUR 150Â 000Â 000, because the further spread of renewable sources of energy and the rational use of energy are of vital importance.
I should also like to emphasise that it is important to safeguard the potential for all regions of the European Union to access and apply the programmes under the framework programme as a basic policy of long-term development, convergence and social cohesion, with the core objective of combating the digital divide, the research and innovation divide within Europe.
Â Â  . Mr President, research and the upscaling of Europeâs economy is Europeâs new narrative.
Europe used to be about coal and steel, then it was about agriculture and fisheries.
For the future, Europe is going to be about research and development, and where Europe adds value in coordinating the two.
From a development perspective I would say that it should be regional development.
There is a clear complementarity between the research and regional development agendas.
The key partners in actually delivering the grand research agenda that we set at European level are the cities and the regions and the businesses within those cities and regions.
That complementarity is vital for the coordination of the policies, in order to make sure that one part of the Commission is not setting one set of agendas while another part of the Commission is setting a different set, and that the complementarity is not necessarily what it could be.
I think it is also worth stating that I and others want to see a lot more synergy in FP7 â and, indeed, FP8 â between structural funds and research funding.
While the budget for FP7 is far from what we wanted, it is even more important that we maximise the benefit between the synergies of the two funding streams.
That debate will continue into FP8, though for now I would add my own congratulations to our rapporteur for his Herculean efforts.
We support this compromise.
Â Â  . Mr President, I should like to congratulate MrÂ Buzek on the hard work he has put in over a long period of time, and, of course, the committee as well.
The Seventh Framework Programme is an enormous step forward for science in the European Union, with a vastly increased budget.
For bio-economy, as it is termed in the report, or agronomic research to you and me, this represents a much bigger step, because this research will from now on be dealt with under a separate heading, which is essential for all agronomic research.
This is an enormous improvement.
This is just as well in view of the rapid change that agriculture is undergoing, not only technologically, from food to food combined with bio-energy and the replacement of fossil fuels and plastics, but also in terms of organisational structures.
Room is needed for that type of research too, and that room is now being created.
I have one negative comment to make.
One amendment that was tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and that was approved, insists on us sharing our expertise with the worldâs poor countries where agriculture is so important.
I should like to have the Commissionâs word that this will actually be done, including in the Seventh Framework Programme.
This expertise must be shared, because only then will the Framework Programme help fulfil the EUâs function in the world, namely that of social and sustainable globalisation.
Â Â  . Mr President, the way the fisheries sector is treated in the Seventh Framework Programme clearly contradicts the statements of the Communityâs highest authorities and of the Member States on the priorities for the implementation of the new CFP.
It also contradicts the policy that has just been presented by the European Commission â and that is President Barroso's great priority: an integrated maritime policy, or common policy that takes a holistic view of the seas.
In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to point out that we need greater investment in scientific research in order to provide us with knowledge of all of the potentialities of the marine environment and ecosystems, not just â and I would emphasise this â in relation to fisheries, but also in relation to other extremely important issues such as pollution, climate change, progress on health and pharmacology, human and animal food and coastal planning.
I would like to say therefore, ladies and gentlemen, that we are going to support all of the amendments that advocate this integration of the fisheries policy into the Seventh Framework Programme.
Â Â  . â The Committee on Legal Affairs has considered the ethical questions surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells.
Embryonic stem cells differ from ordinary stem cells in that they are not yet differentiated, and therefore, any component of the human organism can be grown from them.
In compiling the opinion of the committee, I have given two ethical positions:
1) to use embryonic stem cells to treat such incurable diseases as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, infarcted myocardium, etc. This would help prevent premature death in adults, but the embryo itself would die,
2) to protect the embryo, but take away last hope from people suffering from incurable diseases.
A majority of the Committee voted in favour of the second position.
I am personally pleased that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has found a compromise and has submitted appropriate amendments, which I propose that we approve.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I should like to make it clear once more that MrÂ Sakalas is expressing a personal opinion here.
The Committee on Legal Affairs does not have two positions.
It has a clear, unambiguous position rejecting this funding of embryonic stem cells.
I shouldÂ ...
Â Â  â MrsÂ Breyer, I must point out that we cannot reopen the debate of the Committee on Legal Affairs.
MrÂ Sakalas clearly speaks on his own behalf.
Â Â  MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, inequality between men and women is very prevalent in the research world.
It prevents the Lisbon objectives from being achieved, and it is a barrier to European competitiveness.
The very fact that European women are still underrepresented in the research world shows that Europe has huge potential that is not being exploited.
It is a fact that women find it difficult to obtain research posts, simply because they are women.
Even though the number of female candidates is now larger than the number of male candidates in almost all European countries, women come up against major obstacles in the male-dominated market for jobs in science.
That is a state of affairs we must do something about.
It is therefore important that, in implementing the Seventh Framework Programme, the Commission take account of the gender issue and help bring about a situation in which young female candidates have the same opportunities as men in competing for research funds.
The composition of the new European Research Council is quite simply nothing less than a scandal.
Of the 22 researchers that have been appointed, only four are women.
The EU has a list of general rules governing equality, and these should, of course, also apply to the European Research Council.
We in the Committee on Womenâs Rights and Gender Equality have proposed that there be a balance of genders in the Research Council, which should always consist of no less than 40% of each gender.
Commissioner, I do hope you will consider what kind of a signal we are sending out to the European research world by having so unequal a representation of women and men.
It does not, in any case, help put an end to the gender-divided labour market in the research world.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, CommissionerÂ PotoÄnik, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent handling of an extremely difficult task.
We can see that representatives of new Member States, too â in this case Poland, of which the rapporteur was of course prime minister â are excellently placed to get to the heart of such difficult subjects.
I am pleased that, having been a researcher in the course of his career, he has demonstrated here in Parliament how important it is, when getting to the heart of the issues, to take a professional, objective, political approach.
We can all welcome the piece of work in front of us and be proud that Parliament and the people have tabled so many amendments.
The objective is crystal clear: we all want to live long, healthy lives.
We need to carry out a great deal more research in this regard and see what can be done in the way of prevention.
We want to improve employment as part of the Lisbon objectives.
MrÂ PÃŒhringer, the Head of the Government of Upper Austria, hit the nail on the head when he said that if we want to live healthy lives we have to execute policy accordingly, and that research is the basis for a sound social policy.
We must always bear this in mind if we wish to achieve our growth objectives with the research programme, particularly in the field of exports.
I believe that the European export sector is also capable of affording protection against globalisation in this regard.
We need the world markets, we need the opening-up of the markets, and to this end we need excellent products and services.
For this reason, it would make sense to endeavour to ensure that this programme does indeed start on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
I would be in favour of our attempting to begin a trialogue following Thursdayâs vote, and then we may really be able to launch this programme on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
That would be a good thing for research, a good thing for our 2009 elections, and a good thing for Europe.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking MrÂ Buzek for his excellent cooperation and for the spirit with which he presided over the preparation of this framework programme, and, like him, I would say that the compromise amendments are supported by all the groups and therefore demonstrate Parliament's desire to clarify certain points.
With particular regard to the European Research Council, Commissioner, I should like to tell you that it is clear that this new institution is vital for the scientific community.
We, like you, are therefore very keen to ensure that it works as well as possible as part of an autonomous scientific community.
That is the direction taken by our amendments on the matter, even though, legally, we will need to discuss it during the trialogue.
That said, we should like to assure you that we are very interested in the European Research Council and that we consider it to be very important.
Turning to the framework programme in general, we are, like you, rather disappointed by the reduction in funding, because we are aware how important it is as an instrument for the Lisbon policy.
We also know that it could have a considerable multiplier effect.
In this regard, the joint technology platforms and technology initiatives will play a vital role, and it will not necessarily be a question of money, but rather of setting up an effective public/private partnership at European level on certain major subjects.
Be that as it may, all of these programmes must be based on excellence.
It is a key aspect in the selection of projects, be it within the framework of collaborative research or under the headings 'capacities', 'ideas' and, above all, 'people', in other words researchers, because the most important thing is to have researchers who feel happy.
However, in Europe today, we do not always give researchers the social and moral status they deserve.
That is why the European Union must give a good example, by awarding high-quality Marie Curie fellowships, which build bridges between countries and help to slow down the brain drain.
On the issue of embryonic stem cells, to which you referred, Commissioner, it is true that this branch of research represents a tiny fraction of the budget â barely one thousandth.
Like you, I think that the projects undertaken under the aegis of the Sixth Framework Programme offer every guarantee of ethical quality and of the will to create European-scale projects that are beacons of excellence.
That is why the compromise amendment adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy at the initiative of MrsÂ GutiÃ©rrez, an amendment that I cosigned and that you support, recommends that we carry on with what has been done with the Sixth Framework Programme, in other words a case-by-case analysis that is vital if we are to achieve a level of excellence in a field of research that shows great promise for the future.
With regard to the budget, we are, as we have said, all a little disappointed.
I personally will watch closely to ensure that, over the first few years, you make the effort to increase the relative portion a little.
It is true that an increase is planned, but it will not really make its presence felt until after 2009.
For the 2007 and 2008 budgets, therefore, I think that, within the Commission, you should be able, on the basis of the very good implementation rates, to increase the relative portion, at any rate the portion obtained by Parliament following the discussions on the financial perspective.
Even though this portion is somewhat symbolic, as it amounts to only EURÂ 340Â million, we want it to be allocated to priorities such as the European Research Council and Marie Curie fellowships, without forgetting the thematic priorities.
Parliament is very concerned about the environment and energy, and those are therefore the thematic priorities to which we want to provide more support.
In addition, allow me to draw your attention â I think you are already aware of this, but I was surprised to find that the Council is less so â to the interaction between science and society.
It is absolutely vital for us to develop a positive relationship between society and science in Europe, and for us to ensure that young people do not lose the taste for science and research.
In this regard, the 'science and society' element sets an example throughout Europe, and we will therefore pay close attention to ensure that its budget is not reduced as the Council intends.
Finally, I should also like to add my voice to those who have said that the Joint Research Centre plays a vital role and that its activities in the nuclear sector help to harmonise, at European level, the security issues that we all need to address.
To conclude, we must make rapid progress regarding the participation rules.
The simplification of programmes is an essential point in achieving the best possible participation.
On that subject, we will have to keep a close eye on the calendar, because, as you have stressed, 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007 is approaching rapidly.
Parliament will make a positive contribution to finding solutions regarding the participation rules, as it is doing in connection with the Seventh Framework Programme that we are going to adopt.
That said, the two other partners, the Commission â though I have no doubts as to your own goodwill, Commissioner â and the Council must take matters in hand to ensure that the scientific community is given every reassurance regarding the Seventh Framework Programme.
Once again, my congratulations on your work.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome Commissioner PotoÄnik and thank MrÂ Buzek for the work carried out with the working group of shadow rapporteurs, which I think achieved some important consensual results.
First of all, I should like to highlight the political aspect of the seventh framework programme, which represents a search for excellence at a European level.
This is an important aspect because, in the wake of the change in scale that globalisation has forced us to make, it is crucial that research too should be done on a European scale so that it does not run the risk of being erased from the world political and scientific map.
The seventh framework programme contains important innovations, such as the European Research Council, which has already been mentioned.
I should like also to refer to the technological platforms, which we wanted in committee so that our small, medium-sized and large industries could be fully involved in research, development and innovation efforts.
If they all work together, companies should be able to create a favourable climate for development and consequently for their overall competitiveness.
Technological platforms are also extremely important because local institutions, universities and research centres take part in them.
They are also an appropriate incentive for small and medium-sized enterprises, subject to the participation rules.
They may thus provide SMEs with the ability to make and to influence decisions in this context as well.
Lastly, I should like to emphasise the importance of science and society.
