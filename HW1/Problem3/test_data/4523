Some countries have adopted rigorous veterinary measures, restricted open-air poultry farming and banned trade fairs.
The problem is that such measures have not been adopted by all 25 Member States.
Infectious diseases do not respect borders, especially where there are high rates of migration.
It needs to be emphasised that not all Member States will have sufficient resources to purchase vaccines.
I therefore propose that besides defining high-risk groups, we should also allow those that can afford to do so to purchase vaccine.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, what our fellow citizens require is high quality information and they are waiting for us to take the initiative and to tell them clearly how things stand.
Firstly, it emerged from last weekâs informal meeting held by the âHealthâ Council that some Member States still do not have any real emergency plan.
We ought to be aware of this, Commissioner.
We need to be aware of it!
There needs to be transparency, because it is up to us to make these governments acknowledge their responsibilities.
The European Commission has to show that it is taking a firm stance on the matter, and I would even say that, on behalf of the general public, it has to go beyond some of its prerogatives in order to make sure that the emergency plans are coordinated flawlessly.
We have to break away from this European schizophrenia, which says that the Member Statesâ prerogatives should not be infringed.
What will people say when a pandemic occurs?
Commissioner, no one will ever criticise you for having saved lives, but they will condemn you, and severely too, for having been overcautious.
Then, in the context of researching a new vaccine, the European Union needs to provide its financial support in order both to help develop the vaccines and to make sure that studies related to them are well coordinated, and to encourage mass production of these vaccines.
I understand that this research also includes a section on paediatrics.
As we proposed in our resolution, it therefore seems crucial to use the Solidarity Fund, in particular to ensure that the Member States carry out these tasks in full.
Commissioner, I know that this matter is now MrÂ Verheugenâs responsibility but, when the pharmaceutical legislation was revised, we adopted a measure conditionally authorising products to be placed on the market, making it possible to save time.
What will have become of this important procedure in the event of a pandemic occurring?
I get the impression that it has been left behind in a drawer somewhere.
We must not wait until the epidemic arrives before we deal with it.
I am counting on you to shake MrÂ Verheugen into action and to put in place an effective system for authorising products to be placed on the market more quickly.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I will keep this very brief in my one and a half minuteâs speaking time.
I should like first of all to ask the Commission how it intends to publish the plans due to be drawn up by each of the Member States.
Have any deadlines been set to enable all Europeans to read all of the plans made by each country, as well as the concrete guidelines that should be laid down everywhere?
Exchanging good practices and decisions needs to be encouraged.
Finally, in the event of a pandemic, who will have the say on which decisions need to be taken in order to ensure that the combined efforts are focused in the right direction, that is to say focused on prevention?
What will the EUâs powers be, and how can we prevent the buck from being passed between the Member States and the EU in the event of a pandemic occurring?
Secondly, the Commission has not seen fit to publish the amount of antivirals currently available in each of the Member States.
I do not believe that this lack of transparency is reassuring for people.
We need both to know what stocks each of the Member States has and to create a fund of the kind that will enable each of the Member States to have access to as large a stock of antivirals as possible.
What do you intend to do in this regard?
Thirdly, we do not have a clear strategy as regards employees and other people who come into direct contact with animals and, in particular, with farms on which birds are bred.
It would seem to us to be a requirement to have a specific strategy for these employees and other people.
Next, do you not consider that it would be useful to coordinate the role of the agencies in order to form a kind of group of experts at EU level who would provide reliable scientific information or, at any rate, come up with a consensus of opinion?
Finally, the WHO has just launched an appeal: before we think about a pandemic, let us prevent epizootic disease from spreading!
Money is therefore required.
Is the European Union ready to give money at international level in order to limit the spread of epizootic disease?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, we discussed this problem as long ago as 12 April, when it was clear to this House that ministers were dragging their feet in putting protective measures in place against a possible flu pandemic.
I have to admit that some progress has been made since then, and that may well be down to you pounding the table very hard.
In any case, a number of Member States have taken the right sort of action.
You told us a moment ago that all Member States have now presented plans.
Whether those Member States have presented those plans, but have not disclosed what it is they have done, or have presented sound plans, is, of course, a different matter, and I would like to hear more about this.
The ministers discussed this last week as well, of course, when they concluded that stockpiling vaccines and antiviral drugs was a matter for the national level alone.
This is, to my mind, an unwise decision, since bird flu is a cross-border problem .
In the event of a pandemic outbreak, there is no time for extensive consultation with countries that have done too little, to persuade them to take the necessary measures while there is yet time, while we cannot expect countries that are sufficiently prepared to suddenly make their supplies available.
There is therefore a need for common action, and that, Commissioner, is where you come in.
First of all, we need emergency measures.
At the moment, there is no public health risk, but if there was, you would need to be able to take action immediately, for example, in the shape of measures with regard to disinfection and quarantine at airports for flights from the affected areas or travel restrictions.
I am not confident that all 25 Member States will be taking those measures.
Finally, I think that there is a need, not only for national action, but also for common action, and I hope that the ministers will approve your proposals for a common fund.
Mr Mulder, who is rapporteur for this in the Committee on Budgets, has suggested setting aside funds from the Solidarity Fund for this purpose, and I think that that is a sensible suggestion.
Commissioner, if you pound the table even harder, then we will in any case be right behind you.
Â Â  â Mr President, it is absolutely essential that the EU is fully prepared for an influenza pandemic and that we learn the lessons from the past, for example, from the foot-and-mouth crisis in Europe, so that contingency plans are well-known, communication lines are clear and coordination properly planned.
The current threat of the mutation of avian flu demonstrates the role industry must play.
Patent holders must allow the production of generic alternatives in poorer countries.
We must also take urgent practical steps: an immediate ban on imports of wild birds into the EU, and improved bio-security, particularly in the international poultry industry.
In our amendments, we are also proposing that, as a priority, poultry farmers be offered common, seasonal influenza vaccination, in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces, as Mr Trakatellis has said.
Since international travel is likely to form the key mode of transmission, we are proposing that there should be systematic virological screenings of air filters from flights originating in countries affected by the virus.
Lastly, a question to the Commissioner: will he rule out a mass cull of wild birds, since evidence suggests it is likely to be counter-productive, dispersing infected individuals and making healthy birds more prone to disease due to stress?
I would be very grateful for an answer to that question.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, todayâs debate on the strategy against an avian influenza pandemic is a good opportunity to ask questions both about where the responsibility lies for public health, which is one of the European Unionâs main priorities, and about security and truth in public life.
We must ask ourselves whether predictions asserting that the disease will cause massive loss of life, and claim between 50 and 150Â millionÂ victims, are based on scientific knowledge, or are instead the result of an economy overheated by industry, and in particular by the insatiable pharmaceutical companies, which suffer losses if their drugs are not used.
Conflicting opinions, a quasi-conspiracy of silence and a lack of reliable scientific data all point to such conclusions.
This would amount to entirely despicable and truly diabolic manipulation, aimed at provoking panic and chaos instead of creating a feeling of security and public solidarity.
The latter should be defining features of large communities whose goal is to achieve noble goals, such as those to be found in countless EU documents.
Further key questions surround the reasons for the spread of the epidemic.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with an emblematic case of avian flu, or, to put it another way, an outbreak of foolishness and stupidity.
The pandemic threat of seasonal flu, which afflicts primates and humans alike, from the runny nose of at Cro-Magnon to insalubrious Napoleonic sneezing, is being met by the deadly virus of those bent on creating panic for the benefit of speculators and scoundrels.
A vast gravy train sucking billions of euros from plucked chickens and terrified consumers, to swell the coffers of the multinational drug companies.
There is a perfectly simple answer to the question â and I apologise for my frankness to my fellow Member and to the ingenuous Commission (whose good intentions I have no desire to call into question): if the risk of a pandemic with millions of working hours lost and vast numbers of human victims were a real one, those humans, the Union, the Member States and the Governments would not only have the ethical duty but also every economic justification for distributing vaccine free of charge.
Let us block the import of chickens, but above all let us take action against the hacks and charlatans peddling terror, who are responsible both for the pandemic of neurosis and for the criminal speculation which is ruining hundreds of poultry farmers and risking the jobs of thousands of workers.
If I catch this deadly virus, I hope to take with me to the grave as many as possible of these fools and scoundrels who are inflicting this suffering on mankind.
Â Â  â Mr President, various speakers have made the point this morning that it is time not to panic, but rather to plan.
While this resolution is very much about human health, we have to remember that we have to control avian influenza in the world.
It is not just a case of Europe closing its doors and it will not happen.
All the Member States must go out and help those countries that have avian influenza at the moment, and I know the Commission is doing that.
The key is to stamp it out in the world if at all possible.
That is why I would urge more help for countries outside the European Union to stop this disease coming in.
I would also like to say quite clearly, as other speakers have done, that importing wild birds into the European Union at the moment is crazy and needs to be stopped, at least for the time being, because there is no point in bringing in disease.
Contingency planning is also very important because, as Mrs Lucas said, during the foot-and-mouth outbreak there was a total lack of contingency planning.
We have to make sure we are ready and have vaccines available.
I also think that at the moment not enough information is going out in the Member States to the poultry industry and to those who are actually running our poultry farms, to ensure that, firstly, there is increased biosecurity and, secondly, that they have protection from the disease if it comes into the European Union.
We have to be ready.
We have to look at vaccines that are available, because it must not be forgotten that this disease can mutate into several different viruses.
At the moment we are talking very much about the H5 vaccine, but we have to be ready with other forms of vaccine should the disease mutate into another strain.
So let us prepare, let us try to stamp it out of the poultry industry and stop it mutating into a human form of the disease, because then the citizens of Europe will be protected.
I wish you well in getting all Member States together and in getting a proper contingency plan in place, Commissioner.
Â Â  â Commissioner, thank you for your introduction.
I am still left with three questions about avian flu.
Last week, you communicated that you would advise Member States to have people who work in the poultry sector vaccinated with the flu vaccine.
Whilst this is in itself a useful measure, because that way, it is possible to reduce the risk of mutation of H5N1 into a form that is transmitted from one human being to another, what causes me anxiety, though, is the excessively non-committal tone of a suggestion to Member States that they might make a recommendation to poultry farmers.
I think that the European Union should learn from the previous health crises with SARS and BSE.
In both cases, the Member States adopted their own policies, sometimes with opposite effects.
My first question is whether the Commission can shed light on this as quickly as possible.
I would also like to hear from the Commission what priority it gives to support for flu vaccination campaigns in the poultry sector in Turkey and Romania and what support is in place for similar vaccination campaigns in Asia.
My second question concerns the availability of medicines.
According to experts, EUR 150 million would be sufficient for the preliminary development of new medicines to stave off the pandemic.
Which products exactly will you be making available?
My third and final question has to do with the capacity for producing medicines and their affordability.
Are you prepared, in the event of a pandemic, to suspend the relevant patent rights and data exclusivity?
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, if we in Europe want to protect ourselves, we should have acted years ago to provide aid to Asia, and by that I mean technical aid to address the problem that much of our meat is already produced there from animals kept in breeding establishments.
The problem is that these animals, which have been intensively bred with the aid of technology, come into contact with regional breeds or wild animals, which carry the virus without becoming ill in clinical terms.
If the virus is then passed on to animals kept in breeding establishments, there is the potential for mutations and variations that can present a danger to human beings.
This is where the provision of technical aid would certainly make sense.
What is, of course, nonsensical about this whole debate is the idea that we might be able to gain technical mastery over nature by doing away with it and resorting to banning the entry of geese or the keeping of animals under extensive farming conditions in an attempt to get on top of all this.
This strikes me as reflecting the interests of the cage industry more than anyone elseâs.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, as well as World WarÂ I, Europe experienced another disaster in 1918, namely the Spanish Influenza.
The latter claimed 20Â million victims, and resembled avian influenza in some respects.
Europe today is not fully prepared for another epidemic of this kind.
It may well be the case that the pharmaceutical companies are better prepared than the Commission and the governments of the EU Member States.
It would be preferable, however, to prevent these companies from profiting from the circumstances, and to avoid a scandalous situation in which millions of people cannot be vaccinated because they cannot afford the expensive vaccines.
Preventive medicine should be made available to everyone, no matter how much money they have.
Warnings should also be issued to those Member States that are completely unprepared for this potential disaster, and that are waiting for the European Commission to solve the problem for them.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MrÂ President, the European Parliament should back the measures and decisions taken by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
The adoption of a resolution on the strategy against an avian influenza pandemic will provide us with an excellent opportunity to take appropriate action in this regard.
I am quite sure that we will be able to take more effective measures to prevent any epidemic spreading if we implement the following suggestions.
Cooperation should be established with pharmaceutical companies with the aim of taking special measures to produce new and effective vaccines as rapidly as possible, and equal access to vaccines should become a reality for everyone.
Poorer countries should be offered financial assistance to buy medicines, efforts should be made to place infected areas under quarantine and risk assessment methods should be improved.
Inspections, tests and analyses of avian diseases should be carried out, and restrictions imposed on international travel.
One of the key measures that should be taken by the European Union is to step up the activities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in the fight against infectious diseases.
These activities should involve the deployment of expert missions and EU representatives to those regions, mainly in Africa and Eurasia, where the risk is greatest.
In its present form the virus does not represent a threat to humans, and unless further mutations occur there is no possibility of it causing a pandemic that would paralyse Europe and the world.
Consequently, we should on the one hand take steps to prevent public panic, and on the other bear in mind that the sooner we start to take action, the greater our chances of bringing the situation under control.
The problem of avian influenza also serves as a good illustration of the way in which the EU institutions should communicate with the citizens.
I would remind the Commissioner that the Commission needs a special communications strategy, drawn up under his supervision.
Furthermore, I would call on the Commission and the Council to act responsibly when issuing statements on the matter.
These institutions also have a duty to assess the risk of the disease spreading and being transmitted to humans.
It goes without saying that they should not underestimate the current threat, as happened in the case of mad cow disease, but they should also avoid scare-mongering.
I would stress once again that Brussels must act with the utmost responsibility when issuing assessments of the real risk posed.
Assessments of the opportunities available to us to combat the avian influenza virus should also be realistic.
The Commission should lend its backing only to those medicines that are genuinely effective against the disease.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress that we in the Socialist Group believe that both the European Commission and the Council must commit themselves to cooperating economically and scientifically with the countries of South-East Asia, since, so far, they have been the main focus of bird flu infection, and it is crucial that it be eradicated at origin.
We also believe that the pharmaceutical industry should cooperate closely with the European Commission, and with the Member States and the World Health Organisation, in a coordinated fashion and involving a communication strategy, without alarming the population, but with significant levels of information and transparency.
A final question, or rather an appeal: the slaughter of birds, provided that the health authorities consider it necessary, should not be turned into a deplorable spectacle, such as those we have seen in the media, and furthermore it should be carried out in accordance with proper guidelines.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, flu pandemics in Europe have been documented for more than a century and we know that the three A virus sub-types we have had originated from birds: the H1 in 1918, the H2 in 1957 and the H3 in 1968.
All of them originated amongst birds and all of them mutated.
We have known since 1997 that the H5 sub-type is highly contagious, that it is capable of being transmitted to man and producing a form of influenza with a high death rate, but that so far transmission is only possible through contact with diseased birds and their excrement.
The H5 virus has spread amongst wild and domestic birds, and migratory birds are spreading it all over the place.
Furthermore, it has been communicated to mammals such as pigs and cats.
For all of these reasons, there is broad consensus amongst health experts and bodies about the possibility that the A virus H5 may adapt to human transmission and create a new pandemic.
I believe that the executive Commission has so far acted responsibly and transparently within the framework of its competences.
Perhaps its powers should be increased if a period of emergency and a pandemic begin.
I would like to insist that it is important to lay down relevant rules that the Member States can follow, and to coordinate and monitor compliance with them, and also to urge the media to report rigorously but without creating unnecessary social alarm.
I believe that we must strengthen the wildlife monitoring network, which is closely related to the majority of emerging diseases.
Finally, I believe that we must enhance R+D resources within the European Union with a view to responding in a medical and scientific fashion as quickly as possible, should the need arise.
Â Â  â Mr President, I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the Commission on the speed of its reaction to public health issues, a policy which does not come quite within its competence, and I think that the motion for a resolution, which attempts to coordinate the public authorities on this important issue, is also within this framework.
Within the framework, however, of a comprehensive policy at national and Community level and in conjunction with the confirmed lack of a fundamental communication policy to inform citizens at national and Community level, the poultry market has been shaken, with plummeting levels of consumption.
The Commission, in cooperation with all the competent Commissioners, including Mrs Fischer Boel, will need to mobilise, firstly, the political safeguarding of farmers' incomes from market crises.
The Council of Ministers for Agriculture will need, at long last, to take a decision on this matter.
Secondly, fundamental Community financing for the problems of poultry farms and, thirdly, the necessary marking of poultry for consumption, to the effect that they are from inspected farms.
This marking will help to intensify inspections of poultry farms and restore consumer confidence in this sector.
Â Â  â Mr President, over the past 300 years, 10 influenza pandemics have occurred among humans.
The most recent came in 1968-69, and the most deadly in 1918-19: the so-called Spanish flu pandemic.
Scientists have been predicting a lethal cyclical resurgence of influenza for some time, one that will be more deadly because of our low levels of resistance.
Now, with avian influenza, they are recognising the hallmarks of such a virus.
The medical histories of those who have died of H5N1 influenza to date are disturbingly similar to accounts of sufferers of the 1918-19 outbreak.
Since scientists first started saving flu virus samples in the early 20th century, an H5N1 influenza has never spread among human beings, so population vulnerability to an H5N1-like pandemic virus would be universal.
The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes.
Like most RNA viruses, it reproduces sloppily, its genes readily fall apart, and it can absorb different genetic material which recombines in a process called reassortment.
When influenza successfully infects a new species, it can reassort, and may switch from being an avian to a mammalian one.
When that occurs, a human epidemic can result.
Since it was first recorded in 1997, avian flu strain H5N1 has undergone multiple reassortments â more than 17 mutations â and evolved at high speed to the point where, in January 2003, the âzâ virus emerged.
In late 2004, there was one documented case of human-to-human transmission of the âzâ strain of H5N1.
By April 2005, the H5N1 virus had also moved to pigs.
It is this rapid evolution of the virus that makes it such a potential threat.
We cannot prepare a vaccine in advance or stockpile it.
The total number of companies willing and able to produce influenza vaccines has plummeted in recent years from more than two dozen in 1980 to just a handful in 2004.
There is serious questioning in the scientific community about the possibility of speeding up vaccine production because of contamination risks.
While it is important for us to be prepared and vigilant and to take precautionary action, with responsible risk assessment and forward planning, a lot will depend on the availability and effectiveness of anti-virals and vaccines and hospital bed capacity, which has been seriously reduced in all EU countries in the last decade.
Â Â  â Mr President, I agree with everybody who has said that we are facing a veterinary crisis which must be tackled urgently.
I particularly want to see measures on movements of wild birds, and we must prepare in case there is a mutation of the virus into a human pandemic.
I agree with everything that has been said about preparing the European Union, stockpiling vaccines and antivirals, and developing a vaccine.
I want to ask the Commissioner the same question I asked him last time we debated this issue, and that concerns the rest of the world.
What discussions is he having with his colleagues in the Development DG of the European Commission?
This pandemic could hit the poorest countries hard as well.
We should be talking to the WHO about not just a possible European reserve fund or stock but also a worldwide reserve stock of vaccines and drugs and possibly some kind of solidarity fund.
Â Â  â Europe has found itself truly at the threshold of a global crisis.
We must prepare ourselves for a pandemic, and we must not be taken by surprise.
It has been shown that during the âSpanish fluâ pandemic of 1918, the disease claimed at least 20 million victims.
According to the World Health Organisation, we can now expect a pandemic to cause the loss of 2 to 7 million lives.
This is not panic-mongering.
The WHO admits that the number may even rise as high as 150 million.
In the event of a pandemic, the production of a vaccine after mutation occurs will be complicated, and we will be racing against time to save lives.
Not all European Union countries pay equal attention to the problem.
There are countries that allocate national resources in a responsible manner, but there are also countries that clearly underestimate the threat of the disease and, in particular, its possible consequences.
I therefore call for coordinated action at the European level.
National plans for prevention and immunisation should be drawn up in cooperation with European institutions and Member States.
Every Member State should have a highly effective pandemic plan.
We know that the effectiveness and level of these plans vary.
I urgently call on the Union to mobilise and release more substantial financial, technical and material resources.
Many findings suggest that European countries are not adequately prepared; half of the Member States do not have a sufficient stock of antiviral medicines.
Cooperation with pharmaceuticals companies must be strengthened in order to secure the necessary quantity of antiviral drugs.
The Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, Dr David Nabarro, underlined huge differences in the amount of funds allocated for prevention and treatment.
Thus, while the UN has only allocated 7 million dollars for this purpose, the United States alone has already released one hundred million dollars.
According to Dr Nabarro, the UN would need at least USD 175 million for an effective programme.
In case a flu epidemic breaks out, I am asking whether such countries as Japan, the United States or the European Union will be ready to put their resources and vaccines at the disposal of developing countries to help localise a pandemic or epidemic wherever it occurs.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, the threatened spread of the epidemic of avian influenza and its possible development into a pandemic are a visible and hideous prospect for both birds and man.
The Commission and the Council must lay down measures.
The epidemic must be prevented from spreading to domestic and wild birds.
Care must be taken to ensure the virus does not spread beyond commercial and domestic poultry installations in which cases of the virus have already been confirmed by laboratory analysis.
The populations of birds living in wetlands must be protected both from the spread and from the teams of self-styled saviours exterminating them.
The rules of sensitivity must be adhered to where cases have been identified, as must the rules of hygienic burial.
The profession must be compensated, as must the citizens to whom we owe protection from misleading information and speculation and planned support.
Â Â  â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start with warm thanks to the Commissioner for the clarity of his statement, from which it would appear that the EU and its Member States are relatively well prepared.
Your statement is a calm and matter-of-fact one, and, in that you focus on the protection of poultry generally and not just on the possibility of a pandemic, that will help us all to make progress.
I myself worked for 15 years as a veterinarian, specialising in the poultry industry, with the Organisation of Animal Health, and could well have something to say about a lot of things, not least the vaccination of poultry.
Not having enough time available to me, though, I do not propose to do so.
On Monday, a number of Members of this House visited the Food and Veterinary Office in Dublin.
It has to be said that its 160Â experts, who are active around the world, are doing an excellent job of advising you and the Member States.
There is, admittedly, as yet insufficient provision for worldwide cooperation, but the first steps are rightly being taken in that direction; there is a conference being held in Canada today, and the WHO has met in South-East Asia.
Much more needs to be done to address this problem at the point where it starts and takes root.
Secondly, Mr Bowis and others have already pointed out that a system of inoculation will not be enough to contain the pandemic that threatens us.
Reference has also been made to the Spanish flu of 1918, which cost 50 million people their lives.
What that means is that there is an urgent need for a change of approach where the production of vaccines is concerned, and it also goes without saying that we can work much more quickly with cell cultures such as MPS.
Thirdly, what about anti-flu vaccines â who is to order them, who is to store them, who is to pay for them?
As these medicines keep for five years, there certainly needs to be a plan drawn up.
My fourth point is that no reference has been made in this debate to Africa.
What will happen when migratory birds reach Africa?
The people in Africa, like those in South-East Asia, live cheek by jowl with their birds, and they are at risk of infection.
Who has responsibility for this?
I am quite sure that we share it.
Fifthly, I would like to thank those conservationists, ornithologists and hunters, along with all non-governmental organisations, who have assumed a heavy responsibility for monitoring migratory birds and have passed on their knowledge.
The ultimate question is not whether a pandemic is on the way, but when.
That is what should be the focus of our attention.
Â Â  . Mr President, I will try to reply to most of the questions.
It is true that we had a simulation exercise last week for smallpox.
It was mostly focused on the possibility of a bioterrorist attack.
However, the reaction is more or less the same.
We will be able to see, from the results of that exercise, what the weaknesses are in the whole system and, hopefully, correct them in time for the influenza exercise in a few weeksâ time.
The purpose of the exercises is to detect mistakes and weaknesses and correct them.
I did not mention much on the veterinary side because that is to do with the pandemic stage.
However, I should give some information regarding wild birds.
Today the Commission is proposing to discuss with the standing committee the ban on imports of wild captive birds to the European Union.
We feel that is a precautionary measure that we need to take today for a temporary period.
Our experts will then review it and decide if it needs to remain in place.
On the solidarity front, the regulation has not been adopted yet by either Parliament or Council.
The idea of that regulation is to reimburse the cost of use of antivirals or vaccines in the event of a pandemic.
If the Council and Parliament decide that it has to be readjusted to deal with purchases and precautionary measures, then that is something we can discuss.
The international aspect is very important.
I mentioned that last time.
I will be travelling to South-East Asia â the most affected area â to talk to the authorities there.
Nevertheless, there have been some developments.
In November we will have the Geneva meeting with support from the WHO, FAO, OIE and the World Bank.
There is no reason for duplication, but we must support the international initiatives that have been started by those organisations.
The Geneva conference will assess the needs â financing and other technical needs â to meet this challenge and will be followed by a pledging conference early next year.
That is the important conference, where funds should be pledged to support the most affected countries in this effort.
Seasonal vaccination is the correct approach, but it involves an investment towards increasing the manufacturing capacity and will at the same time help the groups at risk to deal with this problem.
On the issue of communication, it is very important that we maintain transparency; it is very important that we inform our citizens about the exact situation.
Sometimes the media exaggerate.
That is a risk we have to take.
However, any suspicion of a cover-up or of hiding information will have the worst results and that will cause panic.
I admit that there was some panic, but it was not the Commission, nor any European institution, nor any European government that linked avian flu last summer, almost as a certainty, to a pandemic.
At the same time â as mentioned in your resolution â the WHO believes that the influenza pandemic will happen in the near future.
It is therefore natural that people are worried.
The only way to deal with that panic is not by not giving information but by explaining what we are doing to deal with this issue.
We need both national and Community plans.
Each country has its own peculiarities, so each country needs to have its own plan, but we have a Community plan.
Last year we established such a plan, which coordinates and links the national plans with the Community in order to achieve coordination.
As to avian flu, we will have more outbreaks. We have to be realistic about that.
We should not panic or transmit panic every time there is a dead wild bird found on a farm with signs of the virus.
That will happen.
We have the system and the legislation in place, and we will use them.
The CVOs meet regularly, contact farmers and advise them about what they should do.
On culling, that is something we wish to avoid, but we have to take account of the safety issue.
We advise that this be done through animal welfare measures regarding poultry.
However, unless we have strong scientific evidence for such a measure, I would not support the culling of wild birds.
The daily warning system works very well.
The European Centre for Disease Control is very active in this effort.
Member States and the Commission are linked together in an effective way with an early warning system and are in contact and cooperation with the WHO.
Yesterday in the Council we also discussed the issue of compensation for farmers.
Eradication measures are financed or co-financed by the Commission, but the compensation for loss of profit or market is a matter being discussed in the Agriculture Council.
There has been a reference to Spanish flu, but we are much better prepared now.
We have antibiotics, we have the health care system, we have doctors and other measures that we can take.
I therefore believe that, with the right effort, we can minimise the number of deaths in the event of a pandemic.
I will inform Parliament whenever we have anything new to report.
Â Â  I have received a proposal for a resolution(1) submitted in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon.
Â Â  â Despite the recent alarmist statements, it remains difficult today to grasp what health risks there are and to put a figure on the probability of the H5N1 virus mutating into a form that can be transmitted to, and between, human beings.
The threat of a pandemic is real.
Until now, this virus has caused 112 cases of human influenza, including 57 deaths, all of which were confined to South-East Asia.
Therefore, all measures for preventing the pandemic need to be implemented by all parties concerned in the area, from farmers to veterinary surgeons and, in particular, by hunters of migratory birds.
In order to minimise the risk, international coordination efforts and the implementation of a European preparation plan are crucial.
The European preparation plan is already up and running and it will have to be carefully structured around the various national plans.
Strengthening coordination and transparency between Member States, and protecting Europeâs borders at the same time as assuming our duty of solidarity towards third countries, are principles that must guide our actions.
However, a problem arises when private laboratories produce prototype vaccines against an emerging virus, because this is a matter of health and public safety.
Specific allocations of European money will have to be dedicated to this area of research.
It is in these tragic circumstances that Europe finds its
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the amendment on which we are about to vote concerns the inclusion of the prestigious European College of Parma in the list; if it were excluded, it would be in danger of closure.
That would be damaging not only for Parma but for the entire European Union and for its training.
Â Â  Mr President of the Republic of Chile, Presidents of the Chilean Congress and Senate, ladies and gentlemen, it is our privilege today to receive the President of the Republic of Chile, don Ricardo Lagos Escobar, who is accompanied also by the Presidents of the two Chilean parliamentary houses.
Don Ricardo Lagos is an exceptionally important person on the Latin American political scene.
Mr President, please allow me, on behalf of the European Parliament, to welcome you most warmly.
When Ricardo Lagos was 45 years old, he left a quiet and comfortable life in the United Nations to rent a small office in Santiago de Chile and to begin to work for democracy in his country, which was then in the grip of a military dictatorship.
He worked, he fought and he travelled throughout Chile; he was arrested, but he went back to fighting to put an end to General Pinochetâs regime.
He has worked tirelessly to repeal the authoritarian aspects of a Constitution signed by a dictator, and a month ago he succeeded in reforming that Constitution, which has now been signed by a democratic president.
In the collective memory of the Chileans and of all of the worldâs democrats, it is with emotion that we remember the image of Ricardo Lagos on a television programme that has made history, looking at the camera and pointing his finger, confronting Pinochet and opening up the path that would lead millions of Chileans to vote ânoâ in the 1988 referendum, through which Pinochet hoped to remain in power.
I believe that that is the most symbolic image of Chileâs transition to democratic openness.
Through his faith in Chile and in democracy, he supported a Christian Democrat, Patricio Aylwin, as President of Chile, and in that government he was Minister for Education and carried out an in-depth reform of education in his country.
It was then with another Christian Democrat, President Frei, who had previously been his opponent in the presidential elections, that he was Minister for Public Works; this is a good example of cooperation amongst Christian Democrats and Socialists, at a time when the country needed it in order to achieve the transition towards democracy.
It was then that I had the opportunity to meet him: he, Minister for Public Works in his country, and I in mine.
Under your guidance, my dear friend, I began to get to know your wonderful country, from the volcanic deserts of the north to the alpine landscapes of the south, and to the southernmost parts of the country.
Finally, in March 2000, he was elected President of the Republic of Chile, a country which, back in 1812, at the dawn of its independence, drew up its Provisional Constitutional Regulation, which read:
Apply these words to Ceuta, to Melilla or to Lampedusa, and we can see what a horrendous situation we have in Europe at the moment.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Aymara language, Chile means âthe place where the world endsâ and sure enough, at the border of the Bio-Bio river, the world ended, because the Spanish conquest came to an end there in the face of fierce Araucanian resistance.
Today, however, Chile is fully integrated into the world, an open, dynamic and democratic country that has signed the most complete association agreement that the European Union has ever signed with any other country not aspiring to join the Union.
Since then, Chilean exports into the Union have increased by 35% and globally our exchanges have multiplied practically by three.
That demonstrates the mutual benefit we derive from our association.
On welcoming you, Mr President, I would like to acknowledge that it is a privilege for this Parliament that you have wanted to come here, when you are about to end your presidential term; a term, incidentally, that you are ending with a public approval rating of over 65%, which is remarkably positive, not only in Latin America, but also in Europe.
Please believe me, therefore, Mr President, that we are all very happy to hear from you the lessons we can learn from Chileâs great journey towards democracy.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President, for your kind presentation.
Ladies and gentlemen, good friends all: fifteen years ago, I came here to speak with your group presidents as one of the leaders of the opposition to the Chilean dictatorship.
Today, I stand before you as the President of a democratic country, in which a broad political and social coalition has successfully remained in government for fifteen years.
Chile has changed a great deal since those dark days.
We have succeeded in recovering our citizenship and our democratic institutions.
We have doubled production and globalised our economy.
At the same time, we have reduced poverty by half, we have reformed education, health and justice, and, with public and private resources, we have carried out the most ambitious infrastructure and housing plan: today, one in every four homes in Chile has been built over the last fifteen years.
I believe that we have a high level of social cohesion today because of these developments, and our integration with global society is supported by our own society.
We have also looked to Europeâs experience.
For more than half a century, you have managed to combine democracy, a market economy and a high level of social cohesion, compatible with macroeconomic balances and with a welfare State or, better, with a social protection network.
We have a common cultural heritage and historical links which unite us.
We Chileans vividly remember this assemblyâs support of Chileâs return to democracy.
During difficult moments in our country, members of Parliament at that time travelled to Chile, participated in meetings, supported our civil society and expressed their solidarity with the democratic cause.
We remember these events with nothing but gratitude.
And I would ask you to appreciate the significance of what we have accomplished.
Europeâs role was, is and always will be invaluable.
History, our history, would have been different without you.
The truth about human rights violations is now public and acknowledged.
Our brilliant journey to discover the truth began with the Rettig report, on the disappeared, and has continued until today with the Valech report, on prison and torture during those dark years.
I do not know of any other country in the world that has dared to form a commission to listen to the statements of 35Â 000 people, who were detained and tortured, of which the commission recognised that 29 000 were victims.
We have been able to recognise the moral conscience of our society.
We have faced the task of obtaining truth and justice with regard to violations of human rights.
As President Borrell said, Chile now has a strong and robust democracy.
The authoritarian Constitution has been amended.
The workers have been given back their rights.
Chile now has unemployment benefits, labour reforms and new, more effective labour laws.
The role of women is increasingly recognised; there is significant and complete legislation on family duties and rights.
The protection of the environment is now part of the collective imagination and it has been enshrined in important public policies that were recently analysed by the OECD.
Today in Chile, new generations that have grown up and been educated in a democracy, are broadening their horizons and are displaying creativity in every field.
Today, seven out of every ten people in higher education are the first generation in their families to receive a university education.
That is the enormity of the change we have made in Chile: it is a more libertarian country, with more solidarity, which is more progressive, more open to a world on which we want to leave our mark.
It is true that we reduced poverty from 40% to 18%, and extreme poverty from 12.9% to 4%.
We have a competitive economy, low levels of corruption and satisfactory human development indicators.
We are not satisfied, however; there is still much to do.
We have to modify the social security programme to make it more fair and equitable.
There are still chronic inequalities in the distribution of labour income.
The wages of the richest quintile of the population are, on average, fourteen times higher than the wages of the poorest quintile.
If we introduce what we offer in social welfare into the equation, however, that difference is reduced to seven times.
We must find a just balance between social protection and the conditions for maintaining competitiveness.
We therefore look at Europe in a different way to yourselves.
The European debate is sometimes our debate â I am aware of the situation that this Parliament is currently undergoing and I do not want to get into issues that are part of your debate â but I would, however, like to point out that, although Chile has often been presented as a neo-liberal model, the reality could not be more different.
We believe that the so-called âWashington Consensusâ, which talks about liberalising markets, privatising certain companies, deregulation and balanced budgets is something that Chile applied, and in a timely fashion.
What does not appear in the âWashington Consensusâ, however, is the need for concrete public policy in the midst of growth, aimed at the poorest sectors of society in order to create a social welfare net.
No country can compete in the world without such a net.
Countries which are not able to create a minimum degree of social cohesion within their societies will, in the long term, be faced with an internal conflict in their society, which hinders their competition with the outside.
We have therefore made an enormous effort to grow and we have grown.
But this growth has been converted into social policies, in education; we have carried out the most in-depth reform of health and I must say to you, âmy word, it is difficult!â, because reforming health means battling with a whole range of diverse interests.
I told our doctor friends in Chile, âMy friends, you are all socialists during the morning, when you are working in a public hospital, but you are all capitalists in the afternoon, when you are treating your private patientsâ.
And when they threatened me with strikes, I said, âAlright, but go on strike in the morning and in the afternoonâ.
I am sure you understand what I am saying!
It is therefore difficult to carry out a health reform, because the only people who are not organised are the patients in the hospitals and the only people on whose behalf we must speak are them.
Reform therefore involves an enormous change in favour of primary healthcare.
Today in Chile, with regard to 25 pathologies â there will soon be 56 pathologies, which represent 80% of medical interventions in hospitals â we can guarantee three things: a high-quality institution, a time limit for consultation and, if the person has no resources, the resources are provided by the fifteen million Chileans.
This was a long reform process, but it is part of social cohesion, which is essential.

We understand your debate, in the field of health, in the field of welfare; I would like to point out that the average age in Chile is very similar to the average age here in Europe, there are just a few months difference, and the need to provide social welfare for an ageing population is very important for us.
At the same time, we have been able to create a good macroeconomic situation and I would like to point out that Chile conforms to all of the Maastricht requirements.
In other words, your debate is sometimes our debate.
And we therefore follow it closely and we also want to learn from what you have done.
Why not say it?
In many respects, Europe offers an important example to the world today and sometimes, tied up in your own debates, you do not realise that you are an example of the type of society that is wanted in the world today.
We know that, in order to continue growing in an equitable manner in the future and not remain trapped in a pattern of exporting raw materials and low job creation and welfare, we must invest heavily in innovation, science and technology.
We have quadrupled our efforts, but we are creating a fund for innovation funded by a very small part of the income produced by copper.
Copper is a non-renewable source, which generates a large amount of income for Chile.
This immense income will provide a basis for the future by means of science and technology.
In this regard, therefore, we are counting on European cooperation.
The agreement we have with Europe is one that will enable us also to access your resources in this field.
We also want to enhance our integration into the world economy.
We are convinced that countries progress when they see the whole planet as a possibility.
We must not be afraid of globalisation.
In our case, globalisation has opened up new possibilities, including for small economies that are far from the main international centres.
Of course, no automatic mechanism is going to be able to reduce the inequalities, instability and crises that globalisation brings with it.
But we must have rules and institutions that are able to govern the globalisation process.
If we want to achieve them, we must affirm the capacity for a currently emerging global politics to guide society.
I want to say here that we are frankly worried about the incredibly fast advance of globalisation, amid multilateral institutions that are unable to keep up the regulation of this process.
Here in Europe, we see an essential agent in the establishment of fairer trade rules, the creation of global public goods, the reorganisation of international organisations and macroeconomic coordination among the most important economic powers on the planet.
To whom should I turn when in the far south of Chile, the ozone layer is deteriorating and solar rays are stronger as a result of emissions of gases in the northern hemisphere?
Some people do not like the Kyoto agreements; I have said to the leaders of those countries, âthat is all very well, but tell me then where I should go to complain about what is happening in the world?â.
Because what is happening in my country is a problem coming from the outside.
I would therefore like to share with you something that we consider to be central: for a country like Chile, the multilateral ends up being local.
That is why we believe in the United Nations, of which we are founding members.
That is why we believe that the Security Council is the only body with the legitimacy to use force on behalf of the human race.
At a time, therefore, when our country was on the Security Council, we said no to an invasion of Iraq if the decision was taken outside of the Security Council.
Because we were consistent, we said yes and within seventy-two hours made an effort and deployed our armed forces in Haiti, because we believed that, as Latin Americans, we had the obligation to do our duty when the Security Council asked us to, in a country in the region of Latin America and Caribbean that was facing enormous difficulties.
I am convinced, therefore, that the problems of Europe and of the under-developed world are going to be resolved jointly.
As a European professor pointed out, if we insist on enclosing ourselves behind walls, we will perish at the hands of assailants from inside and from out.
These shared values and objectives form the basis of the Association Agreement signed by Chile with the European Union on 18 November 2002.
The European Parliament approved this agreement unanimously, in a political gesture that Chile acknowledges and is grateful for.
With me today at this formal occasion, therefore, are the Presidents of the Senate and of the House of Deputies of Chile, one of whom is a distinguished member of the opposition to my government in Chile, but in these areas there is a State policy which unites all Chileans.
This is the broadest and most comprehensive Agreement signed by Chile to date and it may also be the European Unionâs most ambitious.
We are building our partnership.
We are strengthening links in all of the areas and fields contained in the Association Agreement.
Our exchange is increasingly dynamic, as President Borrell has pointed out.
The European Union has increased its importance as the largest external investor in our economy, now representing 42% of total foreign investments in Chile.
Our trade is very balanced geographically: 30% Europe, 25% Asia, 18% United States, the rest, Latin America.
We have signed a Horizontal Agreement on Air Transport, which we hope soon to turn into a Single Skies Agreement between Chile and Europe.
Within the framework of the Agreement we have held a frank and intense dialogue with Europe, a dialogue of true allies, although on occasions we may differ with regard to certain policies â I do not wish to talk about agricultural subsidies here â but we have common approaches.
Within this context, we are participating in the European Unionâs ALTHEA operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina: Chilean troops are contributing to peace in a European country.
Because we are aware of these responsibilities, we are participating in Haiti, as I said, and we hope to cooperate more closely with the European Union in the new phase following the elections in that country.

We are cooperating actively in the modernisation of our public institutions; we want to enhance our cooperation on environmental issues; we want to exchange experiences and good practices in order further to strengthen social cohesion in Chile.
Ladies and gentlemen, we Latin Americans are not unfamiliar with the diversity being seen in Europe today.
Some of our brothers and sisters are making the opposite journey to the one centuries ago that brought mass European migration towards our continent.
Not just Spaniards.
In the middle of the 19th century many of the countries here which were having difficulties growing exported a huge amount of workforce to America.
Some people are now making the return journey towards here.
We are firmly committed to the consolidation of a strategic association between Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean.
We want Europe to have greater presence over there.
We see our Association Agreement as a significant step.
We are following the European Unionâs negotiations with our brothers and sisters in Mercosur with interest and hope.
We hope to hold more in-depth association negotiations soon, and I hope that the next Euro-Latin American Summit, which will take place in Vienna next year, will lead to the creation of an inter-regional strategic partnership with concrete tasks and measures.
We Latin Americans sometimes use too much rhetoric; in these agreements we want concrete facts.
More than once I have told the different European leaders of the need to understand the Colombia process, the efforts being made there to find peace.
We must all be sure to support Colombia in its present efforts to promote national co-existence.
Because we are united by our past, what we are and what we aspire to be, we want to do much more with Europe.
With a strong Europe, united in its external action, determined to play its rightful role in the world.
A Europe committed to free trade that contributes to the success of the Doha Round.
A Europe that seeks social cohesion internally and also at global level.
A Europe that is in favour of multilateralism and seeks to give globalisation a human face.
A Europe that promotes dialogue and agreement amongst the different cultural, religious and secular traditions within the framework of what has been called an alliance of civilisations.
Ladies and gentlemen, 3Â 500 years ago, a European said in the , âTell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide.
Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted âŠ â
I have come to this Parliament today to ask you to tell us that story, because this journey of 3Â 500 years is also our journey.
At times we have taken different directions.
Many times.
There is always the possibility that we will do so again in the future.
By becoming acquainted with the manners and customs of others, however, and by appreciating the variety of their cities, we must reach a successful common destiny.
You supported us during difficult times.
We are now proud to come together again as partners and we will always see ourselves as friends, united not just by interests, but also by common ideals and shared identities.
That is the essential value that we want to continue to preserve and it is for that reason that I have come here to speak to you.
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Â Â  Thank you very much, Mr President, for reminding us of the importance of Europe.
Thank you for telling us that sometimes, wrapped up in our own problems, we lose sight of the importance of our project.
In fact, Europe is not just a project for its own sake, but also responds to a need in the world.
Thank you for saying that here in the European Parliament, which is honoured to have you here.
Â Â  â Mr President, on a point or order, I just wish to say that, to avoid any potential conflict of financial interest, I shall be present but not voting on the Hieronymi report.
Â Â  That concludes voting time.
Â Â  We have voted in favour of the aviation agreement between the EC and Azerbaijan, but that does not mean that we express approval of Azerbaijanâs having opened an air link between the northern, Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus and Baku.
We do not think that the opening of this air link is a reason for voting against this aviation agreement.
These are two different issues, and negotiations with Azerbaijan concerning the above-mentioned air link must be conducted in another context.
Â Â  , . In July, Azerbaijan began operating flights between its capital and Northern Cyprus, which is under Turkish military occupation.
As Cypriot Members of this House â and in particular Members of our parliamentary group â have said, these flights are in breach of the principles of civil aviation and international law.
I wish to point out that this is not the only example of attempts at imposing recognition, on a practical level, of the Turkish military occupation of part of Cyprus, the so-called âTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprusâ, which is not recognised by the United Nations.
Parliament recently decided to set up a âcontact group for relations with the Northern part of Cyprusâ, a move condemned by our parliamentary group.
There have also been initiatives on the part of the Commission, such as the one aimed at establishing direct trade relations with the occupied part of Cypress â currently blocked by the Council on account of opposition among various Member States â which rides roughshod over United Nations resolutions.
Hence our vote against the report.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the Blokland recommendation for a second reading on âShipments of wasteâ.
This regulation is needed so that shipments of waste can be conducted in complete safety, or, in other words, in such a way that they pose no risk to the environment.
Â Â  . Only a few of the amendments not accepted by the Council were taken up at this second reading.
I wish to point out that of the 103 amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, the common position has adopted only 41, and some of those only in part.
Among the rejected proposals were issues as important as information and transparency, which have since been taken up.
Proposals aimed at retaining animal by-products and other waste under the scope of the directive have also been taken up.
In this way, Parliament is seeking to ensure that the transfer of such waste is conducted in a sound and responsible manner.
That being said, the majorities required to prevent derogations and to adopt some equally important proposals, some of which were tabled by the Greens, were not formed.
Examples of this include ship decommissioning and the need to ensure that this is done safely and in compliance with environmental requirements, with a view to protecting human and environmental health.
Efforts must be channelled into ensuring greater coordination on the issue of ships, especially those transporting dangerous or polluting goods, in order to prevent further tragedies.
Â Â  This report involves weighing up internal market issues against environmental issues.
On the basis purely of principle, we believe that the EU Member States should decide for themselves whether or not they wish to allow domestic companies to import waste from other countries.
One basic condition of such imports is, however, that agreements entered into on an international basis should be complied with and that the transported waste should not constitute an environmental risk for other Member States.
Obviously, environmentally hazardous chemicals should not be carried on international waterways if there are alternative ways of transporting them.
Because it constitutes a sensible compromise between environmental considerations and compliance with the rules of the internal market, we have chosen to support the line taken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
We believe, then, that international shipments of waste should be permitted provided that the waste as such does not constitute a significant environmental risk.
In line with the above-mentioned thinking, we have opposed the rapporteurâs position on a number of key issues, for example his position that waste should not be allowed to be transported if said waste can be treated in the country in which it was produced.
Â Â  . The fact that Waste has become a tradeable and even valuable commodity, brings with it a need for careful regulation in relation to movement of shipments of Waste, both within and across member state boundaries.
Protection of the environment must be a top priority, and I hope that both Council and Parliament will agree.
I also believe there is a need to limit movements by preventing unjustified shipments, dealing with Waste disposal and recycling as near as possible to point of production of the Waste, and ensuring that enforcement of Waste shipment regulations is improved.
Â Â  in writing. I support this report which aims to update existing EU rules on cross border shipments of waste and bring them into line with international agreements.
I regret that this is being dealt with under a legal base that requires unanimity in Council.
I hope that this does not prove to be an impediment to the adoption of strong rules.
I voted in favour of excluding animal by products from the waste shipment rules as they are adequately covered by other legislation.
Â Â  â Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the Pack report in spite of the unfortunate rejection of Mr Tajaniâs amendment, which I viewed as extremely important.
It is really most regrettable that Parliament did not approve it.
I would also like to take this opportunity to remind Parliament that, notwithstanding my report on language learning during the last legislature, there has unfortunately been no further discussion of the document which the Commission was to prepare on the basis of Parliament's decisions in that area.
I hope this will occur without delay in order to progress the above-mentioned report, which also constitutes a basis for the Pack report, since, for lifelong learning to be possible, the citizens of the European Union must have a knowledge of languages, with particular incentives also to learn the minority and regional languages.
Â Â  . We welcome the fact that the rapporteur acknowledges the continuing great disparity in the performance of education systems in the different Member States, as referred to in the Project for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2003 report; this in spite of all the Community initiatives intended to promote greater equality.
We also agree that precedence must be given to promoting the teaching and learning of languages and cultural diversity in education and training.
That being said, we still have a number of objections to the content of the Commissionâs proposal, and although the report seeks to alleviate the problems, it fails to provide an effective response.
Rather, it retains a tendency to favour the neoliberal policies that are increasingly being felt in the area of education and training.
The proposal is to set up an integrated programme for 2007/2013, subdivided into six separate sub-programmes (Comenius, Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Grundtvig, Transversal and Jean Monnet), the overall budget for which falls short of what is required, in light of the scope and the range of situations covered.
As such, even with the modest increases in grants, young people and other people on low incomes are still unable to take part.
Â Â  Because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been rejected by the European Council, we cannot now debate the action programme and its six sub-programmes for the aforesaid period.
We are certainly supporters of, for example, the Erasmus programme, but there are other parts of the proposed sub-programmes that must be examined carefully in order for us to see whether they are justified on the basis of each Member State having responsibility under the Treaty for the organisation of education and vocational training systems and for the content of these.
We have therefore voted against the report today, since we think that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 needs first to be clear.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of this report, which I hope will continue, and extend, the opportunities which are available for all age-groups to take part in trans-national education programmes.
Many Scots have participated in EU programmes over the years, and it is important to build upon successful schemes.
In particular I welcome proposals to simplify procedures, and to decentralise administration.
I note and welcome the fact that amendments from my group led to the inclusion of lesser-used languages, as well as inter-cultural dialogue.
Â Â  . The Communityâs four education and vocational training programmes â Socrates, Leonardo da Vinci, the âAction programme to promote bodies active at European level and support specific activities in the field of education and trainingâ and the e-learning programme â are set to expire at the end of 2006.
Given the importance of education and training in creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in Europe, and the effectiveness and added value of the European cooperation programmes in this field, the Commission is proposing to set up an integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning, divided into six separate sub-programmes, by way of preparation for the new generation of programmes for 2007-2013.
These will mainly be extensions of current actions and programmes.
This report has my wholehearted support.
It is indicative of the high quality of the Commissionâs proposal, which, on the back of past results, has set more ambitious objectives for the new programme.
As such, a substantial increase in funding is required.
Â Â  The E.U. has been involved in financing education and vocational programmes for a considerable period of time â this is an involvement I very much welcome.
However, it is equally clear that there have been too many programmes, the administration has been cumbersome and the budget too low.
An integrated action programme for lifelong learning to bring under a single framework after 2006 â Socrates, Leonardo, Erasmus, Comenius, 'Grundtvig', Jean Monnet â is very welcome and should help address some of the existing shortcomings.
Â Â  . â The integration of existing education and training programmes financed by the European Union into a single 'lifelong learningâ programme is no accident.
It aims to shift the responsibility of the state to provide systematic and scientifically organised education to each individual, so that they will somehow acquire fragmentary knowledge and skills which can be easily adapted to market requirements, as a precondition to the possibility of employment (employability) and an alibi for unemployment.
That is why the term 'learning' was chosen instead of schooling or education.
The objective of 'lifelong learning' is to satisfy the demand of big business for flexible workers moulded for even greater exploitation.
It is the greatest symbol of the 'European ideal'; in other words the competitiveness of the European monopolies.
Moreover, the first to show an interest in 'lifelong learning' were the major industrialists, who have been calling on the Member States since 1995 to address education as a process which will extend from the cradle to the grave.

The programme implements this demand, which is why there is no need for pseudo-humanitarian bombast about improving national systems, combating discrimination and so on. The negative experience from the application of similar measures to higher education shows that the integrated programme is here to ram through all levels of education in every Member State.
Â Â  . The importance of education and training in creating a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in Europe is widely acknowledged.
Mrs Packâs report is based primarily on much-needed simplification measures in the context of the Communityâs education and vocational training programmes.
The Communityâs measures in this area have helped to define quality indicators in education and has encouraged the spread of good practice.
The existing Community instruments naturally complement the measures taken by the Member States and the Commissionâs proposal is to streamline the existing instruments in the field.
This is a well thought-out proposal, which rationalises Community instruments, increasing their coherence and synergy and making them more effective.
The Commission has therefore tabled more ambitious proposals requiring a substantial increase in funding.
I voted in favour of this report, as I believe that these programmes will also help to improve education and training systems throughout the EU.
Â Â  . I'm delighted to see that the Parliament continues to back the ERASMUS exchange programme, which is I believe one of the most vital ways the EU can demonstrate relevance to the people of Europe.
I believe that this budget, almost uniquely amonst other budget lines, should be increased, at the expense of others if need be, and voted accordingly.
I took advantage of the ERASMUS programme myself as a student, and strongly believe it to be the most useful, long term, EU programme of all.
Â Â  . This report improves significantly upon the programme entitled âYouth in Actionâ for the period 2007-2013 and seeks to take on board some of the criticisms of the previous youth programme made in the interim review and the consultation process, with particular regard to the way in which the procedure for applying for funding has become more flexible and less hampered by red tape.
The financial framework proposed by the Commission, however, is extremely limited.
We therefore back the reportâs call for a substantial increase in the funds made available, and welcome its clarification of the fundamental values that we want to promote among young people, such as respect for human dignity, equality, respect for human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination.
Furthermore, we welcome the amendments intended to place greater emphasis on the following aspects: equality between men and women and the fight against discrimination; and the fight against all forms of exclusion and discrimination including those on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty.
Hence our vote in favour, in spite of some of the programmeâs shortcomings.
Â Â  Because the financial perspective for 2007-2013 has been rejected by the European Council, we think it too early now to debate the setting up of the âActive Youthâ programme.
To express support in the present situation for a total appropriation to this programme of EURÂ 915 million (or EURÂ 1,128 million, depending on which proposal wins the vote) would be absurd.
The content of the programme may also be called into question.
The rapporteur writes in her justification that it âwill make an important contribution to the active citizenship of young people in society and thus enhance their feeling of being part of Europe, so that it is likely to deliver substantial European added valueâ.
We question whether the programme really would go any substantial way towards achieving this objective.
International youth exchanges are a good thing but need to be provided for financially through the efforts of civil society or through the agency of the Member States.
We do not believe that the EU should contribute money from its budget in this area.
We have therefore voted against the report today, since we think that the financial perspective for 2007-2013 needs first to be clear.
Â Â  . It is very important to offer, to our young people, opportunities such as envisaged in this proposal.
Developing active citizenship, solidarity, and mutual understanding between peoples must be encouraged and I support proposals to increase the budget for "Youth in Action".
The involvement and active participation of young people in the proposed Youth Week is desirable, and I supported amendments by my Group which sought to underline this.
Â Â  . â This report concerns the âdevelopment of European citizenshipâ.
Here we have the essence of what makes this European cultural programme ambiguous, for what is it about: subscribing to Europe?
It goes without saying that we subscribe to Europe, because we all are Europeans.
Subscribing to European integration as it is being carried out at present?
Well, that is propaganda.
Let us therefore affirm that we are obviously in favour of protecting Europeâs cultural heritage but that the culture budget should not become an annex to the EU communication budget.
Europeâs young people are faced with problems, including suicide, drugs and unemployment. Let us therefore work more practically on the causes of these problems rather than call upon vague and muddled measures relating to mobility, commitment, citizenship, etc.
It is not the EUâs responsibility to engage young people âin actionâ â young people can think for themselves â but its policy can consist in averting the dangers â drugs, in particular â something which, at the moment, it is doing with only limited success.
Â Â  . I wish to give my wholehearted support to the âYouth in Actionâ Community programme.
The rapporteur broadly supports the Commissionâs proposal, although she does put forward some amendments dealing with the following areas: the inadequate nature of the financial framework for implementing the âYouth in Actionâ programme in the period in question; support for the interactive and innovative youth seminars; establishing European Youth week as a regular fixture; and lastly the need to ensure that young people with disadvantages can participate in the programme on an equal footing, thus excluding any discrimination.
The âYouth in Actionâ programme will be a substantially simplified successor to the current âYouthâ programme.
There was a broad-ranging consultation process before the proposal was drawn up, as provided for in the White Paper on youth policy.
To some degree, the proposal thus reflects the initiative of the Heads of State or Government to form a âEuropean Youth Pactâ.
The âYouth in Actionâ programme covers five measures and will cost EURÂ 915Â million.
It will enter into force in January 2007 and will be managed on a decentralised basis, with some centralised measures managed by an executive agency.
Â Â  I welcomed this report.
The current YOUTH programme will come to an end in 2006 and this proposal is for a successor programme â YOUTH in Action â which will cover the period 2007-2013.
If the recommendations are carried out, the new programme will be simpler, less bureaucratic and easier to access.
The programme will now be funded from one heading rather than four and projects will be managed on a decentralised basis.
The programme also takes into consideration the requirements of the Lisbon Process.
Â Â  I support programmes for voluntary service and youth in/for the world, especially involving cooperation with non-EU countries.
These create genuine solidarity with, and understanding of, the world around us.
I cannot, however, vote in favour of the increase of EURÂ 200Â million, proposed mainly because the share for Youth for Europe is being increased.
Youth for Europe is aimed at creating a new form of Euronationalism, something that history should have taught us to avoid.
I am therefore abstaining from voting, since the proposal has negative as well as positive aspects.
Â Â  . The purpose of this report is to improve on some aspects of the new programme for culture proposed by the Commission for 2007/2013.
When taken as a whole, this document, like others in the field of culture, is highly ambivalent and could produce inconsistent results.
On the one hand, it could represent an opportunity to foster not only cultural (artistic and scientific) creativity, research and dissemination, but also the democratisation (and not only the expansion) of access to cultural fulfilment and production.
On the other hand, even if some positive results ensure â because of or in spite of the programme â this could prove to be a form of mass cultural subjugation, an attempt to engender an obedient culture, or a new step on the road to the establishment of a cultural and ideological hegemony.
I feel, however, that much will be decided on the ground.
Whilst the objective of promoting the transnational mobility of cultural players could reflect a desire to promote a more international perspective, and could be indicative of the element of cultural output that aspires to dialogue and more universal aims, it could also serve other less cultural and more financial interests.
We welcome the amendments referring to the importance of preserving, researching and accessing cultural heritage, the diversity of language and culture, together with the amendments, however inadequate ...
Â Â  Cultural issues are, of course, very important.
The June List is of the view that cultural policy should in principle be taken care of by the Member States.
When it comes to the European cultural heritage, there may, however, be justification for dealing with certain issues at Community level.
Individual items of expenditure should not, however, be debated until the EUâs long-term budget has been adopted.
The June List has therefore chosen to vote against this report.
Â Â  . â The aim of Culture 2007 is to modify the procedures used for awarding grants so that they are simpler than those used in the context of Culture 2000.
In actual fact, one of the criticisms made of this programme concerns the poor way in which the system is managed. The âpull factorâ the system has on cultural operators creates a flood of projects, which are then selected in a seemingly arbitrary way: 80% of the projects presented are said to be rejected on procedural grounds!
Yet, are we really sure that Culture 2007 is going to improve matters in that area?
Rather, is it not the case that European bureaucracy itself is the issue?
In response to the famous words of Jean Monnet, who said: âif it were to be done again, I would begin with cultureâ, two remarks can be made:
- that is a stupid thing to say, since European culture already existed, and had always existed; it is precisely for that reason that we talk about Europe!
- thank goodness the technocrats in Brussels are not in charge of culture; otherwise it would be in a sad state today; one only need look at what happened to agriculture and the steel industry.
Â Â  I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on the Culture programme 2007-2013.
Certainly, it is important to promote intercultural dialogue, cross-border cultural projects and cultural exchanges that increase understanding of different cultures in Europe and that help give European citizenship some practical content.
The most practical feature of the European Parliamentâs report is, however, a very large increase in the budget appropriations compared with what is proposed by the Commission.
Since I cannot support this budget increase, I have chosen to abstain from voting on the report.
I believe that the Commissionâs proposal as to how much money should be budgeted for the culture programme is perfectly adequate.
Â Â  I welcomed this report which establishes a new programme for cultural cooperation across Europe from 2007-2013.
It aims to foster a common cultural area through the development of cultural cooperation in Europe.
The funding this programme makes available to support arts and cultural organisations which undertake cooperative projects with organisations in other Member States will be warmly welcome by many organisations which often struggle to obtain funding for cross border events.
I also welcome the boost this programme will give to the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector.
Â Â  . The Culture programme is primarily aimed at promoting the transnational mobility of cultural players, the transnational circulation of artistic and cultural works and products, and intercultural dialogue.
In the new programme for the period 2007-2013, measures are put forward with a view to promoting dialogue and mutual knowledge of European culture.
I feel that the amendments that were tabled have been a key factor in achieving greater flexibility with regard to the duration of projects and in ensuring simplified procedures for participation.
I should also like to stress the need to strike a consistent balance between the principles of complementarity and subsidiarity in the drafting of new Community action programmes.
Law-making should be results-orientated.
This is particularly true when we are addressing issues such as improving the knowledge and dissemination of the culture and history of the people of Europe and conserving and safeguarding cultural heritage of European significance.
I should therefore like to stress the importance of exchanging good practice in the area of Europeâs cultural heritage, the mobility of artists and new forms of cultural expression.
I voted in favour of the GraÃ§a Moura report.
Â Â  I have always spoken up for culture, but this programme removes resources from national culture budgets.
Even the proposal of EURÂ 408 million is an increase of 72%.
When the European Parliament then increases the figure to EURÂ 600 million, it is too much.
AmendmentÂ 29, about strengthening a sense of European citizenship, is an example of the negative Euronationalism that is constantly prevalent in the Committee on Culture and Education.
Moreover, the programme is far too burdensome to administer, a factor that cultural workers in all countries are agreed is an obstacle to creative development.
I am therefore voting against this proposal.
Â Â  I support this report and the need for a MEDIA 2007 programme to follow up on the MEDIA (1996-2000) and MEDIA Plus (2001-2006).
The E.U. currently has a trade deficit with the U.S. of over USD 8 billion per year in the audiovisual sector.
We have to intensify our efforts to make the European industry more competitive and better able to rival that of the U.S. industry.
Â Â  The audiovisual sector in Europe is going through a difficult period.
The previous MEDIA programmes produced good results.
Now, that programme is setting itself more ambitious goals, such as full cultural integration of the enlarged Europe.
Here, I believe it is appropriate to give support to the archives of the European film and audiovisual heritage, which may even contain works which would not deserve to go down in history.
There is no doubt, however, that every creative work bears enduring witness to a period in time and therefore helps posterity to understand the values and tastes of a generation.
Understanding oneâs past should also help to define oneâs future better.
Finally, I should like to emphasise one aspect which does not appear in Mr Hieronymiâs report and which I believe is fundamental for the audiovisual sector, which should be based on accurate information concerning its contents.
I refer to the need to protect minors, who are among the largest users of audiovisual works and, as such, worthy of respect and consideration.
I have therefore proposed amendments to fill those gaps.
In the debate, these amendments gained the support of many Members and were mentioned by the Commissioner, whom I would ask to take account âŠ
Â Â  . The MEDIA 2007 programme is primarily aimed at promoting a European audiovisual market against a backdrop of strong competition from the US market.
This EU programme could make a major contribution to economic growth and jobs in the EU, given that audiovisual works are cultural and economic goods and services.
We must help to integrate creative and cultural aspects into industrial production, particularly in a Europe replete with SMEs.
I therefore feel it is essential that we speed up the funding procedure and encourage close cooperation in order to meet the challenge laid down by digitalisation.
This will help to reduce the imbalance between countries with high and low production capacities and will contribute towards the increased circulation of European audiovisual works both within and outside the EU.
In so doing, we will also be strengthening the competitiveness of the European film industry.
I voted in favour of the Hieronymi report.
Â Â  â Madam President, I have a request to make of you and of this House; it is that we send a letter to the people of Mexico expressing our sympathy.
In view of the fact that we have a free trade agreement with that country, and also a special agreement, we should write a letter to the Mexican Government to the effect that we have the utmost sympathy with the Mexican people as they face up to the damage that the hurricane has caused.
We should also join with the Commission and the Council in considering the options available under that agreement for providing aid in special circumstances, by which I do not, in this instance, mean financial aid, but aid in its widest sense.
I would be most appreciative, Madam President, if you could give me an assurance that such a letter will be written.
Â Â  I will pass that on to the President of Parliament.
I am sure that Mr Borrell will be grateful for that suggestion and will write the letter to which you refer.
I am equally persuaded that you will assist him with your expertise and can suggest some forms of words that he might use.
What I actually wanted to do now was to announce as the next item the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania.
I will indeed do that, but I will wait for a moment in the hope that the Commissioner can manage to get out of the Commission meeting and come to us, as it would make sense to wait until we have heard what Commissioner Rehn has to say about the Commission statement on Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs progress towards accession before discussing it.
Otherwise we would go straight into the debate.
I assume that honourable Members will want to hear the Commissioner before they make their own contributions.
Much obliged though I am to the various groups for their suggestions, I will nonetheless wait a moment more.
I am looking at the Commission benches, which are not entirely vacant, and will try to find out whether someone there can give me an idea when we can expect Commissioner Rehn to turn up.
Â Â  The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on progress towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania.
Â Â  . Madam President, Strasbourg is not an ideal place to deal with such important reports in Commission meetings.
There is a Commission meeting still going on, while we also have other important issues to deal with, such as avian flu.
I therefore apologise for being somewhat late.
First of all, I welcome the opportunity of presenting the results of our intensive monitoring of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs preparations for accession and also holding an exchange of views with you on this important issue.
Let me also thank Parliament, especially its Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the rapporteurs, Messrs Van Orden and Moscovici, for their contribution to this exercise.
When we opened accession negotiations in early 2000 with an additional six candidate countries, we could not know how long the accession negotiations with each of them would finally take.
Quite clearly, all six countries were part of the fifth enlargement round.
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will therefore complete this fifth round of enlargement, encompassing 12Â countries in total.
Overall, the reports on the two countries show that both have continued to make progress in fulfilling their accession requirements.
Bulgaria, having rather lost momentum after the conclusion of the negotiations in summer 2004, has now worked energetically to make up for lost time after the parliamentary elections of June 2005.
Romania has caught up impressively in the fields of justice reform, competition policy and the state aids regime, as well as the overall level of alignment with EU legislation.
Both countries continue to fulfil the political criteria, which are, as you know, related to the rule of law, human rights and democracy.
While much has been done, there is a need for further progress.
In particular, efforts are needed to pursue the reform of public administration, to implement effectively the reform of the justice system and to step up the fight against corruption, particularly high-level corruption.
In the area of human rights and the protection of minorities and vulnerable groups, further efforts are needed by Bulgaria and Romania.
As for the economic criteria, both countries should be able to comply with them by accession, provided that they continue and intensify their efforts.
Both registered robust economic growth last year: 5.6% in Bulgaria and 8.3% in Romania.
Both have also pursued structural reforms to their economies.
In the case of Bulgaria, particular attention has to be paid to the widening current account deficit.
Labour market reforms also need to be enhanced.
In Romania, the external balance, wage policy and strengthening of the governmentâs revenue base call for continued attention.
As regards alignment with the EU legal order â the â we have screened in detail legislative and administrative preparations across 140 separate areas within all 29 chapters.
Over 50% of all areas monitored are non-problematic.
That does not mean that everything is perfect in those areas, but it means that no real problems are expected, provided that the current pace of preparations is maintained.
In the second category, there are areas where the state of preparations calls for increased efforts.
Here, both countriesâ authorities are encouraged to target their reform efforts better, so as to come into line with EU requirements in the period leading up to accession.
This covers around a third of the areas.
We have also identified a limited number of issues of serious concern, covering approximately 10% of the areas covered by the .
These are areas where, unless the countries take immediate and decisive corrective action, they will not be ready by the envisaged date of accession.
Some of these areas require a technical solution.
For instance, Bulgaria must reduce the high proportion of uninsured vehicles on the roads; for its part, Romania must fulfil EU requirements in the field of taxation.
With regard to these areas of serious concern, I would like to make three particular points.
The first relates to Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs ability to reap fully the benefits from EU funds upon accession.
To manage EU funds, an overall reinforcement of the administrative structures in both countries is required. This includes the setting-up of paying agencies for agricultural funds and the required structures in the field of regional policy.
Secondly, we are also seriously concerned about areas linked to the functioning of the internal market and to the internal security of the European Union.
These include, for example, shortcomings identified in the veterinary sector, which could put at risk the sustainability of food safety in the enlarged EU, and the control of external borders in both countries.
The third area of particular concern is the fight against corruption, where too limited progress has been made so far.
The failure to obtain even a single significant conviction for high-level corruption in recent years, despite commonly available information on its scale, is a cause for serious concern.
Urgent efforts are needed here by the judiciaries of both countries.
With regard to these shortcomings, the authorities in both countries are strongly encouraged to take decisive and immediate action. This would show that both countries can be relied on to play their parts as future members of the European Union.
The Commission will continue to support Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs efforts to prepare for accession to the European Union.
Our financial contribution will focus on measures to tackle the shortcomings identified.
The total volume of pre-accession assistance available is substantial.
The EU budget in 2006 for Bulgaria is around EURÂ 545 million and for Romania EURÂ 1Â 155 million, in other words more than EURÂ 1.1Â billion for Romania.
The Commission will also pursue its intensive monitoring of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs preparations.
Next spring, we shall review the situation and may, if necessary, recommend postponing accession by one year.
We hope that steps undertaken by both countries will lead us to conclude that such a recommendation is not necessary.
As formally confirmed by PresidentÂ Barroso to President Borrell before the summer break, I will also seriously consider your views on the matter before issuing a recommendation on whether or not to postpone the accession of either one or both of the countries.
As I have clearly stated before, should there be serious shortcomings, we would not hesitate to make use of all our remedial tools. This includes not only the possibility of postponing accession by one year, but also all other available safeguard clauses.
I trust that honourable Members of Parliament can agree to this approach.
Now is not the time to speculate on the Commissionâs recommendation, but for the acceding countries to concentrate all their energy on the outstanding shortcomings identified in our reports.
The possibility of being ready in 2007 has not been lost, but it will require plenty of work from both countries.
The present report is not the final assessment; that will be provided next spring, in April or May.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the constant interest and support of the European Parliament for Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs accession process.
I look forward to a continued dialogue with you on the implementation of Bulgariaâs and Romaniaâs commitments.
I trust that the newly-arrived observers from the two countries will contribute positively, so as to influence the perceptions of Bulgaria and Romania within the EU.
The European Parliament has played a decisive role in ensuring that the fifth round of enlargement is well prepared.
I am grateful for the cooperation received since I have been in office and look forward to discussing the challenges ahead.
Â Â  â Madam President, on a point of order, I think my point has already been made.
We are supposed to start at 3 p.m. but you do not seem able to get here for 3 p.m. and nor does the Commissioner.
Â Â  I am sorry, that is not a point of order.
I have cut off your microphone.
You can make a point order if you wish, but please tell me the Rule.
Just simply asking the Commission to be on time is all very well but not very polite, especially when the Commissioner told you that he left the Commission meeting.
We are not going to have a discussion about that.
Â Â  . â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a subject on which the Commissioner and I do not always agree, but I have to say, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that he is taking a very cooperative line with the House and is also available to the Committee whenever necessary.
I would like to thank him for that, and also for what he has said about the procedure agreed with this House at the time of the ratification last spring, according to which Parliament is again consulted on the accession date before the Commission puts its decision to the Council.
We have to consider the progress these countries have made; they belong to the Group of Twelve, of which 10 have already become Member States, and so their eventual accession to the European Union is not a matter of doubt.
The question is whether this is to happen, as the Treaties require, on 1 January 2007, or a year later, although there is the possibility of whole chapters being annulled up to three years after their accession if they are not implemented as they need to be.
I am sure that our rapporteurs, and also the Committee on Foreign Affairs, will, acting on this plenaryâs behalf and in partnership with the Commission, apply the most exact judgment in determining whether the conditions are right for accession to take place on 1 January 2007.
Todayâs statement by the Commission is what I would describe as a âyellow cardâ.
These countries are being given the chance to make up the time they lost as a result of their internal political circumstances, but reference has been made to desperately serious matters that give rise to grave cause for concern, such as, among others, these countriesâ absorption capacity and the capacity of the internal market to operate.
There are also questions touching upon the justice system, such as the fight against corruption, and also on the development of administration to enable the internal market to function, which is in these countriesâ interests and also in the interests of the European Union.
Although accession is not conditional upon the Constitution being in place, the failure to ratify it has meant that there are problems with the constitutional process.
These are additional problems that we cannot burden ourselves with if the conditions are not fulfilled, and, at any rate, issues that we will have to examine with a critical eye.
There are also issues that have to do with corruption and organised crime, issues of internal security, the problems to which the Commission has referred in relation to the external borders, and these are issues that are very important indeed, not least in the eyes of the public.
If the European Unionâs citizens are to see it as being capable of further development, it must be clear that there is nothing automatic about these things, but that, on the contrary, we are taking the examination of the conditions seriously and will act only after having done so, rather than out of political compliance.
It is for this reason that we will, over the coming months, be addressing this issue with a very great deal of seriousness indeed.
While we do want these countries to become Member States of the European Union, we also have to create the conditions under which that can be a workable proposition, and it is for that reason that I, on behalf of my group, and perhaps also on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, would like to accept the Commissionâs invitation to work very closely with it in order that the decision we take early next year may be the right one.
Â Â  . â MadamÂ President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking MrÂ Wiersma, who has given up his turn to speak, as I cannot be present for the entire debate.
I should also like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the Commission, which is, I believe, entirely in accordance both with the conclusions of the European Council and with the resolutions voted in favour of by our Parliament.
In December 2004, we decided to close negotiations.
The main areas of reform in which progress needed to be made with regard to the â I am referring to justice, internal affairs, competition and the environment â were identified, and it was also decided, at that time, that these reforms would be monitored by the Commission, with the possibility â the assumption â that a safeguard clause would be introduced, which could postpone membership by one year.
The work presented to us today is rigorous and objective.
I believe that it successfully marks the progress made, that it highlights what limits exist and that it points out what efforts remain to be made, and, as MrÂ Brok has just said, this approach has, I believe, our full support.
I should like, however, to draw four conclusions of a more political nature from my reading of the reports.
The first is that we have a common objective, and that objective is the simultaneous accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union.
This is the culmination of the great liberation movement that took place in Eastern Europe.
Holding debates on one particular country or anotherâs relation to the EUâs borders is all very well, but such debates obviously do not apply to Romania and Bulgaria, as the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has just said.
It is not a question of if, but of when Romania and Bulgaria join the EU.
My second conclusion: the Commissionâs report highlights both the progress and the efforts that need to be made.
A great deal of progress is required.
I, for my part, am not sure that the report should be shown the yellow card, for when I see what is said about freedom of expression, justice, the integration of minorities, the protection of minors and competition, I say to myself that there are no grounds to draw negative conclusions about the report, because what has been addressed is not without significance. At the same time, the report highlights substantial efforts that need to be made, and even points of concern that still remain.
Firstly, one such point of concern is high-level corruption, to tackle which clearly defined institutions and all-out determination are required. A further point of concern is external borders, which need to be secure and controlled, while other points include trafficking in human beings, the environment and the integration of the Roma community.
Dealing with these issues is no small task, either.
My third conclusion: I agree with the procedure now proposed by the Commission.
Today is not the time to give a definitive opinion on the safeguard clause; it would be premature to do so.
The monitoring exercise has to be pursued extremely strictly, and, in this respect, it is relevant to arrange for a meeting to be held in April or May.
I would remind the Commissioner that the European Parliament wants to be fully involved in making the final decision.
Today, we have stopped in midstream: the safeguard clause is not desirable for Romania, for Bulgaria or for the EU, but the idea of it cannot be brushed aside.
I will conclude by reaffirming a desire, which I know is shared on all, or almost all, sides of this Chamber: we want Romania and Bulgaria to join the EU, and we want them to do so on 1 January 2007.
This desire has not been brought into question.
It remains intact after the reports have been read but, as the Commissionâs report highlights, Romania and Bulgaria hold the key to their membership.
The spirit in which we will support the Commission will remain unchanged, and that spirit is one of not only offering friendship and trust but also of making demands.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I really am very glad indeed that we are able to have this first debate on this subject with our observers present.
I think that is quite tremendous.
I would like to join in thanking the Commission for the outstanding work it has done.
My group joins with the others in welcoming the choice of procedure, which involves â as Mr Moscovici has just said â the consultation of Parliament on the recommendation next spring.
There are a few things I would like to say about Bulgaria.
As the country has come through an election and the formation of a government, it is not surprising that the latest progress report by the Commission takes a more critical line than its predecessors.
For that reason, I want to start by saying that, while my group supports Bulgaria as it moves towards becoming a Member State of the European Union, we do expect the necessary reforms to be carried out with more discipline and purposefulness than they were last year.
Results matter, for it is on the basis of the results achieved that the national parliaments will evaluate the accession treaties.
Bulgaria has made progress to an enormous degree.
In terms of economic performance, the country is definitely in the overtaking lane.
Its dynamism and 6.2% growth rate â the sort of growth I wish my own country could produce â gives confidence to the foreign investors who are discovering Bulgaria as a place in which to put their money.
Bulgaria owes its considerable economic success mainly to the previous governmentâs far-sighted policies.
The fact is, though, that the finest of roses are invisible if they are obscured by weeds.
The successes that have been achieved cannot make their impact felt when corruption is unchecked, the law is unstable, and long overdue reforms are not carried out.
So let us consider the justice system.
On 15 October, the Bulgarian parliament passed a new Code of Criminal Procedure; while this is an important step in the right direction, it is one that has taken too long.
The reforms must now be put into practice without delay.
Moving on to corruption and the fight against it, one has to acknowledge that progress has been made in combating small-scale corruption.
What is now vital is that attention should be focussed on corruption in the upper echelons of politics, business and the administration, and that there should be a sustained campaign against it.
Paradoxically enough, the fact that Bulgaria is at number 55 on Transparency Internationalâs Index seems, at first sight, to be a poor performance, but then one notes that Turkey is placed at number 65, Croatia at 70 and Romania at 85, so Bulgaria has already achieved a certain amount on this front.
Let me make it perfectly clear that neither the Commission â I am sure of that, Commissioner â nor this House expect Bulgaria to produce miracles.
Everyone present in this Chamber is well aware that progress demands painful reforms and cannot be achieved overnight.
What we want is for the Bulgarian Government to make progress where it is in its power to do so.
That brings me to consider policy in relation to minorities, something that my group regards as particularly important.
To this day, the Bulgarian authorities have not succeeded in finding the 15 experts of which the National Council for Co-Operation on Ethnic and Demographic Issues is meant to consist, and that does not augur well for the prospect of integrating the Roma into Bulgarian society.
Precisely how the framework programme for this purpose is to be implemented remains vague and unclear.
Paper is patient, but we are not; a lack of ambition is not something that Bulgaria can afford at this decisive point in its history.
Let me conclude by saying that the Commissionâs, and my groupâs, critical observations are not intended to discourage the Bulgarian Government â on the contrary, they should be understood as an encouragement to go down the last stretch on the way towards accession with the sense of purpose and earnestness that this demands.
I might add that I believe we should be holding this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg.
Â Â  . â Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, earlier this year, my group had its own doubts about the new government, but we were very much in favour of giving it the opportunity to address a large number of serious problems.
The moment of truth has now arrived.
Has the new government succeeded or failed?
If we listen to the Commissioner and read the report, we can, in fact, discern a picture emerging that is in keeping with recent Amnesty International reports â a combination of progress in some areas, but ongoing problems in a number of others.
It is up to this House â and I am also addressing the Romanian and Bulgarian representatives when I say this â to focus on the existing problems that still need addressing, which you may or may not like, because I share Mr Brokâs view that there is no automatism that could solve all the problems.
Allow me to single out two of them.
One of them is the fight against corruption, and this is where we have to be honest.
The image we in the Netherlands, but also in many other Member States, have of Romania is determined in the public mind by the notion that that country suffers greatly from corruption, whether that be at low level or the highest level.
It is particularly at this highest level of bureaucracy and politics that something must be done, and that is why it is a good thing â I would like to say this here â that, for example, an old case that was closed in 2003 against Mrs Puwak, the former EU minister in Romania, has been reopened, because there was something fishy about that case, to put it bluntly.
Something must be done about this, and I would urge the Romanian authorities to really give this priority.
You cannot afford to leave this matter to be dealt with by a handful of public prosecutors and judges alone.
I would urge you to do what you can in order to remove that image many European citizens have.
Secondly, with regard to the environment and food safety, the Commission has turned its attention to another issue that is a sensitive one for many members of the European public, that being food safety.
I think that accession should be out of the question if a country does not regulate that properly.
The Commission is right to focus on this.
What is missing, though, is attention to genetically modified organisms.
According to the Commissionâs very brief statement on this subject, there are no real concerns there.
This is inconsistent with reports issued by Greenpeace, among others, which are far more alarming.
Romania is Europeâs largest area for genetically modified organisms.
It grows crops that would be unlawful in the EU, and because of a lack of knowledge on the part of the Romanian authorities, there is very little in the way of information to the Romanian public and it is impossible to check whether European guidelines are adhered to.
That is unacceptable.
A country such as this cannot join the European Union just like that.
Those problems, namely corruption and GMOs, must be resolved by the beginning of next year.
In the unlikely event of this not being done, then it should be possible to defer accession by one year.
To the Commissioner, who is a football fan, I would say the following. We have often mentioned yellow cards.
If at the end of regular match time, neither of the teams has scored, then extra time can be granted.
That too, is part and parcel of the rules.
Â Â  . â Madam President, for more than 30 years, first the European Communities and then the European Union have been involved in enlarging the number of Member States and have swallowed up other cooperatives.
Since the great enlargement of 2004, when all of a sudden more new Member States joined than in the 70s, 80s and 90s combined, something has changed.
Previous to that, each enlargement was a success, but many people nowadays regard enlargement as a threat.
It is unlikely that the example of Spain and Ireland, which quickly made up the shortfall with the help of generous financial contributions from the EU, will be followed.
Many newcomers become dependent on the exports of cheap agricultural products, cheap mining products and, above all, cheap labour, while they have to import expensive new technology.
The old Member States expect they will need to make increasing payments to the newcomers and, above all, they expect increasing levels of unemployment, possibly by low-wage competition.
Despite this, the new Member States are still lagging behind.
With regard to Romania and Bulgaria, a decision was taken in April to the effect that they are allowed to join as the rearguard of the 10 newcomers of 2004.
I now hear comments, even in this House, about tracing a final external border for Europe, about restricting the solidarity contribution from the rich to the poor Member States, about the use of national referendums as a means whereby current Member States can reject newcomers and even about suspending any enlargement until such time as the people in France and the Netherlands get round to rubberstamping the Constitution that they emphatically rejected.
Although my group does not condone the economic and military choices in that Constitution, or the democratic deficit that the text reinforces, our criticism is not levelled at the new Member States, with a lower standard of living, that seek to join the EU.
Indeed, the contrary is the case; their admission could help the European Union focus more on common, large-scale and cross-border issues and less on unnecessary interference in matters that could be better evaluated and ordered on a smaller scale.
Croatia and Macedonia are, in principle, welcome, as is Turkey, provided that it becomes more democratic and respects human rights.
My group is opposed to making unworkable demands on newcomers.
Financial and economic demands that impoverish large sections of their people and deprive them of social security do not contribute to progress, but to the corruption of society.
If, however, the European Union wants to contribute to the quality of society, we must be tough on the environment, human rights and good governance.
Are we now absolutely certain that near Rosia Montana, or elsewhere in Romania, no gold is being mined with dangerous chemical substances that result in streams of toxic water in that country and in neighbouring countries?
Are we certain that the Kresna gorge in Bulgaria, being a vulnerable nature reserve, is protected against the increasing freight traffic by road?
Are the new laws that are copied and translated from the actually implemented?
Are the equal rights of the substantial Roma population guaranteed?
What about the orphans and food safety?
Sadly, we have not had adequate responses to those questions from either candidate country, which means that we cannot give our verdict about what should happen next until next year.
Â Â  . â Madam President, in this speech, I am going to confine myself to the candidacy of Romania, a country that has had a very difficult year, having endured three destructive flood disasters that claimed 66 lives, with material damage amounting to EUR 1.5 billion.
In a situation such as this, one would expect the highest authorities to display national harmony, but nothing could be further from the truth.
The President and Prime Minister were at loggerheads in public over new elections.
Commissioner Rehnâs efforts made it possible for this danger to the countryâs political stability to be averted in good time, but for how long?
All of this is taking place at a critical stage of Romaniaâs accession to the European Union.
I would like to ask the Commissioner what he thinks of President Basescuâs political sense of responsibility in this matter.
The so-called super safeguard clause applied by the Council to Romaniaâs accession date and to no other countryâs identifies 11 specific problem areas, and I should like to touch on some of them.
What, Commissioner, is the latest news on the tax benefits that the Romanian state promised the buyer of the steel magnet Ispat Sidex?
Does the Commission regard Prime Minister Tariceanuâs concession to give Romanian farmers financial help with the purchase of tractors from the factory in Brasov as an infringement of the EUâs competition directives?
A second difficulty concerns solid border control by the Romanian authorities.
That goes without saying, because once Romania has joined, no less than 1Â 457 km of the total national borders of 2Â 508 km will form part of the EUâs external border, quite apart from the issue of the control of the Romanian Black Sea coast.
We are, after all, dealing with a corridor for smuggling people, drugs and arms to Europe.
In short, the fact that training and funding problems are hampering the necessary recruitment drive of 4Â 000 Romanian border guards should be of major concern to the Commission.
Will it take action?
Almost inevitably, the third difficulty will touch upon the sense of urgency with which the government gets the menace of corruption under control.
What action does the Commission intend to take, though, when that fight against corruption at the highest level becomes more and more a political instrument within the governing coalition and within the executive?
The new government should, in any event, be measured against its moral claims.
That is something that the Romanian coalition should take seriously.
It is then unacceptable to refuse to be open about what one possesses.
Â Â  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like, firstly, to extend a warm and affectionate welcome to our Bulgarian and Romanian parliamentary colleagues, as observers.
Commissioner, our group is particularly appreciative not only of your speech but also of the systematic dialogue and discussion between Parliament and the Commission.
With regard to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania into the European Union, I should like to remind our observers that there is a very substantial majority in this Parliament in favour of their two countries.
For us, it is not so much an enlargement as a reunification with countries of an unquestionably European tradition.
Here in Parliament there is even a majority in favour of the accession of Turkey, so it is hardly surprising that there is also a majority favourable and attentive to your membership.
However, the Commissioner's report highlighted real grounds for concern: to put it light-heartedly, I hope that the lateness of the Commissionerâs arrival here today (albeit amply justified) is not a foretaste of delays in the accession of our two brother counties to the European Union.
However, problems do exist.
There is no doubt â as already emphasised and now reiterated by us in this Chamber â that progress, even substantial progress, has been made.
We are fully aware of the state and condition your countries were in after years of an oppressive leftist regime.
We know the problems you have had to face in the past and therefore are highly appreciative of the progress you have made, although there are still serious problems which have to be solved â and solved quickly â if we are to avoid forcing the European Union into something I hope does not occur, namely a deferral of entry by one year or possibly more.
Our wish is for both Bulgaria and Romania to join the European Union in 2007.
However, some problems have to be solved â and solved by you.
The observers at todayâs session should take away with them Parliament's goodwill but also its concerns.
There is much you can do in your own countries to move the reform process further forward.
The delays that still exist must be eliminated, particularly in the areas of corruption and internal security.
The events of recent days give us all cause for great concern in the areas of the environment and health, and there are worries on the conditions of the external borders.
We therefore invite you to take up this great challenge, because we want to have you here with us in 2007.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â MadamÂ President, on 25Â April the Treaty concerning the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union was signed in Luxembourg.
I remember well the debate and vote that took place at the time, as well as the general mood in the House.
In spite of the many criticisms voiced, noÂ one disputed the fact that Romania and Bulgaria are part of the European family.
This continues to be the case today, and in fact the opposite is true.
Everyone, or nearly everyone, is delighted at the decision that has been taken.
Previous speakers have already underlined the fact that shortcomings still exist in the fields of public administration, the judiciary and respect for human rights, in particular the rights of the mentally ill, as reported by Amnesty International.
In spite of this, we welcome the efforts made by Romania and Bulgaria and their achievements to date.
Corruption is one of the most difficult problems to overcome, since it is deeply ingrained in the psyche of people raised for generations in poverty, oppression and injustice under Communist rule.
As a Pole, I understand this well, and I would encourage Romanians and Bulgarians to fight this scourge from within and without.
The two countries should take todayâs criticism as an incentive to undertake further efforts to ensure that accession can take place on 1Â JanuaryÂ 2007.
I am quite sure that Romania and Bulgaria too want a strong and just Europe that is capable of making demands of itself and of others.
Â Â  â Madam President, I speak as the rapporteur for Bulgaria.
First of all I would like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his statement and for his continuing strong commitment to successful enlargement of the European Union.
We should all be conscious that the eyes of Bulgaria are on us today and both the tone and content of our message will be significant.
Overall I see the Commissionâs report as positive, while focusing attention on the importance and urgency of outstanding commitments still to be fulfilled.
I hope I do not detect from the Commissionerâs remarks any dampening of enthusiasm for the timely accession of Bulgaria.
At this final stage it should not, in a way, be surprising if the Commission has been even more rigorous in its comments.
But we now seem to be in a situation where the wedding has taken place, the marriage register has been signed and presents have been received, but the bridge and groom have been told they cannot walk out of the church together just yet, partly because we are not sure what the situation is like outside.
Progress has continued in Bulgaria.
It needs to be faster, but there has been a change in the external political environment.
It would be quite wrong if Bulgaria were to suffer at all from any of this negative background noise.
Certainly urgent action by Bulgaria is required in some key areas.
It is insufficient merely to pass laws.
I do not underestimate the political energy and commitment required to do even this, but legislation has to be robustly implemented and the results clear for all to see.
The people of Bulgaria gave a mixed message in their general election on 25Â June.
They were not sure of the best way ahead.
What is clear is that they must be able to have confidence in their authorities at all levels.
The rule of law and therefore judicial reform, combating corruption and organised crime are the prerequisites for everything else, including economic performance.
This is just one area of particular concern; there are, of course, others.
I see that the Commission is calling for improvements in the business environment including labour market flexibility.
Forgive me if I remark that perhaps the Commission needs to put its own house in order and stop introducing new regulations which add to the costs and burdens of business and reduce competitiveness and growth.
In its report today the Commission has sounded a warning bell, without making a recommendation either way concerning the date of accession. It will, however, do so in April and this will influence the decision of the Council and of this Parliament, which must of course be consulted.
That means that we have a precious six months for Bulgaria to demonstrate solid progress and real results, so that the goal of accession on 1Â January 2007 can be achieved.
On the basis of todayâs report, I see no reason why that date should be missed.
Â Â  â Madam President, in recent years, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has shown itself to be a consistent advocate of the EUâs enlargement through the accession of countries from Central and Eastern Europe.
When those countries join, we can finally put an end to the division of Europe that has lasted dozens of years, and to the major inequality this has caused between East and West.
That is why on 13 April of this year, the Socialist Group, by an overwhelming majority, voted to endorse the accession treaties with Bulgaria and Romania.
Since there was a 20-month interval between the time of approval by the European Parliament and the planned date of accession, namely 1 January 2007, this approval was given in the full knowledge that in both Romania and Bulgaria, further progress should be made in a number of important areas before they can fully comply with the EUâs membership requirements.
In my group, though, there was also the confidence that both countries should be deemed capable of taking the necessary steps prior to the ultimate accession and of actually implementing those.
It should be noted that the inclusion of a safeguard clause which makes it possible to defer the date of accession by one year, along with the firm promise by both the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament fully in a decision about a possible application of this safeguard clause has played a major part in our giving consent.
The Socialist Group is consistent in its policy on the enlargement of the European Union.
As was the case when the 10 new Member States joined last year, we want the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to be a success for the people of both countries, of course, without them presenting an unacceptable burden to the present European Union.
Consequently, we will not be using a fine-tooth comb to go through the reports presented by the Commission today about progress made in the preparation to accession in order to find arguments to wait for another year.
As we see it, the areas of concern and criticism mentioned in the reports are mainly a guideline for the governments and parliaments of both Bulgaria and Romania to take the necessary measures in the time that remains.
At the same time, these reports also identify the areas where both countries could use further support from the European Union in order to be able to achieve the intended objective of full membership of the European Union in 2007.
It is totally irrelevant, for that matter, to our groupâs support for the enlargement or our criticism of progress of the accession process, who and which parties are in power in either country.
The only thing that matters is what those in power do in order to meet the predetermined conditions for full accession.
We hope â obviously in the interest of the people of Bulgaria and Romania â that this opinion is shared by the other groups in this House.
The reports presented by the Commission today do not fill us with the confidence that is needed to conclude at this stage that both Romania and Bulgaria will meet the conditions for accession on 1 January 2007 to a sufficient degree.
There is no need yet.
We can, however, see a reason for moderate optimism that both countries will be able to meet the set requirements at the next assessment, the one that really counts, in April of next year.
Much will need to be done though, both in the decision-making process about, and the introduction of, missing legislation, as well as on the score of practical implementation; especially the fight against corruption and organised crime deserve most attention in this.
On a personal level â because I have much experience in dealing with this problem â I should like to add that both reports are right to express the Commissionâs concern about the situation of the Roma in both countries, and the fact the governments in both countries still have no adequate and effective way of addressing this problem.
I think that this issue should carry a lot of weight in our final verdict.
It is an important point to us, but also to the Roma in both countries.
Following a period of stagnation and delays in connection with parliamentary elections and the problems involving the forming of government, the Bulgarian Government seems to have picked up where it left off with renewed energy and decisiveness.
It is reassuring to establish that that countryâs key political parties have joined forces in order to guide their country into the European Union together.
I would like to urge the key political parties in Romania, the Romanian Government and the countryâs President, to demonstrate that same level of unanimity where the accession is concerned and not waste valuable time on political wrangling.
Finally, I should like to announce that my group, the Socialist Group, obviously in cooperation with the Commission, will, in the coming months, be carrying out its own analysis of progress made in the accession process.
In that way, this spring, we will be able to take the decision whether both countries are really ready to take on all responsibilities of EU membership in a well-considered fashion and according to agreements made.
Â Â  â Madam President, I warmly congratulate Commissioner Rehn and his expert team in Brussels, as well as Mr Jonathan Scheele and his expert team in Bucharest.
The Commissionâs work becomes ever more vital in the final months which bring to a conclusion the long and arduous trek that both nations â Romania and Bulgaria â have undertaken in their search for the promised land of EU membership.
This is the best report yet for Romania.
It is a matter of pride to me that this comes out now, under the British Presidency.
I want to congratulate not just Mr Quinton Quayle, the British Ambassador in Bucharest, but the entire diplomatic corps of all EU Member States who have put such time, effort and energy into assisting Romania in achieving her goal.
We have the enlargement minister from Romania in the diplomatic gallery with us today, as well as the minister for child protection and the minister for child adoption, Mrs Teodora Bertzi.
Perhaps, therefore, I could comment most warmly on the triumph of the reform of child protection that has taken place during the period under discussion, since 1999.
That year, at the Council of Ministers in Helsinki, three challenges were placed in front of Romania: children, corruption and the civil service.
The first challenge was tackled powerfully by successive governments, presidents and prime ministers.
The result now is that Romania offers a model that has been widely acclaimed and applauded as providing, in some ways, even better services and better protection for her six-and-a-half million children than some EU Member States, and certainly other countries in the wider neighbourhood.
I believe we shall learn more about that model as it becomes replicated elsewhere in the coming months and years.
Overall, Romania has undergone a complete transformation from a country in 1990 that was dark, slow, tired, exhausted, with almost no life, no light, no fun, no laughter and little trade. Today it has been transformed into a nation that is once more alive and vibrant.
Now we have to look at measures that will assist the public, particularly as regards public health â which is at a very low ebb, livelihoods and poverty reduction.
Entering the European Union is indeed the long-term answer to achieving a rapid rise in levels of prosperity.
However, there remains one Achillesâ heel clearly identified in the Commissionâs report today: corruption.
Corruption is enemy number one of the people; it is enemy number one when you seek to reduce poverty; enemy number one when you are trying to improve health, livelihoods and futures of a population.
Much must be done to fight this enemy, but I believe and know that it can be tackled and that in Romania it can be conquered. This has already happened in some sectors.
Now the same effort and energy must continue in the other sectors, particularly in justice, which is so critical for the Romanian people.
I seek no time delay.
I hope and believe that at some time in 2007 we will be able to say: welcome, Romania, you are now one of us.
Â Â  â Madam President, on a point of order, I apologise for disturbing the natural process of this debate, but many of us here present â colleagues, press and public â will have spotted that the UK Presidency is, unavoidably, not able to take its seat in the Chamber because, obviously, there are many other pressing matters.
However, would you undertake, on behalf of the President of Parliament, to convey the message coming loud and clear from this debate that 1Â January 2007 is not negotiable?
Â Â  Mr Beazley, that was not a point of order.
Nevertheless, I will pass on the message to the President of Parliament and he can tell the UK Presidency that we always appreciate its presence in the Chamber.
Â Â  â Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, absent Presidency, it was only to be expected that the progress report put before us today would confirm that Bulgaria and Romania do not yet meet the Copenhagen criteria.
The criticism of them is justified.
My own experience of the problems that the Visegrad states have with accession to the EU and my own knowledge of the Romanian and Bulgarian accession agenda lead me to be very sceptical about 1 January 2007 as a deadline.
You may well ask why this is so.
I was recently one of a delegation from the Human Rights Sub-Committee that went to Bucharest, and I regret to have to say that the talks we had there confirmed me in my views.
We had the opportunity for discussions with representatives of the institutions of state, and also with various NGOs.
These encounters reminded me of my experiences with regimes in the aftermath of totalitarianism.
The government representatives were highly self-critical, but, in the final analysis, said little of any substance.
It was in meetings with NGOs, particularly in private conversations, that the state of play in the various areas under negotiation was described much more clearly, and in terms at once more sober and more dramatic.
The same was true, in varying degrees, of our conversations with these representativesâ Bulgarian counterparts.
We are dealing here with a reality that is not entirely what it seems to be.
There is little point in signing documents if they are not implemented.
There is no evading the conclusions with which these problems present us: the legal system is lacking in transparency, there is organised crime, problems with minorities and the Roma, corruption, and problems with agriculture and the environment.
Even taking into account the natural disasters with which both countries have been afflicted, it is, regrettably, to be expected that they will find it difficult to make the grade in the short time available; they will have to make a very considerable effort to make it even by 2008.
Â Â  Â âÂ Â I find it hard to know whether MrÂ HorÃ¡Äek was talking about the situation in the old EU Member States, or that in Romania and Bulgaria.
The European Union is supposedly founded upon certain basic principles.
These include the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital, and, perhaps even more importantly, the European social model, non-interference in the domestic affairs of Member States and solidarity.
Last but not least, they also include the environment as a priority issue.
The basic question that needs to be asked about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is whether we really want to accept these countries into an EU of 27 as equals.
Quite apart from whether the citizens of these new Member States will enjoy genuinely equal treatment â and it emerges from the reports that have been tabled that this is a far-off prospect, rather than a given from the date of accession to the European Union â one of the EUâs most important values, albeit one that is now frequently called into question, is the European social model.
In my opinion, any attempts to liberalise social values along the lines of the Bolkestein directive on services are entirely inappropriate.
I am not alone in this view, as proven by todayâs reactions to CommissionerÂ McCreevyâs speech in Sweden.
We must not allow the low social standards in some of the new Member States to be used as a battering ram to reverse the social achievements of more advanced Member States.
We should be aware that the welfare state and respect for environmental standards are among the most important of the European Unionâs values.
These values, and the resulting strength of the Communityâs social foundations, ensure its superiority over models in which such values are not recognised, and which allow unrestrained liberalism to prevail over social cohesion.
It is our duty to help the new Member States to achieve the best possible conditions and to negotiate appropriate transitional periods when Romania and Bulgaria join the Community, instead of harping on about problems in these new Member States that we ourselves face in our own countries.
The Czech people enjoy particularly close and friendly relations with Romania and Bulgaria, and these relations date back many years.
We are in favour of the two countries joining us on 1Â January 2007, and we would like to congratulate them on moving another step closer to the European Union.
Â Â  â Mr President, the choices facing Romania and Bulgaria are quite simple: will they compete with the economies of Western Europe on the basis of skills, or with Turkey on price?
A practical example would be the steel industry.
In Ireland, the state-owned Irish Steel was sold to Europeâs favourite steel producer Mr Mittal for one pound.
Five years later, just weeks after he collapsed Irish Steel with debts of GBPÂ 50Â million and no word of complaint from the then Irish Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy, we had Mr Blair writing to the Romanian Prime Minister recommending Mittal as a suitable custodian of Romaniaâs steel industry.
No doubt Mr Mittalâs donation to Mr Blair of GBPÂ 125Â 000 was coincidental.
The donations to Labour have continued, and again, coincidentally under the British Presidency, anti-dumping tariffs on steel produced by Mittal outside the EU have continued to be reduced by Commissioner Mandelson.
But what will happen once Romania and Bulgaria are on the inside?
They hope, of course, for an increase in their standard of living, but with that comes an increase in the costs of production.
Just as Mittal moved production from Ireland to Romania, where will Romaniaâs production go in due course?
Would it be Kazakhstan or Algeria, Serbia, Bosnia?
All of these countriesâ steel industries have been bought with aid from loans from the EBRD and the World Bank
In other words, European taxpayers are subsidising the export of their own heavy industries.
The sale of Sidex was seen to have helped Romaniaâs bid for EU membership.
What will be the price for the next wave of candidate countries?
Are the Romanian and Bulgarian governments happy to pay for EU membership with the jobs of their steel industries?
What other industries have similar deals hidden away?
If Mr Mittal is successful in his rumoured takeover of Corus/British Steel, no doubt they will follow MG Rover into Blair-sponsored oblivion.
Â Â  â Mr President, I, too, am glad to be able to welcome observers from Romania and Bulgaria to this House today.
They, as representatives of their peoples, need to know that the Romanian and Bulgarian people must, of course, after 50Â years of Communist tyranny and servitude, have the prospect of membership of the European Union, and that it is self-evident that they are part of Europe â in utter contrast to Turkey, in my opinion.
Neither Romania and Bulgaria, though, nor indeed the European Union, will be able to cope with an over-hasty enlargement.
If we bear in mind that last yearâs eastward enlargement, involving the accession of 10Â states, stretched the European Unionâs financial viability to the very limit, and that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania can be expected to entail costs amounting to some EURÂ 44 billion, then we will know just how knotty this problem is.
It is because of financial problems such as these and, above all, the ongoing predominance of the as yet incompletely resolved problems that both these countries have with such things as burgeoning corruption, organised crime, unemployment and poverty, but particularly the outstanding deficiencies in the monitoring and control of their borders that this project of continued enlargement really does need thorough preparation.
What the European public expect of the applicants for accession is demonstrable progress in fighting crime, in making themselves better locations for economic activity and in creating jobs.
Quite apart from that, the people in Romania and Bulgaria, too, have a right to see those problems resolved before any enlargement, particularly if it is to be a precipitate one.
Â Â  â Mr President, I am grateful for the information Commissioner Rehn has given us on the progress towards accession by Rumania and Bulgaria; an historic process for these two countries, completing the fifth enlargement, which is supported by this Parliament and also by the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.
I shall focus on Rumania.
We all know that the work done by this country to fulfil the commitments it has made and to be ready to join the European Union on the scheduled date did not end on the day the Treaty was signed, but that the Rumanian authorities had to continue to make great efforts.
