Or on the other hand, is it not the price we paid, the price of commitment to European values and a community of destiny?
But we place a higher value on Europe.
Let us not put it at risk.
The price we paid for it is not convertible into euro.
One year after joining the EU, how do we explain to our citizens the gap between promise and performance?
How do we put more soul into the European project?
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome your passion for the debate, Prime Minister.
But we are not beginning the debate today; we are â to put it in sporting terms â at half-time, and we must win the second half.
With regard to the Constitution, I must point out that more than half of the European citizens and 60% of the euro zone have approved it and I cannot understand why the positive vote by 75% of Spanish citizens is worth less than the negative vote by 66% of the Dutch.
That makes no sense mathematically.
You are a man of principles: you have approved a Bill of Rights in Great Britain and you have lifted the veto on the Social Charter.
What are you going to do about the Constitution?
Are you going to act or are you going to wait-and-see?
This is a question I would like you to answer.
With regard to the euro, you have had the grace not to speak about it.
You will agree with me that, when we talk about the social model, we must also talk about the economic model.
What are you going to do with regard to the euro?
With regard to the financial perspectives, and since we are in a Parliament, I would like to inform you that the Constitution grants this Parliament the power of codecision over agricultural spending, a power that we do not have at the moment.
Furthermore, if this is a Parliament that is to be respected, we must apply the âno taxation without representationâ principle and we must not go even further than Soviet planning; to produce financial perspectives for a period of seven years would go further than the Gosplan, and that is unsustainable.
The President of the Commission is right when he says that we must opt for a transitional solution until 2009.
Furthermore, we must stand for elections on the basis of a defence of our options.
That is the way to act democratically and I hope that you will help us actively to consolidate a more democratic and transparent Europe.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, regrettably it becomes clearer day by day that the present Constitutional Treaty will not be brought into force.
The current text must be seen as a good first draft and the famous period of reflection should be exploited to prepare for a renegotiation through a fresh convention with a new mandate.
The renegotiation should focus on Part III and should carry through the modernisation and reform of the EUâs common economic and social policies of which you so properly speak.
Â Â  MrÂ President, PrimeÂ Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the French and the Dutch did not say ânoâ to the Constitution, they did not give the thumbs down to the values of Europe, but they did, however, pass a negative judgment on todayâs Europe, which is too far removed from the people and often a prisoner to a style of bureaucracy that is deaf to the voice of the citizens.
That is the reason why the Europe of politics and values that you mentioned cannot put a stop to its progress, and cannot give up on developing its role as a major international player and as the representative of peace in the face of a number of setbacks.
In order to achieve the objectives that we are working towards, a number of important changes are required, significant reforms designed to provide tangible answers to the people of Europe; in short, a Union is required that does not meddle with absolutely everything, issuing scores and scores of incomprehensible directives.
On the contrary, what is needed is a Union that addresses the issues that, in the era of globalisation, cannot be resolved by nation states: from foreign policy to defence policy, from immigration crises to the fight against terrorism, to the trade challenges with China.
Progress must also be made in the economic sector by means of the reforms leading on from the Lisbon process: the aim is to drastically reduce unemployment by means of support given to SMEs.
We agree with your analysis, we welcomed your intervention in support of Europe as a major player, able to keep abreast of the times and upholding the commitments it has made.
We have one year in which to approve the budget; we can achieve the objective that we failed to meet last week and, at the same time, we must not abandon the commitments that we have made with the countries that are keeping a close eye on the Union.
Bulgaria and Romania can enter our shared home in 2007 and negotiations can be started up with Turkey, in order to have a Union that looks to the East, but also to the South, to the South also in terms of Africa, a continent that harbours great hopes of receiving important answers from Europe: we cannot turn back.
PrimeÂ Minister, we agree with the approach of your Presidency, and with this in mind you can depend on the cooperation of the Italian delegation of the party, on active cooperation in forthcoming months, with the certainty that the British Presidency will ensure progress is achieved by the Europe of the citizens.
Â Â  Prime Minister, above all, I would like to express the determined support of our group for the action plan against human trafficking.
MrÂ Juncker reminded us yesterday that we were able to eradicate slavery and that we should be able to eradicate poverty.
We also emphasise that the elimination of sexual exploitation and violence against women should also be a top priority for the European Union.
We absolutely must eradicate this scourge that is unworthy of our society, and this aspect must form an integral part of the fight against illegal immigration.
The fight against organised crime and terrorism is also a priority.
We therefore support as rapid an implementation as possible of the European evidence warrant and of joint investigation teams, but we are still cautious with regard to the exchange of sensitive data, including biometric data.
The fragile balance between security and freedom must be maintained.
Our fellow citizens want a protective, generous Europe that shows solidarity.
If we keep this in mind at all times, we will be able to meet their expectations.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, the United Kingdomâs control order regime brought into force by the forthcoming presidency, flouts the presumption of innocence and cannot reasonably be described as sitting squarely with any accepted European notions of fairness and basic human dignity.
These draconian measures leave EU citizens who have never been charged with a recognisable offence, confused and disenfranchised with no knowledge of why they are under suspicion, leaving the individual under a constant fear of imprisonment for breaches of the broadest and vaguest of laws; all decided by a politician, flying in the face of the separation of powers and the rule of law.
The holders of the presidency should be setting the human rights standard for the world, yet only this month the Council of Europeâs own Commissioner for Human Rights confirmed that here we have a government which is prepared to suspend the human rights of its own citizens under Article 5 of the European Charter.
The international community is facing a defining moment in its response to terrorism and we, as Europeans, will ultimately be judged by the way we treat our citizens.
Will this presidency not recognise that its actions have led to victimisation and effective isolation of a large section of its own population?
Â Â  MrÂ President, Prime Minister Blair, Europe today is better than ever.
I say that because a large proportion of the current debates concern the view of enlargement.
I am among those who believe that enlargement to include the 10 new Member States has made Europe safer and more stable and has created better preconditions for peace and prosperity than ever before.
For me, this is an argument for positively accepting continued enlargement and not an argument for trying now to close Europeâs borders.
One of the most important tasks for the new leadership in Europe will be that of firmly establishing and developing the view of how Europe can bring about increased security and greater prosperity by embracing those countries for which enlargement is now in the offing.
Prime Minister Blair, I believe that the problems we now face in the EU have to do with the fact that Europe is better than ever.
That also means that the European Union is a greater challenge than ever.
It is not a question, as is sometimes said, of a conflict between the old and the new Europe or between a free-trade Europe and political union.
The European Union is a political union and must fulfil its task on that basis.
It is a question, instead, of moving on from the old European Union of 6, 9, 12 or 15 Members to todayâs EU of 25 Member States.
This requires respect for variation and diversity and also an ability to take advantage of the dynamism that exists throughout Europe.
It requires openness towards the new Member States.
It requires an ability to find the common denominators, to pin our hopes on the knowledge-based, instead of subsidy-based, society and to put our faith in the new enterprises instead of making agricultural aid an obstacle to the research and development we need.
I hope, on behalf of the Swedish Moderates, that you will lay the basis for the new leadership needed by the new Europe and the new European Union.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I wish to thank Prime Minister Blair for an inspiring speech.
I share his view that the EU needs to be changed.
I share his view that the EU needs to become more active in the world. I share his view that the EU is not only a free trade area but also a political union.
I also share his views on the Budget.
The British rebate is out of date, but so too is agricultural policy and those aspects of agricultural policy in which we currently put our faith.
That too needs to be changed.
We need to invest, for example, in research and development and in developing peopleâs skills.
What we talk about during and after important meetings must be put into practice.
I also share Prime Minister Blairâs view of the social Europe.
It is true that he was involved in introducing the Social Chapter, as well as the employment strategy and the active labour market policy in EU cooperation.
All that was good, but we must go further and find a balance.
That is why we must obtain a draft Services Directive that balances the trade in services, for that is something we need.
At the same time, we need sound conditions in the labour market, consumer rights and high environmental standards.
We also need a working time directive that takes account of precisely what you just said about being able to combine family life and working life so that the one party does not work him- or herself to death and so that we do not compete on the basis of long working hours.
We need a recruitment directive, not in order to pull the rug out from under the recruitment companies but in order to create a framework.
If you succeed in opening the door to trade and in opening up the borders and, at the same time, in developing the social Europe, we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament shall support you.
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome the Prime Ministerâs historic speech.
It bodes well for a highly successful UK presidency.
During his time in office, will he build on the already agreed enlargement programme?
Will he give special emphasis to ensuring a timely entry into negotiations for Turkey, since so much hangs in the balance in early October on reforms in Turkey?
Will he support Romania in the final stretch of what has been a major endurance test, leading to early entry in January 2007, and for Bulgaria too?
Will he build on the success of yesterdayâs unique conference on Iraq, which demonstrated the profound endurance of British policies?
Will he build on that success with the elected Iraqi Government and parliamentary assembly to continue to foster the growth of democracy in the Arabian Peninsula, the Persian Gulf and the Euro-Mediterranean region?
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Blair, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the same House that, yesterday, gave the outgoing President-in-Office of the Council, Jean-Claude Juncker, a standing ovation, today gave you, MrÂ Blair, a convincing round of applause to welcome you into office.
That amounts to a huge pledge of confidence in you on the part of this House, whose Members are the representatives of the citizens of this European Union â the true representatives, because they are the only ones to be directly elected.
At a time when this European Union is going through an identity crisis â and you yourself, Mr Blair, spoke of a crisis of leadership â it is vital that we remember that this Europe of ours, having been in existence for 50 successful years, needs a âbottom-upâ rather than âtop-downâ approach.
What that means is that we have to carry the public with us rather than alienate them, and whose vocation is it to do that if not their directly elected representatives?
This is not just about Europeâs need for better regulations; most of all, it needs fewer of them, and that I say not only to the Commission, but also to the Members on the left of the political spectrum here in this House.
In many respects, Mr Blair, your speech was persuasive; you were particularly convincing when you spoke of the principle that some changes are necessary if what is good is to be retained.
That principle is one that your future successor as President-in-Office of the Council, Austriaâs Federal Chancellor Wolfgang SchÃŒssel, has chosen as his watchword.
I also welcome your desire to resolve the dispute about the European Unionâs objectives that has ensued from the constitutional crisis.
I have to say, though, that your presidency will be judged not only by what it intends to do but also, and especially, by what it actually does.
I therefore hope that you will not mind if I ask what practical steps you intend to take in order to get the Financial Perspective completed under your presidency; secondly, what you propose to do to keep the constitutional process alive; and, thirdly, what answers you would give to those members of the public who fear that the European Union is over-extending itself.
Do you not think there is something paradoxical about mentioning Turkey and Croatia in the same breath?
Many members of the public have misgivings about a large country like Turkey, but not about a small one like Croatia.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister Blair's presentation has been more a series of interesting reflections than of precise commitments for his six-month Presidency.
In terms of assessing his intentions in the field that concerns me as the Socialist Groupâs spokesman for development and humanitarian action, I must comment on the approach announced by his government in this area.
I will express my satisfaction at the fact that the British Presidencyâs main priorities include increasing the European Union's action and resources in the field of solidarity with the developing world: achieving the Millennium Objectives â they will be classified as a priority goal â with eradicating poverty as the main concern and Africa as the main focus, because Africa is one of the main elements of the problem.
I would like to make two further comments.
Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that the Luxembourg Presidency set very high standards with the decisions of the Development Council in May; let us hope that the British Presidency understands that these decisions provide a good launching pad for promoting its action over these six months.
I would like secondly to highlight and welcome the fact that the British Presidencyâs priorities in the field that I have been referring to coincide with those of the Socialist Group.
This is natural, not just because our values coincide, but because for months we have been cooperating intensely with our colleagues in the British Cabinet, Hillary Ben and Garret Thomas.
Let us hope that the British Presidency intends to maintain a close relationship with this Parliament over these six months in this field; I am sure that, in that way, we will make more and better progress.
Â Â  Mr President, Prime Minister, excellent goals, very good speech, you have my support.
I have got one minute so I want to make one point.
In the French referendum President Chirac got 45.3 per cent of votes in favour.
In the UK General Election last month, you got 35.3 per cent, which is 10 per cent less than Jacques Chirac got.
You are only there because of a distortion in the UK electoral system; you had a manifesto commitment in 1997, but it seems to have been forgotten.
The point is that neither of you have majority support in your own countries.
After eight years of leadership of my country, the hostility and ignorance about Europe in the UK is shocking and terrible and needs to be corrected.
Please will you start to make positive speeches and explain âŠ I am sorry to see you are not even listening!
Will you start to make speeches explaining the European Union in the country you and I know best?
Â Â  Mr President, I welcome Mr Blair and thank him for staying for the entire debate here this morning.
Last weekendâs political sparring and lack of conclusion to the summit was not worthy either of you, Mr Blair, nor of Mr Chirac.
Where was the Tony Blair of the Good Friday Agreement, a man of understanding and goodwill, who could bring both sides of an intractable conflict to the table; a man who showed singular courage on the Iraq question, regardless of our views of the right or wrong.
It may well be good for you and for your image at home, Mr Blair, to stand up to the French and to play to the residual, historic emotion that finds resonance in British chemistry.
But remember the 100 Years War in the Middle Ages: the British came out of it with much less than they went in.
Fontainebleau was Margaret Thatcherâs Agincourt, when she walked away with the British rebate, and now, 20 years on, that rebate is worth a farthing in the pound of British GDP.
Yet, MrÂ Blair, you are prepared to sacrifice Europeâs budget agreement and the European project to continue being the populist servant of Mr Murdoch and his newspapers.
If Kohl or Mitterrand had been at the table last weekend, we would have had a conclusion.
We are politically rudderless in Europe and the real crisis in Europe is the lack of political leadership.
Mr Blair, you were right to say that we must modernise Europeâs social model on the basis of a strong economy and not at the expense of it.
It is true that we urgently need to peel back regulation and that China is investing threefold in research and innovation.
However, splitting hairs over decimal points on the budget last weekend has put Europeâs ambitious Seventh Framework Programme for doubling funding on research on ice.
So much for the Lisbon mission.
What about the common agricultural policy, Mr Blair?
What exactly is your intention in relation to that?
Do you understand the income crisis that exists among the vast majority of our farmers across the Europe of 25?
Have you forgotten the unanimous agreement on radical reform of the CAP that you personally endorsed and your government signed up to only 18 months ago?
Â Â  Mr President, the EU is in crisis in terms of direction and legitimacy, and Mr Blair is now under challenge to fill the leadership vacuum, with Mr Chirac and Mr SchrÃ¶der weakened domestically and probably on their way out.
The UK is right to question the entire EU budget architecture based on a distorted, wasteful common agricultural policy, which harms developing world farmers.
Our rebate will never be given up until the CAP is radically reformed, with the funds freed up, used to address modern priorities like research and development, combating climate change and external action funding to stabilise the Western Balkans, help Eastern European countries like Ukraine and fledgling democracies in the Middle East such as Iraq.
This is happening at a time when the US is anxious to mend fences with the EU and needs our help.
As a priority, I hope that Britain will put the roadmap for Arab-Israeli peace back on the agenda and combat nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea.
I support EU enlargement with a wider, looser flexible Europe.
I welcome the proverbial Polish plumber and recognise that the new countries are driving the economic reformist agenda.
We are now committed to Romania and Bulgaria.
As much as I support Ukraineâs EU aspirations, we have not carried Europeâs public with us on enlargement.
I hope the UK will emphasise human rights violations in brutal regimes such as Burma and Zimbabwe.
As a Commonwealth country, we have a very special influence on these countries in Africa.
At the summit meeting with Russia, it will need reminding of its obligations in Chechnya and must be made to understand that it must respect the sovereignty of its former satellites such as Ukraine.
In the case of Moldova and Georgia, it should be encouraged to withdraw its troops.
Mr Blair, you might also might want to use some of your goodwill with Turkey to resolve the Armenia embargo and border issue.
Lastly, we must maintain the arms embargo on China, with its lamentable human rights record and threats to Taiwan.
Certainly, building a multi-polar world with China and the EU as a counterweight to the US should play no part in this issue.
Â Â  Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr Blair, the European Unionâs Heads of State or Government have prescribed a period of reflection, and you are participating in it by deferring the United Kingdomâs referendum.
It is because I know from my own experience that the enlargement issue played a particular part in the debate around the referenda in France and the Netherlands that I believe that the present period of reflection must include consideration of it.
What we have here is a new situation.
After adopting the Treaty of Nice, we discovered that it would not function adequately if we had 25 or 28 Member States, and so we summoned a convention and compiled a draft Constitution, which you, Mr Blair, support.
We know too, though, that there is no very great likelihood of this draft Constitution seeing the light of day in its present form.
That is what makes this situation new.
There is also a fourth criterion for accession, one that is of very considerable significance, and it is the one adopted in Copenhagen, which states that consideration must also be given to the Unionâs own capacity to cope with further accessions.
In the absence not only of a constitution but also of any financial settlement, we have to ask ourselves the very serious question as to whether it really is well-advised to start accession negotiations with Turkey on 4 October.
We have to ask ourselves â that is, the European Union itself â whether we really are in a fit state to handle another enlargement.
Along with many of my friends, I take the view that this question has to be answered, and firmly, in the negative.
Â Â  â Prime Minister, your speech was inspired and I trust that your European actions will be equally inspired.
However, I must point out that the Union has entered a period of crisis, a credibility crisis, and I shall explain why:
- In March 2000, the European Council agreed on the Lisbon Strategy.
During the review last March, it was decided to give greater emphasis to research and innovation.
- In Brussels in October 2002, the European Council agreed on the 2007-2013 financing framework for agriculture.
- In Athens in April 2003, all the Heads of State agreed to and endorsed enlargement.
That brings us to today.
The Lisbon Strategy: the Council proposal for financing the strategy cancels it in practical terms.
Agriculture: Prime Minister, you yourself have questioned the compromise on agriculture.
Enlargement: you have welcomed the 10 new Member States, but with less money.
By contrast, the European Parliament, in adopting the BÃ¶ge report, has shown that it is consistent in what it professes.
Prime Minister, I share your views about the need for reforms which will make us more competitive on the international stage, but we need to combine the validity of this position with respect for what has been agreed.
I ask you:
- Firstly, taking account of the fact that the compromise on agricultural spending was achieved after reciprocal and painful concessions, taking account of the fact that the basic principle of international law is the ' principle and, finally, taking account of the fact that a new compromise will be impossible to achieve today with 25 Member States and the current institutional framework, do you consider it advisable that we exhaust this issue?
- Secondly, with what budget do you intend ...
Â Â  Mr President, I was very interested in the reference made by the Prime Minister in his speech this morning to the Europe of values.
And, as well as this legitimate vision, there is another complementary vision of Europe (I would be grateful if Mr Blair could put on his headphones), there is another legitimate Europe which is complementary to the former, which is the Europe of the tangible, the Europe of hard cash, and the Europe of the net contribution and the net beneficiary, and the Europe of the British rebate.
I am pleased that you believe that we in Europe no longer see ourselves simply as consumers in a big market, but as citizens of the Union.
There is a qualitative social leap from the notion of a consumer to that of a citizen and from the notion of a common market to that of a project of political union.
It is clear that leadership is needed in order to propel the project in the right direction, in order to bring Europe closer to the citizens, in order to recover the path of sustainable growth and job creation and in order to give Europe a role on the international stage in accordance with its economic, commercial, financial and industrial weight.
Europe, Prime Minister, is not the problem, it is the solution.
And we need more Europe rather than less Europe.
And the important thing is to move on from words to actions.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is important to move on from words to actions and leave behind purely rhetorical statements, because you have signed a document reducing the European Unionâs ambitions and budgetary resources.
Or do you believe, Mr President-in-Office, that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of doubling funds for Africa if we have less resources?
Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the priority of introducing the necessary economic reforms if we have less resources?
Do you believe that we are going to be able to deal with the challenges facing the European Union with less resources?
Mr President, I wish the British Presidency the best of luck in its task of bringing together wills and creating consensus so that the European Union can move forward, but it will only be able to do so on the basis of two perspectives or two premises: firstly, by providing the money required to realise our ideals; and secondly, Mr President, by everybody seeking advantage on the basis of a common advantage.
Â Â  Do not lose heart, Prime Minister, I am the last, though I hope I will not be the least.
Following a Luxembourg Presidency led with honour by MrÂ Juncker, you are taking on the Presidency at a very delicate moment for Europe.
At a time when the draft European Constitution, based on a careful rebalancing between politics and economics, appears to be stillborn, I hope, despite everything, that we will not bury its content too hastily.
The financing of the EU cannot be decided by a confrontation.
Enlargement must be financed fairly and reasonably.
Is it fair for the United Kingdom to be the only one of the 15 to have reduced its net financial contribution following enlargement, thus excusing itself from all efforts to reunify Europe?
You have declared that the British rebate is not non-negotiable, and we take note of that.
Do not forget, though, that the CAP has already been reformed three times.
You will allow me to express my surprise at the UKâs reaction with regard to European farmers.
The United Kingdom is well placed to know the extent to which European solidarity expressed itself during the two major health crises that we underwent with BSE and foot-and-mouth disease, and to evaluate the costs borne by the European Union to deal with those two disasters.
The future of Europe depends on our ability to guarantee to 450Â million Europeans that they will all be able to feed themselves at a reasonable price and completely safely.
We will not forget that you have declared that you do not want to reduce the EU to a huge, dehumanised market.
Your predecessor stated that he wanted an integrated, political Europe of solidarity.
May the UK Presidency share the same vision of our common future.
Â Â  Listen, I am not going to give Prime Minister Blair the floor until you sit down and be quiet.
The complete lack of respect you have shown to your fellow Members who were speaking before ...
Mr Martin Schulz, I am perfectly aware who is changing the order.
I would ask you all to sit down and be quiet.
We are not going to continue the sitting until you sit down and be quiet.
And if you do not do so, I am going to call on the ushers to ask you to leave the Chamber.
Would the honourable Members who are in that aisle please sit down?
Please be kind enough to listen to what the Presidency says and not to disturb the sitting any further?
I would ask you to hurry up.
Alright.
Are you ready to listen to Mr Blair?
Then be quiet please.
Â Â  . Mr President, I thank you for that excellent discipline you have imposed.
It would be interesting to see how you would get on in the British House of Commons at Question Time!
I thank everyone who has contributed to this debate.
One thing, for sure, is that I have not been short of advice, for which I thank you.
As you may know, some of our colleagues in the gallery today are from Kuwait, and have just passed a law, as was indicated earlier, giving women the vote for the first time.
They are an excellent example of how progress and change can happen.
It is good to see you here, Sir.
In addition, many speakers have asked me to try to achieve a consensus across Europe.
It must be said, given the broad range of views, that is going to be quite some challenge.
Perhaps the most interesting suggestion was that we made Welsh one of the official languages of the European Union.
It could indeed be the way to achieve a consensus, but we shall see.
One thing is certain: our debate today has provoked enormous interest not just here in this Parliament but also outside.
I will try to respond to some of the specific comments made by the leaders and then make a short summary.
In respect of President Barroso, I thank him very much for his kind words.
I agree with the agenda he has set out.
There is much in common we can work on.
The only point I would make on the review clause in respect of the next financial perspective is that it has to be very clear, it must not be ambiguous.
Let us work on that together.
In respect of Mr Poettering, I thank him for his kind sentiments and we will do our very best to reach agreement on some of the difficult issues, in particular the financial perspective.
He reminded me of John Majorâs negotiations in 1992, so I was rather grateful for Mr Schulz reminding us that we defeated both him in the 1997 election and three subsequent leaders, but that is perhaps a point to make in a different forum.
On the Constitution, I had not appreciated that you said this yourself, Mr President, but if you said, as was reported in the course of the debate, that it was not the text but the context, then I entirely agree with that.
There will be a time when we have to return to the discussion of sensible rules to govern our working as a European Union of 25 â and even larger numbers in the future â rather than 15.
The truth is that we need a new framework of rules for Europe and, therefore, the impulse that gave rise to the Constitution was entirely correct.
It is, however, necessary to get the political direction firm in order to get the Constitution supported in the way that it should be.
Mr Watson challenged me over Council transparency and, certainly in relation to legislating, there is a strong case for that.
Let us consider that under our presidency.
It is good to see Mr Cohn-Bendit after all these years.
A long time ago I used to listen to your speeches, and now you listen to mine.
Only history will tell whether this is progress or not!
I apologise for not spending more of my speech on the issues of the environment and climate change.
I hope that at the G8 summit we will have at least a chance for these issues to dominate the discussion.
They will be a major aspect of our European Union presidency.
In respect of what Mr Mote said about the rebate, I repeat that we must look at all of this in the round.
These issues all need to be resolved together.
All I would point out is that without the rebate we would have been contributing about 15 times as much as other similar sized countries over the past 10 years, and even with it, we are contributing more.
Without it in existence at all, over the next financial perspective we would be the largest net contributor.
I understand your concerns and I repeat that Britain will pay its fair share of enlargement.
We support enlargement and will contribute towards it.
However, the issue has to be resolved in a way that is satisfactory for everybody and in the context, particularly, of the point about the review that we discussed earlier.
I apologise for not dealing with every single individual point.
In some contributions there has been a sense that this is just a dispute between leaders based on personality or disagreements between countries.
I want to make it clear that, in general terms, I think I have shown over the past eight years that I have always tried to reach consensus at a European level and it is important that we do so.
Obviously I have not reached consensus on that statement!
The difficulty we have at the moment which I just want to describe to you is: why is it that I feel so passionately about the reform agenda?
It is because of a sense of urgency.
We do not quite realise in Europe the competitive economic challenge we face today.
It is serious and it is urgent!
It is strange how things happen but just now everybody has mentioned China, India, etc. in their speeches. Now, however, people understand the seriousness of this situation.
It is not simply China and India: take countries like Vietnam or Thailand today.
The changes they are making in their economies are amazing and dramatic.
The trouble is that in todayâs world you have to adapt constantly to that process of change. My worry is that if we do not, two things will happen.
First, the very social model and the idea of social solidarity that we, and I, believe in is put at risk. Second, if we cannot handle the challenge of change and if we are unable to adapt to do so, then as a result support comes about for the policies that Mr Farage outlined for the UK Independence Party.
I have to tell him that I completely disagree with those policies.
I do not want Britain to be in the position of leading a charge against the European Union.
That is not my determination at all.
The difference between you and me is very simple: you see the problems of the European Union as an opportunity to wreck the European Union, I see them as the necessity for reinvigorating the European Union.
There is a big difference between the two.
I am well aware, as I have said in my own Parliament and country, this debate for change and reform cannot be led in any other way than from a pro-European perspective.
That is something I understand.
It is not enough for each person to simply claim Europe for themselves and to say that if you challenge what I am saying, it means somehow you are against Europe.
The question, as was rightly put by several speakers in the debate, is not whether Europe should change or whether we believe in Europe, but how Europe should change and what type of Europe we believe in today.
That is the issue for us and it is the issue we have to address with a genuine seriousness of purpose.
I want to make one other final point.
I have said why I support the Constitution.
But I will be frank with you.
The one thing that worried me during the course of all the debates about the Constitution was this: there is a tendency that I have noticed over my eight years as Prime Minister for Europe sometimes to go back over institutional questions when the questions are really about policy direction.
We can debate some of these institutional questions for a very long time.
Sometimes you also find it in leaders â and I do not absolve myself of responsibility on this â who, when there is a problem, want to blame a European institution rather than refashion a European policy.
It is true that we all have a tendency to do that.
My point is that when we decide the direction of Europe â and that is what the coming months have to be about; when we have the debate about how Europe copes with these great challenges, we should always keep our minds focused on the daily concerns of the people we represent.
You are the directly elected part of the European institutions.
You know how important it is when you go out into your communities to respond to what they talk about.
They talk about jobs, security, crime and immigration.
They worry about the change in their daily lives.
We must have the clear, tough, proper policies to deal with these challenges.
If we do, they will respond to us and tell us that they agree it is sensible to have a new European Constitution, because they will then understand the political context in which that constitutional debate is happening.
This is a big moment of decision.
In conclusion, I would only say that todayâs debate in the European Parliament has been excellent.
I am honoured to have sat through it, I know there have been many different views and some critical things have been said about me and my presidency.
That is part of a healthy democratic debate.
I would just suggest to you that if we could replicate this debate in our individual countries and go out and engage with our people and talk to them about what we believe in, why we think Europe is necessary for todayâs world, why we want to make the changes necessary to bring it into line with peopleâs priorities, then in the very act of debate we will help Europe; in the very reaching out to people we will show our relevance; in the very satisfaction of being in a position to answer their concerns, we will reinvigorate the European project.
I have found todayâs debate immensely impressive.
It has been a genuine privilege to sit through it, and I thank you for listening to me.
Â Â  . Mr President, Members of this House, Prime Minister Blair, I agree with you that it was a very interesting and useful debate.
We all understand that this situation is a very special one.
It should not be seen as business as usual.
I understand that there is a real appetite for a frank debate.
There were, of course, different views, but this debate has shown that there is a will for the search for consensus.
In that search for consensus, it is important to avoid simplifications: the idea to put those who are in favour of a free market against those who are for social commitment; the idea to put political integration against economic integration.
The truth is that we need economic integration and political integration.
We need a consensus, but not one that ignores the need for the hard choices that Europe must make.
There is now a risk in Europe: the risk of populism.
Sometimes populism on the left against globalisation and foreign competition; sometimes populism on the right, just against foreigners and against the very idea of Europe.
That is why it is important that all those who have some responsibility in Europe â be it at national or European level â fight that populism and show, collectively, their commitment to the values that make Europe a great project.
That is why it is important that responsible politicians fight that populism and do not resort to tabloid politics.
That is why it is important that we should not be blocked now by the institutional problems we have.
We must go ahead with our programme.
The European Union must avoid paralysis.
That is why it is very urgent to have a solution for the financial perspectives.
That is why we have to respond to the expectations, namely of the new Member States that are looking to us for solidarity.
That was their expectation and we should be committed to meeting their expectations.
That is why Europe needs ambition for reform and solidarity.
The way forward for Europe is not to avoid the very idea of solidarity.
Without solidarity and cohesion there is no such thing as a Union.
A Union requires the mechanisms of solidarity.
I am looking forward to working with you, Prime Minister Blair, in what I hope will be a successful presidency.
You can count on us.
We are going to our work every day.
We have been doing everything to avoid the idea that Europe is paralysed.
After that very difficult European Council, Prime Minister Juncker and I attended the successful summits in Canada and the United States.
Yesterday we had a very successful conference here on Iraq.
Yesterday the Commission took very important and courageous decisions: the Green Paper on energy efficiency; a new sugar market reform â which shows, by the way, that the common agricultural policy can also be reformed.
This evening I leave for Africa because, like you, I attach great importance to the African agenda and our solidarity with that continent.
I hope that I will also help your G8 presidency for the goals for Africa and our solidarity.
To conclude and to summarise, we have to reform and change.
However, when we speak about reform and change we are speaking about reforming our economy and making it more competitive.
We are not speaking about changing or reforming the old values of the European Union or of Europe, the values that were those of our founding fathers for a European Union that believes in solidarity with ambition for all our citizens.
Â Â  Thank you very much to all of you for participating in this important debate.
The debate is closed.
Â Â  The next item is voting time.
Â Â  MrÂ President, I just want to point out an error in the Swedish version.
What, in other language versions, is ArticleÂ 23.2 is ArticleÂ 12.7 in the Swedish version.
Â Â  Mr President, very briefly, it is clear from the voting list, but I have learnt from experience that it is very good to point it out at length.
This is not an amendment to amend the Statute but an amendment to the legislative resolution.
Irrespective of the rumours that have been going around the House, it refers to the expense regime that was agreed to in the Membersâ Statute, namely the travel expenses at real costs, not all the expenses.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, I should just like to say that this vote is the outcome of a long debate that took place in Parliament, and that you have the honour of having brought this itinerary to an end.
I therefore thank you on behalf of the whole of Parliament and I also thank the Commission and the Presidency-in-Office of the Council.
We did not reach agreement on one item alone, but I believe that an overall balance has been reached.
I also thank my colleagues in the committee and MrÂ Lehne in particular, who provided a tremendous contribution in terms of achieving this important outcome, which places Parliament â as we said this morning â at the centre of attention of a united Europe.
Â Â  Mr Gargani, thank you very much for your constructive words.
Thank you very much to everybody and in particular to the Luxembourg Presidency.
Â Â  Mr President, as we seem to be the only group to be holding fast to the compromise that we hammered out together, I have consulted at least some of the other groups and am now able to ask, on their behalf too, for the vote to be deferred in accordance with Rule 170 of our Rules of Procedure, irrespective of whether we will be voting at a later date.
Under Rule 170, therefore, I move that the vote be deferred.
Â Â  Mr President, I move that we should, if at all possible, vote on the individual amendments , but not, of course, on the final resolution.
Â Â  Mr President, whilst I can very well understand the general desire to get the vote over with, that cannot be done so quickly, as there are a whole range of different items to be voted on.
I have a procedural suggestion to make, that being that we vote on Amendments 1 to 21 in a single block, while we really do have to vote on the other items on a one-by-one basis.
Â Â  That concludes the vote.
Â Â  Mr President, I have voted against this Statute, and have done so for five reasons.
The first is that I think this is not the right time for it; while Europe as a whole is grappling with its future, we are concerning ourselves with the future of our financial arrangements.
The second is that I am opposed to tax privileges.
The third is that I see our having our pensions paid by the taxpayer as sending the wrong message.
The fourth is that I do not think we should be getting a percentage of what judges are paid; rather, things should be the other way around, with judges being paid a percentage of what the freely-elected representatives of a sovereign people earn.
After all, it would also sound much better if judges were to be paid 250% of an MEPâs salary.
Finally, all this involves us looking into the future; we are taking decisions on behalf of future Members, and I do not find that exactly proper either.
As I do not regard this as a particularly favourable result, I have voted ânoâ.
I am sure that many of my colleagues who have voted âyesâ today have done so not out of conviction, but in response to pressure from the media, and that, too, is a pity.
Â Â  Mr President, I, too, have voted against the Membersâ Statute, which I regard as sending the wrong message â that is what we are doing if we adopt it in such haste while the current European crisis is raging around us.
I also feel that it rather amounts to a load of eyewash, and to putting wine in old bottles, as I cannot see much of a difference in comparison to the draft with which the Rothley report presented us.
There has been a lot of talk in the past few days about the setting up of citizensâ forums to address the crisis situation in Europe.
Why are we not setting up citizensâ forums to discuss the Membersâ Statute?
Why is there no consultation on the Internet?
If we can have a pause for reflection during the process of ratifying the Constitution, why can we not have a pause for reflection on the Membersâ Statute?
I still do not think it right that it should be combined with travel expenses.
These things can be dealt with separately; for that we do not need this Membersâ Statute to be adopted so over-hastily and in such a headlong rush.
I would, though, ask for a vote to be corrected.
I am of course in favour of not reducing the retirement age.
That, too, is something there is no way we can get across to the public at a time of austerity measures and cutbacks in the social budget.
I think we have done Europe a disservice today, and I do not believe that we will, in so doing, be able to rid people of their suspicions of the European institutions and of their weariness with our politics.
Â Â  Mr President, I think that we sent an entirely wrong message today by voting on the Gargani report on the Membersâ Statute, not least because the impression is once again being created that this Houseâs real principal concern is with its Membersâ benefits.
Moreover, I think that what is described as the elimination of a number of abuses is a mere pretext, at best a palliative.
In reality, Members are being endowed with new privileges, which nothing and nobody can justify, the planned pension fund scheme being one example that springs to mind.
Another reason why this message is the wrong one is that nobody in the whole of Europe is waiting for a common statute for all MEPs except a few MEPs themselves.
We represent our peoples and our Member States here.
Why should we be so insistent on having a statute that is different from that of our counterparts in the national parliaments, unless, of course, Europe is to be thought of as a superstate, which is not what I want it to be?
If this report is a new stunt to bring even more people to resist what we are gradually referring to as the Eurocracy, then it has achieved its object.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the EU is mired in a profound crisis, when agreement on the European Constitution eludes us, when we are unable to decide on the EUâs future financial basis, at a time marked by great economic problems and high levels of unemployment in the EU, yet again, we in this House are focussing our attention on ourselves.
European politics could hardly appear more distant from the real world!
I voted against the Membersâ Statute on the ground that I am opposed to us MEPs enjoying tax privileges.
I want to be taxed in the same way as those who vote for me and my fellow German citizens, and, as a German MEP, I want to be paid in the same way as my counterparts in the German national parliament, the Bundestag.
Â Â  Mr President, having taken note of the result of negotiations between Parliament and the Council, we in the Austrian Peopleâs Party delegation voted to adopt this Membersâ Statute.
We find it regrettable that the Council should have dictated to Parliament conditions in respect of the Rothley report, one of which was that the cut in salary should be compensated for by the pension scheme being made non-contributory.
Every amendment that we have tabled here today would, from the Councilâs point of view, have caused the Membersâ Statute to fall.
It was high time, following 10 years of negotiations, that this House should endow itself with a Membersâ Statute, and for there to be equal pay for equal work.
To this compromise we have agreed, even though there is without doubt room for improvement in many areas.
Â Â  The June Movement is a strong opponent on principle of a common Membersâ Statute, which would turn Members of the European Parliament into the EUâs representatives in the Member States instead of Denmarkâs representatives in the EU.
The June Movementâs representative has proposed approximately 50 times that travel should be as per account rendered, and the present compromise now offers the chance to have this put into practice.
We in the June Movement are therefore voting in favour of this compromise, at the same time as holding to our opposition on principle to the Statute, which was unfortunately approved by the Treaty of Nice.
Â Â  . I am in favour of enacting a single statute for all Members of the European Parliament.
A functioning European Parliament depends to a large degree on a good uniform statute being in place.
Any such statute must, however, have at its heart modern, EU-wide rules on MEPsâ immunity from prosecution.
In Parliamentâs present motion for a resolution, the Member States are requested to revise the provisions laid down in a protocol in 1965.
No such rule is to be found in the draft Statute itself.
Regarding this as a fundamental defect, I have â as I did in December 2003 â voted against the draft Statute.
In the event of the Statute entering into force in 2009, I very much hope that this defect will have been, by that date, remedied by means of a rule on the immunity of MEPs that shall be binding, equal and uniform across the EU.
It was not only in this respect that Mr Rothleyâs original draft was markedly superior to the present text, for it embodied a parliamentary law that was, in a whole range of other areas, more modern and more comprehensible to the public than national rules, including those obtaining in Germany, not least in such matters as the requirement that Members make a contribution to their own pensions, for which no provision is made in the regulations of many national legislatures.
Â Â  Today, Parliament has voted on the long-debated Membersâ Statute.
There are some doubtful features, but it overwhelmingly constitutes an improvement on current rules applicable to, for example, travel expenses, taxes and pensions.
Actual travel costs will be reimbursed, rather than a standard payment being made.
The Statute also means that all MEPs will receive the same level of salary from 2009.
That is especially important if our fellow MEPs from the new Member States are to receive reasonable salaries and if the earnings gap is to be reduced between those who earn least and those who earn most.
Quite a few constructive amendments were tabled before the vote, demanding, for example, a common statute for MEPsâ assistants and the opportunity for those MEPs who wish to do so to receive back only their actual expenses from as early as 2007.
We have for a long time supported developments towards a statute for assistants and the reimbursement of actual expenses.
That is something we shall continue to do in the future too.
In order to ensure that the Statute arrived at by compromise with the Council goes through, we have, however, chosen to vote today against all the amendments tabled in plenary and have voted in favour of the committeeâs report.
Any change to the compromise would jeopardise the unity in the Council and, thus, the possibility of being able to agree at all on the Membersâ Statute.
Â Â  . Following the commitment made on 3Â June 2005 by representatives of the Member States and the Council regarding the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, plenary amended its decision of 4Â June 2003, and called for the creation of a monthly parliamentary salary, set at a flat rate for all Members regardless of the country they represent.
The salary will, in current terms, come to around EURÂ 7Â 000 per month, which is around twice the amount earned by members of the Portuguese Parliament.
This would widen the gap between the Members of the European Parliament and politicians in the Member States, when in fact their work and their day-to-day functions are similar, and this is something to which we are opposed.
This decision has undergone one or two amendments, which we welcome, not least the call for greater transparency in reimbursement of travel expenses, indicating that the payment will be based on actual expenses.
Members of the European Parliament are elected nationally and are â and must continue to be â accountable to their national electorates.
We are opposed to the federalist concept of the mandate of Members of Parliament, as it overlooks the differing social realities in EU Member States â in terms of workersâ salaries, for example â and consequently widens the gap between the politicians and the people that they represent.
Â Â  . We wish once again to indicate the position of principle we adopt on this issue.
We believe that Members of the European Parliament should receive their salaries from their respective national parliaments.
The principle of subsidiarity should serve as guidance.
It is up to each Member State to decide what salary is to be paid to its parliamentarians.
The national salaries paid to Members of the European Parliament are adjusted according to the actual situation regarding salaries and expenses that applies in each Member State.
MEPs should be remunerated by their own countries, where they should also pay tax.
It is important for Members of the European Parliament not to be regarded as a privileged elite by the voters in their own countries.
Instead, salaries should be more or less the same as those paid in those countries to people in corresponding positions.
The present system of travel expenses, which takes no account of actual costs and is based on standard payments, is, in our view, quite unfair.
MEPs should only be reimbursed for the actual costs that arise in connection with journeys made.
The travel expenses system can be reformed without a common Membersâ Statute being adopted.
We have voted against the proposal for a common Membersâ Statute.
Â Â  . This House has for many years been calling for a single Statute for its Members.
We have, on innumerable occasions, been critical of the extreme divergences in the remuneration of those who represent Europeâs people.
The process of making the EU more democratic must be of equal value to all its Member States.
Now, for the second time, the Council has presented us with a compromise proposal, which we, the elected Members of this House, are supposed to agree to.
It envisages basing MEPsâ income on a good third of the income of a European judge.
Absent from this proposal, in my view, is any clear statement about what value Europeans themselves attach to the financial independence of their MEPs, and these same MEPs are instead exposed to an unworthy media campaign.
At a time when all pro-European forces are concentrating on overcoming the problems involved in modernising the new, enlarged Europe, I do not intend expending any energy on âProject Statuteâ if it means that we are reproached for feathering our own nests.
I will be abstaining from the final vote.
Â Â  . In adopting a Statute for Members of the European Parliament, we are having the wrong debate at the wrong time.
At the present time, we are all well aware of the urgent need for the EU to discuss its fundamental objectives.
The popular votes in France and the Netherlands clearly indicated, among other things, the need for the EU to draw closer to its citizens in order to restore credibility to the European project, and, in view of that, I am not in favour of a debate on the Statute for MEPs being on the agenda.
To say the least, the time is not well chosen.
I welcome as an improvement the proposal that travel costs be reimbursed on the basis of the expenses actually incurred, and that the current payment of fixed amounts should cease.
I nevertheless take the view that it is difficult to have a statute for MEPs that differs from those binding on their national counterparts.
How is the difference between the earnings of an MEP and those of a member of a national parliament to be explained and justified?
Current events lead me to abstain from voting on the Statute for Members of this House.
Â Â  . We have always expressed our opposition to the creation of a monthly âparliamentary salaryâ, set at the same rate for all Members of the European Parliament regardless of the countries and the people that they represent.
Members of the European Parliament are elected nationally and are â and must continue to be â accountable to their national electorates.
The creation of a single âparliamentary salaryâ financed by the EU budget and subject to a Community tax, forms part of a federalist concept of the mandate of Members of the European Parliament, with a view to turning the current ânational Member of the European Parliamentâ into a âEuropean Memberâ.
The social situation in the different Member States also varies markedly.
A monthly âparliamentary subsidyâ set at around EURÂ 7Â 000 (around 1Â 400Â 000 escudos) would undoubtedly lead to deep inequality and disparity between the salaries earned by workers, national politicians (such as Members of the Portuguese Parliament) and local politicians, especially in Portugal, and we find this utterly incomprehensible.
Furthermore, we wish to restate our commitment to pursuing the fight for strict accountability with respect to the Membersâ use of resources to perform their duties.
Â Â  . I and my British Conservative colleagues have argued consistently for greater transparency and accountability with regard to Members' salaries and expenses.
The packageÂ proposed by the Legal Affairs committee represents an important step forward in achieving a fair and open system.
Conservatives have always believed that we should be taxed at the same rate as our UK constituents (article 12, point 3), that our salary is equal to that of our colleagues in Westminster (article 29, points 1 and 2), and to ensure that travel expenses are only reimbursed for the actual amount incurred (article 20, point 2).
Indeed, it was Conservative amendments, adopted in committee, which will allow Member States to adopt additional measures in order to place MEPs on an equal footing with members of national parliaments.
Â Â  . On 17Â December 2003, our party, the Dutch Socialist Party, voted against the then draft for a Membersâ Statute.
We were not opposed to a unified salary, but what was suggested at the time was far too high.
Moreover, we considered it important that it should be possible to make this salary liable to national taxes and that the reimbursement of travel expenses should be restricted to those actually incurred.
In our experience, on an annual basis, more than half can be recouped that way.
In the Dutch parliament, we asked the government to reject this document in the Council.
The proposal that was amended as a result, on which we are voting today, is still not entirely what we want.
Salaries must be below EUR 7Â 000 and we simply reject ArticleÂ 9.3.
We realise that voting ânoâ at this stage will not yield any further improvements.
Now that the maximum has been obtained, we consider this to be a victory in our long-term battle against inappropriate proposals.
Acceptance of this proposal represents a defeat for those who for years resisted this Statute, thinking it beneath their dignity, the salaries and reimbursements of travel expenses too low, and the financial monitoring too intrusive.
By voting against it, they will make it quite clear that they want, shamelessly, to line their own pockets.
Â Â  . The issue before us is an important one that needed to be addressed, given that the fact that the Statute for Members had not been standardised following the last enlargement had created unacceptable inequality.
My vote was therefore based on what I feel to be the most relevant aspects of this proposal on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament.
There are two aspects, however, on which I feel I should enlarge.
The fact that this proposal does not cover the current legislature, and that it provides for a very long transitional period, has enabled me to act with freedom, in the knowledge that I am voting on an issue that does not affect me directly.
Lastly, there is the question of timing.
When the report was put to the vote, I supported it, yet had the timing of the debate been put to the vote, I would have voted against.
Among other things, politics is about symbolism, and the fact that Parliament decided to vote on this issue at a time of major crisis for the European institutions is not something that I welcome or applaud.
Â Â  I am voting against MrÂ Garganiâs report because the proposed Statute would involve unacceptable salary increases, unduly generous pensions and an unduly long transitional period of two terms of office.
The voluntary pension fund should also have been abolished with immediate effect.
Instead, the Conference of Presidents should implement plenaryâs decision concerning the reimbursement of actual travel expenses instead of, now as before, blocking this reform so as to be able to use the issue of travel expenses in its negotiations with the Council.
Â Â  . The Left Party believes that it is wrong in principle to vote on our own salaries and other remuneration.
The Left Party is in favour of proposals finally having been made to do away with the standard reimbursement of MEPsâ travel expenses.
It is good that, in the future, reimbursement should be on the basis of actual costs.
The Left Party is not, however, in favour of the proposed salary, the level of which is too high.
High salaries must not turn elected representatives into a financial elite.
Tax must, of course, be paid on a national basis, and there must be no EU tax.
An unduly favourable pension system should also come in for the same criticism.
For these reasons, I shall abstain in the final vote.
Â Â  . Mr President, despite the worst possible timing for handling this persistent problem that has been around for years and years about a uniform Membersâ Statute, I took part in the vote and pressed the âplus buttonâ.
I voted in favour, not because I think this is such a wonderful Statute, for it is not.
The degree of uniformity is not sufficient for starters.
From all the times, though, that we have voted in Parliament and had to establish subsequently that the Council was incapable of reaching agreement, I have learnt that the communality we seek is not feasible and that there is no such thing as an âidealâ Statute.
The Statute proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which apparently received the stamp of approval from the Council, is better than what we have at the moment in the sense that it provides the necessary transparency and that it gives us the only acceptable travel expense scheme, namely one that reimburses only expenses actually incurred.
I am convinced that this alone is reason enough to vote in favour, even if this is done at the wrong time.
Â Â  .â The report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, by which we mean the creation of a new framework of privileges, is an insult to the peoples of Europe, while the recent rejection of the so-called European Constitution by France and the Netherlands expresses the general opposition of the peoples to the anti-grass roots policy of the ÎU.
Consequently, the EU and the European Parliament do not have the credentials to take such decisions.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report, because they consider that Members of the European Parliament should be paid by the countries in which they are elected and which they represent and to which they answer and not by the ÎU.
It is also an insult to the workers being crushed by the new EU anti-grass roots tempest to set the monthly salary of MEPs at EUR 7Â 000 while the monthly salary in Greece, for example, is EUR 572.30.
The working and grass-roots classes must draw their own conclusions from the common stand of the conservative and social-democrat parties, who are speeding up the attack on grass-roots incomes and their standard of living in order to increase the profits of big business and, at the same time, secure privileges for the political representatives of the plutocracy.
Â Â  .â I wish to explain my abstention from the vote on the Gargani report.
I am in favour of transparency on the subject of Members' salaries and expenses: of full transparency which is the product of dialogue which highlights the realities on which any decision must be based.
In the present instance, there was insufficient dialogue.
Account was not taken of all the objective data.
For example, the proposed reimbursement of travelling expenses does not take account of travelling time or inconvenience.
The ratio between the salary of a Member of Parliament and a judge does not take account of Members' loss of income.
Â Â  . I am in favour of the Membersâ Statute being adopted without delay.
All Members of the European Parliament should, as soon as possible, be subject to uniform terms and conditions.
I will not, however, be participating in the vote, as I shall not be availing myself of the new arrangements.
I took my seat subject to the former conditions and will continue to regard myself as bound by them.
Â Â  . I welcome both the implementation of the codecision procedure in connection with these proposals and the fact that the Court of Justice has issued rulings on areas relating to the border code, most importantly on the introduction of internal border controls.
One of the greatest triumphs of European integration has been freedom of movement without people being subject to internal border controls.
Consequently, to reintroduce such controls would have to be an exceptional and temporary measure, and without prejudice to the normal police controls that may take place anywhere in the territory.
External borders must act as an effective filter to stop people who are a threat to our society from entering, without interrupting the normal flow of people.
For border controls to be efficient and effective, Member States must be equipped with the necessary human and financial resources, and at the same time must ensure that human rights are upheld in full when these controls are taking place.
I therefore endorse this report by Mr Cashman, which supports the thrust of the Commissionâs proposal aimed at communitarising the management of external borders, with a view to ensuring the same standards and the same conditions of entry for third-country nationals are complied with across the board when controls take place.
Â Â  The June List broadly supports the compromise agreed between the Council, the Commission and Parliament.
On many points, the Code clarifies previously unclear rules derived from a range of legal sources.
We particularly welcome the increased protection against discrimination in the implementation of border controls, as well as the opportunities for third-country citizens who have been refused entry to a country to appeal against the decisions made.
We do not, however, share the rapporteurâs view that the EC Court of Justice should be given the power to give judgment on issues concerning the reintroduction of internal border controls, and we therefore welcome the fact that the Council has not accepted these proposals.
The June List believes that each Member State should be allowed to reserve the right to reintroduce its border controls if it considers this to be necessary in order to combat drug smuggling and illegal human and other trafficking and if it is required to withdraw from Schengen cooperation.
Â Â  .â The Community Code on movements across internal and external EU borders applies the racist and anti-immigration decisions taken in Seville and Thessaloniki, in order to turn the EU into a fortress which is hostile and inhumane towards the victims of the policy of imperialism and international monopolies who try and cross its borders.
It is not enough for foreign nationals wanting to enter and remain in the ÎU for no more than three months to be in possession of the necessary documents, to convince the authorities that they have legitimate reasons and enough money to survive for that period and to give detailed information on where and how they will live; they must also not be nationals 'for whom an alert has been issued in the Schengen Information System' and must not be considered 'a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Member States'.
Given that 89% of the entries in the Schengen Information System concern persons with no criminal record (they are based on unconfirmed accusations by 'informers'), this is an immensely arbitrary and repressive approach towards foreigners.
The anti-immigration policy of the ÎU is also reflected in the plummeting numbers of requests for asylum approved, in the preparations for the creation of immigrant concentration camps and so on.
The ÎU is opening its borders just wide enough to serve the interests of big business in cheap labour.
The Communist Party of Greece voted against the Cashman report.
Â Â  . Freedom of movement is one of the freedoms that the citizens of the EU hold most dear.
At the same time, immigration is one of the political questions that we must address seriously and with cool heads.
That being said, I feel that the crux of the question addressed in the report, which in part verges on the technical, is, nonetheless, equally important.
The practical rules governing both âinternal border controlsâ and âexternal border controlsâ are of considerable significance.
First and foremost, along with security and the exercise of authority comes respect for the citizens, be they nationals of EU Member States or otherwise.
Nonetheless, I agree that there are exceptions, whereby a Member State may waive the rules, for perfectly valid reasons.
I also back both the reportâs support for the right of appeal against a decision to refuse entry, without prejudice to the immediate effectiveness of such a decision, and a set of rules on the procedures mentioned here.
Â Â  The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of MrÂ Cashmanâs report on establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (A6-0188/2005).
We are, however, alert to the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmarkâs position.
Â Â  The report is designed to create a legal base for cooperation and commercial relations with the following industrialised countries: the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
Cooperation is partly about supporting EU Centres.
Trade cooperation is partly about exchanges, conferences and executive training.
We support the EUâs common trade policy but have difficulty justifying the budgeted costs of the efforts required, amounting to EURÂ 17Â million between now and 2007.
The results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands show that the EU bureaucracy must be slimmed down, so unnecessary expenses must also be dispensed with.
In the light of all this, we are voting against the report.
Â Â  . Commercial relations and cooperation with the countries involved in the programmes covered by this regulation are of major importance to the Union.
The evaluations of these programmes have proved very positive.
For the purposes of workable and fruitful commercial relations, we must continue to support initiatives of this nature, which help to coordinate support for research activities, exchange programmes for young people and business missions.
These programmes benefit todayâs Europe and will benefit future generations.
Â Â  . This report forms an integral part of the package of reforms of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP).
Statistical issues, such as the harmonisation of accounting rules and macroeconomic aggregates in the context of calculating the public deficit, were among the areas dealt with in most detail in the report entitled âImproving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pactâ submitted to the Spring European Council of MarchÂ 2005.
The plan to improve the European statistical system goes hand in hand with the attempt to restore credibility to the SGP, following cases of statistics being manipulated and numerous examples of creative accounting.
For us, the crux of the matter is not so much the SGPâs credibility; we feel that the SGP should be scrapped in view of its social and economic effects.
The regulation before us, which has been improved upon by the amendments that have been tabled by Parliament, increases the powers of the Commission and Eurostat, both to define and certify the quality of statistical data and to verify and standardise calculation procedures.
The most worrying aspect of this is that the Commission can put direct pressure on governments to implement monetary policies in the Member States.
Our vote against is thus consistent with our overall opposition to the so-called reform of the SPG.
Â Â  . All actions that help to improve the governance of the EU should be supported and properly taken on board.
The report by Mr GauzÃšs forms part of the efforts that need to be channelled into reforming the Communityâs statistical system, within the crucial context of the Stability and Growth Pact.
It is of paramount importance that exchanges of information be governed by transparency and trust between all of those involved in the process.
The collection, exchange and analysis of data must therefore be guided by the principles of accuracy, coherence and quality, within the context of the trust and transparency on which relations between Member States and the institutions must always be based.
Â Â  . I support this much-needed initiative to address the breach of the cease-fire agreement signed at N'Djamena on 8Â April 2004.
The purpose of this proposal, following UN Security Council Resolution 1591(2005), is to impose certain restrictive measures against Sudan, with a view to:
- freezing the funds and economic resources of persons impeding the peace process and
- preventing the entry into or transit through the territories of persons who may represent a threat to stability in that region.
We cannot allow violations of human rights, and of international humanitarian law, to continue.
Nor can we stand by while all manner of atrocities are being committed.
We must take all steps available to us to endeavour to re-establish peace in Darfur.
It must not be forgotten, however, that special attention must be given to one-off humanitarian emergencies.
Â Â  . The attitudes shown by countries and by international institutions are always worth more than the words that they speak.
When it comes to conflicts, the victims know this better than anyone.
Consequently, as well as voting in favour, I should also like to state that I hope that these measures will prove effective, and for this to happen we need the commitment of each of the 25 Member States.
There is no national interest that comes before peace and human rights, and nor must there be.
Â Â  . The June List supports the two UN resolutions on Darfur and Congo whereby those who impede the peace process, commit violations of humanitarian or of human rights law or violate the arms embargo shall be prevented from travelling within the territory of the Member States, with funds, financial assets and economic resources that can be linked to them also being frozen.
We do not, however, wish to help develop a common foreign and security policy for the EU.
All the Member States are obliged to implement those measures decided upon by the UN Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, and a joint decision at EU level is therefore unnecessary.
The June List has therefore voted against the reports.
Â Â  . The importance of this issue is in inverse proportion to the speed with which the international community has acted in response to the tragic situation in Darfur, Sudan.
Although I have consistently called for Parliament to address this issue, I still feel that this report deserves my vote in favour and my hope that it will prove effective.
Â Â  . As I said at first reading, the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) fell short of what was required.
The same objectives and criteria were reaffirmed and indeed more time was given.
What was really needed was the scrapping of the SGP and a clean break from the prevalent economic and monetary policies, in order to create a macroeconomic framework capable of fostering sustained economic growth and employment.
This was not the case.
The excessive deficit procedures continue to be implemented, not least in Portugal, the worst aspect of which is that it serves to justify the austerity measures contained in the stability programmes put forward.
This is true of Portugal, where taxes have gone up and where there has been a concerted attack on public administration, and in particular on public officials.
There is still no desire to learn the lessons that need to be learned.
Yet in spite of the cosmetic reform of the SGP, I welcome the rejection of the rapporteurâs maximalist proposals, the aim of which was to strengthen the SGP and to attach greater importance to the debt criterion, offsetting the data provided by national governments against the data provided by the central banks.
Â Â  . Not only is the Councilâs refusal to take into account any of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament a cavalier action, it also goes against the spirit of the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact.
Indeed, the balanced result achieved by the Luxembourg Presidency makes the procedure for excessive deficits more flexible, but at the same time includes increased surveillance of budgetary positions, with the simple, but sensible and honest, idea that we need to save during good times in order to face the lean times.
Only, the affirmation of this principle must be translated into reality in these texts.
There is the rub!
Following the unanimous agreement of the Council, certain Member States seem to be breaking their word and to be trying to go back on the particular attention that should now be given to public debt.
It is an appalling signal to give in these troubled times.
The stability of the euro will suffer from it.
Under these circumstances, the rapporteur proposes nothing less than re-specifying the commitment made with regard to public debt.
I can only support him in that, even though I hold nothing against the Presidency, which is irreproachable in this matter.
Â Â  . I supported the report by Mr Karas, because I feel that the problems that have surfaced in recent years with regard to the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) must be resolved.
The reform of the SGP calls for more emphasis to be placed on debt and for comparisons between statistics provided by the national central banks to the European Central Bank and the data provided by the Member States to Eurostat to be taken on board.
The reform of the SGP must involve all those involved in the process and all information relating to the development of the economies of the Member States must be clear and transparent.
As such we will be in a position to act promptly with economic measures and reforms aimed at helping our economies to grow and develop healthily.
Â Â  . The report by Mr DuchoÅ addresses areas of major importance to the future of economic activities in Europe.
It is vital that we protect the Communityâs financial interests when combating fraud and other illegal activities with the potential to harm its financial interests.
I therefore feel that this report strengthens the existing measures for cooperation and exchange of information that are key to combating illegal activities of this nature.
I also wish to highlight the key role played by OLAF, a body that is at the Unionâs disposal, in facilitating the exchange of information.
I therefore voted in favour of this report.
Â Â  . Almost half of funds earmarked for helping poor countries comes from the EU and its Member States, making it the worldâs biggest donor bloc.
The Union also makes use of trade to foster development, by opening up its markets to goods from poor countries and encouraging them to step up trade amongst themselves.
The proposal for a regulation is designed to further untie Community aid in areas covered by tendering procedures for goods and services for the purpose of external aid.
The purpose is to ensure that suppliers have access to all development assistance programmes financed from the EU budget and to set down rules governing the eligibility of persons and goods under instruments, laying down criteria and derogations.
I therefore endorse the report by Mr Gahler, which points out that fully untying this aid could make it USDÂ 2 to 3Â billion more effective.
Â Â  . The most relevant aspect, to my mind, of the issue before us, and the aspect that led me to vote in favour, is the belief that untying Community aid makes it more effective.
Beyond political considerations is the expectation â backed up by studies â that greater success can be achieved without enlarging the budget, simply by greater economic streamlining, and this is something that I welcome.
Â Â  Regarding the matter before us, we believe that NAFO is right in stating the need for a rebuilding plan for Greenland halibut.
We are not, therefore, voting against legislation by the EU.
Nor, however, can we vote in favour of this, for it is extremely improbable that this rebuilding plan will work, any more than other rebuilding plans in the EUâs fisheries policy have worked.
We believe that the EUâs fisheries policy has foundered for, in spite of extensive measures and bureaucracy, stocks are still threatened.
This may be due to a situation in which an isolated intervention in the form of quotas has led to increasing numbers of discards.
Then there is the hidden transfer and sale of quotas and rights and, in addition, the great uncertainty attached to bycatches in other fisheries.
That is why we cannot vote, either, for a report that would have the EUâs fisheries policy continue unamended.
We believe that there is a need for Parliament to demand a review of the EUâs fisheries policy, including the rebuilding plans.
Â Â  . The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) scientific council has adopted a 15-year rebuilding plan for Greenland halibut, which provides for a reduction of the total allowable catch (TAC) level of this species.
Already provisionally transposed into Community legislation, the plan is now waiting for binding permanent status.
Although I feel that the legislative proposal is consistent with the new common fisheries policy, I do not agree with some points in the version tabled by the Commission, which I feel would penalise Community fishermen.
I refer specifically to the reduction by 20 to a 5% margin of tolerance between the estimation of the quantities retained on board and that of the logbook figure.
As this level has not been adopted by NAFO I have always felt that adopting this measure would have a detrimental effect on Community fishermen.
I therefore welcome the removal of Article 8 and feel that Parliament has given the document a better balance and made it fairer.
Â Â  We oppose the EU Common Fisheries Policy.
We have, however, chosen to support this report because Parliamentâs position is closer to the rebuilding plan adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) than is the Commissionâs proposal.
Â Â  . This fishing zone, managed by the regional fisheries organisation in question, is of major importance to the Portuguese fleet.
The plan provides for a reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) level and for additional control measures, which will obviously have social and economic repercussions.
As with other rebuilding plans for fish stocks, we feel it is essential that, beyond the need to ensure that fisheries resources are sustainable and that scientific data is reliable, we implement much-needed social and economic support measures for the fleets affected by the reduction in fisheries or the temporary suspension of activities.
We welcome Parliamentâs proposals improving on points on which we disagreed with the Commissionâs proposal:
- the fact that fleets of EU countries that are bigger than other fleets working in the same waters do not impose their own limits (it is impossible to understand why the Commission seeks to be âholier than thouâ in adding further measures to the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, and as such we object to a unilateral limit of tolerance margins);
- the guarantee that TACs can be adjusted upwards if that fish stock is deemed to have been restored.
Â Â  . The report by Mr Kristensen addresses an issue that is without doubt of key importance to Portugal.
I voted in favour of this report on fisheries-related issues in an area in which the Community vessels operating are almost entirely Portuguese or Spanish.
Â Â  . It is appalling that most Members of this House insist on turning a blind eye to the crisis of confidence between the citizens and the European institutions, as evidenced by the recent referenda in France and the Netherlands on the ex-draft of the so-called European Constitution.
Similarly, they continue to press ahead with proposals such as the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, including the Bolkestein proposal for a directive, the organisation of working time and access to the port services market, rather than demanding that the Commission and the Council remove them.
They also support the Councilâs decision on guidelines for employment, which, disgracefully, overlook equal rights and opportunities between men and women, with specific regard to access to jobs, salaries and career development.
They also continue to promote projects such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the flexibility of labour, to which we are opposed.
Â Â  The true crisis eating away at Europe is unemployment, uncertainty and the destabilisation of public services.
The people are reminding their leaders of their existence.
Those who voted ânoâ in France are calling for a major change of direction for European integration and a renegotiation of the Treaty.
The pause for reflection must be used for that purpose.
The first requirement is social: to create growth and employment without making working conditions too flexible, and without pulling our social model down.
The guidelines for growth and employment adopted during this Summit, however, run completely counter to this objective.
At a time when employees are demanding guarantees and an end to ultraliberalism, âwe are carrying on as normalâ.
We should have withdrawn the Bolkestein directive and the Working Time Directive and proposed a social Treaty in their place.
The Council is deaf to the expectations of the people.
In order to extricate ourselves from the budgetary deadlock, we must increase the European budget in the interests of revival and cohesion.
As long as the budget depends on revenues from the Member States, the blockages will be stronger than the general interest.
The alternative to a European tax is European borrowing.
Â Â  . I was not able to support the resolution on the result of the European Council (Brussels 16 â 17 June 2005) as a result of its excessive formality and use of general officialese.
It is couched in complex bureaucratic language that is practically devoid of meaning.
The individual points made are not formulated in a clear and sensible manner which would provide comprehensible answers or ways out of the complex situation, in which Europe finds itself after the two unsuccessful referenda on the constitutional agreement and the failure to adopt the budget for the years 2007 - 2013.
There was no mention of basic principles relating to the internal market, such as the approach to the Directive on services.
It failed to mention the importance of a regional policy and the structural implements that are essential if the differences between the developed regions and those which are lagging behind are to be gradually removed.
The Lisbon Strategy is once again a series of empty phrases and there is no mention of how it should finally be put into practice.
If we want politics to be comprehensible to the citizens of Europe, we must change the bureaucratic rhetoric in our resolutions and word them in a language that is comprehensible to the people.
Only then will we be able to regain their trust.
Â Â  . The fact that I voted against the resolution tabled on this issue is not, in any way, due to any dissatisfaction on my part with the Luxembourg Presidency.
Indeed, I feel that we can all see how the widespread praise for the Luxembourg Prime Minister is justified.
Recent events, however, such as the double rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French and the Dutch and the inability to adopt the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013, cannot have gone unnoticed by Members of this House.
Reality is no mere passing detail.
Nevertheless, anyone reading the adopted resolution could be forgiven for thinking that either Parliament has had its mind elsewhere or that the citizens have.
In fact neither is true, at least on my part and on the part of the group to which I belong.
The last European Council should have responded to the current crisis in Europe with great lucidity and a proper understanding of the feelings of the citizens.
Unfortunately, it was not to be.
One can only hope that this crisis can give rise to fresh, more appropriate, solutions.
I believe that this is possible.
Â Â  . The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of the report on security research.
We think it important to develop a structured and appropriate security research programme with a view, for example, to guaranteeing the EUâs credibility and an advanced intelligence capability within the framework of the European Security and Defence Policy.
We are, however, opposed to certain wordings in the report: firstly, those applying to the budget appropriations for security research, linked by the rapporteur to a percentage of GNP; and, secondly, those applying to worldwide observation and data collection.
Â Â  The report is aimed at developing a European Security Research Programme (ESRP), to be introduced in 2007.
We are not opposed on principle to joint research efforts at European level, but we object to the ESRPâs aim of contributing to an integrated European defence market.
We therefore choose to vote against the report as a whole.
Â Â  . This report concerns a European Parliament initiative to support the creation of a âEuropean Security Research Programmeâ by 2007, and the Community financing of that programme, within the framework of the âEuropean Security and Defence Policyâ and what are referred to as the âEuropean Security Strategyâ and âThe Hague Programmeâ.
The aim is therefore to step up research in areas such as the gathering and storing of information, vigilance, spying, security and âcrisis managementâ.
It will be a further cog in the wheel of the current militarisation of the EU and its drift towards securitarianism, under the pretext of the âfight against terrorâ, conducted in conjunction with the USA.
Hence our groupâs vote against.
Â Â  . In light of recent world events, the issue of security has taken on major importance, and Member States must address new threats to security.
There has nonetheless been a marked under-investment in research and development in the defence sector, in which spending has either remained unchanged or has in fact gone down over the past ten years.
I therefore congratulate Mr Klich on his report, which supports the Commissionâs proposal to set up a European Security Research Programme (ESRP) by 2007, in order to address current security challenges, while contributing towards the growth and competitiveness of the European economy.
The ESRP will involve relevant security research stakeholders and will enjoy appropriate funding, so as to secure the greatest possible continuity over time and the best results.
Â Â  .â The report also puts the research sector at the service of the imperialist policy of the ÎU and, at the same time, secures funding for big business in this sector by making EUR 1 billion available from taxes paid by the working and grass-roots classes in the Member States of the ÎU.
On the pretext of 'security' and 'threats', it promotes the further militarisation of Europe and improved technology to support the aggressive actions and enhance the military power of the ÎU, so that it is better placed to compete with the USA for control of markets and countries.
At the same time, taking the view that the distinction between internal and external security is difficult to make, it also uses research to improve internal repression of the grass-roots movement in the Member States.
Every system, even in space, even the satellite positioning system, is being put at the service of the programme for security research.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report.
The peoples of the ÎU must step up their fight against the ÎU and their disobedience to its imperialist policy.
Â Â  . It is really no progress towards peace that the Klich-Report calls for a minimum annual community budget of â¬1 billion for armament and so called security research.
The Parliament's Resolution is even worse than the Commission proposals.
It is preposterous to try and aim to close the gap on armament spending between the EU and the United States. This would mean require the EU to spend still much more each year on armament research.
The EU is becoming more and more militarised.
The spending of an additional one billion Euros on armament research would be yet a further step in this direction.
In rejecting the Constitutional Treaty, the people of France and the Netherlands also rejected the EU militarisation envisaged in that Treaty.
It is a scandal that the protagonists of this militarized EU are simply going ahead with their plans regardless.
Instead of pretending to create jobs with huge spending on armaments, the EU should spend more on civil research programs - and not follow in the footsteps of the United States.
Â Â  . Europe must get used to the idea that security comes at a price and that our need for security justifies paying that price.
Without prejudice to our partnerships and alliances, especially with the United States, Europe needs to invest in the security of its citizens, and this cannot be done without investing in research, an area in which Europe has sadly proved lacking in commitment and competence.
In the context of the world in which we live, I feel that this report addresses the concerns that I have expressed, and advocates action that meets our needs.
I therefore voted in favour.
Â Â  . We live in an age of headlong technological change, and, at the same time, criminal activity is developing with equal speed.
One example of this is the latest theft of credit card data, which may well affect some 800Â 000 Europeans.
The electronic health cards that we intend introducing may well end up being the next thing that the criminal gangs will have their eyes on.
Cybercrime â in the shape of illegal downloads, spamming, spyware and child pornography â is flourishing, and only some 1 or 2% of the offences committed on the Internet ever come to light.
What makes this particularly disturbing is the widespread ignorance of such crime.
Far too many users are still falling prey to e-mailshots that trick them into disclosing their bank details, thus credulously giving fraudsters access not only to sensitive data, but also to their own bank accounts.
The latest Eurobarometer survey showed that 40% of Austrian parents had no idea where to get information on safe use of the Internet and where to report prohibited material.
In that, though, they are not alone, for investigations have revealed that the US authorities are equally ignorant of when and to whom they should report cases of cybercrime.
Tracking down cyber-crooks is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
This makes it all the more important that we should mount an information campaign that would enable users not only to avoid the traps in the Internet, but also to play their part in combating the crime that goes on there.
Â Â  . I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Trautmann.
I feel that issues of Internet governance and mechanisms for financing the new technologies should be at the forefront of political debate in Europe and the rest of the world.
The information society is of twofold importance in meeting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy: firstly because it will help to fulfil the aims of economic growth accompanied by major investment in the new technologies and secondly because a Europe that seeks to be at the cutting edge of technology needs to be a regular presence and a proactive player on the international stage.
I believe that any initiative that fosters the exchange of ideas and information and puts us on the road to technological development should be supported.
Initiatives of this kind can only help to achieve greater growth and economic development in Europe.
Â Â  I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
Â Â  I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 23 June 2005.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, a terrible tragedy has struck the family of our fellow Member Filip Adwent: as you know, he, his daughter, his father and his mother died in a traffic accident on Saturday 18 June.
Parliament has lost a colleague, an excellent Member of Parliament, a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, vice-chairman of the Delegation to the Parliamentary Committee on EU-Ukraine Cooperation and deputy in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
I believe that all of those who have worked with him in these committees and all of us in general remember his serious work and his dedication to Parliament.
Filip Adwent was a doctor by profession.
He was known for his sense of justice and the conviction with which he fought for what he believed in.
For many years he participated in the organisation of humanitarian aid for the poor and disadvantaged in Poland.
At this painful moment, Parliament would like to express its condolences to his wife, Mrs Adwent, and the whole of his family â the remaining members of his family.
I would ask, ladies and gentlemen, that we observe a minuteâs silence in memory of our colleague.
Â Â  Ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to make a further statement relating to certain events of this weekend.
On reaching the Chamber, you may have been surprised to see that there is a large white band encircling the Chamber.
I believe that this is the first time that we have used a symbol in this building for a campaign, such a large symbol, and I would like to tell you a few details about the significance of this white band.
I would like to remind you that this band symbolises the âGlobal Call to Action against Povertyâ which was launched by the President of Brazil, Mr da Silva, in Porto Alegre, in January 2005.
Since then, more than 600 non-governmental organisations throughout the world, including the largest organisations, have joined this campaign and are trying to secure the support of governments and public figures.
It is now our turn, the turn of the European Parliament, and to this end we have chosen this week of plenary sittings, which coincides with the beginning of the G8 summit on Wednesday in Gleneagles.
Ladies and gentlemen, we will all agree that the fight against poverty is objective of the Unionâs development policy and that this year offers a great opportunity to make progress in this regard, since during this year several high-level conferences will be held on this subject.
You are also aware that, this year, the European Union will contribute EUR 46 000 million in development aid, and this means that the European Union is the world's largest donor in this field.
We can certainly take pride in this, but we should perhaps consider the relative significance of this figure â of this EUR 46Â 000 million.
Please bear in mind that the EUR 70 that each European pays per year in the rich countries for the purposes of development aid is equivalent to the price of one cup of coffee per week.
This is what our effort means in relative terms: the price of a cup of coffee per week for each inhabitant of the rich countries; our generosity goes no further than that.
The Council in June approved the decision to increase the EUâs development aid to EUR 66Â 000 million in 2010, that is to say, from 46 to 66, the price of one and a half cups of coffee.
However, we would have to wait five years for this.
I believe that this is the ambitious message that the European Union is sending to the G8 summit this week, but we must also remember that for this purpose we will need a budget that we do not yet have.
The objectives of this campaign are fair trade, debt reduction and an increase in aid, both in terms of its quality and its quantity.
I would also like to remind you that, outside this Chamber, there are a series of stalls set up by the NGOs, and until Wednesday you will be able to obtain more information from them.
On Wednesday morning, a debate will take place on Africa, on the challenges of globalisation and also, of course, on this campaign against poverty, in which Jack Straw, Hilary Benn and Louis Michel will participate.
The white band is the symbol of this campaign and, following the debate, everybody who has spoken in it and myself, on behalf of everybody, will sign a second white band as a sign of our support; this band will be cut and Hilary Benn will take it to Gleneagles.
However, we also need the support of all of you, and to this end I would ask you to sign the white band at the entrance to the Chamber as a sign of your action and your will to combat poverty, so that Hilary Benn can present a vigorous message from this Parliament in Gleneagles.

When you sign it, however, I would ask you to bear in mind that we are citizens with more powers than the ordinary citizens, we are budgetary authorities, we vote for and allocate resources and we approve policies; when you sign it, bear in mind that over the coming years, we as parliamentarians will have to approve the Unionâs budget, with or without financial perspectives, and that the commitment represented by your signature is also a commitment to use this Parliament's power to make a genuine effort to eradicate poverty in our world.
Thank you very much for participating in this campaign.
Â Â  The final version of the draft agenda for the present part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 30 June pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed.
There are several proposed amendments that we shall consider day by day.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has requested that the reports by Mr Lauk, on the 2004 Annual Report of the European Central Bank, and Mr Maaten, on the implementation of an information and communication strategy on the euro and economic and monetary union, be debated jointly.
Â Â  Mr President, the two items â the Lauk report on the European Central Bank, and the report on the communication strategy on the euro â were originally to be debated jointly.
That made sense, because President Trichet of the European Central Bank would have been present at the debate.
When, at a later stage, the two items were separated, it meant that President Trichet would be present only for the Lauk report and therefore would be unable to discuss the communication strategy on the euro with us.
That is a pity both for us and for President Trichet who, I understand, is keen to be part of that debate.
It makes more sense to have a joint debate on the two reports to enable President Trichet to participate on both reports, rather than on the annual report of the European Central Bank alone.
That is the reason for our request.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, allow me to reassure you and to reassure MrÂ Maaten: I feel very much part of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and, therefore, it is not on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe that I will speak, but as the Chairman of the committee concerned with the two reports in question.
Basically, the request that we are going to examine to change the agenda is slightly paradoxical, because the entire strategy carried out by the rapporteurs and the Commission was aimed at having a joint debate on those two texts: the policy of the Central Bank and the information and communication strategy regarding the euro.
The agenda as it is envisaged, with the one report following the other, very much reflects this intention.
There is, however, something strange in all of this: how did the idea of holding two separate debates instead of one joint debate come about in our agenda?
I hope that the plenary vote will allow things to be returned to normal as good sense would dictate.
During the sitting of 10 May, the report by Mr Busk, on the proposal for a regulation on exceptional market support measures, was referred back to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, pursuant to Rule 52.
That committee is now asking that it be referred back to committee, pursuant to Rules 52 and 168 of our Rules of Procedure.
Â Â  Mr President, we have referred this report to the committee.
The rapporteur agreed with the commissioner concerned to put forward a fresh proposal on the matter at the September part-session.
We therefore request a further postponement with the consent of the Commission.
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that Questions to the Commission be removed.
Â Â  Mr President, let me first of all express my groupâs condolences to the late Mr Adwentâs family, and also wish Mr Laschet all the best in his new role.
We will miss him as an adversary in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.
I wish to move â and it is not a pleasant task to do so â that Questions to the Commission be again adjourned to another day, as we have a lot of things in mind for the Structural Funds, and so we are very keen to take part in the debate on them.
Even though this debate will probably make few changes of any substance, a lot of Members would like to speak in it.
We will be in a similar situation on several occasions over the coming months â the services directive and REACH are two examples that spring to mind â and so I would ask you, Mr President, and the services, to give some thought to what arrangements we should be making for them.
I have no desire to make the same request every time and deprive Members of something they are entitled to.
We need to join together in considering how we can retain Question Time and still allow more time for important debates.
Today, though, I wish, on behalf of my group, to move that Question Time be dispensed with, and, as I have said, that the services give some thought to these matters.
Â Â  Mr President, I should in fact like to offer the support of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the proposal put forward by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, as the debate on the Structural Funds is so important that the agenda, as it stands, would not allow a large number of Members to speak.
I therefore believe that it is very important that we can take advantage of an extended debating time.
Withdrawing the time dedicated to questions to the Commission and the Council is, however, regrettable.
It would therefore be desirable, MrÂ President, if you could consider organising the debating time within plenary in Strasbourg more efficiently.
We would like the time for questions to the Commission and the Council to be reorganised, with a number of my fellow Members even proposing that the debate be held on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
I do not know if that is possible.
Be that as it may, we very much hope, MrÂ President, that you will give fresh thought to the matter.
In the meantime, we are in favour of the proposal put forward by the PSE Group.
Â Â  Mr President, at the last part-session, at exactly this time, Mr Swoboda proposed the abandonment or the curtailment of Question Time.
Here we go again!
This is quite intolerable.
Questioning the executive â questioning the Commission, rather than giving our little speeches â is one of the most fundamental things we do in this Parliament.
It is not acceptable to do this two part-sessions running.
I am very much against this proposal.
Although the two big groups are proposing it, so it looks as though it will go through.
I plead with colleagues to vote against the proposal by the two leaders.
Let us keep Question Time.
Mr Karas and 38 other Members have requested that a Commission statement be added on the Situation in Bulgaria after the elections Progress made towards accession by Bulgaria and Romania with a view to the next progress report.
They call for progress towards their full and effective accession, naturally.
Furthermore, they request that a resolution be voted on in this regard.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the avoidance of doubt, I would like to start with three prefatory remarks.
The first is that most members of my group voted in favour of Bulgarian and Romanian accession on 1 January 2007.
Secondly, there has been a debate in the Conference of Presidents as to when observers from these countries can be invited to join in the work of this House.
I regard this as an issue for debate in the plenary and believe that no date can as yet be set.
Thirdly, as the states that joined us in 2004 were allowed to send observers to the European Parliament a year prior to their accession, we believe that the same rule should apply, with exactly the same timeframe, and that an accession date cannot yet be named, quite simply because the ratification of the accession treaties has not yet been completed.
Nor has the Commission yet produced its progress report.
The consequences of this are not yet known; it would still be possible to delay accession until 1 January 2008, and we have not made financial and organisational preparations for observation to begin earlier.
We therefore want the Commission to make a statement on the state of play as regards its planned progress report, enabling us to come to our own conclusions, rather than put the next new Member States, as regards observation and cooperation, in a more advantageous position than that formerly enjoyed by the last ten Member States to join us.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this House is not in any doubt about the fact that Bulgaria and Romania will join the European Union.
What is still an open question is at what point in time they will do so.
The Conference of Presidents has decided to invite observers in September, and, although we all, of course, accept its ruling with the utmost submissiveness and reverence, the plenary might perhaps be allowed to decide these things for itself from time to time.
There are three reasons why the date set for the sending of observers was too early.
For a start, never before have observers been invited so early on; secondly, the treaties explicitly provide for the accession date to be delayed, and, if that were to happen, the observers would be here for rather more than two years; and thirdly they would be with us when the Commission presents its next progress report, in which we can expect an answer as to whether accession is to take place at the beginning of 2007 or of 2008, and debating with observers present is not a good idea.
We therefore ask that this item be put on the agenda, thus enabling us, on the basis of the plenaryâs decision, to consider the matter carefully.
Â Â  Mr President, in 1993 in Copenhagen the Union agreed a strategy of ten plus two for enlargement.
We have pursued it to the huge benefit of those 12 countries and of the other Member States in terms of greater stability, greater prosperity and greater opportunities for our citizens.
Whatever the position of the EPPâs Prime Ministers, within the EPP Group there has always been a history of opposition to Bulgaria and Romania.
Two months ago they moved to delay our approval of the accession treaties.
More recently they tried to delay the appointment of observer MEPs and now they are trying to stop observers coming although you, Mr President, have already written officially to the presidents of those parliaments inviting observers.
We all know the weakness of the EPP in those two countries.
We know that the EPP Group in this House would appear smaller after the arrival of these observers.
But it takes a unique combination of political cunning and willingness to destabilise things in those two countries to make such a cynical move now and I hope the House will reject it.
I would like to inform you that during the last two part-sessions two legislative proposals by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs have been rejected by plenary and have therefore been referred back to committee pursuant to Rule 52 of the Rules of Procedure.
With regard to the initiative by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs asks that plenary confirm its rejection during the present part-session by voting for the legislative resolution closing the consultation.
If there is no objection the vote on this issue will take place on Thursday.
With regard to the proposed decision on the retention of data â the Ãlvaro report â which was referred back to the Commission on 22 June, I must inform you that that parliamentary committee would like more time to allow the European Commission to present an alternative or additional proposal on the same subject.
Do you think that we should allow that committee more time and that, once its proposal is presented, Parliament should then decide on the most appropriate procedure for dealing with this issue in accordance with the Treaties?
Â Â  . MrÂ President, you have just explained everything in fact.
If I have correctly understood, therefore, the entire matter will be put to the vote on Thursday.
I thank you and I thank my fellow Members.
Â Â  Allow me to provide some details in relation to what we have just voted on: motions for resolutions can be presented until 10 a.m. tomorrow Tuesday and amendments and joint motions for resolutions can be presented until 10 a.m. on Wednesday.
Â Â  Mr President, can you please again tell us precisely when this debate on Bulgaria and Romania is to be held and how long it will last?
Â Â  That debate will take place at the end of Wednesdayâs agenda.
Â Â  Following that laborious rearrangement of the agenda, we shall proceed to the next item, which is the one-minute speeches by Members.
I shall continue to apply the procedure that I communicated to you by letter, to which nobody has expressed any objection and which was applied during the last part-session.
Â Â  In recent weeks there has been a new and unprecedented series of raids in Germany organised at the government level.
These actions have been going on for more than a year now with unabated intensity and according to press reports, are brutal, unjustified, unlawful and in violation of the presumption of innocence and other fundamental human rights, and have as their aim to collectively crush Hungarian firms and squeeze them out of the German market, in other words, out of the internal market of the European Union.
The Hungarian Government has protested and demanded an explanation, those affected have written to the Commission, and indeed as a Member of this House, I have also submitted a question to the relevant Commissioner.
The matter has not, however, been resolved.
Now my parliamentary colleagues and I are again writing to urge the Commission to take action, and indeed we intend to propose that Parliament should debate these and other such discriminatory practices by Member States that seriously contravene EU regulations.
Mr President, please follow these events closely, as I am convinced that by obstructing the free movement of services we are not moving closer to achieving our Lisbon targets on competitiveness; on the contrary, we are going in the opposite direction.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Parliament has passed 83 Lisbon directives, 63 of which should have been implemented.
In fact, only ten have been fully implemented by all the Member States.
I wish to continue my practice of naming and shaming Member States that fail to implement EU legislation.
Today the issue I am concentrating on is being discussed at the G8 Summit: the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowance Trading Scheme Directive, which should have been implemented by the end of 2003.
Estonia, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Sweden have yet to notify the Commission of their legislation implementing this directive.
There is no point in passing these laws if they are not implemented.
Such lax behaviour by Member States jeopardises the Lisbon directives and economic liberalisation.
Mr President, could you please write to these countries and ask them when they intend to initiate this law?
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, on 26Â June our colleague Filip Adwent, a Member of the European Parliament, passed away following a tragic car accident.
His closest family members, his parents and his daughter, also died in the accident.
We have held a minuteâs silence in their memory.
We have lost a Member of Parliament who was kind-hearted, extremely hard-working, noble, friendly and compassionate to others.
He was known for his active participation in Parliamentâs work, for example within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and during plenary sessions, when he championed farmersâ interests.
His enthusiastic involvement and magnanimity meant that we joined forces to promote common causes and the common good, in spite of our political differences.
We recently spent a great deal of time together working to end the European Unionâs extremely unfair treatment of Polish producers of soft fruit.
MrÂ Adwent is unfortunately no longer with us, and we will doubtless find it harder to find solutions to such problems without him.
My memories of MrÂ Adwent are fond ones, and I should like to thank him by means of this speech for his friendliness and cooperation, while sharing in the grief of his family.
Â Â  Mr President, I, along with a quarter of a million people, marched through Edinburgh â my home city â over the weekend to protest against poverty in the developing world.
Sadly, today we hear that a few hundred rioters are currently under the control of the police in Edinburgh and that they are intent on making trouble in my home town.
I hope that the police will take firm steps against them.
As you said earlier, it is our turn in this House.
We must reclaim the agenda from these rioters, from these protesters.
I would refer the House to the activities which will be taking place this week.
I would urge colleagues to support them.
I would ask you also to sign the written declaration in my name on âMaking Poverty Historyâ.
At a time when expectations of politicians in general are running so high, I would urge colleagues to demonstrate and prove to the citizens of Europe that we are in step with them, as we were in step with them over the weekend, and play our part in making poverty history.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like everyone else, I too am impressed with the wave of solidarity engendered across the whole of the Western world by the organisation of the Live 8 event.
By watching the concerts in Hyde Park, Versailles or Toronto, which they were able to do via 140 television channels, millions of people across the globe have sent a clear message that we should not turn our backs on Africa.
The question is, though, whether the proposed solution is the best one.
It remains to be seen whether the cancellation of Africaâs debt by the G8 is the best way of getting Africans to take responsibility for improving their lot.
We should also be critical towards quite a few African leaders and, as the brother of the South African President, Muletsi Mbeki, did in the , have the nerve to say out loud that Africaâs problem resides in the plundering of the continent, and is being inflicted by its own leaders.
As a Fleming, I know only too well that in the past, Belgian politicians nurtured Mobutu, who was a common thief, and also that the French Africa policy was often one of unscrupulous complicity with political figures who did not give a damn about the misery of their own people.
I cannot, therefore, agree with Bob Geldof when he says that we should not dwell on corruption too much.
Africa deserves our all-out support, but not when our money ends up in the pockets of corrupt politicians.
Â Â  â Mr President, the British Prime Minister, having barely taken over the Presidency of the Council, has said that he does not care about the 4% of the population who are farmers, who produce 2% of gross income.
However, not every European lives in Mayfair in London or on the Champs ElysÃ©es in Paris or on the Via Veneto in Rome.
There are a great many Europeans who live in the regions, in rural areas.
In my country, which was one of the first to join the European Union, the situation is tragic.
Factories are closing, people are shopping in neighbouring countries, unemployment has reached peak levels in Europe, we have two and a half million illegal immigrants, more than Italy, which has a population of 45 million; the situation is dramatic.
We are not begging.
We are asking that you secure the borders of Greece, the borders of Europe.
There are 40 to 50 illegal entries a day.
This has forced us to spend USD 5.2 billion on equipment.
If we had spent this money on agriculture, if we had spent it on factories, we would not today need to ask Mr Blair for money.
Save us, please, from the threats from Turkey.
Â Â  MrÂ President, a journalist, MrÂ AkbarÂ Ganji, and a lawyer, MrÂ Nasser Zarafshan, are being detained in extremely critical conditions in Iran.
You are going to receive a precise update on the situation concerning them and I should like you, on behalf of Parliament, to contact the competent authorities in order to request their release on medical grounds.
All of the large humanitarian organisations are doing so, as is the Nobel Peace Prize.
It would therefore be a significant step for our Parliament, through your voice, to intervene in support of the release of these two intellectuals.
Mr President, last week five farmers were thrown into jail in Ireland because they resisted the laying of a potentially dangerous gas pipeline through their land and close to their homes.
The five men were sent to prison because they refused to give assurances that they would not obstruct work on their land.
These men have legitimate concerns and we should share those concerns on environmental grounds.
The Shell-led multinational consortium, including Marathon and Norwegian Statoil, intend to place a pipeline across residential land and beside homes, without an independent safety audit being carried out.
We see multinational companies with no regard for local communities or the environment and a compliant government that allows these potential hazards to communities.
Local people argued that the pipeline should be laid out to sea.
The pipeline operation has not been shown to comply with the necessary safety precautions.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to express my sincere gratitude â and, I am sure, all European parliamentarians from the Baltic States will join me â for your recent statement commemorating the 65th anniversary of the occupation of our three sovereign states in 1940 by the totalitarian Soviet Union.
The truth about that should be made known and remembered by everybody, and even recognised by some with a feeling of apology, as it was such a bloody and long-lasting tragedy.
The memory calls for justice.
Therefore, I am sure that a new special Nuremberg process or a special Hague Tribunal will also be established for Soviet war crimes and their perpetrators.
Let many among us here share this hope: the hope in the future of having a Russia of shared values.
Â Â  Mr President, I wish to ask you to raise urgently with the United Kingdom Government the issue of its failure to properly and fully carry out its obligations under the Euratom Treaty and European directives on nuclear safety.
Persistent failures at the BNFL Sellafield nuclear facility put at risk the health and wellbeing of those who work there, their surrounding communities and those living on the east coast of Ireland.
Recently, it was revealed that, over a period of eight months from August 2004 to April 2005, 83Â 000 litres of radioactive material containing 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium leaked unnoticed from a broken pipe into a containment tank.
This is not an acceptable level of safety in an industry where safety failures can have catastrophic outcomes.
Â Â  Mr President, approximately 58Â 000 people die each year in the European Union as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury.
This figure is far higher than the number of people killed in traffic accidents.
The Commissionâs Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection published a paper last year on the state of mental health in the European Union.
One of the important points to emerge from the research was that, with the exception of Ireland, the elderly have the highest suicide rates in the population.
Suicide rates increase with age.
Since the number of people who reach old age is increasing, the absolute number of suicides is expected to rise.
We know that the majority of suicide cases are linked to mental health, particularly depression.
One might also think that there would be a relationship between suicide and major economic factors such as unemployment and poverty levels.
The Commissionâs paper acknowledges that, even though standardisation of most mental health instruments has been completed through many studies, definition of mental health states is one of the most difficult tasks.
Therefore it is always difficult to interpret any differences.
Would it now be prudent to establish a central European register for suicide cases so that an EU-wide analysis of data could take place?
We could thus try to identify the causes and trends of this terrible phenomenon and see which Member Statesâ best practice could be benchmarked in the other Member States.
Â Â  Mr President, MrÂ Hans-Peter Martin, a non-attached Member of this House, is now, in the Austrian media, delivering himself of sweeping, foul, unqualified insinuations and slurs, aimed no longer only at this House and the European Unionâs institutions, but also at those who assist us in our work as Members and the officials of the European Parliament.
Among other things he has written in a daily newspaper, I will quote the following: âThe assistants, mainly young graduates, quickly get used to a three-day week, enticed, seduced and spoiled by Brussels.â
He goes on in similar vein, as follows: âIn this place, heaven help any MEP who expects hard work; practically all of them find it far beyond them.
Performance and responsibility are not in their vocabulary; sloppiness comes as standard.
Most of all, the staff can neither concentrate nor see things through.â
I firmly repudiate these sweeping denigrations of our staff and of the staff of this House.
I wish to thank all our staff, without whom we would not be able to make such a good job of serving the people, and without whom we would be unable to cope with so many parties of visitors and so much legislative work.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last week, the Council adjourned the vote on the directive introducing a uniform driversâ licence across the EU, and this decision I regard as extremely irresponsible, short-sighted, and, indeed, incomprehensible.
One reason why many members of the public reject the EU is that they believe that it lays down rules and regulations on everything, conceivable and inconceivable, but to put on ice, for fear of prompting even more Euro-scepticism, a directive that makes the roads safer, strikes me as utterly, excessively rash as a course of action.
I also see it as betraying a communications failure on the part of the ministers responsible for the delay, who did not attempt to communicate the directiveâs significance and purpose to the public, and perhaps did not have the nerve to do so.
This directive could do a great deal to put a stop to âdriving licence tourismâ and make the roads a good deal safer.
An Austrian government minister â the transport minister, in fact â recently gave it as his opinion in an Austrian newspaper, that the European people should not be treated in such a condescending manner.
That, though, is precisely what the Council is doing with this decision and the minister in question was one of those responsible for it doing so.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, one of our colleagues and a fellow Member of the European Parliament, DrÂ Filip Adwent, has passed away.
He died together with his parents and daughter following an accident which occurred in unexplained circumstances.
I should like to take this opportunity today to share my memories of our dear colleague, who was a magnificent, honest and good-natured man, as well as a social activist and a patriot.
It is fitting that I should say these words before the European Parliament in Strasbourg, as this was the city of his birth and his home for 40Â years.
I should like to express my sorrow at his death.
I should also like to say that DrÂ Filip Adwent was a fine example of a believer.
He had discovered the priceless evangelical jewel that is love for oneâs homeland, and this love filled his life with new value and meaning.
He left the fine city of Strasbourg for Poland, motivated by a desire to serve the homeland of his ancestors, and disregarding not only the many objections, but also the distance separating the two countries and the affluent life he led here.
In the belief that life changes but never ends, let us pray that MrÂ Filip Adwent and those closest to him enjoy eternal life.
Â Â  Mr President, Africa has featured a lot today in the debate, and rightly so.
Last Saturday, the people of the world â in particular the young people â called on the G8 nations to sort out the economic problems of Africa.
Live 8 was a tremendous success.
Hopefully, the collective will of the young people in particular will be listened to at Gleneagles.
However, Africa has more than economic problems: it has political and human rights problems.
In particular I refer to Zimbabwe.
Mobutu has already been mentioned; we have had Amin and Bokassa.
We now have another dictator in Mugabe: not content with the purge of white farmers, he has now turned on the black population, who have been uprooted from the land and are living in hovels with no food.
We are now facing another human catastrophe in Africa.
The United Nations wrings its hands, the EU has stood back, but South Africa â the model of peaceful ethnic resolution â surely should take the lead.
That is why I am heartened by the fact that Thabo Mbeke has met with Morgan Tsvangirai, the head of the opposition in Zimbabwe.
I would like to draw the Houseâs attention to one statement in particular: Zimbabweâs police chief said yesterday that they must rid their country of âthe crawling mass of maggotsâ.
What an indictment of his own people. We must act.
Â Â  MrÂ President, during the dramatic hours of the battle conducted by Luxembourg, in the course of the Summit, six new Member States â Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary â proposed a compromise aimed at reducing the aid granted to them, in order to save the 2007-2013 budget.
It was neither a purely symbolic gesture, nor a sacrifice: as new Member States, it was in fact entirely in our interests for a budget to be adopted for that period.
Without that new budget, Europe as a whole would lose out, but the biggest losers would be the ten new Member States.
We continue to contribute to drafting a compromise for the budget.
The Budapest solution proposed by the Prime Minister of Hungary, Ferenc GyurcsÃ¡ny, is working towards the same objective.
It is not a question of a new budget but of a kind of âlifebeltâ, based on the proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency and intended to save this yearâs budget.
If it is unable to reach a compromise, the Council will thus have to draft a three-year budget.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the European Union, or more precisely Poland and Lithuania, shares borders with Russia.
The region of Russia in question, which was formerly known as KrÃ³lewiec (KÃ¶nigsberg), has been called Kaliningrad for several decades.
A much-publicised ceremony recently took place there, yet although the highest representatives of France and Germany, or in other words the French President and the German Chancellor, played a prominent part in proceedings, the EU Member States of Poland and Lithuania were not invited.
Kaliningrad is a symbol of Russiaâs imperialist policies.
To tell the truth, I have no idea what kind of message these top EU leaders were trying to convey, given that they committed themselves to a common foreign policy for the European Union in the draft Constitution.
There is no indication whatsoever that such a policy is in fact being pursued.
The general reaction to gestures of this kind is one of complete incomprehension, since they not only misrepresent the historical significance of this region, but also give the lie to the idea of a genuine community of interests.
Â Â  Mr President, a written declaration on rheumatic diseases has been put out today for Members of this House to sign.
It is one that I urge you and all Members of this House to support.
The reason why I am doing this is that rheumatic diseases affect 50% of the European Unionâs population, and 50% of those treated for them will become unemployed within ten years, accounting also for 450 million days of paid sick leave in Europe every year.
This adds up to a heavy burden on our social security and health systems and is also an obstacle to our achieving the essential Lisbon goals.
I therefore urge you to support this declaration, which calls for the Commission to acknowledge once and for all that rheumatic diseases are among the major diseases and should therefore be included in a special category in the Seventh Research Programme.
Â Â  â Mr President, trafficking in women and children as commodities from third countries within the Union for the purpose of sexual exploitation and forced labour is a constantly burgeoning phenomenon.
The situation, which has taken on the proportions of a scourge, has preoccupied the Union and the institutions responsible without, however, achieving any substantial reduction in absolute numbers.
In Greece in particular, we have hundreds of children arriving illegally every year, children who do not enjoy any of the rights which adult refugees enjoy, who are housed in mixed centres for both minors and adults, who are detained beyond the stipulated three-month limit and who have no care once they are released.
The lack of systematic identification and recording of minors, the lack of information about their rights in a language which they can understand is reflected in the fact that asylum has not been granted to a single child in recent years.
Hundreds of them are roaming around and few reach non-governmental organisations.
The modern slave trade, which moves 40Â 000 women and children a year in Greece alone, must be given our attention and addressed.
Â Â  Mr President, the week before last we were addressed by the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.
Mr Blair knows that the European project is in crisis.
He knows that further political integration cannot be sold to the peoples of Europe, still less the British, unless there are at least some cosmetic changes to the worst excesses of the budget.
We in Britain have endured New Labour for the last eight years. Now it is your turn to endure New Europe at least for the next six months.
Mr Blair hopes that he can reform the European Union in order to make it more palatable to the people.
He will learn the same lesson as Mrs Thatcher did, namely that the European Union is unreformable.
It is likely that it will be even more apparent to the British people at the end of the British Presidency that the British Government should adopt UKIPâs policy of unconditional withdrawal.
Â Â  Mr President, before we go off on the summer break I wanted to talk about a problem that has arisen in my country.
The problem is that, after nine years of refusing to sign a border agreement with Estonia, Russia finally did so last month, but the Estonian Parliament, following typical parliamentary procedure, added a unilateral non-binding declaration saying that the legal continuity of the State is enforced even when territory is given up.
The Russians have now said they are going to withdraw from the border treaty. This is a problem not just for Estonia but for Europe as well, because the border between Estonia and Russia is also the border between Europe and Russia.
Since everyone is about to go off on vacation and the Council will not be dealing with this until September, I thought it would be appropriate to raise the issue at this point.
Â Â  Mr President, the way Members of this House are treated at European summits has for years been a cause of annoyance, and this last summit in Brussels was no exception.
The simple fact is that the bunker mentality in the Justus Lipsius building is so pronounced that nobody â not even the media â can make contact with the representatives of the people.
A number of passes were issued to us.
I heard that three chauffeurs got passes, whilst three Committee chairmen â of the Committees on the Budget, Citizensâ Freedoms and Constitutional Affairs â could not get in at all.
I would ask you to devise a system for future summits enabling representatives from this House to get access to these events.
Â Â  We shall review the system we are using in a manner that is satisfactory to everybody, but the number of passes is limited by the Council.
The Presidency distributes those available amongst the political groups.
We shall examine the issue in light of what you have said in your speech.
Â Â  I wish to inform this House that during this week the Maltese Parliament will be adopting a resolution to ratify the European Constitutional Treaty.
By this vote, which is expected to be unanimous, Malta will be aligning itself with the eleven other countries that have already ratified the European Constitution.
For Malta, though, the ratification of the European Constitution has a very particular meaning, as this will be the first time that the two major parties in Malta will have joined together in voting the same way on an EU issue.
After fifteen years in which Malta has been divided by the issue of the European Union, and by whether or not it should become a member, this week will at last see this division healed as soon as both sides of the Maltese Parliament vote in favour of the European Constitution.
In this way the European Constitution means, for Malta, not only a step towards European unity, but also a new chapter of national consensus in Malta about Europe.
Thank you.
Â Â  That concludes this item.
Â Â  The next item is the report (A6-0210/2005) by Mrs Wallis on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Mr Bossi (2004/2101(IMM)).
Â Â  Mr President, we are dealing here with four cases referred to us by the Italian authorities concerning the immunity of MrÂ Umberto Bossi and whether this House should lift that immunity or not.
The Committee on Legal Affairs has considered these four cases over a long period of time and is now in a position to make recommendations to the House.
Parliamentary immunity is of course a matter for this Parliament, it is not for us as Members.
It is to protect the institution as we carry out its proper work and it is therefore a very serious matter.
With regard to Mr Bossiâs cases, I will approach them separately with reference to the name of the court from which they have been referred.
First of all, there is one case which I think provided us with very little difficulty or discussion.
That is referred from the Milan court.
It refers to an incident where MrÂ Bossi actually used physical violence.
In that particular instance, we felt, as a committee, that this was not a proper instance for us to be, as it were, protecting immunity.
If a Member uses force or violence, then that is not something that is a proper carrying-out of the duties of this House and therefore we were unanimous that the immunity should be lifted in that case.
There then follow two other cases which are perhaps more difficult and more complicated to get to grips with.
