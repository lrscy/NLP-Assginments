Why should Bulgaria increase its greenhouse gas emissions when it has an alternative which has been found to be safe?
(FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, he who speaks here of Finlandisation may be thinking of himself.
It may be a long journey for him to get to Finland's level in terms of democracy and its economy, because we are at the forefront of Europe.
(Applause)
This has come about through hard work.
Come, follow us!
The themes at Lahti are investment and innovation. They are Finland's priorities too.
The Union's level of investment in research and development is totally inadequate.
The Barcelona objectives have been achieved by just two countries: one of them is Finland, the other Sweden.
I am ashamed of the short-sightedness of Europe's leaders.
Europe is in a constitutional crisis and spiritually powerless at the same time.
We are just not coping in many areas because our investment in research lags behind that of our competitors, and soon the East will catch us up.
Out of this fragmented scientific arena we urgently need to build an efficient, straightforward and high-level European area of research. Through cooperation and collaboration we will succeed.
We will be an area where the sun is setting unless we put innovation quickly into practice.
As far as the founding of a European Institute of Technology is concerned, the project lacks money and direction.
As rapporteur, my own opinion is: let there be innovation and the transfer of innovation into practical realisation; then our standard of living will improve.
We regard Russia as a strategic partner, and we will renew the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement.
The shocking murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaja does not sit well with the Russia which we are hoping will become a better partner for the European Union.
She fought against corruption and violence; even the country's government says she did.
Why was Politkovskaja not given protection?
Everyone knew about the death threats.
This serious matter needs to be raised at Lahti.
Europe is becoming more and more dependent on imports of energy. Dependence is growing at a phenomenal rate.
As our problem is security of supply, and Russia has a problem with good customers - that is, a problem securing long-term agreements which can help the country invest in the energy infrastructure - I propose a solution where we strike a major deal and address both these issues at the same time.
That way, the markets will open up both in Russia and the European Union under the same rules; that is, an energy agreement will be ratified in the same package.
This way, we will create energy security for both parties and, obviously, especially for ourselves.
(FI) Ladies and gentlemen, Russia's energy resources and our desire to secure deliveries of oil and gas must not be allowed to blur our vision when it comes to the worsening state of democracy and civil rights in Russia.
Civil society is in dire circumstances there.
Following the murder of Anna Politkovskaja, this should at last be obvious to everyone.
Human rights violations, assaults and even murder do not just target political opposition but also minority nationalities, dozens of which exist in Russia.
The Mari Nation is one, and the European Parliament has also turned its attention to the outrages it has experienced.
The conflicts relating to nationality are also connected with Anna Politkovskaja's murder.
She was murdered because she told the truth about what is happening in Chechnya.
On the very next day after the murder, thousands of Finns gathered in front of the Russian embassy for a candlelit demonstration, the like of which had never been seen before.
I hope that the Finnish Government, as the country to hold the Presidency of the EU Council of Ministers, will express to Russia just as clearly its shock and the concern that we feel.
Human rights must be at the core of Russian relations.
in writing. - (SV) Madam President, next week's Lahti Summit will deal with the issue of a common energy policy.
This is another example of the fixity of purpose with which the political establishment, for purposes concerned purely with political power, exploits a variety of social problems in order to promote the EU's positions.
In reality, there is very little reason to conduct energy policy at EU level.
We are at a stage in history when it is beginning to appear quite certain that the emissions of greenhouse gases resulting from human combustion of carbon and hydrocarbons are causing climate change.
We need to find ways of resolving this situation.
Yet no one in a position of power in the EU is able to decide which types of energy we should choose in order to secure a sustainable energy supply for the future.
What is more, the requirements of the different countries vary widely.
Certain countries have the greatest possible interest in finding methods of separating and storing carbon dioxide from the combustion of coal and oil.
Some countries are prepared to allow themselves to become dependent on natural gas from Russia, while others would rather pin their hopes on nuclear power, water power, wind and wave power, biomass or geothermal energy.
There are various ways by which all of them can reduce their energy consumption.
In so doing, countries must be free to experiment and try out a variety of routes.
It is through such institutional competition between countries that progress occurs.
The idea of the EU prescribing how much of each type of energy is to be used is an absurd notion that is dangerous for the future of Europe.
Madam President, I am very happy that the President-in-Office has confirmed that discussions at Lahti will centre on the whole question of energy.
Like the last speaker, Mr Lundgren, I hope that climate change will also be a core part of these discussions.
The protection of the citizen and his or her environment needs to be put at the centre of energy policy.
Climate change and its possible repercussions, air pollution in cities, the deterioration of the urban environment and all the other pollution nuisances of which we are aware have a strong impact on our citizens in their everyday lives in economic, social and health terms.
We know that the planet is now 0.6oC warmer today than it was a hundred years ago.
We know that by 2020 our environment will have warmed up by another 0.8oC.
That global warming will lead to extraordinary weather conditions such as storms, extra rain and floods.
We hear from the experts that water levels could rise by up to a metre.
If that happens, countries like Bangladesh and - nearer to home - the Netherlands will face catastrophe.
This is how important it is.
Last winter we witnessed a crisis in Ukraine - who will witness another crisis this evening when they play Scotland at football! - and we saw the first interruption in our gas supplies for 40 years.
We get 22% of our gas from Russia, and this is a dangerous position for the EU to be in because, following that crisis last year, we discovered that some of the newer Member States only had 24 hours of reserve supplies.
As Mr Barroso said on the subject of immigration, in terms of energy we cannot go on with 25 - soon to be 27 - disparate and completely separate energy policies.
We have to centralise and have a coherent energy policy run from the centre.
(Applause)
(FR) Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the most recent summits in Tampere and Luxembourg again showed the limits of European immigration policy and the limits of solidarity amongst European governments.
We therefore hope that you will be able, in Lahti, to at last tackle the underlying causes of immigration.
If we want to have fewer people arriving on our southern borders, the answer is not, and never will be, to increase patrols and speed up return flights.
I have met these immigration applicants: all the hope of their family and of their village rests on them and some of them would prefer death to failure.
Combating illegal immigration, therefore, does not mean condemning these victims by sending them back to a destiny from which they were trying to escape; it means targeting the people who organise the trafficking, who deceive people by holding out the prospect of a better future in Europe, and targeting those who exploit them in Europe.
Should we not also make European policy on visas more flexible?
That is the way to fight against clandestine activity.
If it is true that we need workers, we need people with rights, not slaves.
We have to accept that regularisations may be necessary in order to fight against the exploiters.
Trafficking in human beings can only be combated effectively if we take action against undeclared employment and the exploitation of migrants in our own countries.
We also have to admit that we have been paying for Africa for a long time, we have to admit that our codevelopment policies have not been fair, and we have to allow for massive development of poor countries.
Until now Europe has been happy just to make declarations of good intentions.
We have to invest massively in these countries and also help to create public services that are accessible to everyone and to set up businesses that will pay their employees fairly, which, it has to be said, is not always the case at present.
Workers are often exploited by European businesses in their own country and that, I repeat, is something that we must not be afraid to say.
Finally, our Member States have to realise that we must work together and that we will not be able to really do anything by each keeping ourselves to ourselves.
Let us go beyond our national selfishness which is leading straight into disaster.
Madam President, well, here we go again: another Heads of State Summit, another discussion about our competitiveness - or, should I say, lack of competitiveness - and another complete waste of time!
We have been here before haven't we?
Do you remember, in March 2000, the Lisbon Agenda?
I sat here and I heard this wonderful pronouncement that the EU was going to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.
It is not going very well, is it, Mr Barroso?
I do not think you are going to meet those targets in the course of the next three and a half years!
And then we heard it last summer, when Mr Blair came here.
He stood up and told us that we had to face the challenge of globalisation, and we could only do that if Europe became competitive, if we started to invest more money in research and development.
And, of course, nothing has happened again.
If you really want to improve competitiveness, then what you will do this weekend is look at the 91 000 pages of close-type legislation that make up the acquis communautaire and decide to get rid of a substantial chunk of it.
If you were serious about making Europe competitive, if you were serious about moving into the modern world, that is what you would do.
I am amused that Denmark is to be the economic study for the weekend. Well, I understand that, because they have got the highest rate of employment in the European Union.
I wonder whether that is because they have got their own currency - they are able to manage their own fiscal and monetary policy.
In fact, unemployment figures outside the eurozone are half those inside the eurozone.
So the real conclusion this weekend is that we should be doing far less at European level, because everything the EU touches turns to disaster.
(PL) Madam President, the meeting between our leaders and President Putin will be an opportunity to raise the issue of secure energy supplies, and to express our extreme - and I repeat our extreme - concern at the state of Russian democracy and respect for human rights.
Too many times our politicians have buried their heads in the sand, and too many times they have accepted meaningless explanations from the Russian side, until finally the conscience of Russian journalism, Anna Politkovskaya, was brutally murdered by shots to the head, like Galina Starovoytova before her.
These two victims mark the beginning and the end of the process of the retreat from democracy in Russia.
Mrs Starovoytova's death in 1998 marked the beginning of the retreat from democratic standards in that country, because she was a symbolic figurehead, the leader of the St Petersburg democrats.
The murder of Mrs Politkovskaya is a blow to what remains of the free press in Russia.
Whoever ordered the killing knew that the victim was a person of unyielding character, a symbol of truth and independent journalism.
I did not know Anna Politkovskaya personally, although I did have the pleasure of working with Galina Starovoytova, and always admired her courage.
For this reason, in view of their sacrifice, and before we feel the effects of Russia's retreat from democracy on our own heads, I appeal for respect for human rights and civil freedoms in Russia to be made a condition of further political dialogue with that country.
(PT) Madam President, there are some very important issues on the Lahti agenda such as energy policy, illegal immigration, competitiveness and innovation.
It is inevitable, however, that the issue of freedom of the press should also be addressed.
Democracy, freedom and human rights are essential issues at a summit of this importance, due to be attended by President Putin at a time when the murder of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya is uppermost in our minds.
The European Council must call on President Putin to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.
At a time when Europe is facing the effects of climate change and rising oil prices, energy efficiency must, as a matter of urgency, be stepped up.
Furthermore, dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced to help the economy, the environment and the quality of life of Europe's citizens.
The EU must diversify the sources and suppliers of its energy and must prioritise renewable energy so as to honour its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.
The idea of linking innovation to competitiveness makes perfect sense for the Finnish Presidency and for my country, Portugal.
Harnessing innovation to boost competitiveness is one of the approaches of the Lisbon Strategy put forward by the Portuguese Presidency in 2000.
Eight examples of best practice, selected by the European authorities, were presented a few days ago at the first meeting of the national coordinators of the Lisbon Agenda.
Portugal deserves praise for the Company in One Hour project.
Mr President, the murder of Anna Politkovskaya is a threefold tragedy.
It is personal - a tragedy for her family - but it is also a tragedy for Russian society, because it is a sign of an emerging development in that large country, and it is a tragedy for democracy, because it was a murder of an important democratic element in Russia.
It was a step down the ladder which is weakening democracy in that country.
It was said earlier here today that we should be realistic about democracy in Russia.
I do not know what the speaker really meant, but let us indeed be realistic about democracy in Russia: if we do not stand up for democracy in Russia, we will leave people like Anna Politkovskaya and thousands of others on their own.
If we do not stand up for democracy and the rule of law in Russia, we will not strengthen the forces in Russia that can make Russia a better country and a better partner.
Not standing up for democracy will not make Russia a better partner in energy policy or in any other area.
(Applause)
Not calling for democracy and the rule of law does not make Russia a better society.
Russia will be a credible energy partner only when democracy is stronger and when the rule of law is stabilised.
That is what it means to be realistic about democracy in Russia, and let that be stated here today.
Mr Barroso, some of the competences we have in the European Union - the internal market for energy policy, the trans-European networks, competition rules and trade policy - are the instruments that we must use with relation not only to Russia but also to other parts of the world.
They are the best basis for the future energy policy of the European Union.
Let us use them and let us go forward step by step.
(PL) Mr President, the European Union must face up to the political, economic and cultural challenges of recent times.
Firstly, the time has come to form a common European energy policy consisting of measures on the scale of the European policy on heavy industry after World War II.
Secondly, the European Union must give a unified response to the problems of mass illegal immigration of people from all over the world, which is having a considerable impact on some countries.
Finally, we have to achieve a real breakthrough in developing scientific research, new technologies, competitiveness and economic innovation within the Member States.
In Europe we are currently in need of courage, vision and a forward-looking strategy.
We need to deepen integration and achieve a truly common and unified policy in these three areas.
I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that President Putin was invited to the summit in Lahti, and at the efforts to forge a strategic partnership with Russia.
At the same time, however, our agreement with Russia should not be pursued at the cost of tolerating violations of human rights and media freedom.
Russia is a land of immeasurable mineral wealth, but above all it is a land of people such as the murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist whose courage and honesty is a symbol of civic Russia, and whose activities should become a symbol and an inspiration for the whole of Europe.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I find today's debate on the one hand a sobering experience, but am also, on the other, refreshed and reinvigorated by it.
Many of those who have spoken in it have put forward factual analyses, have set the right goals and have told hard-hitting truths, but what comes next?
What action shall we now take?
Confidence is built not by analysis on its own, but only by action.
There are three messages I want to give the President of the Council to take with him to the Summit.
The first is that, if he has listened to us, he will have heard us telling him not to treat his talks with Vladimir Putin as just 'business as usual', not to reduce the summit to a meeting about energy policy, but instead, also to talk about all the things that have been mentioned today.
Secondly, we urge him to put before us a timetable detailing when we can expect to have the EU internal market in energy of which President Barroso spoke, and thirdly, we want him to give us a timetable for when the European Union will become a research area.
Turning to energy policy, the partnership with Russia is only a part of the energy policy that Europe needs.
Our priority is greater independence where energy is concerned.
We favour above all the prioritisation of research on the reduction of energy consumption and the creation of sources of renewable energy, and that is our great contribution to more innovation.
We urge you to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in innovation and enable their representatives to take part in the tripartite dialogue.
Do not forgot how this year started with the reduction of gas supplies to Ukraine, nor that the most recent major event in Russia was the murder of a critical journalist, which attracted far more public attention than the many similar murders that preceded it.
I want to focus my remarks on one of the key topics for the summit: innovation.
I notice that not many speakers have talked about it today.
I just want to encourage both the President-in-Office and President Barroso to make sure that this remains at the heart of the discussions.
As you pointed out, President Barroso, there could not be a better place than Finland to have that discussion.
I was pleased that in both your speeches you talked about the main competition coming from China, India and the other Asian economies.
We have to start looking outside and to start building on the real strengths of our technology.
One of the things I particularly want to appeal to you to promote in your summit - something with which to engage Europe's leaders - is to energise and use the power of public authorities.
They are spending billions of euros of public money on developing new services, but I do not think that many of them are thinking about how they use that money to generate innovation and to push forward the new products and services that European industry and companies are willing to provide.
Let us take Nokia as a good example, because you will be in Finland, the home of Nokia, for your summit.
Wireless networks, wireless innovation, wireless services: these are the sort of things that we should be developing for health, for education, for raising the quality of public services, for transforming the quality of experience the citizens have in interacting with us.
That is something that I would like you to put firmly on your agenda with the European leaders, because if we can achieve that we will make some serious moves forward.
We know that other countries are doing that, particularly the United States.
In conclusion, I notice, President Barroso, that we see your European institute of technology on the agenda.
I hope you will convince us that it is a worthwhile investment.
I am not yet convinced, because I think many universities are already doing what you want to do - it is a lot of money.
Let us put innovation at the heart of what we do at the summit, and I hope that you will give it the importance that it deserves.
(PL) Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the statements of my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the situation of democracy in Russia, and I do not wish to repeat their arguments, to which I give my full support.
I would like to raise two other questions, and to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for preparing two items for the informal summit in Lahti, namely energy and innovation.
In energy we need a common policy, both within the European Union, to establish a common energy market, and outside it, for example joint European negotiations with the partners who supply our oil and gas.
This is extremely important.
We need to ensure that there is no repetition of the situation where one Member State's negotiations, for example, concerning supplies of oil or gas from Russia, place other Member States in an extremely unfavourable position.
It is extremely important that we approach our common energy policy in this way: this will be a major step towards creating a common foreign policy.
There is, however, another aspect to our external policy regarding energy: Ukraine's pipelines are currently in a bad state of repair, and they are the last route for energy supplies from the east which is independent of Gazprom.
It is important that we invest in these pipelines, and that we make every effort to secure the funds necessary for such an investment.
On the issue of innovation, I would like to raise just three points.
In the first place, we need a responsible economic policy whereby innovation is adopted by industry, which we do not have on our continent.
And that means an economic strategy.
The second point is the issue of a European patent: we need to have our own European patent.
Thirdly I believe there is a need for a European Institute of Technology which will serve innovation.
I personally support Mr Barroso's idea and believe that we now have the opportunity to finally sort things out.
(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mrs LehtomÃ€ki, I very much welcome the communication on innovation that the Commission will be publishing next week.
It represents one of the first serious attempts at drawing up an EU strategy for the positioning of Europe in the context of globalisation, and so I believe that it will be the most important item on the agenda at the informal meeting in Lahti.
Innovation is, in particular, characteristic of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the communication takes that fact into account.
As the Minister has said, innovation calls for European standards, and there are many fields in which much remains to be done on that front.
For that to happen, we need - as you yourself said, Mr President of the Commission - to spend more on research and investment.
Much as I rejoice in Finland's good example, I also have to point out that my own region, Baden-WÃŒrttemberg, spends 3.6% of its gross domestic product per annum on research and development, which is a good deal more than either the USA or Japan do.
We also need more confidence in our own abilities, and that is at the heart of this communication.
We have to say more about what we in Europe will, together, be able to achieve once our structures have been revised, even in a globalised world.
We have an outstanding internal market, which - while we do have to further extend it - does nonetheless offer us protection.
We do need more self-confidence in our dealings with Russia and China, but we also need to know where, within the European Union, we need to undertake reforms in order to remain competitive, and the innovation strategy offers an excellent basis for that.
It has also been said that a more innovative approach to the award of public contracts is needed, and examples of what is meant by this have been given.
These things are already being done in my region.
I believe that there are some splendid possibilities for putting Europe in a better position to cope with globalisation, and I also believe that this informal summit in Lahti should help to develop - perhaps in the coming year - a globalisation strategy for the European Union that will enable us to convince the public that this Europe of ours has a chance in a globalised world.
(LT) Mr President, we must have clarity, here in Brussels, when speaking about Lahti.
The beginning of today's session revealed how disunited, polarised and easily manipulated we are.
The European Parliament appeared to be unable to react immediately, with a joint document, to a terrible crime in Moscow, so as not to disturb the Russian president touring Europe.
This is just one more indication that the European Union does not have its own European policy in respect of Russia, and that we, in Europe, implement only a pro-Russian policy in this respect.
The cajoling of leaders does a disservice to Russia if anybody is still to believe that Russia could become a European country rather than Europe becoming a political annex to undemocratic Russia.
We are only talking about Europe's united Energy Strategy, but we are closing our eyes to the fact that Russia will never allow this to happen as it already has its Trojan horse in the middle of Europe.
The supporters of Mr Schroeder and others suffering from political blindness will continue to destroy a united Europe.
Unfortunately, here in Parliament we have only one option - to talk openly about the deliberate moral surrender of influential Europeans.
The Russian president is the one who is absolutely open when he says that European values are unsuitable for his Russia and his regime.
According to Russian politicians, Europe can simply throw out its Energy Charter together with the Human Rights Charter, since Europe will sign anything dictated by Russia anyway.
This was voiced in Sochi and on various other occasions.
Such is the real partnership and the common space.
This is the common space where journalists are murdered and we do not dare to question if this common space is for us.
We nevertheless get irritated about North Korea and Iraq, instead of simply recognising that both buttons, the one in Teheran and the other in Pyongyang, are pressed by the same player somewhere in between.
We should at least try to understand that Anna Politkovskaya, the last brave journalist, was murdered not only by Putin's Russia, but by conformist Europe as well.
(Applause)
(PL) Mr President, it is appalling that the road to civil freedom and respect for fundamental human rights needs to be paved with the killing of innocent people.
Today we are discussing the murder of Mrs Politkovskaya, the woman who unflinchingly exposed the crimes committed against the Chechen people by the Russians.
But let us remember that, before her, others lost their lives in the struggle against dictators, for example the Ukrainian journalist Mr Gongadze or the Lebanese journalist Mr Kassir.
In these cases, did the state do everything to protect those who exposed the connection between public structures and criminals?
Or did hatred for their uncompromising behaviour and their writing lead to a closing of eyes, to a washing of Pilate's hands, to the indifference of the state to their fate and the threat of death that hung over their heads?
Russia has always produced great figures who have swum against the tide of dictatorship and risked their lives to expose the crimes and iniquities of their governments.
We only need to think of such names as Kravchenko, Bukovsky, Sakharov or Solzhenitsyn.
Should we as citizens of the free world always abandon these people to their fate?
No, we did not support Mrs Politkovskaya enough during her lifetime.
Let us support her after her death.
I believe that the investigation into this crime should be conducted under international supervision, as happened in the case of the murder of Lebanon's prime minister Rafik Hariri.
I cannot imagine the European Union signing a cooperation agreement with Moscow without this crime being investigated, and without those who ordered it and who carried it out being put on trial.
The European Union should either give priority to commitments to freedom and civil and human rights, or to economic and energy interests.
Mr President, the hour of truth has come.
We must be uncompromising.
We owe it to the murdered journalist.
(MT) Mr President, I hope that next week's summit will discuss the letter sent to the Finnish Presidency by no less than eight Heads of Government, who wrote to you about illegal immigration.
Although summer is over, and one now expects the flow to abate, it is common knowledge that we had a crisis, and that it is still there.
If we remain passive, we will be facing even greater problems next year.
I must say that during the last few days we witnessed the first concrete steps in our bid to convince European countries to tackle the problem of illegal immigration in unison.
Firstly, last week saw the start of patrols in the Mediterranean.
I can see Mr Frattini here, whose role I wish to acknowledge.
I hope that these Mediterranean patrols send out a clear message that the Mediterranean is not an open sea, free for all, where organised crime ferries immigrants to Europe unimpeded.
Secondly, we took a vote in the Committee on Budgets whereby we increased substantially the budget for the Frontex Agency to almost EUR 35 million, so that it can strengthen its operations at our external borders.
I hope the Council is willing to support us, rather than reducing the budget for Frontex as it has already tried to do.
How can the Council say it is conducting the struggle against illegal immigration in a serious manner, if, at the same time, it allows European governments to act in a niggardly manner and try to reduce the budget in this area rather than increase it?
Thirdly, it appears that agreement will be reached this week about the four European immigration-related funds, which will operate as from next January.
I am satisfied with the adoption of measures such as the emergency clause, which enables the European Union to extend immediate financial help in emergency situations.
Much remains to be done, if we want people to feel that Europe is indeed taking into consideration their feelings about illegal immigration.
Parliament has spoken and so has the Commission.
The Council is now expected to do its part.
Thank you.
Mr President, listening to Mr Landsbergis's football fan club giving him applause, I hope the fan club of the Finnish national team in a European state called Kazakhstan is as strong as his, because we are 25 minutes into the match and it is still 0-0, so we need a little bit of help!
First of all I support the Finnish Presidency and its agenda for Lahti.
With regard to external energy, you know what you need to do: you need to thank Mr Putin for the fact that it is actually on the agenda, because at about this time last year he was squeezing the Ukrainian pipelines a little bit and that is the reason we are actually talking about it in Lahti.
So give him a big thank-you when he gets there.
Second, with regard to innovation, this is not product placement but the truth is that we spend about EUR 4 billion a year on innovation and research and development.
That is less than Nokia spends on research and development per year.
I hope that makes the leaders of the European Council think.
My third point relates to EU-Russia relations.
It is funny to listen to the debate here, apart from the murder case, of course.
Sometimes it seems to me that we are much quicker to criticise the United States than we are Russia, and perhaps in the latest case we should deal with Russia as a superpower much like the United States.
I want to support the President of the Commission very strongly on EIT.
I think there are a lot of misunderstandings around the concept.
It is a network which I think would work quite well.
Everyone agrees on the problem, now it is a question of how we are going to find a solution.
I think we need public and private partnerships, much like the MIT in the United States.
In that sense I hope that this initiative of yours will go through.
Finally, the problem with informal European Councils is that you usually get very few practical things out of them.
President-in-Office, if you come out of that meeting with three things, I think it will have been a success.
One: a green light for the EIT; two: some patent legislation, or at least a promise to have it; and three: a common energy policy.
If you do not get these results I think future informal European Councils will be as empty as this Chamber is today.
Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its valuable contribution during this discussion today.
I can assure you that I will convey the message to the Prime Minister for him to look at during the preparations for the Lahti Summit.
It is of course true that innovation and competitiveness have been on the European agenda for some time, but it is now our aim to turn this discussion into action, at least to open the door to the way forward.
Action is what is really needed at the moment.
In the framework of the strategic partnership that we have with Russia, all the issues can and will be discussed.
I am sure that the very important points you have raised during this discussion will also be discussed during the meetings.
I am very happy that you will have an opportunity to continue the discussion on the results of the Lahti Summit with the Prime Minister of Finland later this month, on 25 October in Strasbourg.
I thank you very much and look forward to having some 'deliverables' from the Lahti Summit.
Mr President, first of all let me welcome the broad support that was given for the agenda for innovation, for a European institute of technology, for a common energy policy and for a European immigration policy.
But let me tell you that we need to deliver that message outside this room, because, as some of you said, there are still some misunderstandings.
Let me just mention the EIT.
It is interesting that everybody agrees that in Europe we are not doing enough in terms of innovation; there are not enough links between the universities and the research centres and the world of the economy, business and practical projects.
But when an idea comes to change that situation, immediately there is resistance.
It is amazing!
Everybody then says, 'but we have excellent universities!' - of course we have excellent universities!
But if we have excellent universities, why are we falling behind the Americans and others?
Something is wrong.
The status quo is not an option.
We cannot go on with business as usual.
I know we have excellent universities.
Universities were created in Europe.
They are a European creation, but we are not taking advantage of the full benefits or the full potential of our European dimension.
Let us be frank: some of our universities are still very corporatist, very closed.
We need a European dimension.
Even the biggest Member States lack the dimension to promote the global culture we need now to face the challenges of this 21st century.
Therefore, the idea is network-based.
It is not a huge bureaucratic institution; it is network-based, building on the principles of excellence, on what all excellent universities and excellent research centres are doing, but with a view to connecting businesses with research so that we can promote innovation.
At the Commission I met with the leaders of the most important European companies that are driving research in the world.
I got great support for the idea and I could name some of the companies.
Two of those leaders in European business came from the United States, and they told me at the meeting that their biggest shock when they came to Europe was to discover that, unlike in the United States where they have American institutions for the whole of America, in Europe we do not have that.
Only now are we starting with the European Research Council.
So we have great institutions to promote research in Germany, Britain, France and Sweden.
We have great things, but we are missing a European dimension.
We are missing a European mission to give them the real tools they need to compete with the best.
That is why I believe this is a great idea.
I hope that, not only will it be supported in general, but that it will be supported when we come forward with practical proposals.
That is why I hope to have your support when we come forward next week with a practical proposal on the EIT, and I hope for your support when in January we come forward with a really ambitious energy package.
My final point concerns coherence.
The best way to negotiate with Russia is from a coherent and unified position.
If we want to be credible when we discuss matters with Russia or other partners, we have to show them that we are able to have a coherent policy ourselves.
We cannot discuss energy with them in a serious manner if we have 25 different energy policies.
It would not be credible, let's face it.
The first thing to do if we want to be seen from outside as credible, is to put our own house in order and to have a real joint approach to energy.
The same, of course, applies to other issues.
But I strongly agree that the fight against climate change is a crucial element in our energy policy and we should recall that the European Union is a key player in that field.
We are, in fact, leading in the world.
I can tell you that when we discuss this matter with our American friends, with our Russian partners, or with the Chinese or Indians, we always put this question at the forefront of our negotiations.
It is important to do what we can, but also to involve others in those efforts.
But what all these issues show - from innovation to immigration, to energy, to the fight against climate change - is a strong argument for Europe.
In the age of globalisation, even the biggest Member States do not have the means to tackle those challenges.
So if you want a strong Europe, we are going in the right direction.
A strong Europe is not bureaucratic, but has a common approach to those issues.
We should also speak with one voice on human rights, and I hope that this is the message which comes out from Lahti: the European leaders may come from different political and ideological backgrounds, from different national situations, but they are ready to build a strong Europe together and they are ready to speak with one voice to the outside world.
That is what I am hoping for from Lahti.
That concludes the debate.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(PT) Quite apart from important international issues, the next European Council is set to include the so-called 'innovation policy', the proposed 'common energy policy', and 'illegal immigration', issues for which working documents have yet to be tabled.
We shall return to these issues in due course.
Apparently, two debates have been left off the agenda: one on our 'functional' or 'assimilation-related' 'absorption capacities', that is to say the enlargement to include Croatia and Turkey, and the other on the so-called institutional reform (the composition of the Commission and Parliament, and the Council's decision-making process).
This debate concerns setting the rules of the game, which are always imposed by, and in the interests of, the major EU powers.
Another debate absent from the agenda concerns the attempts to (re)impose the so-called 'European Constitution', which has already been rejected.
Hitherto, and despite numerous attempts to do so, there is still disagreement over what can now be done to resurrect the, revamped or otherwise, 'European Constitution'.
Yet its proponents reflect, prepare the ground and set up think tanks while they wait for the French elections and the German Presidency, with the latter expected to present the (pseudo) 'way forward'.
The more they dither, the less the workers and the people are aware of the real significance and primary objectives of the EU.
Use of passenger data (PNR) (debate)
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the use of passenger data (PNR).
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, talks on releasing passenger data to the United States of America were brought to a conclusion last week.
The outcome of the talks helped to avoid a state of non-agreement between the EU and the United States, which is very important.
The Presidency has received a letter dated yesterday from Sophia in 't Veld, the European Parliament's rapporteur for the PNR report, and we shall return to the questions raised in it in more detail in writing as soon as possible.
In the negotiations, we agreed on a new temporary PNR agreement.
Its purpose is to replace the earlier agreement made in 2004, which the Court of Justice of the European Communities overturned in its judgment last May.
The negotiations were tough, as the annulment of the earlier agreement threatened to push the EU and the United States into a state of total non-agreement.
Despite the difficulties, the negotiations mandate given by the Council in June 2006 was adhered to.
The new arrangement will guarantee both the level of protection of personal data under the former agreement and the continuation of transatlantic air traffic.
The arrangement therefore makes it possible for passenger data to be released to the US authorities in the future, at the same time guaranteeing an adequate level of data protection when the information is being processed, in accordance with the commitments given previously by the US Customs and Border Protection.
The Committee of Permanent Representatives followed the progress of the talks closely and discussed the outcome and its content on 6 October.
Coreper said that it was in favour of signing the text of the negotiations.
The outcome of the talks was reported to the Ministers of Justice in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which began immediately after Coreper.
The temporary agreement which resulted from the negotiations will apply after it has been signed.
Coreper will sign it for the EU tomorrow, and the intention is that the Council should grant the authority to sign as soon as possible.
The temporary agreement will remain in force until the end of July 2007.
During this time, the parties intend to agree on a more permanent arrangement for releasing PNR data.
The aim is to start these talks as soon as possible.
It took some hard negotiation to reach agreement.
The United States wanted to change the previous arrangement so that it would accord better with an altered operational environment.
The biggest challenge in the negotiations was how to respond to the changes that had occurred since 2004 in US legislation and the organisation of the administration while at the same time maintaining the principles relating to standards of data protection for Europeans.
In addition to the text of the agreement itself, the talks also covered a letter by US negotiators addressed to the Commission and the Presidency which discusses the interpretation of the commitments made regarding the use of PNR data.
The EU will take the letter into consideration, but it will not become a part of the agreement.
The outcome of the talks is a success for many reasons.
Firstly, the temporary arrangement aims at ensuring the security of air passengers.
This is vitally important.
Secondly, I wish to stress that the commitments on the use of PNR data given previously by the US administration will continue to apply.
The aim is to guarantee the same level of data protection for citizens' PNR data as with the previous system.
The agreement contains a provision which states that the US Department of Homeland Security should be seen to guarantee adequate protection for PNR data sent from the EU.
This relies specifically on the notion that the DHS will continue to comply with its commitments made in 2004.
Owing to the organisational changes in the US administration, under the new agreement the number of authorities with electronic access to PNR is greater than before.
These authorities have, however, been specified in the agreement.
Thirdly, I am glad that the release of PNR data under the new agreement is aimed at the same 34 fields of data as in the earlier arrangement.
Fourthly, the new agreement will guarantee the legal security of the public and that transatlantic flights will continue.
At the same time it will ensure that airlines are able to operate viably.
We have other good news for airlines.
During the negotiations, the United States undertook to test systems where airlines can themselves store PNR data on the databases of the US authorities, starting this year.
This has always been an important objective for us.
Talks on a more permanent PNR system to replace this temporary agreement in July 2007 are to commence in the near future.
We have also agreed that questions relating to the storage and destruction of data should only be resolved during these talks on the PNR system.
We shall therefore return to this matter very soon.
Mr President, I regret that I cannot stay here for this debate as I have to leave at 6.20 p.m. as agreed earlier with Parliament, and, unfortunately, my flight will not wait a minute longer.
Mr President, may I start by expressing my full agreement with the Presidency's positive assessment of the value of this agreement, which has a limited time-span - up to July 2007 - but has the prime advantage of guaranteeing juridical continuity in a very sensitive subject.
It also allows airlines to ensure fitting treatment of the personal data of EU nationals travelling to the United States without disrupting air traffic to and from that country.
This agreement forms part of a wider commitment.
I can of course say that, during the very complex negotiations that have been in progress, both the European institutions - the Presidency and the Commission - and the United States have confirmed their willingness to start straight away on a shared project.
This would cover a wider field and would thus include the reaffirmation of a common will, that of the EU and the United States, to work towards a definite agreement - the one that will enter into force after August 2007, replacing the present temporary one - and to cover the widest possible field of joint cooperation against terrorism, together with protection of the rights of the individual.
This is a much wider political perspective.
As I have emphasised on many other occasions, I consider it politically necessary that Parliament should be involved with it, even though the procedures will necessarily form part of the so-called 'third pillar', following the decision of the European Court of Justice.
It is clear that the contents of this agreement must be considered in more depth.
I already know that many honourable Members have studied it attentively.
I should like to make some brief comments.
Firstly, this agreement does not permit the exchange of a larger amount of data.
It permits the transmission of data to other agencies which are concerned with customs and border protection and complies entirely with comparable data protection regulations.
We are not looking at a change in the agreement because, as you know very well, we have clarified the meaning of the undertakings.
There was in fact a change after 2004 in the structure of the agencies, brought about by domestic United States legislation.
Previously, that is to say at the beginning of 2004, there was only the United States Customs and Border Protection.
Now, however, for example, we have a new interlocutor, namely the Department of Homeland Security, which we must take into account, at any rate in interpreting undertakings.
The agencies that I mentioned earlier also form part of this process, which is why it is impossible not to refer to them.
What is the distinguishing feature of this interpretation?
On the one hand we have to take note of the existence of various agencies; on the other we have established that United States Customs and Border Protection retains the same function as before, this agency - and only this agency - being the direct recipient of transferred data.
The other agencies can obtain the data that they require from this first agency on a case-by-case basis.
Thus this is not a matter of direct access to data on the part of other agencies; it is a transmission to other agencies in response to a request.
What would be the request that justified such a transmission?
As I have already said, the request would be made on a case-by-case basis.
We have specified that the concept 'case-by-case' means the indication either of a concrete threat or of a specific flight or flight-path for which information has been received that justifies the request for data.
Such a request for data would be justified solely by reasons relating to anti-terrorism investigation, as has happened previously; in this respect nothing has changed.
We have therefore specified that American agencies with an investigative remit other than anti-terrorism will not have access, not even on the basis of an indirect request.
The other element which is important in my opinion is, on the one hand, the impossibility of direct access and, on the other, the change in the modalities of accessing data.
Many honourable Members have in the past frequently emphasised the malfunctioning or the inadequate guarantees of the so-called 'pull' system: that is to say, the system that permits the user to extract data direct from databases.
We have in consequence requested that the system should be changed and replaced by a system of the 'push' type, as has been requested on numerous occasions by parliamentary authorities; this has been agreed.
The 'push' system means, as the work clearly indicates, that the data is not extracted but supplied on request.
It has been agreed that the new mechanism, as we have written in the covering letter to be sent by the United States, will come into operation no later than December 2006, that is within a month and a half at the latest.
The mechanism will be tested at the beginning to check its functioning, but in any case it will be operational - I repeat - by the end of this year.
A specific obligation has also been confirmed, namely - bearing in mind section 2 of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union - to respect the fundamental rights of the individual in the handling of personal data.
We have inserted a reference to that same Article 6, replacing the reference to a directive on data protection, because the European Court of Justice has established that that directive is not directly applicable in security matters.
An important reference to European legislation would therefore have been missing.
We have accordingly replaced it with a more general cross-reference - in my view, one that is still more binding - to Article 6 of the EU Treaty, where there is a reference to the fundamental rights of individuals.
To conclude, the US authorities have a commitment to continue to guarantee, also on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, an acceptable level of protection for the handling of data and therefore, obviously, the possibility of revising the application of this agreement, as has already been laid down in the earlier agreement.
The final aspect concerns confirmation of the data custody period, a subject that has not been broached.
It is true that there has been a request to keep data for longer than the period foreseen by the current or previous agreement.
The request came to nothing, firstly because the agreement will come to an end in July 2007 and, secondly, because we have taken the view that a subject as sensitive as the period of data retention could if necessary be a topic for later negotiations.
I can assure you that the Commission intends to set in train such negotiations in January 2007, so that they will be sufficiently far advanced by the end of July 2007 for a definitive agreement to be reached.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, only recently, some elements in this House celebrated the ruling of the European Court of Justice to the effect that the agreement between the EU and the United States on US access to airline passenger data was invalid on formal grounds.
The interim agreement that has now been concluded leaves the nature and scope of the information largely unchanged, however.
Admittedly, the United States no longer has automatic access to the data, instead having to request them from the airlines.
This represents a successful negotiation outcome, one for which I should like to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Frattini.
Nevertheless, the agreement that the European Court of Justice declared invalid clearly stipulated that the customs and border protection authorities were permitted to pass on these data only in exceptional cases.
Now, airline passenger data may be passed on, as required, to all the American authorities responsible for combating terrorism.
Passengers probably do not feel that this compromises their security - the opposite is more likely to be the case - but my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has a strong sense that, by referring the case to the Court of Justice, certain Members of this House have done us all a disservice, for one thing that must be recognised today is that the new agreement affords no greater data protection than the old one.
For this reason, I would plead that we continue to work to safeguard the high standards of data protection in Europe, including in the case of the transfer of airline passenger data.
While Parliament and the Commission should exert their influence on future negotiations to this end, we must also recognise that a sovereign state such as the United States will continue to exercise the right to lay down rules on who can enter its territory and on what conditions.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I wish to say, on behalf of my group, that we urgently needed to reach a new agreement with the United States.
It was not, indeed, possible to leave the airlines in the state of legal muddle in which they had been since 30 September and under the threat of severe sanctions if they did not transfer the required data.
We had to reach an agreement common to all the Member States of the European Union in order to guarantee an equivalent level of protection for each one.
We are nonetheless concerned about facilitating the transfer of this data.
The subsequent transfer of data to other agencies responsible for the fight against terrorism poses a problem if we do not also have the appropriate guarantees.
We are asking for European citizens to have the right to effective recourse to a judge in the event of abuse in the use of this data.
We expect the American authorities to put in place the guarantees of protection that we are asking for and which are included in the declarations of commitment.
We believe that it is necessary to involve national parliaments too.
Article 24 of the Treaty provides that the European Union is the contracting party.
That does not, however, prevent Member States from using a parliamentary ratification procedure.
Therefore, at the time of signing these judicial cooperation agreements with the United States, the Member States, with the exception of two of them, made a declaration stating that they would not be bound by these agreements until they had been ratified by their parliaments.
Can you confirm that the same applies to the agreement concerning the PNR data and, if so, when these ratifications are to be carried out?
It is a very precise question to which we would like to have an answer.
Finally, the negotiations for the new 2007 agreement must focus on defining a binding, global framework which guarantees the protection of security and of the fundamental rights of citizens.
We must not be shy of repeating that the European Parliament and the national parliaments must be involved.
It is, moreover, necessary to engage in an overall reflection on the protection of data relating to European citizens within the framework of transatlantic relations.
Indeed, a recent hearing on the company SWIFT revealed to us the potential conflicts between European law and American law and we must sort out these conflicts: it is our responsibility.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have the feeling that I have ended up in the wrong theatre play and I have the wrong script in front of me.
The President-in-Office and the Commissioner were talking about the agreement and you completely ignored the side letter from the Department of Homeland Security, which gives an interpretation of the agreement that goes in a completely different direction from what you have just said.
So I am afraid that I am unable to share the joy just expressed by the Presidency and the Commission.
I sent a letter - to which the President-in-Office just referred - with a number of questions.
I would very much like to get an answer to those questions, preferably during this sitting, or otherwise in writing.
For example, you said that there is no change in the number and the nature of the data and there is no change in the level of protection, but how do you then explain the part in the side letter from the Americans that says that, in addition to the purpose of fighting terrorism and related crimes, we will also collect the data to fight infectious disease and other risks?
I call that a considerable widening of the scope.
The sharing of data has been widened to include agencies which have not all been specified.
The Americans now say that they may not apply the agreed data-retention periods even to the data collected under the old agreement.
You said that we have agreed to move to a 'push system': I am sorry, but that is not what I read.
I read that the Americans will move to the 'push system' as soon as it is technically feasible.
Well, congratulations!
That was also part of the old agreement.
It has been technically feasible for more than a year and the Americans have simply refused to do it.
So how can you present it this way in a press conference?
I would also like to get an answer on the impact on other categories - the precedent that this agreement sets - for example, the bank account details as in the case of SWIFT, and the telecoms records, to which the Americans also have access.
Could somebody please reply to that?
I think we should look to the future, because unfortunately we need this agreement.
The only other option would have been no agreement, in which case the Member States would not have stood together in solidarity and would have moved ahead and concluded bilateral agreements with the Americans.
I think that for the future we need a strong and clear mandate.
Such a strong mandate requires the approval of the European Parliament for reasons of democratic legitimacy.
That is the only basis on which a new agreement can be concluded.
Therefore, I hope that the bridging clause will be adopted as soon as possible.
I know that you are our ally at least on that one.
(Applause)
(DE) Mr President, Mrs in 't Veld is not in the wrong play; this is about the defence of the rights of our citizens and the role of Parliament.
It is just that the staging is a little tired and the cast is less than brilliant.
Until the judgment of the European Court of Justice, what we were dealing with was the transfer of highly personal data on our citizens to a foreign country.
The judgment has revealed that this transfer of data was illegal - and not just on formal grounds, Mrs Klamt.
We passed on our citizens' data without any legal basis - or, put another way, illegally.
We are talking about a serious encroachment on fundamental rights without any legal basis.
There is nothing formal about that.
This should really make us think.
What is it, then, that we are dealing with today?
We are dealing with an agreement that represents a juridical continuation of this illegal transfer in the third pillar - that is to say, intergovernmental cooperation without the involvement of Parliament, without a public debate, outside the jurisdiction of the Court; without even the involvement of national parliaments, without ratification.
When Mrs Klamt says that the USA has the right to determine who it admits into its territory and on what conditions, I would reply that, up to now, we have agreed that considerations of human dignity, international law and human rights impose certain limits on this.
I really consider it an incredible absurdity when the Commission argues that we are passing on the data, but that the protection of our citizens' fundamental rights will remain, as the USA has promised to guarantee the same level of data protection as we enjoy in Europe.
Do we, then, together with the Americans, now constitute a single superstate?
Do fundamental-rights considerations not forbid us to transfer our citizens' data to foreign countries regardless of the level of data protection in force there?
Do fundamental-rights considerations not forbid airlines to transfer data even to our authorities where to do so would infringe these rights?
Personally, I have to say that the defence of the fundamental rights of European citizens indeed makes for a good play, but the cast and staging are dreadful.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs in 't Veld is right: the PNR agreement concluded last week is by no means cause for celebration.
Although the fact that we once more have an agreement, as opposed to no agreement, avoids legal uncertainty, nothing has been achieved, in essence, in terms of content.
On the contrary, the new agreement even falls short of the previous one.
This has been yet another instance of the EU kowtowing to Washington.
How else can one interpret the fact that PNR data are to be transmitted directly to the US Department of Homeland Security?
The real scandal is the fact that, in future, this all-powerful US authority will be able to routinely transmit data on European airline passengers to all the US authorities active in the field of combating terrorism - which includes the CIA, and we all know what that is capable of.
I should just like to remind my fellow Members that this House set up a special committee because the CIA, in the process of 'combating terrorism', was taking it upon itself to kidnap and torture Europeans, among them the German citizen Khaled El Masri.
In the light of this, are we to believe that this notorious secret service will not do as it pleases with airline passenger data on our citizens?
The new agreement, too - despite Parliament's demands to the contrary - fails to afford EU citizens even the same means of legal protection as it does American airline passengers.
EU citizens will not have equivalent means of legal redress to defend themselves against the processing of incorrect data or against the abuse of their data.
Why was it not possible to make the regulations that apply to US citizens applicable to EU citizens, too - as is the case, for example, with the agreement between the EC and Canada?
The PNR agreement does not afford sufficient protection of EC citizens' right of self-determination over their personal data, and my group considers this unacceptable.
The only ray of hope may be the envisaged change of system from 'pull' to 'push', but even this is relative, as it is not the intention to introduce this change immediately, despite existing commitments on the part of the USA, but to first have a trial run.
The push system is used in the case of Canada, however, and is perfectly feasible in technical terms.
What, then, was stopping the EU from insisting that the USA immediately honour the commitment it made to us a long time ago?
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, despite the short time available to me, there are three points that I want to raise.
First of all, what further guarantees have the American authorities given with regard to how the data will be used?
I know we have the 'push system' and the 'pull system' and so on, but what kind of criteria are laid down for the use of the data?
Secondly, when we hear about actions on a case-by-case basis determining whether a threat exists or if a particular flight may be under threat, how much time do we have to be able to respond to that request for information, and what difficulty will there be in accessing that data? And I mean that from a European perspective as well as a US perspective.
Thirdly, and I suppose most importantly, if we find that some data has been misused, what comeback do we have?
What mechanism is in place to ensure that an individual or groups of individuals whose data has been misused can get some kind of comeback from the American authorities?
These are questions which I think all European citizens want to have answered.
I agree with the deal, I think it is a good deal in general and better than the previous deal, but there are still requirements for further clarity on it.
(EL) Mr President, I have listened very carefully to everything said by both the Minister and Commissioner Frattini.
They have both accepted that the agreement reached has positive elements for Europe.
My view is that the views which prevailed were the American views.
I have three specific comments on this interim agreement.
Firstly, it says in the agreement, as Mr Frattini also said, that the number of data items transferred remains unchanged but that this agreement leaves open the possibility of new information being included on frequent flyers.
I believe that this reference is open to numerous interpretations.
Perhaps the Commissioner could explain what applies to the House?
Secondly, it was agreed to change from the pull system to the push system, meaning that the airlines will upgrade their own systems.
Can the Commissioner tell us who will bear the cost of this changeover to the new system?
I fear that the cost will be passed on to passengers and tickets.
Thirdly, I am worried about the retention of the term 'adequate' used to qualify the level of protection of data.
Who in fact judges if the level is adequate?
Do the assurances being given by the American side suffice?
Can the Commissioner tell us what guarantees we have on actual data protection?
Finally, I believe that all this must be addressed in the new round of negotiations due to start in January.
The new agreement must be more balanced than this one.
Mr President, the temporary PNR agreement with the United States continues to treat as non-binding the US unilateral undertakings for the proper use and protection of personal data in the form of a protocol.
Why?
And how is it possible that the European Council in this case concluded an agreement that seems more flexible on US obligations than even the agreement that a mere private company, SWIFT, was apparently able to negotiate with US authorities for the unacceptable transfer of banking data?
SWIFT, for example, has claimed that it can in real time block any US search if it violates the causes for which it has been agreed.
The PNR and SWIFT cases reveal a dangerous political and legal black hole in the protection of our fundamental rights.
A third country invoking exclusively reasons of its own national security can apparently impose upon Europe, including directly upon private companies, the level of access to, use, and even protection of, data.
This is clearly unacceptable, and, while the whole EU pillar structure has de facto collapsed in these two cases, the Council insists upon denying Parliament the role of an equal partner in fighting terrorism and in protecting fundamental rights.
What is now urgently needed is a comprehensive and democratic European approach in cooperation with all our partners on a global level to deal with these issues in the future.
(FR) Mr President, in view of the large number of speakers and people present in this debate, I shall try not to tire you out even more.
I agree with much of what has just been said, on a subject that is really very serious.
I wish publicly to thank Mr Frattini for his efforts to inform our committee.
I am speaking, in fact, as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs since Mrs in 't Veld has already spoken on behalf of my group.
I shall make two observations, the first concerning the political climate.
I believe that, in the context of the forthcoming negotiations, there needs to be more effort made towards the notion of reciprocity.
I want to speak about reciprocity of the information that we agree to supply to the American services: what can we hope to obtain in return?
I have good reason to wonder because, whilst it is true that we Europeans need to be able to land in the United States, particularly for business purposes, one must not underestimate the same need on the part of American companies because a lot of business is done in Europe.
We are therefore in a relatively balanced position.
My second observation concerns the future.
This interim agreement lapses in July 2007, and it will therefore be necessary to prepare the follow up, no doubt from the end of the coming winter.
Given the numerous questions posed by the grey areas in this agreement, particularly - and this worries me a bit - the explanatory letter to which Mrs in 't Veld alluded just now, does it seem unreasonable to you, Mr Vice-President, to hope to build some sort of compromise by the next United States/Europe summit, that is to say by April 2007?
Can one hope to build a kind of transatlantic Schengen on the basis of which the United States, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, could establish a framework making it possible to sort out both the problem of the demands of security and that of the protection of citizens?
We have a right to a new political structure as, in a few months time, we shall be entering into the negotiation of a new agreement.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the most honest opinion we can express is that we have agreed to blackmail, since unfortunately Europe has in this matter been subjected to blackmail by the United States; that is to say, the US is dealing with single Member States and airlines, which is why we have in practice been coerced into concluding the agreement in question.
This - I repeat - is the most politically correct position, which Parliament must express.
However, it is as if we are having to defend an agreement that effectively damages European citizens: it is in fact true that nothing has changed, but the agreement that has been annulled by the Court of Justice was a very bad agreement.
We would have to put into the hands of the American authorities 34 personal data items, of which, as the Americans themselves testify, only seven or eight would normally be used.
If that is how things are, I do not understand why we have to hand over all this information and, furthermore, to put it in the hands of the American intelligence services - a new feature of the agreement - unless anyone maintains that we can trust the CIA.
I do not believe that I am speaking just for myself; I consider rather that this Parliament has every reason not to trust the CIA.
What has happened in Europe is clear for all to see: Parliament has even set up a special commission on CIA activities in Europe, and there have been discussions on what happened with SWIFT, when it was discovered that our bank accounts were being inspected by the Americans.
I therefore remain puzzled and still believe that we cannot trust the activities of United States intelligence agencies.
I believe that the agreement in question was not negotiated in the name of European citizens; it certainly was not negotiated in the name of this Parliament, which was completely ignored in the discussion, as Mrs in 't Veld recalled a short time ago.
In my opinion we must instead involve the European Parliament, just as we need to involve national parliaments, so that this agreement is reached in such a way as to give priority to defending the rights of EU citizens and, above all, ensuring that our personal data is not put into the hands of persons who will certainly not make fitting use of it.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commissioner.
It is not a perfect agreement.
When compromises have to be made, agreements are never perfect, but, as Mrs in 't Veld said, it was either an agreement or no agreement.
If there was no agreement, we would have had data anarchy and certainly no EU-wide protection for our citizens.
I want to associate myself fully with the comments of Mr Cavada, who I believe has taken a really constructive approach.
We need to look at what is happening with PNR and we need to look at what is happening with SWIFT - incidentally, the memorandum of understanding that SWIFT managed to negotiate is a good basis upon which to build any future negotiations.
But we can see it also as an opportunity to create this so-called Schengen transatlantic area, because we will come up against these problems time and time again.
However, I should like to say to this House that nothing is being imposed on us.
The choice is ours.
If we wish to travel to the United States, we will have to abide by conditions set by the United States.
If we want to set up a business in the United States, exactly the same principle applies.
We have to negotiate for our common good and this interim agreement is a step in that direction.
Congratulations, Commissioner!
The easiest thing in the world is to knock something; the hardest is to support it.
Well done.
(DE) Mr President, I must admit that I see some aspects quite differently from the previous speaker, but Mr Cashman and I have a relationship of friendly disagreement, and it actually works quite well.
Nonetheless, I think it most regrettable that the Council is no longer present, as it is clear from the speech on its behalf that neither was it present at the negotiations nor does it know the substance of this agreement.
It is not possible to speak of any gain in data protection if we have adopted the same amount in this regard as before, namely nothing - as twice nothing is still nothing.
We still do not know where the data retrieved will end up.
We do not know which authority in the United States has access to them, and thus where they will be stored in the end, let alone where they will be transmitted.
We do not know when they will be deleted.
European citizens are not entitled to enquire where these data are.
They are not entitled to require that the data be corrected.
It is not true, therefore, that we have achieved more in essence.
I am not accusing the Commissioner personally, as I know the pressure the United States has exerted, but I should have liked us to have put up more resistance to this pressure and, for example, taken up my colleague Mr Cavada's suggestion in saying that, if the US expects data from us, it has to hand its own over too.
Who says there cannot be any threat to the EU from the USA?
Who says that we do not also have the right to learn who is travelling into our territory?
We must be able to pay the US back in the same coin in this case instead of just yielding to its pressure.
Mr President, the Presidency said that the final outcome is a success, but I say it is a sell-out.
We are told that data protection will be in compliance with relevant European standards, but I read in paragraph 3 that the Americans will process data in accordance with applicable US laws, and in paragraph 1 that data will be handed over as required by the Department of Homeland Security.
Then we have the accompanying US side letter which says that they will interpret the agreement as laid down by President Bush's executive decrees on data sharing and access by other agencies.
This is a complete assertion of US jurisdiction, so I would like to ask Commissioner Fratini to tell us whether he accepts this accompanying US side letter as an intrinsic part of the agreement.
Paragraph 6 of the agreement says that the Department of Homeland Security is 'deemed' to ensure an adequate level of data protection.
Now what on earth does 'deemed' mean?
Paragraph 1 says that we are relying on US continued implementation of the undertakings as interpreted in the light of subsequent events.
So we are at the mercy of events to tell us if the US will respect its undertakings!
So the Presidency assertion that the earlier undertakings continue to apply is baseless.
The Commission and the Council say that the agreement delivers legal certainty for EU citizens.
I agree with this only in one respect: the certainty that their legal rights have been sold down the river, or rather across the pond.
This is not theoretical; we have heard all this year on the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transport and illegal detention of prisoners, regarding people about whom soft information has been transferred to the United States that has become hard information, leading to people being rendered to places like Syria and tortured for months or years or incarcerated in GuantÃ¡namo Bay.
This is not theoretical.
Mrs LehtomÃ€ki has had to return to Finland - data-free - because it is the Indian Summit tomorrow, so there will be no reply from the Council in this debate.
Vice-President of the Commission. (IT) Mr President, I believe that in the next few months there will be a debate with Parliament - because I confirm my personal willingness and that of the Commission to maintain a political dialogue with Parliament, even when we start on the negotiation phase with the United States of America - which in my opinion must presuppose a desire for mutual understanding, based in turn on familiarity with the official records on the subject.
I have heard some Members speaking about personal data being sent to the CIA: it is simply not true.
You must read the official records, honourable Members.
It is clear from these that neither the CIA nor the other American secret services will have access to this data.
This is a fact, established by the official documents - which we have checked.
It is not true to assert that we are putting the data in question into the hands of the secret services without any checking.
For this reason I am willing to engage in dialogue, but on the basis of shared data.
By the same token, it is untrue to assert that data sent to the Department of Homeland Security is then sent to all the agencies.
That is definitely not the case.
We send data only to those agencies that are entrusted with the task of either undertaking investigations or dealing with terrorism.
These are the two conditions that place a limit on who receives the data.
A request for personal data has to be made on a case-by-case basis, and the undertakings specify what is meant by 'case-by-case'.
Looked at in this way, therefore, the agreement - signed but not yet ratified - is in no way different from the earlier one.
The earlier one may not please you, but it has not been changed nor made worse.
Some observations have been made concerning the entering into force of the agreement: for example, Mr Roure has referred to Article 24.
You know very well, Mr Roure, that national parliaments have the right - and in some cases the obligation - to ratify agreements.
You know equally well, however, that this temporary agreement has been negotiated very urgently to avoid the anarchy to which Mr Cashman has referred.
Anarchy means the absence of rules and of protection and the possibility that any bunch of people could sign an agreement.
It is therefore clear that we shall apply Article 24 of the agreement, including the part that states that it will come into force immediately.
If we were to await all the ratifications, this agreement would come into effect after July 2007, whereupon the immediate anarchy that we wanted to avoid would be caused.
We are talking about rules laid down in the Treaties, not of an interpretation of our own.
We have repeated that '[A]n adequate level of data protection is guaranteed'.
This is a formula that existed previously.
I have been asked a serious question: how can we protect the citizen or indeed the European Community if this adequate level is not maintained?
Honourable Members, you know that the undertakings and the agreement envisage the possibility of denouncing the agreement and maybe of suspending it, if it were to emerge that the 'adequate level of protection' had not been maintained.
So there are suitable instruments; and if it were necessary to resort to legal procedures, it would certainly not be for me to establish in what cases a magistrate could invoke his jurisdiction.
I have received objections to the existence of a covering letter that establishes the application of a certain jurisdiction, for example only United States jurisdiction.
You know full well, however, that this letter is a unilateral act, not part of the agreement.
The Commission has not agreed any dispositions concerning jurisdiction that might be contained in a unilateral letter from the State Department.
Therefore it is absolutely untrue that we are surrendering our rights concerning jurisdiction.
It is up to the judges to establish who can or cannot act.
This will certainly not be established by the agreement under discussion.
I believe that there is another particularly important matter: the 'push-pull' aspect.
Mrs in 't Velt has asked some complicated questions, seventeen in all, to which we shall naturally reply in writing: they are very technical questions, but important.
However, there are other points to which I must now respond.
It is simply not true that, according to the agreement, the new 'push' system that Parliament wants will come into force when the Americans want it.
On the contrary, we have it in writing that 'by December at the latest, the system will be operational'.
The agreement therefore refers to a date that is very clear and close - one and a half months away - and, as you well know, there is a network of international airlines, headed by the Amadeus chain, that is already in a position to apply the 'push' system tomorrow.
There thus exists the technical capacity and there is also a juridical basis, which was not contemplated in the previous agreement.
This is certainly an improvement: the 'push' system can come into operation from tomorrow.
As far as the limited scope of the agreement is concerned, someone - I think it was again Mrs in 't Velt - stated that the transmission of data would no longer be justified only by the war on terrorism but also by other objectives.
Points 3 and 34 of the undertakings, which have not been modified, established and still establish that, in the event of a matter of life and death, including cases other than specific investigation of terrorism, personal data may be requested.
This is nothing new.
One more thing, Mr President, and I apologise for the length of my speech. I am in full agreement with what Mr Cavada and Mr Cashman said: we can also call it the 'Transatlantic Schengen Agreement' (I like that title).
Certainly there will have to be wide-ranging political negotiations with the United States.
We shall need to establish once and for all - and Parliament will also have to do this - whether the United States is, as I believe, Europe's foremost ally in the war on terrorism, or whether it is a problem.
I consider it to be our foremost ally in the war on terrorism; this being so, it is clear that, just as we Europeans have constructed the Schengen area of security and affirmation of rights, we must start doing the same thing with the United States.
Otherwise, we risk forgetting that the problem is terrorism, not the US.
I should like to thank the Commissioner and all colleagues who took part in that important debate.
The debate is closed.
Footwear from China and Vietnam (debate)
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the definitive results of the anti-dumping investigation concerning footwear from China and Vietnam, by Enrique BarÃ³n Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0432/2006).
Mr President, honourable Members, I am replacing my colleague Peter Mandelson in this debate.
Peter is currently on his way to the EU-India Summit with Minister LehtomÃ€ki and he really is on duty because we have many important trade policies to discuss with India.
Last week the Council adopted the measures proposed by the Commission to tackle the dumping of Chinese and Vietnamese footwear in the European Union.
These measures offer a balanced solution in a complex case; a solution which responds to the clear evidence of unfair competitive practices and state intervention which has enabled Chinese and Vietnamese companies to engage in dumping in the European Union.
The measures now adopted will help to redress the situation.
They offer some comfort to footwear producers in the Union while taking into account both the interests of consumers and the changing structure of the sector within the Union, where many household names in the footwear sector now choose to manufacture outside the Union.
This is in fact a case study of our ability to respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by globalisation.
The full findings of the investigation are set out in the measures which we published on 6 October, as well as the details of how we established the level of dumping and injury to EU industry and determined the appropriate level of duties in this case.
This information is in the public domain and is of course, as in every other case, open to public and, ultimately, judicial scrutiny.
With regard to the possible use of a deferred duty scheme, it is correct that the Commission considered such an approach as a possible response to this case.
Such a novel approach would indeed have had certain advantages, but it did not command the support of a majority of Member States.
The Commission listened to the concerns of the Member States and in late August presented the measures which have just been adopted by the Council.
In formulating the level of duty, the Commission applied the 'lesser-duty rule', which is part of our existing legal framework and entirely consistent with the international framework applying to anti-dumping.
This rule allows the Commission to set levels of duty which reflect the actual damage being suffered by EU industry rather than the level of dumping established in the investigation.
This is not in itself a novel approach.
At the same time, given the nature of this sector, where quotas on shoe imports applied up to 2005, this was an important factor which needed to be taken into account in determining the appropriate level of duty to be applied.
Nevertheless, the situation is specific to this particular case, and, while each case must be judged on its own merits, particularly when we face globalisation, it does not as such represent a fundamental change in the way we deal with trade defence cases.
Let me conclude by highlighting that the kinds of challenges posed in the shoes case cannot be ignored.
This is why, as part of our push to strengthen our external competitiveness, the Commission will publish a Green Paper in December looking at how our trade defence instruments operate in the context of economic globalisation.
I am very much looking forward to that debate and I believe we need to work together to look for practical, sensible improvements that will reinforce the ability of Europe's businesses to compete fairly in a global marketplace.
I am very much looking forward to Parliament's active participation in this debate.
I should like to apologise to Mr BarÃ³n Crespo that I gave the speaking order incorrectly.
He should of course have had the floor first in order to put the question to the Commission.
Mr Mandelson is not present for the reasons Commissioner Rehn has explained.
He is flying with Minister LehtomÃ€ki to Finland for the EU-India Summit.
author. - (ES) Mr President, I had two complaints and I shall add another, since I find what is happening in this House today to be absolutely intolerable.
Firstly, it shows disrespect towards Parliament to change our rules and make the substitute Commissioner reply before I have the opportunity to put my question.
Secondly, the absence of the Council.
There is no justification for it, and we raised this today in the Conference of Committee Chairmen: there is no justification for the absence of the Council, particularly given that the Council's role in this issue is currently very much in question, in terms of the impartiality it has shown in considering it.
The Finnish Presidency - and I say this with very great regret, since Finland is exemplary in terms of transparency - has not acted correctly, and Mrs LehtomÃ€ki should have given explanations.
With regard to Commissioner Mandelson - and I say this to Commissioner Rehn so that he can pass it on, and I will say a little more - if Commissioner Mandelson were in a State school, his parents would have been called because of their son's truancy: because he was not here at the September sitting to debate the report on India; today he has had to leave; he is not going to be here for Mercosur ...
Yes, it is very important to talk with India in Helsinki, but it is more important to be where the executive should be, which is in this Parliament talking to its Members.
Mr President, with regard to the fundamental issue, I must say that we support the Commission: we support it and we entirely disagree with some people's two-dimensional stereotypical view that there are either pro-free trade countries or protectionist countries in this field.
The Commission is taking a balanced approach; we act here jointly and with solidarity, and we are in a very serious situation.
It is said that there is protectionism; well we must protect our workers, for example.
At the moment I can tell you that the last industry remaining in France, in Alsace, manufacturing safety footwear, which is very important, is going to go to the Court of Justice, because the differences are of 40% - bearing in mind that we are asking for antidumping measures in the form of a tariff of 10% to 20% - and the footwear coming in does not conform to the minimum safety standards.
This is not therefore a debate that divides the European Union into those who are in favour of doing the right thing and those who want to close the doors.
This is a debate in which we are calling for compliance with the rules that we have agreed within the World Trade Organisation.
In its work, the Commission has acted correctly, though it has not done so today when it comes to Commissioner Mandelson's absence.
We therefore believe that the Commission should treat such an important issue as this with greater respect.
Other issues are very important too, but the President and I have missed many planes in order to fulfil our duties.
If there is a Summit tomorrow, they should get up early or arrange things in some other way; but where they should be today is here.
Your point is very well made, Mr BarÃ³n Crespo, and your own experience as President will tell you how difficult it is to keep some of our speakers to their speaking time.
I note that in earlier debates this afternoon Mr Frattini and Mr Barroso spoke jointly for more than 42 minutes.
I cannot apologise on behalf of Mr Mandelson, but I think Mr Rehn has explained the situation.
I am sure your remarks will be conveyed to Mr Mandelson by Mr Rehn.
Mr President, I endorse Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's objections concerning the Commission's conduct on such crucial discussions.
The question of antidumping duties on footwear has divided the Member States of the Union.
It has also highlighted conflicting interests between manufacturers, on the one hand, and suppliers and consumers, on the other.
We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, continue to advocate multilateralism and open and balanced international trade.
However, I consider the arguments put forward against the adoption of the measures in question, by which I mean protectionism for the benefit of the industry and the passing on of the cost to European consumers, to be misleading and unsubstantiated.
Ladies and gentlemen, it must be made clear that the imposition of duties is a justified legal commercial defence measure or, if you like, a productive protective measure.
By contrast, dumping practices are a primary protective measure - and one which distorts trade.
Given, therefore, that the application of dumping practices and the damage caused by them to the European industry have been confirmed, the failure to take measures would mean tolerance of unfair competition.
To all those who put forward the argument of better prices against the imposition of duties I ask: did consumers benefit from the reduction in import prices following liberalisation?
Clearly not.
As the Commission itself confirms, there was no benefit to the European consumer, given that prices remained stable or even increased slightly in certain instances.
Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union should send a clear message: yes to competition; no to its manifest or concealed distortion.
The Union is and will remain an open market to partners who respect the rules and disciplines of the multilateral trade system.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, frankly I am dismayed by this decision to impose tariffs on shoes for two reasons: firstly, because a large number of European consumers are going to be asked to pay more for their footwear in order to bring dubious benefits to a small number of European producers.
I particularly regret the fact that children's footwear has been included in this.
If you are a relatively low-paid parent of a young child, who has to buy new footwear regularly, this imposition is a serious one and I regret that we have taken this action.
The second reason I am dismayed is the way the majority in Council was allegedly - and I say allegedly because I have no hard proof of this - put together.
I understand that Latvia was persuaded to change its vote, which was nothing to do with shoes, but because Italy promised then not to vote for GSP sanctions on Belarus.
Because Latvia trades extensively with Belarus, this was a big hook for the Latvians.
That sort of horse-trading, if it is true, brings both the European Union as a whole and the Council in particular into disrepute.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, may I first of all associate myself with the comments of complaint that were raised by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo.
Commissioner, the EU's move last week to slap duties on the imports of shoes from China and Vietnam not only went against the will of the majority of Europe - a number of Member States have clearly undertaken horse-trading and have now abandoned their declared positions - it has also raised the possibility of the EU being reprimanded before the WTO as many question the factual and legal basis of the Commission's investigation.
Protectionism was the fuel behind this short-sighted, sticking-plaster measure.
Duties are quick fixes which only hurt those EU industries that have actually adapted to the global economy.
Britain's Clarks Shoes, for example, has first of all shown foresight, in relocating production of shoes to China and Vietnam; responsibility, in diversifying into retail outlets in the UK, where they now employ more people than they ever employed in shoemaking; and, not least, understanding, in recognising the Commission's difficulties and trying to work with you and not against you.
Yet, because of last week's ill-thought-out measures, Clarks is now being penalised for all three, as European retailers and consumers are now expected to foot the bill for an ailing Italian manufacturing industry.
It is short-sighted, too, for whilst Commissioner Mandelson is rolling out his plans for stronger bilateral links with emerging economies in Asia, it has incensed the Chinese, cut across EU-sponsored poverty reduction and hunger eradication programmes in Vietnam and shown an EU protectionist red flag to the region.
I fear that Commissioner Mandelson's review of the EU's anti-dumping rules comes a year too late.
The naming and shaming of retailers who do not forward the benefit of cheap imports to the consumer is a smokescreen for the Commission's poor management of the challenges of globalisation.
On this one, the Commission has failed miserably.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, the Council's decision concerning duties on shoes from China and Vietnam is another example of the EU's protectionism.
The decision is an assault on the multilateral agreement system and, specifically, the Multifibre Agreement, and it excessively punishes those Member States that have managed to comply with the agreement.
The duties hits, for example, Denmark, which has transferred its production of shoes to China and only retained the design and marketing aspects in Denmark.
Even worse, the EU is now undermining the WTO and the multilateral agreement system.
It is also remarkable that the Commissioner does not even listen to people when they are talking.
Even though he is Finnish, he is unable, when standing over there, to understand my Danish.
I would point out to the President that this is completely unacceptable.
(The President cut off the speaker)
Commissioner Mandelson will now pin his hopes on bilateral trading agreements.
The justification for this is that, as long as the WTO route is barred, we must find new ways.
I would point out, however, that it is, in actual fact, the EU that, together with the United States, is mainly responsible for the WTO negotiations having stalled.
No doubt there are indeed problems involving human rights, interest rate policy and environmental standards, but they must not be solved through protectionism.
They must be solved through binding multilateral cooperation.
Strengthening the bilateral approach will only buttress poor countries' dependence on the EU.
It is a poorly disguised continuation of colonial exploitation.
Commissioner Mandelson calls the bilateral agreements 'stepping stones' to better global trade.
They are not that, however.
On the contrary.
They entail a rejection of the WTO and the multilateral trading system and thus also of the ideals of fair and free trade and of the fight against poverty, which the Commission otherwise emphasises as its global vision.
With the bilateral strategy, that vision is just empty words.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, we feel that the problem with the measures decided by the Council is that they are overdue, that they will have a limited impact and that they fall short of what is needed in a sector that has a good future ahead of it and that is very important to Portugal and the EU.
Commissioner, you will certainly be aware of the reality of the closure and relocation of many companies and the loss of jobs in the footwear industry in Portugal, the result of which has been an increase in unemployment and the danger of thousands of workers falling into poverty.
Once again, let me highlight the case of the workers of the multinational C [amp] J Clark in Castelo de Paiva who, three years after the company's closure and following repeated promises, remain without alternative employment.
In other words, with the liberalisation of world trade, the workers employed by innumerable micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the footwear industry in the EU have been the losers.
Those who have gained most, on the other hand, from the huge rise in footwear imports from third countries have not been the so-called consumers but, rather, the large multinationals and the major importers and distributors, which have made tremendous profits, as the Commission has acknowledged.
If international trade as a whole were properly looking after the consumers' interests, it could have long since significantly reduced the selling price of imported footwear.
As we have pointed out, the responsibility for this situation does not lie with third countries, but with the EU and its policies of promoting competition and liberalising international trade, as well as maintaining the value of the euro, a policy that hampers manufacturing industries such as the footwear industry.
Just last week, as a matter of fact, the Commission declared its intention to increase bilateral free-trade treaties, thereby launching a fresh crusade to liberalise world trade.
It is this policy that should be brought into question.
Mr President, just last year, a total of 1 billion 250 million pairs of shoes from China came onto the European market.
That is half of all the shoes sold in the European Union during that time.
Meanwhile, since 2001, production of leather footwear in Europe has fallen by almost 30%.
In the European Union shoe sector almost 40 000 jobs have been lost during this period.
The situation in Poland is similar.
In 2001, Poland imported only 300 000 pairs of Chinese-made shoes.
Now the figure is 9 million pairs per annum.
This has had a direct knock-on effect on employment in the sector.
In 2003, the shoe-making industry in Poland consisted of 123 firms, while in 2005 there were only 93.
At the same time, employment in the industry fell from almost 17 000 to 13 000, with production falling from 18 to 15 million pairs.
What is more, it is not the consumer who has benefited from these huge imports through lower prices, as is generally thought, but the importers themselves, who often add profit margins exceeding 100% of the transaction value.
In this situation it is good that the European Commission has finally decided to impose tariffs to protect the European market, and in particular that experts from the Commission have established beyond all doubt that China is using dumping prices.
Governments such as China and Vietnam are unfairly supporting their manufacturers through tax concessions, the provision of free land, and also by absolving them of the full costs of manufacture, for example by waiving environmental taxes.
The only regret is that this has come so late in the day, after the European shoemaking industry has suffered so badly.
The European Commission must do everything in its power to prevent such a situation from repeating itself in any other sector of the economy.
What is more, decisions on how to react to the sale of goods at dumping prices within the European customs area must be made quickly to limit the damage such imports cause to manufacturing, and therefore to employment in the European Union.
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I fundamentally disagree with the fact that the Council and the Commission have adopted the Mandelson proposal and in the last few days have imposed high customs duties on footwear from Vietnam and China.
I feel that this is a short-term measure that is tantamount to anti-liberal protectionism and that does not in any way help European competitiveness.
This is just prolonging the agony for these manufacturers who fight hard to adjust to the reality of the global economy.
By introducing customs duties the politicians paradoxically punish those amongst the businessmen who have come to understand the rules of the global economy and, in a show of flexibility, have moved production to Asia and managed to hold their own under the new market conditions.
The introduction of customs duties also ultimately works against the consumer, given that the cost of a pair of shoes has gone up by EUR 7.
I should like to know which Head of State or which Commissioner will be going out in person to explain to families with many children that when they buy more expensive shoes they are not buying higher quality, but are subsidising inefficient footwear companies.
(PT) In imposing the anti-dumping tax on leather footwear imports from China and Vietnam, the EU took a good decision, albeit a long overdue one.
Still, better late than never.
We are all aware that China and Vietnam export various products around the world, including footwear and textiles, which enjoy major state intervention at source.
Examples of this state intervention include non-refundable loans, tax breaks, the artificial devaluation of the currency and, in some cases, the non-depreciation of investments.
These products continue to enjoy the total, or near-total, absence of social or environmental regulation, which accounts for a significant proportion of production costs in EU countries.
European footwear manufacturers know that they have to compete with companies that manufacture products while paying their employees lower wages.
They are opposed to the idea that competition should be distorted by this kind of intervention from exporting countries selling their goods below the production price.
Where I come from, this is known as cheating.
The EU has, albeit belatedly, made the right decision, but in watered-down form.
What is happening shows that the authorities of these countries are unwilling to change their behaviour and, in view of their repeated unfair practices, I would have preferred the original version of the sanctions, which called for anti-dumping tariffs for five years, rather than for the two-year period that has finally been decided on.
These measures were only supported by a narrow majority in the Council, only 13 out of 25 Member States.
I should therefore like to ask, in conclusion, whether we will be able to hold on to that majority in two years' time?
If not, what will the EU do?
Let me be absolutely clear on this point, Commissioner. I am no advocate of protectionist policies.
I just want everyone to play by the rules.
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a strange conception, as Mr BarÃ³n Crespo said, of democratic debate and of the respect due to our institution if the Trade Commissioner and Finnish Presidency are not here to answer our legitimate questions.
If the Commissioner had managed to get here, I would have had two questions for him.
Why have the anti-dumping duties been imposed for two rather than five years, which is a first in the history of this instrument, and why are the duties so low when there is a blatant violation of the international trade rules and when businesses are suffering serious losses?
If the Finnish Presidency had honoured us with its presence, I would not have congratulated it on its biased coordination and on its unwavering support for the position of the big importers and distributors, at the expense of our own industry which is experiencing a number of tragic bankruptcies with the job losses that that entails.
Once again, however, financial considerations have prevailed over social considerations and the vital solidarity between countries within the European Union, a solidarity which, if we keep on putting it to the test, tomorrow could end up being the exception and no longer the rule that unites us.
To sum up, the position adopted means more unemployment in Europe, a missed opportunity to promote social norms and decent employment, and profit reserved only for importers and distributors: I cannot accept it.
(LT) The European footwear market has shrunk by one third over the last five years as it is not able to compete with cheap production subsidised by the governments of Asian countries.
With the imposition of anti-dumping duties on Chinese and Vietnamese leather footwear for the next two years, EU Member States trying to compete in the footwear manufacturing sector have won a temporary victory against those EU countries that have moved their production to Asia.
Large sales networks, such as footwear importers from Asia, are also resisting the introduction of such duties.
Market protection measures are necessary as long as the energy sector is subsidised, preferential duties are applied and the environment is being polluted in Asian countries.
These measures will at least partially serve to reduce the differences between the operating conditions of European and Asian footwear manufacturers, albeit temporarily.
The transfer of production to countries with cheaper workforces appears inevitable.
The Earth is still round, and will the EU not be harmed after destroying its own manufacturing capabilities?
Why will the European Commission not consider a reform of the foreign trade policy of the WTO and the EU?
(PL) Mr President, footwear is a product whose quality has an important effect on our health and on comfortable walking.
Its practicality and durability depend on the design, the method of manufacture and the materials used.
Securing a basic standard for footwear entails certain costs.
Very low-priced shoes may originate from subsidised production or manufacturers using very low-quality raw materials and technologies that do not meet health and consumer requirements.
This should be taken into consideration when protecting the industry and consumers in the European Union.
For this reason I believe that the introduction of anti-dumping duties is justified, as is the use of any other methods that would restrict the import of shoes that fall short of European requirements.
(SV) Mr President, the introduction of duties on shoes from Vietnam and China is a splendid own-goal by the EU.
It is bad economic policy and bad trade policy, and it is morally bankrupt.
Allow me firstly to explain why it is bad economic policy.
What we are doing at the moment, you see, is standing up for and defending those industries that are uncompetitive, at the same time as punishing those industries that have adjusted to globalisation, for example by moving their production to more competitive countries.
In that way, we achieve the feat of weakening the EU's competitiveness two-fold by means of one and the same decision.
I am afraid that the Commission's vision for the future is that the EU should compete globally using cheap shoes.
I think the worst that could happen is that the Commission might succeed and that we would retain this industry.
In that case, we shall be able, in 30 years, to expect to see Europe exporting shoes to Vietnam, while Vietnam exports cars, or an even higher-value product that we cannot even imagine, to Europe.
Secondly, the introduction of these duties is bad trade policy.
At the end of this month, Vietnam will become a member of the WTO.
The EU's welcome present is duties on Vietnamese shoes.
The signals we are sending to Vietnam, from one of the world's largest trading blocks, are a disaster, especially since the country is going through major changes in order to meet the requirements for future WTO membership.
Thirdly, it is morally bankrupt because it hits individuals hard in order to satisfy small, well-organised special interests.
You are not content to prolong the duties on shoes, but you are now also extending them to include children's shoes.
What do you say to Swedish families with small children who may be forced to buy several pairs of children's shoes per year?
Do you think that families with children have too much money?
Have the previous measures allowed them to get off too lightly?
This is an example of the EU showing its very worst side, namely when well-organised special interests are allowed to come before the wellbeing of the people.
That, I think, is something we must prevent from happening in the future.
(PT) Advocates of free trade believe that trade protection instruments such as anti-dumping measures should only be adopted in extraordinary, objectively verified, circumstances.
Unfortunately, such circumstances apply in this instance.
China and Vietnam have been responsible for particularly unacceptable commercial practices in the footwear industry and have gone so far as to increase the numerous competitive advantages they already enjoy.
By acting in this way, these two countries have breached one of the fundamental principles of free trade, namely that of fair competition.
These measures are not, therefore, to be understood as being opposed to free trade, but as being, quite the opposite, a vital factor in protecting free trade in the long term.
We must therefore applaud the Commission for what it has done in this area.
It is, however, important to emphasise that European industry must keep up its efforts to modernise, by investing in innovation and in improving quality in order to increase its competitiveness in the sector around the world.
This effort must involve the public authorities, with the rules of free and fair trade always being adhered to.
The adoption of these measures must not, therefore, be seen as an attempt to reopen the door to unwanted protectionism, but rather as a vital instrument for ensuring that international trade is fairly regulated.
(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, in contrast to the previous speaker, I wish to say that if anyone believes that European jobs can be saved by placing duties on leather shoes from China and Vietnam, they should think again.
That is simply not how things work.
The fact is that production will, of course, merely move to other low-wage countries.
The latest figures from Eurostat show that, since the duties were approved in the spring, shoe production has moved from China and Vietnam to countries such as India and Indonesia.
The EU countries' inefficient producers gain nothing.
The Commission maintains that dumping has taken place and says that it has presented all the practical results of the anti-dumping inquiry.
I have to say that I can only find a few general documents.
I think that there is a major democratic problem if decisions are taken on a casual or incomplete basis.
It reinforces the impression that what we have here is political horse-trading, and I would therefore call on the Commission openly to present the results of all its investigations and to submit detailed analyses of the consequences that the shoe duties are having, and will have in the future, for European consumers and companies.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the matter addressed by Mr BarÃ³n Crespo's question flows from the case of the footwear sector, because the entire production system of Member States has been thrown into a crisis, and not merely from today, by unfair competition - or, to put it more plainly, by the remorseless and unbridled financial greed of the so-called free market: a market that would be better defined as being without rules, which preys on individuals like a vampire, exploiting workers without paying heed to their age and without any social security remotely comparable to that which is in force in countries of the European Union.
It is a market with devastating financial interests that impoverishes society and nations, intent on the exponential enrichment of multinational companies.
The trade defences such as anti-dumping measures, and thus the maintenance of tariffs, are the first and the minimum indispensable tool; but they are not entirely satisfactory, since the unfair competition that is in danger of flooding the markets with much cheaper products is the consequence of the huge advantages offered by production factors.
Unfair competition should thus be fought not only by defensive means: one cannot attempt to win the war with rearguard battles, and defence does not guarantee victory in war, as strategists even before von Clausewitz have already noted.
If, therefore, the European Union wishes to safeguard its producers, it must impose controls on the products that it aims to promote in the internal market.
It is unthinkable to set off prices against production so long as the production factors are so unbalanced in favour of Asian industry - unbalanced in respect of costs not only of labour but also, for example, of administration.
At the start of this parliamentary term, I tabled an oral question in accordance with Article 108, with dozens of signatures in support of colleagues of various nationalities and political leanings.
It was obviously not put down for the debate, perhaps because it clashed with the interests of those who, in the name of profit, despise social considerations and the profound importance of employment.
I said then - and I remain of the same view - that, as well as imposing restrictions on imports from countries that do not give guarantees as mentioned earlier, it is time to institute a control mechanism that would certify how products imported into Europe are made, whatever non-European country they come from, and that would in consequence authorise or prohibit the trade.
Let us impose a trade mark of ethical certification - ethical as regards employment and the environment and, more generally, ethical as regards the production process.
Karl Popper was undoubtedly a supporter of free trade, but he summarised perfectly the extent to which liberty cannot be considered ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly reject the view that anti-dumping is tantamount to harmful protectionism.
In fact, the opposite is true.
For Europe, there is nothing worse than taking a benevolent view of the unfair trade practices of third countries whilst imposing very strict requirements on European manufacturers.
We should not be surprised that European firms have moved production to Asia, where they can make the most of low social and environmental standards, in such a way that they can sell poor quality shoes, textiles, electronic equipment and other goods cheaply and at huge profits to Europeans who are, moreover, losing jobs on their home markets.
Countries that have joined the EU adhere to trade rules and cannot by themselves impose official sanctions against third countries.
That is a competence of the Union. This is why it is important for the Commission to take action on this occasion.
I am concerned about inconsistency, however.
After all, children's and sports shoes from China and Vietnam are also sold at dumping prices.
Their exclusion from these measures simply on the grounds that sports shoes are no longer made in Europe, or even on the grounds that poor quality children's shoes will be a help to poor families, is a sign of Europe's weakness.
The previous exclusion of children's shoes which were demonstrably harmful to children's health showed a gross failure of professionalism on the Commission's part.
I believe that in this case we should follow the principle of mutually monitoring the agreed rules and not simply surrendering to European wholesalers, who often benefit from our lack of thoroughness in these matters.
We are all aware that we are talking about just a few euros, which will make no impact on the generous profits that the consumer does not see.
The Council statement showed that governments are not interested in principle, but in concrete trade interests that differ across the north-south divide.
I hope that at least here in Parliament we uphold the principles of fair competition irrespective of whom it suits in Europe or otherwise.
It is our duty to support the Commission and to warn the Council against any such policy.
To conclude, I should like to call on the Commission once again to address the issue of compulsory certification for children's footwear that is sold in Europe, regardless of who has produced it.
Shoes should be healthy, whether they are made by the Chinese, the Japanese, or anyone else.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if this debate were to be confined to weighing up the arguments for and against anti-dumping measures for leather footwear from China and Vietnam, it would truly serve no purpose.
European countries are divided on this issue because producers' interests are in conflict with those of distributors.
This is a statement of fact, not a matter for outrage.
We should be asking a different question: does a common European interest exist?
How would one define it?
In my opinion we can and must try to define it, because a divided Europe is a weaker Europe.
However, it can be done only if we start from a strategic and realistic vision of Europe's position in the market and in world trade and remain bound by principles and figures.
One of these principles is the defence of the European consumer: among other things, the producers' requirement, that is to say the 'made in', is sacrosanct: first of all, because it signifies more information and therefore more openness (this is a European principle); and, secondly, because it transpires that a drastic fall in the costs of importing leather shoes has not in fact been matched by a reduction in retail prices.
On the contrary, it has become clear that there exist in Europe unearned incomes from this situation and that these too are a cause of the danger.
The tariffs that have been imposed for two years are a reasonable compromise measure, which also endorses a correct method of respecting the interests of all parties.
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being here with us today.
I would like briefly to communicate to the Council my relative satisfaction with the agreement reached on 4 October: satisfaction because it has finally been agreed that action should be taken to counter the sale of shoes from China and Vietnam below real costs prices.
I say relative satisfaction, because this kind of tariff measure is usually in force for five years rather than the two years that the Council has agreed to.
Those of us from Spain and the Balearic Islands are calling upon the Commission and the Council to leave open the possibility of extending these duties, since the problem of unfair competition will still be there in two years' time.
Furthermore, in the region that I represent, the Balearic Islands, one of the regions most active in defending equal conditions in the marketing of footwear in the European markets, we believe that the tariffs provided for in the Council's agreement are low compared to those applied during the provisional period that ended on 6 October: the temporary tariff of 19% for Chinese footwear is becoming 16%, and in the case of footwear from Vietnam it is falling from 16.8% to 10%.
For the Balearic Islands and for my country, the fundamental issue is to defend equal conditions in the marketing of footwear, conditions that exclude this kind of dumping practice.
We are not therefore talking about imposing protectionist measures that hinder free trade, but rather about taking measures to combat unfair competition.
(EL) Mr President, the recent decision by the Council of Ministers to impose antidumping duties leads me to two crucial comments.
The first concerns the efficacy of the common trade policy and the mechanisms which it has at its disposal to defend European interests.
Unfortunately, yet again China, as a member of the World Trade Organisation, is continuing its dumping practices through its state policy, whereas the European Commission is continuing, for its part, to monitor this practice as a neutral observer.
On the other hand, we have Vietnam, which is also continuing to take dumping measures, while at the same time seeking to join the World Trade Organisation.
I believe that the European Commission must also send a message to the Vietnamese authorities, given that it wishes to join the World Trade Organisation.
My second comment is more serious and concerns the very future of the European Union and the defence of the European productive fabric.
In Europe there are not only consumers, whose interests we must of course defend; there are also workers who are losing their jobs and remaining unemployed.
There are imports, on the one hand, but there are also productive businesses and sectors of industry which must be able to compete in a secure international environment free from distortion.
Europe cannot become a jungle of uncontrolled imports in the name of the liberalisation of international trade.
(HU) China and Vietnam are subsidising the export of footwear in an unacceptable manner.
These subsidies are contrary to WTO rules.
This State aid causes market distortions and results in dumping.
The market distorting subsidies cause serious harm to European producers and the European economy, attested to by the fact that several tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in recent times.
That is why the introduction of anti-dumping measures is justified from a legal and economic point of view.
It is not true that such anti-dumping measures are protectionist but, on the contrary, it is the Chinese and Vietnamese states that are using protectionist, market-distorting measures.
The aim of the anti-dumping duties is precisely to offset the effects of China's and Vietnam's protectionist, market-distorting practices.
Thank you very much.
(NL) Mr President, while northern Europe considers the anti-dumping measures to be protectionist, and brandishes consumer interests to back up its argument, southern Europe considers the measures to be inadequate to protect their shoe industry against unfair competition.
This gap in the EU is increasing, and with it the mistrust.
Dumping is not the same thing as fair competition or reduced costs.
Dumping is unfair competition, whether that is because the dumping companies receive state support or whether they use child labour to keep wages down.
Where dumping is going on, we must close ranks.
We cannot simply dismiss unfair competition if, for once, it appears insignificant in comparison with the benefits for the entire community.
It is unfortunate that the government of my own country, the Netherlands, uses this very argument against taking anti-dumping measures.
How arbitrary of them!
Who, though, stands to benefit?
Not the European consumers, because last year, although import prices for shoes from outside the EU dropped by 25%, consumer prices remained the same.
Does the Commissioner agree with me that we must work on a new anti-dumping policy that rules out arbitrariness and brings unity in the EU?
We must protect ourselves against unfair competition.
We must protect both our producers and consumers.
Surely they do not want to buy products that are made by children?
We must strive for clean clothes, clean shoes and clean hands.
Mr President, the impact of these tariffs will be to increase shoe prices for my constituents in London at a time when families, especially those on lower incomes, are already facing higher energy bills.
With these tariffs, the EU has effectively levied a tax on consumers in a vain attempt to protect shoe manufacturers in certain countries who need to face up to the fact that they cannot produce shoes more cheaply than Asian countries.
Globalisation is a reality; we in Europe should not be burying our head in the sand and hiding from it.
The most successful European companies have embraced globalisation and outsourced low-value manufacturing to China and Vietnam.
We are also deluding ourselves if we believe that duties imposed on Chinese and Vietnamese shoes will lead to more European jobs.
Retailers will simply fill the gaps with more imports from other countries such as India and Indonesia, and indeed this has been shown to be the case.
When will we realise that free trade is good for European consumers and creates more and better jobs in the long run?
It may be painful for some, but the EU will gain in the longer term.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank you all for your contributions.
They reflect the justifiable concerns of industry and employees, and important considerations as far as consumers are concerned.
I will convey the outcome of this debate to Commissioner Mandelson, and also, obviously, to all my colleagues.
This is a very important issue, and we will be monitoring it continually.
Right from the start we realised that this would be a very tough and complicated case, and, after a thorough investigation, the Commission in April imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs.
All the conditions of anti-dumping tariffs were met; there is no doubt about that.
The report showed that China and Vietnam practise dumping, as a result of which it was in the Community's interests to intervene.
Several speeches, like the one just now, mentioned consumer prices.
We have looked into this in detail, and these investigations show that in all likelihood these solutions will have no effect on consumer prices. This is because there is, I would say, very considerable added value between import and consumer prices.
The average import price is EUR 8, while every one of us knows that shoes in a shop normally cost many times more than that.
Consequently, the effect of anti-dumping tariffs will be minimal, and in any case they apply to just 11% of the Union's total imports.
As I said, Mr President, I will convey the content and spirit of this debate to Mr Mandelson.
(ES) Mr President, I take note of Commissioner Rehn's expression of disapproval, but I believe that what has happened today must be looked into by the Presidency and the Conference of Presidents, because it shows a lack of respect for Parliament, particularly on the part of the Council.
As for the Commission, I hope that it will sort out its issues at home and continue to work in favour of European interests.
Thank you, your remarks are noted.
That concludes the debate.
Written statements (Rule 142)
(PT) If we are to protect manufacturing and jobs with rights, the Commission and the Council must focus more on the industrial manufacturing sectors in each Member State and must not only take into account the interests of the large economic groups involved in world trade.
Sectors such as footwear, textiles and clothing have been particularly hard hit by the disastrous policy of liberalising world trade, within the framework of the WTO.
Thousands of jobs have been lost.
In Portugal alone, jobs have been lost in the footwear factories of C[amp]J Clarks in Arouca, Castelo de Paiva and Vila Nova de Gaia, of Rodhe in Tancosco and of Ara in Avintes.
Hundreds of jobs have also been lost at Ecco and Rodhe in Santa Maria da Feira, and many others in the area of Felgueiras.
This policy does not only affect the workers, and the countless micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; it also hinders regional development in huge areas in countries such as Portugal.
Fresh measures must therefore be adopted, and, as a minimum, the period for maintaining customs barriers must be extended, with a view to protecting manufacturing, as well as employment with rights.
(FR) I am very pleased that the 25 Member States of the European Union have at last adopted definitive anti-dumping measures in relation to the import of Chinese and Vietnamese shoes.
European manufacturers were suffering heavy losses in their export market and were victims of unfair competition.
It was therefore right to apply the trade defence instruments which the European Union has at its disposal, instruments that, I would remind you, were approved by the WTO.
Furthermore, I wonder about Mr Mandelson's desire to fight against protectionism and about his assimilation of it, in the context of future reform - the Global Europe communication - with trade defence instruments.
I am not in favour of protected markets, shielded from competition, disconnected from all the developments brought about by globalisation.
Nonetheless I am in favour of applying the legal rules when, in the markets, the competition is unfair.
Therefore, the safeguards or anti-dumping measures must under no circumstances be put in the same category as protectionist instruments.
The purpose of these instruments is to protect European manufacturers against unfair competition, by requiring compliance with the rules defined by the WTO.
I ask the Commissioner, Mr Mandelson, therefore, what the aim of this reform will really be: to adapt these instruments or to weaken them?
European Agency for Reconstruction (debate)
The next item is the report by Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction - C6-0170/2006 -.
Mr President, Honourable Members, I would like to thank Mr Kacin very much for the positive assessment of our proposal in his report.
Let me first explain the rationale of the proposal.
At the end of an era of reconstruction, and in view of the preparations for accession, we decided to reassess the mechanisms for assistance implementation in the Balkans, including the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction.
We explained our views on the future of the Agency in a report issued in December last year, which was transmitted to the Council and the European Parliament for information.
The need to prepare the beneficiary countries to assume their own financial responsibility for the implementation of EU assistance led the Commission to the conclusion to discontinue the Agency but to seek its extension for two years until 31 December 2008, with its current mandate and status, and gradually to phase out its activities under CARDS.
In the mean time, the Commission will prepare the programming and implementation of the instrument for Pre-Accession in a deconcentrated manner through our delegations in the countries concerned from next year onwards.
So we have both phasing-out and phasing-in going on at the same time.
The current Regulation expires on 31 December 2006, and, therefore, it is important that the amending regulation is adopted well before the end of the year in order to provide continuity in the implementation of CARDS and legal certainty for the staff of the Agency.
A number of administrative decisions will have to be taken directly following the adoption of this regulation before the end of the year.
On the phasing-out of the Agency, the Commission is committed to ensuring an efficient phasing-out and at the same time a phasing-in of the EU delegation's liaison office in order to deliver aid without disruption and in a cost-effective manner.
This is a complex process in terms of transferring staff (to the extent possible), transferring files, closing all remaining financial activities and making all necessary arrangements to ensure sufficient premises for the reinforced Commission delegations.
The Director-General of DG Enlargement has created a Task Force at director level to monitor and steer this process.
The Commission welcomes Mr Kacin's proposal for regular reporting to the European Parliament 'on the ongoing operational details of the transfer plan'.
My services will always be at your disposal to reply to your questions and to provide you with updated information on a regular basis.
However, for the sake of legal clarity, I would prefer that this amendment is not included in the text of the amending regulation, the purpose of which is merely to extend the mandate of the Agency for an additional two years.
As rapporteur for Serbia and rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for Albania, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I have been following the political circumstances in the region very closely.
I am aware of the fact that the phasing out of the Agency will coincide with a period of critical developments in the Western Balkans.
We have already witnessed Montenegro's declaration of independence, and now we are facing not only the prospect of local, parliamentary and presidential elections but also, on top of that, the constitutional referendum in Serbia.
This will take place by the end of the year and, although in theory it should not affect the timetable for deciding the future status of Kosovo, it will nonetheless do so in practice.
For this reason, I have also drafted two amendments that I will proceed to present.
As I stated when presenting my report to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I support the Commission's proposal for phasing out the Agency by extending its mandate for a further two years.
The Agency will retain and renew its current status and mandate, together with its activities under the CARDS programme, but it will be phased out and replaced by Commission delegations and offices that will manage the IPA, our new financial instrument.
The Agency was founded in 2000 as the principal EU office for reconstruction in war-ravaged Kosovo.
It later extended its operations to Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Agency is independent and its mandate is renewed successively every year by the Council and the European Parliament.
Hence, even as far back as its founding, it operated on the premise that it was a temporary body and that it would ultimately be replaced.
Now, ten years after the Kosovo crisis, it is obvious that the current interim arrangements are inadequate and inappropriate.
The countries of the Western Balkans are in a state of transition from a reconstruction phase to a phase of preparation for their prospective membership of the European Union.
Streamlining the European Union's activities by devolving them to Commission delegations is therefore the appropriate and correct way of demonstrating our political commitment to the countries of the Western Balkans.
This will also ensure that we make the best use of EU taxpayers' money.
Beginning to phase out the Agency now, at a time when activities under the CARDS programme are also being discontinued and replaced by the new financial instrument that is the IPA is both sensible and timely.
I firmly believe that the new streamlined and rationalised arrangements for the political and financial assistance offered by the EU will have positive effects on the political and economic stability of the region.
The draft amendment in my original proposal recommended that, in order to coordinate our positions with the Commission, we draw up a detailed report on our organisational plans for devolution.
As the Commissioner has informed us, my later recommendation envisaged instead a draft amendment which would oblige the Commission to report to Parliament and the Council on the situation in this region on a quarterly basis.
However, the devolution process must be continuous.
The quarterly reports would need to include brief information on the progress of the devolution of individual duties from the Agency to the individual delegations, as well as an assessment of their cooperation in the quarterly period.
The reports would need to include new facts that have been gathered since the last report or will shortly be gathered, and would also need to set new objectives that need to be met.
Likewise, the reports would need to include an overview of devolution in practice in the beneficiary countries, particularly in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is still a candidate country, but unfortunately at present still does not have a date for the commencement of negotiations.
In the context of these reports, the Commission would also need to present measures which it intends to adopt in order to promote regional projects after the Agency ceases to operate.
