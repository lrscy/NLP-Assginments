The Schengen Facility, providing nearly EUR 1 billion, enabled the new Member States to meet, in particular, the challenge of building up an efficient border control and becoming full partners in the Schengen area.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the European Parliament for their positive support in reaching this fundamental achievement, and last, but not least, I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency.
I congratulate you personally, and Ministers of the Interior, Minister Costa and Minister Pereira, on your strategic partnership and clarity of purpose for the successful implementation of the Schengen information system project, known as 'SIS One For All'.
We have worked hard, together with the former German and the future Slovenian Presidencies, to support our Portuguese colleagues, and we have succeeded.
This shows what can be accomplished if everyone is fully committed to a complex project.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, work is not finished.
Our ultimate goal is to make Schengen Information System II fully operational by December 2008.
We will again have to work very hard together.
rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Schengen area is one of the greatest successes in the history of European integration.
Abolishing internal borders and implementing several compensatory measures, such as the reinforcement of controls at the external borders, police and judicial cooperation and the creation of the Schengen Information System, are the best way to enable freedom of movement.
Like the European Union, Schengen has grown.
From the five original Member States, we are now 15, including two non-Community countries, Iceland and Norway, and with the partial participation of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
We are now facing an historic event: the biggest enlargement in Schengen's history, with the simultaneous abolition of internal borders with nine Member States: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia and Malta.
This is an event full of significance for Europe, for free movement and for these new Member States and their citizens.
I must start by welcoming and congratulating them.
I want to congratulate them not only on their entry into this area but also, in particular, on the systematic and committed effort that they have made to meet all the requirements laid down by the strict Schengen rules.
The December 2006 reports, already mentioned by Minister MagalhÃ£es, highlighted various problems which have in the main been overcome.
The evaluation teams were composed of experts from all the Member States.
They went to the borders and consulates and prepared exhaustive reports containing factual descriptions, assessments and recommendations, many of which required additional measures and follow-up visits due to the problems that still existed in the vast majority of Member States.
I want to congratulate the evaluation team, led by Dr Carlos Moreira, not only for the exacting work carried out in a short space of time, but also because it did not just fulfil its inspection role, it also frequently suggested measures and solutions allowing the problems identified to be solved.
Mr President, the absence of internal borders not only requires better controls at the external borders and a good exchange of information and data through the Schengen Information System (SIS), it is notably an exercise in mutual trust in which everyone must strictly comply with the adopted rules.
Guaranteeing effective control at our borders allows the security of all European citizens to be ensured.
In fact, the security of the Schengen area depends on the rigour and efficiency that each Member State applies to controls at its external borders and also on the quality and rapidity of the exchange of information via the SIS.
Any weakness or incorrect working of any of these elements is liable to jeopardise the security of the Union.
That is why the remaining minor problems must be ironed out.
Although they do not constitute an obstacle to abolishing the internal borders, they must be solved.
That is why the European Parliament, in the political resolution to be adopted, which has been co-signed by five political groups, and in the legislative resolution, asks to be informed in detail within six months about all pending issues.
That is why we also ask that a global evaluation of the functioning of the Schengen area is carried out within two years, involving all the Member States, both new and old.
Finally, I want to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its commitment and spirit of cooperation, in particular the Portuguese Government and the Portuguese Secretary of State, JosÃ© MagalhÃ£es, who is here today, and for the solution found with SISone4all, as already underlined by Vice-President Frattini.
This solution has enabled the new Member States to be connected to the SIS.
If this had not occurred, given the delay with SIS II, it would not have been possible to extend the Schengen area this year.
Minister MagalhÃ£es, I am fully aware of your extensive personal commitment and I also want to congratulate Dr Eduarda Peixeiro, to whom much is owed for the solution adopted.
I have two final comments.
The first is to the European Commission.
I would like to remind it once again that the creation of SIS II continues to be a priority for the European Parliament, not necessarily to allow the new Member States to access the system, as this has been solved with SISone4all, but mainly because, within the Community framework, it will enable more efficient use of data, thereby improving security through both the inclusion of biometric data and the interlinking of alerts.
My second comment is to the Council.
I must express my regret that at the start of this consultation process it did not respect the principle of reasonable cooperation with Parliament as it refused to send the evaluation reports prepared by the experts, on security grounds.
Although a compromise was found to resolve the situation temporarily, a long-term solution must be sought.
It is absurd to deny Parliament material with which it exercises its legislative competences.
Mr President, we have taken another step towards European integration.
It is up to all of us to make sure that this step results in more freedom and greater security.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the European People's Party and European Democrats Group I would like to welcome the introduction of the Schengen system, and to use the occasion on behalf of the nine new Member States to thank both the German and Portuguese Presidencies, the Council, the Commission and especially Mr Coelho for the enormous amount of work needed to achieve this.
I must also mention the efforts of the new Member States, since their work has enabled us to be at this point today.
The free movement of people is one of the four freedoms of the Union.
We are now extending this achievement, this new area of freedom to many millions of new Union citizens.
This is a joint act by all of us: we Europeans have created this together, and we should be proud of it.
Ladies and gentlemen of the House, I come from a town on the border of Austria and Hungary.
For many decades my town, Sopron, was separated from its immediate environment and from Austria by an iron curtain.
I have brought in a piece of this iron curtain to Parliament - as I have many other times.
It was this iron curtain that made it impossible to exercise freedom in Europe.
With the introduction of the Schengen system, we are eliminating the last remnants of it.
This piece of iron should remind us that our recent past did not have freedom, and that we should never allow freedom to be taken away from us.
With freedom comes responsibility.
The new Member States are taking on the responsibility of guarding the common European external borders rigorously, since the security of all of us depends on this.
Furthermore, we must not allow ourselves to undermine widespread social support for the right to move freely.
For this reason every citizen of the Union must comply with the laws of the Union; as Commissioner Frattini said just now, freedom of movement does not mean freedom of crime without borders.
Freedom must not and cannot be abused, because that endangers freedom itself and the right to move freely.
Nor can we allow certain forces to revitalise the principle of collective guilt, which brings bad memories, so as to undermine the right to move freely.
We cannot allow the perpetrators of crimes to go unpunished.
For this very reason, I would like to express my thanks again that the Schengen system can be extended to these nine new Member States.
This is an historical event.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, on behalf of my group I, too, would like to congratulate the citizens of the nine new Member States on the present that the Portuguese Presidency will be giving them on 21 and 22 December.
I am in complete agreement with the Minister and the Presidency, who are indeed dismantling the last remains of the Iron Curtain.
The free movement of citizens without internal borders is a very positive thing and one of the most important freedoms of the European Union, and I welcome the fact that the inhabitants of the nine new Member States will now be able to enjoy it.
The Schengen Agreement, however, concerns more than just the removal of internal borders.
It also means that the external borders of the Union must now be monitored by these new countries, in the interest of all the other Member States.
It is very important that the expansion of the Schengen area does not jeopardise our security.
Mr Frattini and the Minister have both said the same.
Efficient and effective border controls are therefore essential.
The assessment of the Council and the Commission show that the nine countries are in principle ready to take on this task, but that improvements could be made in a number of areas, for example as regards staffing and airport infrastructure, and our curiosity has been aroused as to the evaluations and monitoring that will appear as a result.
We hope, too, that Parliament will be swiftly informed about this.
Schengen of course relates to much more than border controls.
It implies greater police and judicial cooperation between Schengen countries.
We are glad that in the case of these nine Member States the Portuguese Presidency has found a solution with a sort of SIS 1+, although we maintain that progress must be made as soon as possible on SIS II.
I am happy with Mr Frattini's promise to have it by December 2008, and naturally we will hold him to that.
We understand that Bulgaria and Romania still have to wait a number of years, but we also hope that these countries will continue to work hard, with our help, so that in a few years they can also join the Schengen area.
The same applies to Cyprus.
It is a shame that the problem that has been holding the country back for so long is now also preventing it from joining the Schengen area.
That is another argument for working together to find a solution to the problem that has affected this country for too long already.
In other areas, too, for example in relations with Turkey, this question leads to problems.
Naturally a solution is also necessary for the people of Cyprus themselves.
Finally, I want to refer again to yesterday's discussion.
It has rightly been indicated that the enlargement of the Schengen area and the entire Schengen system requires mutual solidarity between the Member States.
As I have already said, controlling the external borders is a task that affects all our security and in which the nine countries concerned are now involved.
We will now speak to them about this.
That security and the need for cooperation are themselves potential future problems, as regards internal migration for example.
We must also agree that we will not try to solve the problems unilaterally, but that we will seek to cooperate, with all the countries that belong to the Schengen area working together to solve the problems that arise in the future.
As I said, we must ensure that what is currently happening in Italy does not happen, i.e. that one country tries to solve on its own what is in fact a shared problem.
Mr President, I would also like to join the congratulators. I congratulate the new Schengen members for having succeeded in the feat of satisfying the requirements of the Schengen rules in such a short space of time.
I would also like to congratulate Portugal, which is a double congratulation.
Portugal was the first to come up with the proposal of "SIS I for Allâ.
Now, under its Presidency, Portugal has had the ability and energy to drive through the evaluation process.
We have heard here what an historic step forward this is.
To reunite Europe also in this form, with free movement, is an achievement which cannot be overestimated.
The road has been difficult. In particular, the problem with SIS II, which has been delayed for reasons which are unacceptable and have been much criticised by Parliament.
As we have heard, we need SIS II in order to strengthen security within the new enlarged area.
Parliament has also been critical of not immediately having had full transparency and access to the evaluation documents.
I would like to give special thanks to my friend and colleague Mr Coelho.
Without his efforts we would not have been able to complete our parliamentary scrutiny.
Finally, I would like to recall that many of the new Member States have long historical ties to their European neighbours.
We must now ensure that the Schengen enlargement does not lead to a Schengen iron curtain against these.
These, our neighbours, must also have access to the knowledge we have here if they are to be able to follow in our footsteps and build up a society governed by the rule of law, democracy and a market economy.
Once again, congratulations to all three parties that have succeeded here.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the Portuguese Presidency on being able to create an agreement and understanding with regard to the enlargement of Schengen, and indeed it is historic.
It ranks there alongside the enlargement of the European Union and it is one that we should welcome.
There are concerns, however, as rightly mentioned by other colleagues, with regard to our external borders and what we can do and how we can deal with them, about the issue of solidarity and about showing solidarity with other Member States.
In particular, from my own position coming from Ireland, because of the common travel area which exists between Ireland and Britain, there are certain difficulties with regard to Ireland becoming part of the Schengen Agreement, for no other reason, maybe, except the most important one of all: that it would reintroduce a border between the north and south of Ireland.
So there is a difficulty there but we do not want to see hindered the progress that is being made.
Now, with your permission, I would like to continue in Irish.
(GA) The EU will continue to grapple with the problems of drug imports into the EU and illicit trafficking in children, as well as addressing itself to common policy on migration, common asylum policy, EU-wide police cooperation, and the fight against organised crime.
Europol is doing a wonderful job in tackling international crime in Europe.
And together we can actually achieve the required double result of free movement of people and security and certainty for all countries.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, first of all, on behalf of my group, I would like to congratulate the new Member States, including my own state, Latvia, on the occasion of joining the Schengen area.
I also thank Portugal for its SIS I initiative, which has opened the way to free movement for many Europeans.
Many thanks to all the people who were involved in this work and did their best in order to make this Christmas gift possible.
In the mean time, a lot of problems still exist in this field.
What has happened with SIS II?
When can it start operating?
We are also worried about the use of sensitive data by SIS II.
The data protection regime applicable to these SIS II rules is unduly complex.
Will we have a political agreement on the third pillar data protection framework decision by the end of this year?
Will the framework decision solve all the problems?
Do data protection authorities have adequate resources to enforce data protection rules in respect of SIS II?
Will all Member States act in good faith when processing Schengen data?
Why am I posing so many questions now?
I just want to remind you that the Schengen system is far from complete.
A good job has been done in order to enlarge the Schengen area, but now we have a new task - maybe a more difficult one - to make the area of freedom and liberty a guaranteed area for everyone.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, on behalf of my Group, believe that today is a very important day because we are extending the possibility of free movement for many Community citizens.
This marks a ground-breaking step forward, about which we are very happy because it guarantees additional freedom of movement.
It is a great achievement, pointing us in the direction of a single European space.
My Group is nevertheless somewhat hesitant about certain other aspects, especially concerning the external dimension of the Schengen area.
We are in fact strengthening the external dimension of the Schengen area, reinforcing and in a sense actually militarising our external borders.
We have grave doubts about this: while guaranteeing ever greater freedom of movement for Community citizens belonging to the Schengen area, we are at the same time impeding access for non-Community citizens.
For this reason we are not happy with the entire process.
Furthermore, we have our doubts about the implementation of SIS II: we are very concerned, and believe that in certain cases these exchanges of information do not afford proper protection for sensitive data.
We therefore think that a very tangible step forward has been taken today in the building of the European Union, yet at the same time we have sent out a very negative signal about the form and substance of this European Union.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to speak on behalf of my colleague Mr Blokland.
In previous weeks it has become clear in the media that since the accession of Romania to the European Union, 500 000 Romanians have already moved to Italy.
There is therefore a great deal of free movement of people within the European Union even without the application of the Schengen acquis.
I am therefore very concerned about the controls on undesirable persons crossing our internal borders.
Italy's decision to turn away European citizens is an extreme measure that clearly shows that open borders can also have negative consequences.
Specific controls will therefore be necessary.
That is possible at the borders, but controls can also be carried out at airports and railway stations.
For this reason it is necessary for a functional SIS to be operational in the short term.
Can the Commission, in its Schengen assessment, also focus on the free movement of people from countries that belong to the Union but not to the Schengen area?
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, we too are pleased that the Iron Curtain which the Communists drew across Europe for more than half a century, with such contempt for human dignity, is finally down.
I say this as an Austrian, for whom access to our neighbours, the Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and Slovenians, is now open again, just as it was a hundred years ago.
May I nonetheless voice a point of criticism: on a decision of such gravity, the fact that the Schengen Information System is functioning properly is by no means enough.
In my view, the new guardians of the external borders must actually have the capacities to perform their role.
If we consider that some EU countries in East Central Europe were still major transit countries in 2006 and that the figures for the apprehension of illegal immigrants were far higher at the EU's previous Schengen borders in Austria and Germany than at the EU's external borders, we cannot afford to ignore this concern.
Nonetheless, it is a very good thing that the Iron Curtain has finally been consigned to history.
(SK) I believe that the new Member States, including the Slovak Republic, are all well prepared to join the Schengen area.
The Slovak Republic has fulfilled the individual criteria in the area of Schengen cooperation and has therefore fulfilled all the basic conditions, so that Slovak citizens will be able to enjoy the removal of internal border controls on the ground from December 2007 and from March 2008 in the air as well.
The Slovak Republic implemented the Schengen acquis in regard to the Schengen Information System by 1 September 2007 and police information is now flowing through the system in both directions.
We have built a network of points of contact to facilitate the exchange of data from police information systems. Our border protection and control are now in compliance with requirements of the Schengen border code.
The shortcomings identified in personal data protection and at Bratislava airport have been remedied.
After three and a half years of EU membership, there are no longer any obstacles to Slovak citizens at last getting the right to which they are entitled under the EC Treaty, the right to the free movement of persons.
I trust that the European Union will soon grant our citizens another right to which they are entitled, which is the right to work without restrictions in other EU countries and that European Union will no longer give priority to workers from third countries but will instead prioritise EU citizens from the Eastern Europe.
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I myself represent Lower Bavaria, which borders on the Czech Republic, here in the European Parliament.
When I was even younger than I am today, this area really was the end of the world.
Looking at the gallery, I see so many young people in the audience, and I think we can remind ourselves that it is an historic day when these borders finally fall and we are united in Europe.
For that reason, yes, it is a cause for celebration!
As a political representative, may I say in all honesty that many people were not convinced that this would work as well as it has, or that our East European friends, one for all, would implement SIS in this way.
May I express my congratulations and respect for that achievement.
I would also like to thank Carlos Coelho.
The fact that the European Parliament is playing such a major role when it comes to Schengen is due to our rapporteur.
I would like to emphasise that point as well.
However, politicians always have to think of tomorrow and what will be facing us then.
Here, I would like to remind everyone of what the Executive Director of Frontex, Ilkka Laitinen, said at the last meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council: he said that migration flows are already demonstrably changing, away from the southern border across the Mediterranean and towards the eastern border.
That is something we need to prepare for today.
We must also work through the problems identified in the evaluation reports.
That is why the evaluation clause proposed by Parliament is so important.
We need SIS II and may I appeal to the Vice-President of the Commission not to cease applying pressure here, for it is important that Member States resist any temptation to sit back and say, that is it, we have done it.
We need the same level of commitment from them when it comes to the implementation of SIS II as well.
Once we have open borders for citizens, we will also have open borders for criminals, and when we have open borders for criminals, we need open borders for our police as well.
For that reason, there must be no slackening of commitment now when it comes to the PrÃŒm Treaty; we need closer cooperation here too.
As my fifth point, may I say that there is a need for a strengthening of Frontex.
I would like to see Frontex taking on responsibility for the evaluation of standards at the external borders in future.
We will be celebrating in December, and I hope that what will come afterwards will not be a hangover but the positive memory of the celebration itself and the reasons for it.
(SK) Excuse me, Mr Chairman, excuse me, but I have been informed that the English interpreter said the Czech Republic instead of the Slovak Republic.
I would like to appeal to our interpreters to get used to the fact that Czechoslovakia has been divided into two sovereign states, which also means that in the context of my speech, I meant that it was the Slovak Republic that was fulfilling the conditions.
Thank you, Mrs BelohorskÃ¡.
We are aware of what happened, and you know that we were in fact exceptional witnesses to the situation.
In any case we have taken due note of this, and if any corrections are necessary they will be made in due course.
To tell you the truth, I am not altogether sure who you mean, who mentioned Czechoslovakia.
I do not think it came from the Presidency.
(HU) Thank you, Mr President.
Today's decision is truly symbolic, and it can be experienced most keenly by those of us who grew up behind the barbed-wire fence, who were able to cross the border to the West every three years, and who today can remember the stomach-churning moment of crossing the border.
Hungary implemented the necessary legislation by 2004, the time of the accession.
Since then, it has developed its system of instruments necessary for Schengen protection.
The inspections have classified the preparations as excellent, both for the land and air borders.
In addition, Hungary will take responsibility for 15% of the eastern border.
We would like to thank the Member States who have shown us solidarity, and especially the Portuguese Presidency, for this opportunity that is full of responsibility.
We would also like to thank the Council for their flexibility, which has enabled us to solve the problem we had with Croatia, and which has also made it possible to resolve the situation of Hungarians living abroad through bilateral agreements, in accordance with their wishes and the approval of neighbouring countries.
Thank you everyone!
Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
Mr President, with the accession of nine new Member States to the Schengen area, which is a true and final falling of the historical Iron Curtain, the EU has truly given the opportunity to their European citizens to travel and fraternise in a reciprocal manner.
Last autumn I drew the attention of the Estonian public to the threat that the accession of the new Member States might be delayed until the beginning of 2009.
I am glad that the European Commission has found the means to speed up the process and I hope that it has not affected the pertinence of the system.
But, besides the positive products of this accession, the EU must be up to the challenge of managing the possible threats that might result from such a vast administrative unit.
The SIS is a necessary safeguard to secure the normal functioning of the Schengen area and it should definitely be left open to future complements.
Now the practice might induce some new issues.
Working off the threats and maintaining a flexible nature is essential for the SIS to address the challenges that this enlargement brings about.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the spirit of the Schengen Treaty is about safeguarding the security of European citizens.
To this end, it is undoubtedly better to have a few queues at borders and in airports rather than allowing free entry not only to decent people but also to the most hardened criminals, whom we do not want in our countries.
We wish to see border checks, for example on Romanian Roma, with compulsory detection of biometric data including digital fingerprints.
We must know who we are allowing into our country, as well as the exact date of entry, so as to be able for example to apply scrupulously the European Directive enabling us - as pointed out just a moment ago - to expel after three months anyone who lacks the funds to support themselves.
Romano Prodi's Commission made commitments to the new Member States without giving any consideration at all to emergencies, of which there have been several since then.
They are now giving rise to appalling security problems, and the European Union must think not only about European citizens' rights, but also about their security.
Security is an inalienable right, a natural right.
Action is now required, and Commissioner Frattini is quite rightly sending out well-balanced, positive signals in this regard, but we should not forget that Schengen must also concern itself with checks at the European Union's external borders, and must do so ever more efficiently.
We have nothing against any ethnic group or population group, still less against our brothers in Eastern Europe; however, we do not want criminals moving around freely in our land.
Padania is a land of honest, hard-working people.
Its doors are open only to those who come to work, who behave well and - as befits the European Union's area of justice and freedom - who abide by the rules, namely the rules of honesty and law and order.
(CS) The history of the enlargement of the Schengen area is marked by double standards.
In 1995 the three new Schengen states only had to fulfil a few formalities.
In 2004, however, the new Member States were subjected to a series of humiliating controls and assessments lasting three and a half years.
There were objections from Germany and Austria in particular, which maintained that enlarging the existing Schengen Information System to include the new countries was not possible.
In the end this problem was overcome thanks to the Portuguese Presidency, which is to be highly commended for having been able to overrule these voices.
SISone4all now fulfils all the requirements.
The new Members are now ready to ensure adequate security of the Schengen area.
There are a few issues that have yet to be resolved, such as data protection, perhaps even protection of the new Member States against the transport of toxic substances, such as in the case of Germany and the Czech Republic.
I believe, however, that all these issues will be successfully dealt with and that Europe will not in the process become some sort of enclosed fortress.
I hope that Europe will continue to be open to collaboration with other nations of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.
Without Eastern Europe and the Balkans, Europe is not and will never be complete.
(NL) Mr President, like the European Ministers of Home Affairs this Parliament is now giving the green light to the extension of the Schengen system to the Member States that joined in 2004.It will be a relief to many.
However, I am somewhat less euphoric about Schengen itself: the fact is that the European policy of open borders also noticeably strengthens the scope of international organised crime.
As a result, Schengen has a spill-over effect.
The system of open borders has always demanded a further transfer of competences and ever-closer police cooperation, which will eventually result in a full-blown European police force, prosecutors and criminal law, with their positive but also their negative aspects.
However, the policy of open borders renders the individual Member States powerless in the face of the regularisation programmes for illegal migrants adopted in certain countries - I am thinking of Spain and Italy in particular - which always attract more migrants to Europe's poorly protected borders.
The famous European solidarity is completely lacking here and this has to be said.
(PL) Mr President, the decision on the Schengen issue was mission impossible, as Mr MagalhÃ£es stated.
It proves that if there really is a will to do so, it can be possible to interconnect in practice the areas of freedom for the citizens of Europe, including the freedom to travel, whilst simultaneously reinforcing security for those same citizens, that is to say, internal security.
Preparations for this decision have lasted at least 10 years, and have been very intense in the last two of these.
In its present form, the Schengen project is quite different from what it was in the mid-1980s. The main difference is that it is now fully enshrined in the Community's legal and organisational order.
In other words, as far as the new countries are concerned, the question is not if but when we will begin to benefit fully from the Schengen area.
At this juncture one is inclined to indulge in historical and symbolic reminiscences.
After the Second World War the issue of borders and their control resulted in bloody dividing lines being drawn across the map of Europe.
Crossing a border often meant risking one's life.
As things now stand we can state that part of our post-war legacy has gone forever.
The new countries have come through the preparatory stage with flying colours.
It is abundantly obvious that many of the solutions adopted by Poland and other new Member States can and do serve as examples for current members of the Schengen area.
The wind of change from the new countries will be an inspiration for the old Union, not a threat.
It will also help to increase mutual trust.
The Schengen enlargement process also constitutes a challenge and hard work for us in Parliament.
On a personal level, I was honoured to be able to work with such a distinguished rapporteur as Mr Coelho, with my colleagues from the group, and with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs.
I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its tremendous determination. Thanks are also due to Mr Frattini for his favourable attitude and commitment to this splendid achievement, which is without precedent in the course of history.
(DE) Mr President, extending the Schengen area to include nine new Member States is an historic step which completes the enlargement of the European Union and dismantles those borders where once the Iron Curtain separated our nations.
There were those who believed, in advance of the process, that it was too early to do this, but we can now allay those fears.
The most recent evaluation has shown that the new Members are implementing the Schengen acquis to everyone's satisfaction.
Let us be honest: border controls and the traffic jams which they produced have only ever made a limited contribution to our countries' security.
Real cross-border organised crime can only be combated effectively through intensive cooperation by our police and security agencies.
This cooperation must be improved in future, and everyone is invited to play a role here.
After all, among the old Member States, Germany is one of the countries whose borders have been most affected by the removal of controls.
I would therefore like to welcome the citizens of our neighbour countries to our common area of free movement.
May I say that people in our own countries - in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Spain - will benefit from the newly acquired freedom as well, whether during their vacations or a visit to friends.
On 21 December, Europe will move a step closer together.
This is good for its people, and it is good for Europe.
(PT) Once again, many thanks to Mr Coelho, our President-in-Office and Commissioner Frattini.
(PL) Mr President, Poland is to join the Schengen area on 21 December of this year along with other new Member Sates.
This will represent a further significant step towards full membership of the European Union.
We would therefore like to say how much we welcome this development.
The next stage will be joining the euro zone.
Joining the Schengen area does not amount to turning our backs on our Eastern neighbours.
We shall try to facilitate entry into Poland for their citizens within the framework of the Schengen commitments.
Allow me to emphasise, however, that we shall only do so in accordance with our commitments as members of the Schengen area.
(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President.
The new Europe is now coming into our reach, in that the dividing lines that were drawn up so skilfully in the past have ceased to exist, and this will have a bigger impact than anything else on the everyday lives of all of us who live in the area.
I would like to congratulate and thank the Portuguese Presidency for creating the opportunity and the technical framework for the events of today.
We would like to thank Commissioner Frattini for the help that these Member States have received.
Last, but not least, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Coelho, for his sense of vocation in dealing with this matter.
We can now feel the advantages of enlargement as a physical reality, and also the symbolic and practical importance of being able, for example, to cross the bridges of the Danube without checks, or rowing across the Danube, which was an inconceivable dream for our parents.
The precious desires of generations are coming true.
In this way, history now admits that our young heroes of 1956 were right.
At the same time, we must do everything to extend this zone as soon as possible to Bulgaria and Romania, who acceded recently.
In this latter case - for example in the case of Transylvania - the Romanian-Hungarian border will be so important, and it can only be compared to what must have been felt when the Franco-German border was dissolved, by the people living there.
At the same time, we cannot forget that checks will be even more stringent at the external borders of the Schengen zone.
For this reason, the ethnic groups living outside our borders, the Hungarians living in Vojvodina and Subcarpathia, will be at a disadvantage: our close contact with them is a condition for their staying there and a constitutional obligation for us.
The external borders cannot turn into a new iron curtain for these communities.
It is only in this way, paying attention to those who remain outside, that the celebrations for opening up the borders can be complete for us.
Thank you for the floor.
(PL) Mr President, along with previous speakers I would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency for its very determined work on enlarging the Schengen system.
I welcome the fact that one of the last remaining differences of treatment between citizens of the old and the new Union will disappear on 21 December of this year.
In particular, as a Pole I am proud that my country is responsible for the control of more than 1 200 kilometres of the Union's external land border, and that the FRONTEX agency is located in Warsaw.
At the same time I should like to emphasise that the Schengen system is not intended to isolate the Union from its neighbours.
It does not aim to create a so-called fortress Europe. I think we should take this opportunity to send out a signal from the House to our neighbours beyond the Union's borders, including the citizens of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, making it clear that the strengthened Union border is certainly not a wall to defend ourselves against them.
We must let it be known that it is simply a feature of our security as a Union, and that we shall not cease being good neighbours.
(HU) The entry of nine Member States is a significant step forward in the field of integration, both for the European Union and for the Member States concerned.
There will finally be a tangible benefit for citizens from membership of the European Union.
Thanks for this are due to the Portuguese Presidency, which has done everything for us to join at the planned date, in 2007, even though there were attempts to prevent this.
The Member States concerned are also due recognition for making great efforts to fulfil the stringent criteria and conditions.
It is very important that no new iron curtain should fall between the countries that have just joined and their neighbouring countries.
The agreements on easing visa procedures and local border traffic might be a great help in this, but the ultimate goal in any case is to achieve visa exemption.
A specific, realistic timetable is needed for this, to enable the creation of visa exemption as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Welcome
We are pleased to welcome an EFTA delegation to our gallery today, led by Mrs KatrÃ­n JÃºlÃ­usdÃ³ttir, with members from Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, along with some observers from Switzerland.
The delegation is visiting the House as part of the 29th session of the European Economic Area Joint Parliamentary Committee, which will be meeting here in Strasbourg on 14 and 15 November.
I wish our colleagues every success with the EEA Agreement, and with the future prospects of the area, energy issues and climate change, as well as their talks with Commissioner Borg on EU maritime policy, which are on the agenda of the discussions.
I am also very pleased they have decided to pay a visit to the European Parliament during our part-session.
I thank you all and welcome you here today.
(Applause)
Application of the Schengen acquis - Application of the Schengen acquis in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (continuation of debate)
The next item is the debate on the Council Declaration on application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, and on the report by Carlos Coelho on the application of the Schengen acquis in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.
(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the Portuguese Government for the technical solution it proposed regarding the transitional period.
This will allow the new Member States to join SIS before the end of the current year, in advance of the new system being confirmed and implemented by the Commission.
I am pleased for my fellow citizens who will be travelling back to Poland for Christmas.
This time they will be spared having to spend long hours queuing waiting to cross the border on the way home.
All this has only become possible, however, because following the initial difficulties experienced, each and every one of the countries involved has set to and tackled the problems arising in connection with implementation of the SIS system, adapting it to local conditions.
(SK) I would also like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Portuguese Presidency for its initiative and for finding a solution by proposing SISone4all, which enabled nine new Member States to join the Schengen area.
The historic significance of this step for the citizens of those countries cannot be doubted.
Not only does it make the principle of free movement of people a reality, it also represents a historic step towards the reunification of Europe.
I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Carlos Coelho, for his excellent work and for a remarkable grasp of all the issues.
Thanks are also due to Commissioner Frattini for his great commitment and all the help with fulfilling the Schengen criteria.
It was stressed a few times in the report that joining the Schengen area was a matter of mutual trust and I believe that trust is also the underlying theme of our present debate.
It is quite clear that border security is not just an issue of technology but also of mutual trust.
However, this works both ways.
More technologically advanced systems would also undoubtedly help individual Member States to trust the countries protecting the security of the Union's external borders.
We must therefore ask why and how much longer we have to wait for SIS II, which will increase security and facilitate both judicial and police cooperation between Member States in this area.
Prolonging the existence of temporary solutions is both costly and inadequate compensation for the non-existence of SIS II.
I also want to support the amendment tabled on the fulfilment of the Schengen criteria, which states that Parliament should be informed within six months of the assessment of the situation in the Member States.
We should not see a repeat of the situation when the Commission did not want to provide the Parliament with information that was vital for its decision-making.
Mr President, the joy of the magnificent Christmas present among the 21st century new European citizens is understandable.
The expansion of the Schengen area - this special Portuguese flavour - is a historic event of great psychological and symbolic magnitude, lifting not only the borders and divisions in Europe.
Yet, whilst for us it is now possible to travel from the Baltic Vilnius to the Atlantic Lisbon, a new European curtain is being pulled in front of Ukraine, Russia, Moldova and Belarus, a financial and bureaucratic one in place of that very old iron.
Not so long ago, our neighbours could travel visa-free to many new Schengen countries, but now they must pay between EUR 35 and 60.
This is a quarter or even a third of a monthly salary in some of these countries.
We do not need the fortress of Europe while the Schengen acquis, with some improvements, is the key to a stronger and more inclusive Europe.
(LT) I cannot help welcoming and rejoicing at the eminent enlargement of the Schengen area, which is due to take place at the end of this year.
The concepts of 'Schengen' and 'roaming' are the notions best understood by EU citizens. They can see them actually working; everyone has been influenced by them in one way or another.
For most Europeans they are closely associated with the notion of a united Europe.
The accession of nine new Member States is a historical step not just for Lithuania, but for Europe as a whole.
For Lithuania it spells another sequential step towards deeper European integration.
The preparation has required a lot of work and effort.
I am glad that the experts have assessed these efforts and found them to be acceptable and that all nine candidates will be able to join, having successfully 'passed the test'.
I would like to thank the presiding country, Portugal, for having come up with the solution regarding the Schengen Information System, which has prevented our countries from wasting several years.
(PL) Mr President, it emerges from the report by Mr Coelho that nine new Member States are properly prepared for their land borders to be opened on 21 December this year and for their air borders to be opened on 30 March 2008.
Despite earlier concerns, all these countries have managed to catch up and establish an information system allowing data to be exchanged between organisations responsible for protection of the Union's external borders.
Consequently, the principle of the free movement of persons will be implemented approximately three years after these countries acceded to the Union.
I would remind the House that this is one of the four key principles governing the operation of the European Union.
It was also a good thing that the Council of the European Union responded to the European Parliament's hopes, taking the formal decision to open the borders during the night between 20 and 21 December of this year.
This will be a very special Christmas present for the many thousands of Europeans travelling between the old and the new Member States during the Christmas and New Year holiday period.
(MT) I would like to start by joining my fellow Members in thanking and expressing my best wishes to Mr Coelho for the useful work that he has done.
Mr President, the enlargement of the Schengen area is not just another historical step in Europe's development; more than that, it is a major acquisition for European citizens, as it gives them new rights.
Mr President, we sometimes forget that there was once a time when, wherever you went in Europe, immigration officials would stamp your passport.
In order to leave your country and enter it again you had to fill in an embarkation form to advise authorities where you were going and how long you would be away.
On arrival you again passed through immigration control, waited in the queue and were then quizzed: why have you come, what are you going to do, how long are you staying?
They almost treated you with suspicion rather than welcoming you, which annoyed many people.
On returning to your country you went through the same thing, with controls in the country of departure and controls when you returned to your own country.
We should not forget as well that until a short while ago customs officials checked your baggage, asking you what you had bought, how much you had spent, as if you had some form of contraband.
Mr President, this is not 50 years ago; this is just a short time ago.
Now, finally, the controls are going to end once and for all.
This means that a country is in the Schengen area.
When you travel within the Schengen area, you are as free as you are within your own country; you leave your country, you arrive in another, and you return without controls, without stamps, without borders, without questions.
The sense of freedom brought by the freedom of movement without controls is a major acquisition that we really appreciate as one of the greatest successes of the European Union.
More and more, for those of us who come from islands, Schengen unites us, builds a bridge between the periphery and the centre; for us, Schengen means a sense of liberty, it means a sense of liberation.
- (SK) The creation of the Schengen area, which does away with controls at the internal borders between all the participating states and thus makes free movement of persons a reality throughout the EU territory, can rightly be considered to be one of the EU's greatest achievements.
The citizens of the countries joining that area in December will welcome our decision as one that is in the interests of the people, making their right to free movement a reality.
However, the enlargement of the Schengen area also requires the introduction of some compensatory measures, including the introduction of effective controls at the external borders, better cooperation between the administration, police, customs and judicial authorities, a common visa policy and the creation of the Schengen Information System.
The Slovak Government has, according to all the assessments, completed the preparatory phase very successfully and I am honoured to be able to declare in the European Parliament today that the Slovak Republic is fully prepared to join the Schengen area.
(LT) Today we are about to finalise the discussion on the application of the Schengen aquis provisions in the new Member States.
I welcome the fact that all the hard work put in by those countries about to join the Schengen area, together with the efforts of the existing Member States and the Commission, has led to victory.
The creation of the Schengen area is one of the EU's biggest projects.
In order to facilitate its implementation after the expansion in 2004, when we were having difficulties with the realisation of SIS II, the Member States demonstrated true solidarity; Portugal proposed the SISone4all version, enabling the borders to be opened between the 15 existing Member States and the nine new ones before next Christmas.
This means increased freedom of movement within Europe, and it is also a rational decision, preventing new Member States from incurring losses because of the delay in setting a date for the application of SIS II.
SISone4all, which is due to operate for nearly a year, will facilitate the movement of persons while at the same time having a beneficial impact on the countries' economic growth.
(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of Schengen is an event for all 500 million Europeans and, in fact, for the whole world.
By removing controls on its internal borders, the European Union is putting an end to an age which was characterised by division and opposition - East and West.
I spent my childhood and teenage years in the Soviet Union.
I remember the anxiety engendered by the knowledge that the land and sky were closed off, that the soldiers of the army of occupation were protecting the iron curtain.
The accession to Schengen marks the final liberation from the past.
The disappearance of borders is a powerful symbol for 75 million Europeans.
The nine countries acceding to Schengen are ready to take on the changes in data exchange which go hand in hand with the privilege of free movement.
My home country, Estonia, protects one of our external borders.
I am nevertheless disappointed that this historic occasion has been split into two smaller events for no convincing reason because air frontiers will not, of course, disappear for eastern Europeans until the end of next March.
(MT) I wish to share some ideas regarding Schengen and the way in which I see it.
For me, it is not just a matter of what is in the Treaty and what it will provide or the rules that are applied; I see it as part of a process, part of an important process to include diverse European States - in this case two EFTA states - and help them to feel more integrated and move closer to each other.
Although we have this independent and sovereign quality, we should on the other hand be proud that we are part of something whole.
In this case, entry and exit through common borders - because they are going to become common borders - are part of a process like that of the Euro, part of a process through which my country became part of Europe.
We should all be proud that we form part of such a wise continent that also exports the values that it believes in.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is total consensus in this House that the imminent enlargement is not only historic but also highly symbolic.
However, this consensus is not only institutional but, much more importantly, it is also social as it is what our citizens rightly want.
It is right that the EU's bodies should listen to its citizens and respond in timely fashion to their aspirations.
This is what we have done.
I am very grateful for the positive comments which have highly praised the work carried out not only by the Portuguese Presidency but also by all those who contributed at just the right time so that the many pieces of this complex puzzle could be readied and slotted together just as they should.
Just one year ago we were facing a very different situation and it is not only a technological feat, which is in itself very important, but also a political feat that our institutions have achieved for our citizens, which reinforces the credibility of these institutions.
Secondly, I must stress that the new external borders are a great Christmas present for our citizens and will be so for many Christmases to come.
However, they also provide a new way of managing external relations as we do not want to create a second generation Iron Curtain for our neighbours.
What we have is the start of an electronic border, vigorous in its interception of criminals and flexible, like everything electronic, in allowing citizens in good faith to pass rapidly through, whoever they may be and wherever they may be coming from.
This is the model that Europe is presenting to the world and this is the commitment to which we are bound.
Thirdly, this work and this achievement are based on meticulous preparation which has left the partner states in the SISone4all project very well provided with equipment and a police preparation logic which we must link with new measures, such as the reinforcement of Frontex recently announced by the Commission and our new model of integrated border management.
This is therefore one more piece in a complex policy that must be pursued and developed.
Fourthly, I should like to underline that one of the secrets to the success of this project is being able to duly combine security and freedom, freedom of movement, much more freedom of movement, with appropriate data protection.
The two things are inseparable.
This is the way forward for Europe and it is fortunately also an important point of consensus between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
There is no other way forward, only this one.
This rule is valid for SISone4all and will also be valid for SIS II, for the second generation Schengen Information System.
This is obvious in the legislation approved with the seal of the European Parliament and is apparent from the suggestions made in the report prepared by Mr Coelho.
I must also say that this applies to the issue of managing confidentiality and transparency.
Confidentiality and transparency can be balanced and an optimum balance must be achieved so that all decision-makers have the necessary information to make decisions in full knowledge of the facts.
This has been achieved in this process and is surely a point which bodes well for future successes in an excellent relationship between the Commission and the Council on this essential point.
Finally, I must also once again stress the importance of the method that we have chosen.
We have not run away from bad news or problems.
In 2006 we realised that there was a serious problem and we took note of this serious problem.
We did not adopt a 'blame-shame' attitude but instead tried to find positive solutions to the problems by ensuring exemplary cooperation among the institutions.
I have no criticisms to make of the Commission's behaviour throughout the process and I consider that the Commission should have no criticisms to make of the Council's behaviour, as managed by the previous German, current Portuguese and future Slovenian Presidencies and other future presidencies.
It is this kind of cooperation that I consider necessary to solve European problems.
To conclude, we must relish the victory and prepare for the future.
I should therefore like to invite the representatives of this House to attend the commemoration, which will be held on 21 and 22 November.
This will be a symbolic journey through sites that were previously symbols of closure and that will, from 21 December, be symbols of the freedom that is the air and oxygen breathing life and happiness into Europe.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.
I too am extremely satisfied with the outcome of this debate.
The result which is within our reach today clearly shows that the countries about to join Schengen on 21 and 22 December, and their citizens, really do deserve this Christmas present, as it were.
They deserve it because, whereas we have worked together over the past 12 to 15 months to overcome certain technical difficulties - and the Portuguese Presidency cannot be praised highly enough - they have played their part too.
They have overcome difficulties and shortcomings - in airports, at border posts and in staff training - which just 12, 13 or 14 months ago seemed hard to overcome.
That is why they really do deserve what has charmingly been called a Christmas present, and I can say so having visited a number of border posts in person, together with many colleagues - Ministers of the Interior - who showed me the enormous progress made between one visit and the next.
I believe that this development is of huge political importance for Europe and has a major social impact, in other words on the citizens.
It is of huge political importance because, from 21 December onwards, each Member State will regard another Member State's external borders as its own.
I, as an Italian, will regard the far-off border between Poland and Ukraine as my own.
That will be my country's border: such is the political impact of this decision that Europe has managed to take within what is a very reasonable period of time.
Then there is the social impact, in other words the impact on our citizens' daily lives which, if I may say so, even goes beyond the symbolic effect of no longer having to queue up at border posts.
It means that every law-abiding European citizen will feel at home in any other country of the European Union.
It means freedom of movement and not having to show one's passport; it does not merely mean not having to queue up for border checks, but rather feeling that European citizenship has become a reality.
Many of you have raised the issue of security, and I entirely agree with what Mr MagalhÃ£es has just said.
Security and freedom must obviously go hand-in-hand.
The more we promote the expansion of this right, this great freedom, the more we must do to prevent criminals from making the most of this great freedom to step up their own dealings and unlawful activities.
That is why this Europe, this large Schengen area, will not be a fortress but certainly will protect EU citizens from criminal comings and goings.
Furthermore, it is obvious for this reason that the Schengen system - currently the 'one for all' Schengen system and soon to be Schengen II - must be equipped with the best technology.
Criminals tend to evade controls, of course, and we must have the technological instruments to prevent that from happening, such as the use of biometrics, showing full respect for everyone's freedom but in order - as it were - to ward off temptation.
One last word: I was struck by what has been said about Europe's neighbours.
Clearly, an enlarged Schengen area must not engender the risk of shutting out those countries which now adjoin the expanded Schengen borders.
As you know, we have to use this Schengen system to monitor and administer 80 000 km of EU external borders, and Frontex will play an ever greater role here.
Just think what an enormous task that is, but we have to perform it.
Well, this must not happen to the detriment of our neighbours, of the relationships some have mentioned: the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans.
We have therefore embarked on a new approach, and I would once again ask you, the European Parliament, now that you are giving the final green light to this action, to confirm your support for the policy which I proposed to the Council and which the Council of Ministers has endorsed.
It is a new-style visa policy, aimed at facilitating the movement of honest people, accompanied by measures on document security, personal identification and the use of biometrics, but which offers citizens now living extremely close to but not within this European area a tangible opportunity to go occasionally to the theatre in Vienna or to see the Coliseum in Rome or to visit Lisbon, without the enormous difficulty and expense currently involved in obtaining a visa.
The new approach is as follows.
Let us make visa policy an instrument of our neighbourhood policy, and let us do so at the same time as enlarging the Schengen area.
This, in my opinion, would hopefully be another political, purely political, step; it is neither a bureaucratic nor a narrowly legal matter.
It is a political message that we can send to other states and their citizens, who are watching us from Europe's neighbourhood but do not need to look on in envy because we are free to move around while they cannot even attend a university course in a European city.
In order to ensure that no such envy exists and that Europe is loved by its neighbours, let us accompany the enlargement of Schengen with a policy of friendship, using visas and greater freedom of movement as a strategic instrument.
To conclude the debate, I have received motions for a resolutionfrom five political groups pursuant to Rule 103(2).
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon.
Written statements (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) We can still remember the fear we felt when we crossed the iron curtain of the time with valid passports in our pockets.
The passport was valid in vain, and we got all the stamps in it in vain, because something could always happen at the border.
Or, if not, we were afraid of it because crossing the border was an extraordinary event in Europe.
Since the iron curtain came down, border traffic has become simpler, but the checks have remained, and the borders can still only be crossed at a few designated places, which primarily made life more difficult for the people living there.
Now that has ended too, and the borders - as Hungarian democrats have wanted for many decades - have 'turned into thin air'.
From now on we shall also find it natural that the people who live near the border can go across into another country just as naturally as from, let's say, Budapest to Budakeszi by car, by the number 22 bus or on foot using footpaths.
Complete freedom of movement without checks is particularly important for people belonging to the same nation who live on both sides of the border.
Recently we have not adopted much legislation that is more important than this, and I am proud that I can be part of this wonderful process!
EUROMED (debate)
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration.
Before handing over to the Council and then the Commission I would ask Members to adhere strictly to their speaking time, for the small leeway that we had has now been used up.
It is true that the previous debate was an important one.
In theory, if everyone observes their speaking time we shall be fine.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the first Euromed Ministerial Conference on Migration will be held in Santa EulÃ¡lia, in the Algarve, Portugal, between 18 and 19 November.
Said like this, it seems the most banal of statements, but it is not.
We have managed to organise this high-level ministerial conference after this was defined as a priority by our Heads of State and Government in November 2005.
That was nearly two years ago, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona Process Summit, when the growing importance of migration issues within our Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was recognised.
Subsequently, as some of you will certainly remember, we had occasion in Rabat, Tripoli to reaffirm our common political agenda.
We did this realistically and lucidly, in the Council's opinion.
There are now, on both sides of the Mediterranean region, sizeable migrant communities which play a very important role in our societies.
We have a duty to give new impetus to the Partnership which can take advantage of the existence of these vigorous communities.
The complexity and significance of migration issues mean that everyone needs to tackle these, both countries of origin and countries of transit and destination.
At this first conference in the Algarve, the Council feels that the debate should be focused on the most pressing issues and only on these, with a step-by-step approach to these issues.
The main items on the agenda will be the priority areas agreed at the Ministerial Meeting in Tampere, namely immigration and development, legal migration and the fight against illegal migration.
These areas cover such important subjects as the framework for migrants' remittances, the new challenge of micro-credit, the opportunities that we are creating in the European Union and on both sides of the Mediterranean for legal migration, the essential issue of document security raised earlier in another respect by Vice-President Frattini - security of travel documents is crucial for allowing migratory flows to develop under secure conditions - and the very important issue of return conditions, where applicable.
I believe that the preparatory work carried out in recent weeks can result in a positive conclusion which bodes well for the debate to be held in the Algarve.
There is a clear determination on both sides to find positive solutions and concrete measures and to agree and implement these measures.
In this respect, the Council informs the European Parliament of its conviction that the conference will reach agreement on concrete measures that will enable us to take our Partnership forward.
We hope that these efforts will result in a final statement which, due to the careful process of preparation, will receive ministerial approval in the Algarve.
This statement must unequivocally define the main priorities and will also determine the specific projects to be implemented in the short term.
We therefore consider that this initiative is developing in a positive framework and will prove to be inspiring and a significant moment in our Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
This is the Council's duty and also the result that we want, and it is fully within our reach.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, improving migration management in the Mediterranean region will certainly be one of the priorities for the EU and its Euromed partners.
Too many people are drowning, and we are not benefiting sufficiently from the potential that well-managed migration can bring.
At the summit in 2005, which was just mentioned, the Euromed Heads of State and Government adopted a work programme that set goals for cooperation on migration, social integration, justice and security.
Now, thanks to the excellent initiative taken by the Portuguese Presidency, ministers responsible for migration will have the opportunity to take the next steps in making the cooperation more concrete.
It promises to be a big milestone.
I welcome the Presidency's emphasis on concrete operational outcomes from the conference, because our citizens want to see very concrete results.
The three themes for this meeting are well balanced and fully in line with the global approach.
First of all, legal migration: we live in a world of increasing mobility, and well-managed migration is in the interests of all partners.
The European Union needs migration in full respect of the law.
The need for workers in many Member States of the EU is already evident, for example, in agriculture, health care and tourism.
However, the European Union needs to be able to manage and integrate these migrants.
We need to match skills better than in the past and we have to prepare migrants for their life in the EU and their eventual return if their migration is temporary or circular in nature.
No migratory strategy is possible unless a European policy towards integrating migrants who live and work in the EU is in full respect of the law.
We will be discussing how to use the European Integration Fund that, for the first time, is available in the EU, thanks to a proposal made a year and a half ago by the Commission and endorsed by the Council and this Parliament.
We need to make Europe more attractive to legal migrants.
Our recent proposal for a European 'Blue Card' for highly skilled migrants is the first example and relevant to the Euromed context.
Next year's legislative initiatives for unskilled and seasonal migrants and remunerated trainees will follow.
The proposals to launch discussions on these matters with our Euromed partners seem to me logical and timely.
The second point is migration and development.
In order to be successful in managing migration, we must also address the main roots of migration, such as economic disparity, lack of career opportunities, instability, poor governance etc. Good cooperation with partner countries and detailed knowledge of the situation on the ground in terms of labour needs, skilled shortages and capacity-building requirements are essential to this effort.
That is why ministers will discuss with the Commission the concrete proposals on migrant remittances and how they could be made more productive for development - a debate that is to be welcomed.
The third area of discussion is illegal migration, because to be comprehensive we must also tackle illegal migration and protect European external borders.
Our Euromed partners are countries of destination, transit and origin.
We should aim to establish cooperation to prevent people drowning at sea.
At the Euromed Conference we will be talking with ministers about cooperation and a possible new role for Frontex in search and rescue activities, not only in patrolling and the return of illegal migrants.
In doing so, we need to ensure that we respect our obligations when it comes to international protection and human rights.
We would support a development whereby Frontex becomes a tool of support for third countries in their efforts to better manage migration and control their borders by fully respecting international obligations.
We are looking forward to this ministerial meeting.
Migration is a subject of vital interest to us all, and that raises strong passions at Member State and Community level.
It is no different in our partner countries.
However, working together is the only way to move forward.
I would say cooperation alone is no longer sufficient.
We need partnership based on shared goals and on equality of all partners.
We need political packages, including measures to improve both the movement of honest people and respect of national and European laws, and to increase local growth rates in the origin countries.
Finally, I believe that the ministers will be successful in identifying concrete areas for cooperation.
The Commission stands ready to support the implementation process, including in financial terms.
We are committed to supporting such actions through the MEDA Programme, as well as the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument and the new thematic programmes.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I certainly welcome this meeting with the Mediterranean partners.
I would, however, have preferred the Ministers for Foreign Affairs to be present, as at the Europe-Africa meeting in Rabat.
Why?
I wanted them here to emphasise the fact that immigration must be a major issue in our relations with the countries of the southern Mediterranean.
These are neighbouring countries with vast income differences.
Many of their nationals are now working to the north of the Mediterranean and their transfer constitute an essential development issue, as has already been said.
These countries are experiencing considerable growth of their population, a population now seeking a better life in Europe.
We are suffering the effects of illegal immigration from these countries, which in turn are also countries of transit for sub-Saharan emigrants.
This means that the integration of residents, the connection between immigration and development and illegal immigration are of vital importance.
Thus the ministerial meeting in the Algarve has plenty of work to do.
We discussed immigration in the House recently: I am referring to the Klich and Moreno reports.
I trust that due consideration will be given to them in the discussions.
I would just like to make a few comments in this respect.
The first is the need to ensure that the southern countries cooperate closely with us to control migratory flows and to encourage them with what I would call 'positive conditionality'.
The phenomenon of immigration is much easier to control where there is political will to do so.
Results are achieved if a neighbour really wishes to cooperate.
Secondly, illegal immigration is still very much a current issue.
We must prevent illegal immigrants arriving by sea; these immigrants are also risking their lives.
There are even children, victims of the activities of those who deal unscrupulously in human lives.
The Mediterranean countries must be asked to sign and ratify the two Protocols to the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime in relation to trafficking in persons.
Thirdly, I must reiterate the need to draw up readmission agreements.
This has been done with Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, so why has it not yet been done with Morocco after so many years?
What is happening with Algeria?
I wish the Euromed Conference every success, Mr President.
I hope that the participants secure specific commitments and solid agreements that will actually be implemented and not end up as a mere juxtaposition of mutual wishes not subsequently followed up in practice.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Monsieur le PrÃ©sident, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, scientists claim that almost two million years ago climate change led to the first large-scale migration from Africa to Europe.
In our age, although climate change may have something to do with it, poverty and a dearth of freedom and opportunities are still the main reasons why large numbers of emigrants risk their lives for a better deal on our continent.
The challenge we face as Europeans is to make immigration a genuine part of development for both countries of origin and countries of destination, and have development make its contribution to reducing illegal immigration.
This is why we must work alongside countries of origin and transit towards true mobility for a workforce with rights and obligations, not a workforce of slaves.
I therefore wish to reiterate that we need dialogue, cooperation and solidarity to build a cohabitation space between the north and south of the Mediterranean.
Therefore we wholeheartedly welcome this Euromed Summit in accordance with the Ministerial Conferences in Rabat and Tripoli.
Dialogue between countries of origin and transit and European states receiving immigrants must be institutionalised in order to provide a cornerstone for a genuine association based on development.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to take a look at a number of areas that could be examined during the summit.
Immigrants must enter Europe and work there in full respect of the law.
This means that initiatives such as the Blue Card directive constitute a necessary step, but this is not sufficient.
It must be enhanced by a directive applicable to less highly skilled immigrants and accompanied by measures to increase circular migration, genuine circular migration that prevents a brain drain and allows returning emigrants to carry through vital projects in their own countries, with the proper social and economic conditions to do so.
The Euromed space must be an area of prosperity, freedom and development.
We must continue to explore, as Spain is now doing with a number of these countries, the possibility of hiring and training workers at origin by creating workshop schools and vocational training facilities there.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us send a clear message through information campaigns on the chance of emigrating and working legally in Europe, and a warning as to the futile risks of illegal emigration to prevent thousands of young people from falling into the hands of mafias and risking their lives in ramshackle boats or canoes.
Finally, I wish to ask for particular attention to be paid at the summit to the most vulnerable emigrants, women and children, especially unaccompanied children.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, these matters will be discussed at a meeting to be held here in Parliament from 6 to 8 December at the initiative of the ALDE Group and in conjunction with the transnational Radicals.
I think we need a new way forward here.
Perhaps I am being presumptuous but I appeal to you personally, ladies and gentlemen of the presidency-in-office, Commissioner Frattini and even you, Mr President, not to let your institutions take their eyes off the ball.
The issue under discussion, neighbourhood policy, this laudable new initiative, will undoubtedly become bogged down in bureaucracy like so many others: Lisbon, but also Barcelona and all the rest.
President Prodi said a good deal when unveiling the neighbourhood policy; he talked about everything apart from the institutions.
No, the problem lies elsewhere!
You, Mr Frattini, said that we need to do more in our area of work.
That is not the traditional problem; we are sufficiently up to speed.
On the other side of the Mediterranean, however, there is a need for entrepreneurship, of the kind Israel has devoted to its desert areas over a lengthy period.
My time is nearly up, so I would really urge you to note the date of this meeting, and to bear in mind that the problem, the sticking-point, is partnership; the challenge is membership.
Europe itself would not have come into being if it had been confined to partnership, as some wanted at the time.
The problem is that our Europe has limits.
Sultan Hassan II pointed out the solution in 1987; let us now pursue it in the face of Europe's blindness.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, as everyone has said, including those speaking this morning, migration is a priority for the European Union and for Euromed relations.
It is a major issue for those people who are often forced to leave a homeland that has been devastated by poverty, desertification, floods, war and so on.
Will the Euromed Ministerial Conference be equal to the task?
Nothing could be less sure.
The preparatory documents are hopelessly lacking in substance.
This is hardly surprising since we know that none of the organisations on the ground - including those that are actually confronted every day with the situation facing migrants who are either in transit, aimlessly wandering or at risk of their life afloat on the Mediterranean - not a single one of them has been involved in the preparations, not even the HCR.
Preconclusions mean turning a blind eye to the right of asylum, to the illegal detention of migrants and the respect for their rights, whether they happen to be legitimate or not, to the unacceptable violence to which they are subjected, especially women migrants, to the rights of minors and to the criminalisation of giving aid to migrants and migrant families.
This blindness is total when it comes to meeting the Union's international commitments and the agreements that have to implemented or ratified: it is the Geneva Convention for some, and for others, which means all the countries of the European Union, it is the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families.
Where do we really hope we are going with such a Euro-Mediterranean policy, with such a clear absence of demands when it comes to nations' shared rights and obligations?
Where is the risk?
The risk is that of having a smoke-screen of handpicked legal migrations behind which we find sustained and massive rights' violations for all the others.
If it is trying to spare the more sensitive souls by giving up on a really ambitious policy then the conference is doing its best to be a real waste of time.
From the word go it would provide pre-justification for the proliferation of bilateral agreements of the Italy-Libya kind, signed on the sly, which violate the principle of the withholding of removal and do so with complete impunity.
It is not too late to act.
Invite the HCR, invite a representative from the NGOs, start out again with the initial document put forward by the countries of the southern Mediterranean, which is much more ambitious, and the conference may just turn out to be a positive and significant milestone.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming Euromed Ministerial Conference is without doubt important, complex and a matter of urgency in view of the tragedies we are witnessing in our seas on a daily basis.
I nevertheless think it is a shame that there has been no involvement of NGOs, which in fact have a great deal of experience with migration issues, including for example projects such as micro-finance.
Last weekend a meeting of parliamentarians, displaced persons, refugees and NGOs took place in Volterra, where we launched a Charter on the right of asylum and refugees, a topic which I believe is missing from the Ministerial Conference.
On that occasion we drew a clear distinction between refugees and migrants, asserting the rights of both groups: the former sanctioned by the Geneva Convention of 1951 and the latter by the International Convention on the rights of migrant workers and their families, which I think has been ratified by just five of the 37 countries participating in the Barcelona Process.
I therefore hope that the Commission and the Council will endeavour to ascertain what the obstacles are and urge ratification.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Thank you, Mr President.
Mr MagalhÃ£es stated that the Euromed meeting on 18 and 19 November would be the first meeting by Euromed on immigration.
Illegal immigration to Europe is indeed a massive problem for many European countries, posing particular problems for those countries with coastlines within easy reach of North Africa.
Great Britain has its particular problems with immigration, too.
Illegal - and legal - immigration to Britain is now uncontrolled, unlimited and indiscriminate, in the true meaning of that word.
Britain has a massive problem with illegal immigration, but currently the biggest problem is caused by legal immigration from the European Union.
The rate of immigration to Britain, as far as anybody can tell, is running at about 500 000-600 000 people per annum, with a net change to population of about 200 000 people per annum, adding one million people to the population every five years.
Britain is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and England, taken on its own, is right at the top of the league of densely populated countries.
Immigration to Britain on this level is simply unsustainable.
It is putting unbearable strains on infrastructure and public services.
It would be possible to control immigration into Britain by taking some very basic measures.
None of these measures would be possible while we are a member of the EU: they would all be illegal.
The solution for Britain, if it wants to control its immigration, is simply to leave the European Union.
on behalf of the ITS Group - (BG) Our group visited the southmost point of Europe - the island of Lampedusa, on which an immigration centre is located.
There we met a group of people whose boat had sunk and people had died.
Although they had lost friends, those illegal immigrants were in quite good spirits and the reason was, in my opinion, the too big tolerance within the EC to illegal immigrants.
They are so much tolerated that, having reached the EU shores, they feel as if their mission was accomplished.
Therefore measures are to be introduced to tell an illegal immigrant even before his or her departure that the risk of drowning is all too high.
And even if this does not happen and the immigrant reaches the territory of the European Union, it has to be clear that he or she will not stay there.
For if we care for human beings dying in their attempts at illegal immigration, then we shall be reassured that there will be no people making such attempts.
Thank you!
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to take a few moments to express my support, our support, for Commissioner Frattini and to say emphatically to him that the attacks made on him in connection with the issue of Romanies in Italy are absolutely intolerable.
We all know the values that the Commissioner is defending, the values associated with the defence of human rights, the values that are those of the European Union, and on these values, Commissioner, you are irreproachable.
To return to Euromed, I welcome the convening of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference on migration, which is to be held in the Algarve, for it will be the first of its kind, the first to be uniquely devoted to the question of migratory movements in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
The subject of migratory movements is a key issue that must be placed at the centre of our dialogue, our partnership and our cooperation with the countries of the Euro-Mediterranean region, continuing on from the conferences of Rabat and Tripoli.
This is an area in which the Member States cannot act alone.
We need support and cooperation from our partner nations, which are themselves often source countries or transit countries, if our migration policy is to be made more effective.
We need to work with them to reach a consensus on the returns policy, to increase the number of agreements on readmission and together to implement a policy of intelligent codevelopment so that nationals from these countries are able to remain in their homeland and contribute towards its growth.
The question of migratory movements has a security dimension, but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored.
This is why I would like to see respect for fundamental human rights made one of the themes of the conference.
I hope that this meeting will provide an opportunity for open and realistic exchanges, so that together we can find the most appropriate solutions for everyone concerned.
(FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am also pleased that the subject of immigration has been chosen for the next meeting of the Foreign Affairs Ministers of the Euromed zone.
I believe that until now we have failed to put in place a European policy on immigration.
We know that this is a difficult question because it affects the sovereignty of Member States and they are keen to see a very strict application of the principle of subsidiarity in this area.
We also know that the subject of immigration, or migration, is a contentious issue in our dealings with partner countries to the south, who often reproach us for tackling this problem purely as a security matter.
I thank Commissioner Frattini for having adopted a much more global approach to this question, which includes the economic and social dimensions associated with migratory movements.
Legal immigration and illegal immigration are two sides of the same coin and it is not possible to combat illegal immigration without at the same time establishing channels for legalised immigration into Europe.
I therefore welcome the Blue Card scheme, which is the European counterpart of the American Green Card scheme, and am pleased that the legal immigration channels being recommended by the Council evidently take into account Europe's economic requirements as well as meeting the real needs of the countries of the South.
As regards the issuing of visas I believe that the Union should make this a more straightforward process, especially for students, researchers and those involved in civil society.
I think that readmission agreements, especially with Algeria and Morocco, should ensure that any returns procedure should be strictly controlled by mechanisms that guarantee the rights of migrants.
Finally, in view of the new wave of migration currently confronting us from sub-Saharan Africa, I firmly support the idea that Europe must not use the Barcelona Process to shift responsibility for managing migratory movements back to the frontiers of the Mediterranean zone because it is incapable of dealing with this matter at its own borders.
(DE) Mr President, migration is one of the priority topics in the European Union.
The Euromed region is, in that respect, a strategically important region for us.
The Euromed ministerial conference on migration will be the first of its kind to focus solely on this issue and include the Euromed partners.
It is therefore all the more regrettable that no consultation with civil society organisations was held in advance of the conference.
It is equally regrettable that the aspect of asylum was excluded from the agenda for the ministerial conference, especially bearing in mind the hopeless situation of refugees in many parts of the southern and eastern Mediterranean due to the lack of appropriate legislation to protect them.
None of these countries, as we know, has any asylum laws.
Only a few of them recognise the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Libya, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan have not ratified the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.
It is also to be regretted that the members of the Barcelona Process talk about the rights of migrants but are silent when it comes to the rights of illegal migrants.
The fact is that illegal migrants also have rights, especially when it comes to the enforceability of wages, access to education for their children, or basic medical care, especially for women migrants, where the relevant protective provisions apply.
If we want cooperation in our efforts to combat illegal migration, we must not deny or neglect one aspect: respect for the rights of migrants and refugees.
SK) In preparing for the Euromed Ministerial Conference, which is to take place on 18 and 19 November, it is important for the Union to note that the Euromed parliamentary meeting is the only forum in which Members of the European Parliament represent the EU alongside members of national parliaments from the southern Mediterranean region, including Israel and Palestine.
I am pleased to be able to participate in the work of Euromed's policy section, which, I believe, has a key role to play in the context of the Barcelona Process.
The topic of this meeting could not have been chosen better.
The problem of migration presents many challenges, be it development, in that migrants need information on the option of micro-credit and other types of loans, aspects of legal migration to the EU, but also the burning issue of illegal migration, which requires an urgent solution.
I welcome the fact that the EU has been deepening its relations with some of the Mediterranean countries, which are showing political will and taking steps to change.
Indeed, association agreements have already been signed with some of them.
As far as illegal migration is concerned, it is necessary to find a solution to the difficult situation caused by the arrival of thousands of unwelcome migrants, who have a serious impact on the security situation in Malta and Italy in particular, but also in some other EU Member States.
My own country has also been experiencing an influx of both legal and illegal migrants.
I am in favour of the European Union welcoming skilled migrants, whose skills, as Commissioner Frattini said, are needed and can contribute to agriculture, health care and tourism in the EU, but they must be already qualified when they are being allowed in; unskilled migrants should not as a rule be accepted and I believe that the Blue Card scheme will also help to solve this problem.
(DE) Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, the issue of migration demonstrates very clearly to us how close Africa is to Europe.
What happens in Africa affects Europe directly.
Migration flows from the crisis areas to the south of the Mediterranean terminate in the Mediterranean countries of Southern Europe, which means, of course, that they directly affect Europe as a whole.
Africa is a continent with a wealth of talented people.
We ourselves, and Africa, must be clever and use this potential in and for Africa.
This partnership which we are striving for with Africa offers a huge opportunity.
The offer which we aim to extend from the European Union is very challenging.
It ranges from help towards self-help in the fields of security, trade and good governance to stabilisation programmes, including assistance to combat crime, the creation of training places and jobs, the offer of microcredits, and information campaigns about the opportunities for legal forms of migration and all the consequences of illegal migration and measures to combat it.
However, the European Union, at the next Summit, must also make demands.
One of these demands must be for readmission agreements with all countries in the southern Mediterranean before we launch all our action programmes, because all these aspects interact with each other and because what we want is a partnership.
I agree with Commissioner Frattini when he says that what we are talking about now is partnership and no longer about cooperation; it is about partnership and the offer of complex packages.
The European Parliament is ready for this, the Commission supports it and so does Parliament, and Africa must be invited to use these offers in the interests of stabilising North Africa and also in the interests of the security of EU citizens.
(CS) The Commission and Parliament have already given the green light to the proactive and, more importantly, common immigration policy, however unpopular it might be.
For a wealthy, ageing Europe, immigration is indeed a reality.
We know that illegal immigration can decrease the GDP of several countries by up to 20%, whilst their economic growth is limited by the reduction in the number of skilled workers.
The time has come to reinforce international coordination and agree on reasonable common rules.
I trust that next week in the Algarve, the Euromed Ministerial Conference will proceed in this direction, and that it will not only debate but agree on joint steps for successful migration management and propose measures to alleviate the impact on countries of transit.
We need to agree on international obligations with third countries to protect the lives of migrants who take the risk of fleeing by sea.
As a transit region, the Mediterranean countries experience a disproportionate influx of immigrants travelling to the EU and thus require specific measures.
The forthcoming conference can be assured that Parliament takes this issue very seriously.
Our common priorities are to ensure decent detention areas for immigrants from third countries and to combat the factors that cause mass migration.
We have to protect the lives and dignity of migrants.
I would also encourage Euromed to make it clear that the Blue Card for the regulation of qualified immigrants is not a threat to Europeans; on the contrary, it is an opportunity offered to us by globalisation.
The trade unions' resistance to the Blue Card is an irresponsible, populist gesture, bordering on xenophobia.
It is not legal, but illegal, migration that is the cause of dumping on the European labour market.
Commissioner Frattini wants Europe to attract a skilled workforce.
We will have to woo them here from the US, where the annual influx is 55%, compared with the meagre 5% influx into Europe today.
I am convinced that this is the right strategy and that it is line with the EU's position in the global context.
Legal and illegal migration are connected.
The success of a coherent, safe and common migration policy will be a test of the EU's maturity.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council will take from this debate the firm belief that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership must be developed and solidified and that it is right to hold the Ministerial Conference in Santa EulÃ¡lia.
This cooperation, this Partnership - which is the new word and concept - must be based on concrete projects in order to ensure success.
There are many good reasons for this and many dramatic situations, very expressively evoked by Members of this House, which require us to change the status quo.
This will only happen if we can take a long-term view and act quickly.
We have an overall vision, a global approach, action plans and ambitious legislative proposals as mentioned here today by Vice-President Frattini.
We must take concrete steps in relation to projects, particularly in the three areas mentioned.
Firstly, in the area of migration and development, we must take steps to develop specific actions.
This is what the Ministerial Conference plans to do in the area of transfer of remittances and micro-credit.
That is why we are going to have to bring together all the actors (which is not a decision that the Members, the Commission or the Council can take) such as banks, the World Bank, the European Investment Bank, immigrants' associations and civil society, in order to find specific ways of encouraging the use of financial services and reinforcing their efficiency, particularly through alternative methods for transferring money and the use of new technologies which can also really help to achieve our objectives.
We will certainly have no difficulty in setting up a Euro-Mediterranean website with full information on remittances, including the costs in order to stimulate competition and reduce these costs, which is a central objective that unites us with our partners.
As regards legal migration, we need specific initiatives in this area too.
We should like to set up a working group with representatives from the Euromed partners and other social partners in order to study in greater depth the labour situation and the needs of labour markets, to develop training actions for migrant workers before they migrate, to study the possibility of making the European Union portal accessible to all Euromed partners in the area of migration and employment, and to create job search management and information centres in the Euromed countries, naturally in accordance with national competences in this area.
We also need specific projects in the area of illegal migration.
Bearing in mind that many Euromed partners are also countries of destination and transit for migratory flows, it is important that we reinforce institutional competence in the area of the fight against illegal migration.
We must therefore also develop specific actions such as the following: firstly, we should develop document security because only this can allow the correct identification of persons and flows, more confidence and greater ease of movement; secondly, we should develop the access of Euromed partners to Frontex training courses so that they can boost their know-how on fighting illegal migration, in accordance with all the international instruments by which we are bound, in particular the instruments on maritime search and rescue.
This could be an initial concrete step towards participation in joint actions under the coordination of Frontex.
We also need initiatives in the area of voluntary return and readmission.
An open discussion on this issue would be useful in order to consider information campaigns, identification processes, assisted voluntary return processes and the negotiation of readmission agreements with countries of origin.
These and many other points will be tackled in Santa EulÃ¡lia in the Algarve.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there may be many different opinions but one thing is absolutely certain, and I am leaving this debate with this impression: there is no alternative to this path of dialogue and effective partnership.
This is the only way to change the status quo and we are all absolutely agreed on the fact that it is essential to change the status quo.
Santa EulÃ¡lia could be a very important step in this respect.
Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate has brought forth many practical suggestions as well as some interesting thoughts.
I believe that one strategic policy issue is how to progress from cooperation to a genuine partnership, so as ultimately to achieve membership of a real Euro-Mediterranean common area.
Mr Pannella's idea is of great interest, and clearly such a strategy requires long-term thinking on our part.
Only once there is a true Euro-Mediterranean single area will there be a joint sense of belonging that prompts us to work towards the shared goal now being established.
We first had to obtain the consensus of all 27 Member States; now we are consulting with our partners on the southern shore.
The way forward has been mapped out.
The second very practical idea, which I shall definitely take up at the Euromed meeting, is an appeal to all participants at that meeting to ensure that their respective countries ratify the existing international conventions.
Before dreaming up any new rules, let us bear in mind that very few countries have ratified and implemented some extremely important international conventions.
I am thinking, among others, about the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings.
If there is one subject on which a convention must be ratified immediately, it is the international trafficking and trade in human beings.
The third idea comes from Mr Gaubert, to whom I am particularly grateful for emphasising the humanitarian dimension of this major debate.
We are not talking here about laws or bureaucratic matters; we are talking about women, men and children who - as others have said - are risking and often losing their lives.
It is therefore a matter of solidarity.
I believe that showing solidarity towards people who are suffering is the keystone in building a relationship genuinely based on equal rights for our partners.
The fourth idea which I shall take away from this debate is how to move on, to put it a little bluntly, from final documents to tangible action.
We have drawn up numerous documents and, if the truth be told, we have mounted some significant practical initiatives.
We must now build on these practical activities, for example by deciding how best to use development aid funds.
Obviously, if we in the European Union have funds available to assist local development, we must also have the capacity to understand how best to spend them.
As someone said, we must for example have ways of giving positive incentives to those partners, those countries which actively cooperate in our joint strategy.
Given that there is a common strategy, known since Barcelona as the Euro-Mediterranean strategy, and given that some countries are implementing it to a greater extent than others, I think those countries should be given an incentive, some positive recognition.
This, in my opinion, is for example a meaningful way of eradicating corruption. Corruption is one of the root causes of illegal immigration.
If there were less corruption in countries of origin, and if there were less corruption in transit countries, then many traffickers in human beings would be stopped en route to Europe and there would be more cooperation; but that is only one example.
Finally, there is the question of taking a credible, firm stance on unlawful conduct.
Mr MagalhÃ£es emphasised this point and I fully agree: we have no credibility unless we demonstrate that unlawful conduct can be neither rewarded nor tolerated.
We must be crystal clear about this.
Some have touched on the subject of readmission agreements in this context.
Readmission agreements lend credibility to our policy because people who fail to abide by our laws must be repatriated, with all due respect for their individual rights.
However, there is a political point here: states of origin which take back their fellow citizens cannot function as the European Union's border guards.
I am putting this a little bluntly: they are not prepared to cooperate with us solely on security grounds.
For that reason, one topic I shall raise at this conference is how our policy on visas and the movement of persons can be used as a political incentive for those countries, for example in terms of greater mobility for students and business people.
Let us use Europe's visa policy to facilitate such freedom of movement, thereby sending out a positive political signal to the states with which we are seeking readmission agreements.
We did so with the Western Balkans, and in my opinion the time has now come to envisage the same general approach for the Mediterranean.
The debate is closed.
Regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding (debate)
The next item is the report by Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the regulations governing political parties at European level and the rules regarding their funding - C6-0202/2007 -.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on 27 June this year the Commission presented a proposal, based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, which aims to improve and adapt Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 on the status and funding of political parties at European level.
This proposal was followed by a report which evaluated the application of the Regulation.
The corresponding resolution was adopted by the European Parliament on 23 March 2006.
The Commission's proposal introduces a new element: the possibility of funding European political foundations bearing in mind that these have an important role to play in underpinning and promoting the activities and objectives of the political parties at European level.
Since the political foundations are closely affiliated with the European political parties, it is proposed that they must submit their application for funding through the political party at European level with which they are linked, under the same legal basis as applies to the latter's funding, in other words under Article 191 of the EC Treaty.
I know that the political parties represented in this House are forming or have already formed foundations at European level.
The Council looks favourably on the possibility of providing Community financial support for the activities of these foundations under very clear rules which will allow, among other aspects, a clear distinction to be made between the areas of intervention of the parties which must be complementary and not overlapping.
The second main aim of the Commission's proposal is to revise the financial provisions which govern the funding of political parties at European level in light of the experience acquired in the meantime.
To this end, the Commission proposes, among other measures, two derogations from the no-profit rule laid down in Article 109 of the Financial Regulation.
The first measure involves the possibility of carrying over up to 25% of annual total income from one year to the first quarter of the following year to enable the parties to better respond to changing political circumstances and priorities.
The second measure aims to allow political parties at European level to build financial reserves by saving income generated by the parties themselves in excess of a new reduced minimum co-funding level of 15%.
I must also highlight that it is proposed to establish clearly that appropriations received from the EU budget may also be used for the financing of campaigns conducted by the political parties at European level in the context of European Parliament elections, provided that this does not constitute a direct or indirect financing of national political parties or their candidates.
In the Council, the proposal was initially assessed three times by the General Affairs Group, in September and October of this year, and was generally favourably received by the delegations.
However, some delegations expressed concerns about the proposed legal basis and the derogations from budgetary discipline.
An opinion was requested on these issues from the Legal Service of the Council.
The latter considered that the derogations from the no-profit rule laid down in Article 109(2) of Council Regulation No 1605/2002 could only be enshrined in a separate regulation based on Article 279 of the EC Treaty and intended to introduce these derogations into the Financial Regulation itself by amending it.
This opinion led to the proposal being split into two legal acts and the consultation of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors.
On 17 October 2007, therefore recently, Coreper II debated for the first time a compromise text presented by the Portuguese Presidency and the opinion of the Legal Service of the Council.
A week later, on 24 October 2007, Coreper II reached agreement on two points: firstly, the splitting of the proposal into two legal acts, one regulation based on Article 279 of the EC Treaty containing the provisions amending the Financial Regulation and one regulation containing the other provisions of the proposal based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, and secondly, consultation of the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors on the amendment of Article 109 of Regulation No 1605/2002 in accordance with Article 279 of the EC Treaty.
This consultation occurred immediately.
The two compromise texts resulting from the split were assessed by the General Affairs Group on 9 November 2007, therefore very recently.
As a result, I am very pleased to announce that the General Affairs Group, which met last Friday, has confirmed the existence of broad agreement among the national delegations on the issues covered by the two regulations resulting from the split.
In essence, I would repeat that there is no significant disagreement between the three institutions.
The Commission, Parliament and the Council all agree on the essentials with regard to European political foundations and the amendment of the provisions governing the functioning of European political parties.
The legal basis issue was, and is, strictly a legal issue and it was not, and is not, the Council's intention to prevent agreement between the three institutions.
I can confirm, on behalf of the Council, that we want the two regulations resulting from the split to be adopted by the end of this year so that they can enter into force on 1 January 2008.
To this end, I propose that Parliament postpones the vote on your opinion planned for this week so that, by means of the appropriate contacts, we can reach agreement at first reading on the regulation based on Article 191 of the EC Treaty, under the codecision procedure.
In that event, a Parliament opinion on the amendment of the Financial Regulation should be adopted as soon as possible.
We have also asked the Court of Auditors to act promptly.
We have little time but, in our opinion, there is enough time to adopt the two regulations under the conditions required by Parliament, the Commission and the Council.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, from the period of reflection we learnt that there is a clear demand and opportunity for measures to reinforce and expand the political dialogue.
I have always said that if we want to create a European public sphere, then we also need to create more of a European political culture, and this particular issue is absolutely crucial to doing so.
Certainly, there is no single magic solution to bridge the gap between European politics and our citizens and there is no simple way to meet the democratic aspirations of citizens and their desire to be more actively involved.
These aspirations must be promoted by a very wide range of initiatives with common purposes to ensure the broadest possible participation of citizens, including, not least, young people, and, I would add women, in the democratic life of the Union.
The activities of European political parties, together with the creation of European political foundations, is part and parcel of building this real European public sphere, where different opinions can challenge each other and the citizens can better understand the challenges at stake and make informed choices.
Political debate and political controversy are part of democracy and we hope that this will also help to increase the turnout for the European Parliament elections.
I am happy to say that the Commission and Parliament have always agreed on this issue.
The Commission was able to respond quickly to Parliament's request and our proposal was also strongly supported by Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
On 25 October, I stated before this House my concerns that Coreper had decide to follow a route which departed from that of the Commission and Parliament, and these concerns were shared by Members, including President PÃ¶ttering and Mr Leinen.
But I also expressed my hope that the key objective of the Council, Parliament and the Commission would continue to be the same: the approval of the substance of our proposal before the end of this year.
Three weeks later, and having heard what the Presidency stated, I can only welcome the recent developments and express my satisfaction that we are on a common route again.
The Council has been listening and the working group last Friday unanimously confirmed the full substance of our proposal.
This means that we can now move on.
But, even though the agreement reached in Council is an important step forward and very positive news, this is not yet the end of the process.
We need to finalise the details in order to allow for a speedy adoption and entry into force of this regulation.
Even if the splitting of our proposal does not ultimately affect its substance, it entails a separate, more complicated legislative procedure and an opinion from the Court of Auditors, which, I hope, will be delivered in time.
The schedule is very challenging and tight.
I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his committed work on this file, and all the other Members involved.
I also want to thank President PÃ¶ttering, the Conference of Presidents and the political groups, who played an important role in preparing the ground for an agreement on this issue.
So, Madam President, President of the Council, Mr Leinen,
(PT) We can move forward together.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, President-in-Office, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the new Lisbon Treaty is the guiding vision for parliamentary democracy at EU level.
For parliamentary democracy, you need political parties. You need political parties to represent the interests of society and offer citizens a variety of candidates and manifestos to choose from at elections.
In all our 27 Member States, we have parties which stand in the national elections; what we need to do now is to enable these European parties to perform their democratic work at the European level as well.
We want to ensure that in advance of the European elections too, there is a range of active political families for our citizens to choose from, which are capable of mobilising the electorate and telling voters where they are planning to take them.
We want citizens to be able to decide on the nature of the Europe that they are voting for and give them a real choice.
The first Regulation on the statute and financing of European political parties, which we adopted back in 2004, was a resounding success.
We now have ten political families which have registered, and this demonstrates the breadth of the political spectrum in the European Union.
This revision of the Regulation is now designed to inject some flexibility into these democratic structures and expand them at the same time.
In most of our countries, we have not only political parties but also political foundations.
These are vehicles for deeper analyses of social trends and are also a forum for debate which extends beyond the party membership.
These foundations have proved their worth in many countries.
They do good work and so it is all the more necessary to create the opportunity to conduct this debate, this discourse, about Europe at European level too, across national borders.
I therefore welcome the fact that this instrument, which is additional to the political parties themselves, has also received Council's blessing.
Ladies and gentlemen, no political party's agenda is built around the financial year.
It responds to political events, and so political parties must be treated differently from other associations.
That is the purpose of this new Regulation: to inject some flexibility into financial management.
We have three objectives here: firstly, we want the possibility of extending the financial year by three months on the expenditure side to enable parties to respond to political events.
Secondly, we do not want parties to have to spend all their cash at the end of the year.
We would like them to be able to use their own resources, membership contributions and donations to accumulate reserves which can be spent in response to key events in politics and especially, of course, on the European elections.
Finally, in order to assist the smaller political families in particular but also to get the European political foundations up and running, we need different arrangements regarding the proportion of grants and own resources.
We envisage setting own resources at 15% and subsidies at 85% in the new Regulation.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Council has decided to divide the legal basis.
We argued that this was not necessary.
Unfortunately, this will result in a loss of transparency, because citizens will now need to look in two places for the legal basis for this new Regulation.
However, we do not wish to prolong the disagreement over legal issues.
That would simply drag out the process and distract attention from the real objective of this Regulation.
In the interests of the European political parties and their preparations for the 2009 European election campaign, we ought to concentrate on issues of substance and conclude this matter before the end of the year.
I am very pleased to hear that the substance of this Regulation has met with widespread agreement.
I think we should now do everything possible in order to wrap up this important piece of legislation under the Portuguese Presidency so that we have a legal basis for political foundations and a basis for more flexible financial management in the 2008 budget year.
Transitional arrangements for this will be required from the Council, as we originally proposed in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
Madam Vice-President of the Commission, I would like to thank you for taking the initiative on behalf of the Commission.
I am grateful, too, to the Portuguese Presidency for its genuine commitment to this issue, and to Mr LeitÃ£o, with whom I did a great deal of work.
I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Mathieu, for their valuable input in their reports, which introduces more transparency and more control over the allocation of these resources.
We are well on track, and I hope we will get a result by the end of the year.
Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in presenting my opinion on budgetary control I highlighted the four requirements that seem essential to me: improving the control mechanisms and thereby increasing the powers of the internal and external auditors and of the authorising officer; setting up a complementary checking procedure; making a clear separation between the financial resources of the political parties and those of the foundations; and finally, clarifying the rules on the funding of campaigns for European elections.
I am glad that the Council is accepting the famous 25% rule that Ingeborg GrÃ€Ãle proposed last year, which the Council had rejected.
We fully understand that the agreement given this year contained a significantly derogatory element that related to this report.
However, a certain hesitancy as to the legal basis of the report leads us to doubt the outcome of the vote at the conclusion of this sitting, which is regrettable.
Parliament was very quick in drawing up this report and in delivering the opinions.
It would be a pity if the Council's decision to split the report into two parts means that we lose time.
We would therefore like to see it adopted quickly before the end of the year.
Thank you.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, may I express my sincere congratulations and thanks to Mr Jo Leinen, the rapporteur, for doing a very good job.
This report is one which my Group can fully support and we also endorse the amendments.
The report turns political parties at European level, and the new instrument of political foundations, into effective tools to increase participation by Europe's citizens and boost Europe's democratic legitimacy.
The referenda in France and the Netherlands showed that it is important to rebuild the trust of citizens, including via the political parties and the foundations.
It is also true that the financial rules need to be adapted to the rapidly changing needs of the political parties.
Transparency, of course, must be safeguarded as well.
That is why the European Parliament will be providing information on the funding disbursed to parties and foundations every financial year, and this will be available on our website.
Another good innovation is that the role of political parties in the context of the European elections is finally recognised.
Only if Europe's parties can be actively involved in elections to the European Parliament will they become genuine players of the European polis and contribute to the formation of a European consciousness, thereby helping to overcome the democratic deficit which exists.
Another important component is the promotion of political foundations.
Their work in the field of political information and education complements what the political parties do.
These foundations have a special role to play in deepening the educational process and enhancing knowledge about the European Union, thus reducing the distance between citizens and the European Union.
I am convinced that foundations can boost the active participation of citizens in European political life, and they can also play an important role in the training of tomorrow's politicians.
The legalistic thinking of the Council is rather hard to fathom, but as Helmut Kohl always said, the most important thing is the outcome.
That is why I am in favour of this report, and I would like to thank everyone concerned for their commitment and cooperation.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, my Group supports this proposal, and thinks this is a practical set of adjustments to the current legislation and that it is actually useful that European political parties should have the ability to do research and so on through their foundations and have the flexibility to carry money over from one year to the next and so on.
There was the issue of the legal base: Parliament and the Commission agreed, and the Council disagreed with us on that.
But it is the substance that is more important than the legal base, and I dare even say that it is better to have legal certainty than to face a challenge later on this matter in the courts.
So we are happy with that and we are happy to seek first-reading agreements with the Council by postponing the vote.
Let me just add though that, for the reasons the rapporteur himself said, the European political parties are important because they express the political choices we face as a European Union.
The media too often focuses only on the Council, and especially the European Council, as if it is some sort of gladiatorial combat between countries.
Did Britain win today or did the French?
Did the Germans make a deal with the Italians?
Yet when those very same subjects come to this Parliament, you rarely see all the Members from one country voting one way and all the Members of another country voting another way, because we are making political choices - policy choices.
Do we want higher environmental standards but at greater cost, or not?
There will be people in every country on both sides of the argument, and the same with most of the choices we face.
Political groups and political parties highlight the fact that it is political, policy choices we are making in our Union, not a combat between one national viewpoint and another national viewpoint.
That is why they need to be strengthened in their work; that will help citizens have a grasp for the sort of issues that we are dealing with; that will make our Union work better.
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I should like to thank the Council Presidency for the progress that it is making in approaching an agreement at first reading.
I trust that the Court of Auditors will be able to stir itself with unexpected alacrity to bring its opinion before us.
Fertile political thought is a necessary ingredient of a pluralistic, lively parliamentary democracy and this will be encouraged and stimulated by the measure before us to establish party-political foundations.
It will encourage party politics to grow at European level and nascent European political parties to grow in self-confidence and to get stuck into campaigns in a purposeful way.
I have to say that we have been pirouetting around the problem of political parties for several years because, of course, they are prospective rivals and competitors for the old national political parties, which, I sometimes think, will be the final citadel defended in the interests of national sovereignty.
So we should proceed fast to develop platforms at European level to support and promote post-national politics which truly reflect the paradigms of the 21st century.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, I welcome the work currently under way on sensible regulation of the funding of political parties at European level.
It is very necessary and I commend Mr Leinen on his report.
We are also confronted with a broader problem, however. This concerns the consequences of the funding of political parties on the quality of democracy both at Union level and at the level of individual Member States.
For legal reasons, the party I represent was denied budget funding for some time during an election period.
I know how very difficult it is to face a political opposition that has money when you have none.
One of the largest political parties in Poland almost ceased to exist recently, threatened by the withdrawal of subsidies due to minor financial errors.
Money is important, but it should not be the only factor determining the nature of the political scene, as is sometimes the case.
Clearly, this is a matter for a separate debate that should be held in this House.
After all, democracy cannot be dependent on funding alone.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, the citizens' interest in the EU is still modest, to say the least, and this is due, among other things, to its intransparent structures, incomprehensible decisions, and a lack of media interest.
Europe's existing political parties have made little impact in terms of reducing this deficit, and it is not at all clear that they are actually a suitable vehicle by which to fulfil the citizens' desire for more codetermination.
That, in my view, can only be achieved through more direct democracy.
Repackaging the cosmetically enhanced EU Constitution as incomprehensibly as possible after a deal done behind closed doors and avoiding referenda is also certainly detrimental to the envisaged and much-vaunted objective of generating enthusiasm for the EU among the citizens.
In light of these circumstances, European parties and their associated foundations are highly unlike to boost EU-phoria among citizens, but if they manage to improve debate at European level and communication with citizens, and represent their interests, too, we will at least have achieved something.
However, their financing must be clear and transparent and, in my view, this must include auditing by independent bodies.
Madam President, let us be clear about Mr Leinen's report: it is not about democracy, it is about propaganda, it is about using the taxes collected from our reluctant citizens to drive forward a European project about which they are increasingly uneasy.
The Danes voted against Maastricht, the Irish voted against Nice, the Swedes against the euro, the French and Dutch against the Constitution, yet their taxes will be used to promote integration.
Today in this Chamber, President Sarkozy spoke of European democracy, but across our diverse Member States the common public opinion necessary for representative democracy does not exist.
Democracy at European level is a fraud and a delusion.
By reserving funding for pan-European parties, Mr Leinen explicitly excludes Euro-sceptic parties which do not seek pan-European status, so taxpayers' money will be channelled to integrationist parties and denied to others.
In a Europe that talks about democracy, this is a crime against the people.
(ES) Madam President, today the President of France spoke to the House about the need for dialogue and debate.
I think that is what we all learnt during the period of reflection, as Vice-President WallstrÃ¶m said.
For dialogue and debate, however, we need instruments, and some of the most important and indeed essential instruments - although not the only instruments - are political parties.
European political parties, like national political parties, shape the will of a people.
That must also be their role in the representative institutions in Europe.
Talking about political parties at European level without talking about funding would be pointless.
We must look at how those political parties, so necessary for shaping the people's will, are funded.
I think that the most important issue in relation to political parties at European level - and also at national level, but it is the European level that is of interest to us here - is that financing ought to be responsible, clear and transparent.
That is what is important to the taxpayers: that their money is well spent and that there are institutions that take responsibility for the way in which their money is used.
I believe that the people of Europe, although they may have some doubts or hesitations over the direction Europe ought to take, have no doubt that their future lies in Europe.
Here in Parliament, I always hear even those who are most opposed to European ideas claiming that they are European and are not against Europe.
To go back to what I was saying at the start, and quote Mr Sarkozy once again: debate is necessary, and for there to be debate we must create the instruments needed to organise it.
I therefore welcome the report by Mr Leinen, which takes on board the Commission proposal, and I also thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my good friend Mr Lobo Antunes, for your proposal to us.
The European People's Party will not discuss the basis here.
If the regulation needs to be divided in two to find a solution that is acceptable to all, then so be it.
You can count on our support.
- (EL) Madam President, I am glad that another fellow Member will be listening to the discussion, particularly on this issue, in our beautiful language.
It seems to me that we could use political parties here, which are valuable tools.
Alas, we are keeping these valuable tools hidden away in our institutional cupboard where they are in danger of getting rusty.
Most if not all of us are agreed on the democratic role that political parties should play in Europe, but I think we should also agree that they have not been playing this role as yet.
This is because today's parties, as several speakers have said, are not really political parties. They are loose confederations of parties, as Dimitris Tsatsos, my teacher and rapporteur at the time, said in his report as long ago as 1996.
We have no real political parties, and this discussion is a good opportunity for us to see if we can establish real political parties at EU level.
I have two comments on specific topics in the report under discussion.
The report makes two significant advances.
As we have said, it does not solve all the political problems, but there are two major advances.
One is that now we recognise how the political institutions operate, an element of thought comes into our discussion.
A vital element of ideological ferment has been introduced.
One of the very problems of democracy in the EU is precisely that we do not engage in rigorous and serious political thought, and these institutes can supply this need.
The second major advance is transparency.
This is especially evident in the transparency rules laid down for the parties themselves, but above all, I would say, with the new Article 9(b) on the transparency rules for Parliament itself.
Let me conclude with a brief comment on the issue of the fragmentation of the legal basis.
I understand that there are technical problems here.
Personally, I regret this fragmentation.
The point is, if we all agree that from an economic point of view independence and transparency are integral parts of the political mechanism itself, would a single legal mechanism not be far more powerful?
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am favourably disposed towards this resolution in that it assists the democratic life of Europe.
The Group of the European Left, which is about to hold its second congress, have always said that globalisation, and also this Europe of ours, has seen a coming-together of markets, business interests and red-tape, while democracy has lagged behind.
That is all well and good for strong powers, but not for those of us who believe in a different type of society catering for the needs of its weakest members.
This was the role of mass parties in the past.
Today there is a fresh challenge, namely to establish parties capable of coping with new levels of conflict and decision-making; parties which rebuild democratic participation and a democratic role for Parliament, outside the system of broad coalitions and intergovernmental cooperation that stifles democratic debate.
There is of course a need for transparency in the use of funds, but politics cannot be the sole prerogative of the rich.
(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Leinen. Mr Leinen is one of the fathers of this Regulation and a tireless defender of political parties, with whom I have shared the odd battle to secure agreements, one might say.
Ladies and gentlemen, this proposal could not and cannot be the prisoner of battles between the legal services of the Community institutions.
We must reach an agreement sooner rather than later because, if we fail to do so, the only victims in this conflict will be the political parties, who play a vital role in bringing the EU nearer to the citizens and encouraging them to get involved in politics so that they feel part of a common political project and a political future.
The parties also represent the transnational dimension of the EU's process of political integration.
This report shows Parliament's flexibility and operational capacity.
This House cannot be accused of failing to cooperate to reach an agreement at first reading before the end of 2007.
Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to set out three ideas, three basic improvements to this project, which we welcome and which will ensure the development of the parties and the foundations.
The first is the vital role of European political parties in elections to the European Parliament, reflected in the possibility of using the financial allocation for European election campaigns.
The second is the independent management of European political parties, with the transfer of annual reserves, and the possibility of creating reserves from own resources over several years.
Thirdly and finally, encouraging political foundations on a European scale enhances the activity of the European political parties.
The foundations are a vital instrument for extending the action of the political parties and strengthening links to citizens, and they will play a major role in terms of information, debate and political training.
(FI) Madam President, our Group is divided on this.
I represent those who do not believe that the Europarties make for greater democracy.
They are parties of parties and with them power gets further away from the people.
They deliver centralised policies decided by the big parties in the big countries.
They can use Europarty funds to spread centralised propaganda in the European elections at national level.
They receive Europarty funds to promote European awareness among the people.
The aim of centralised power is to make people adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards it - to make them submissive.
A new agent of propaganda is now being proposed in the shape of a legal basis for special European foundations, reducing the extent to which the Europarties are self-funded and allowing them to escape compliance with the Financial Regulations to which others are obliged to conform.
Some in our Group say no to all this.
(DA) Madam President, I am not an anti-federalist.
I believe that federalism is a good form of government in Germany, Canada, Switzerland and the USA.
However, it requires a people, and there is still not a European people that is prepared for a European democracy.
Since I was first elected, participation in elections has fallen from 63% to 46% most recently.
Next time this figure will probably fall below 40%.
The European media are very few in number and small.
They live off artificial subsidies.
There are no common parties with members who have signed themselves up, who voluntarily pay their membership fees and who are involved in the creation of election programmes.
The parties are controlled by the national parties and financed by the taxpayers.
They now want more money and the opportunity to use it in national elections.
This distorts equal competition, is unfair and is probably unlawful because it is in breach of the principle of equality.
Party support is being managed by members of the largest parties; my party has lost its subsidies because an individual signature is required from one of our members, even though not all the members of other parties have signed for their membership individually.
We are being treated differently, yet there is no critical press that raises cases involving discrimination.
I would gladly vote for subsidies for European political parties if the electorate wanted a European democracy.
Begin by giving the elected people's representatives power over the legislative process, and take the power away from the government officials and lobbyists, so that the electorate can make a difference by turning out on election day and voting for a different party.
Create living parties with direct membership and voluntary membership fees, so that we can then arrange the public aid which the electorate deems reasonable and which is not discriminatory.
Currently, we hardly have the support of the electorate for any further pressure on the citizens' purse.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m ended her initial speech in this debate by expressing the wish that we move forward together.
The conclusion that I have drawn from this debate is that we are effectively moving forward together.
This can only be good news for the Council and the Portuguese Presidency and I must thank the Commission and the European Parliament for the fact that we can move forward together based on the proposal which I have presented to you today.
As has already been said, the form is not so important; what is truly important is the substance.
The substance in this case is to provide the European political parties with additional resources so that they can fully carry out their political activities and exercise their competences and so that they can fully involve all our citizens in this fascinating process of European construction.
That is the real substance, the real reason and the real issue.
As I have said, I can only rejoice that the three institutions have been able to reach agreement on how to move forward in this regard.
I must also say, if you will allow me to be frank, that the fact that we could reach this agreement during the Portuguese Presidency is for me and for the Portuguese Government naturally a key aspect of our Presidency, which is rapidly coming to an end.
I must say three things to you.
Firstly, we hope that we will soon receive the opinion of the Court of Auditors and that we will therefore be able to achieve a rapid conclusion in this respect.
Secondly, it was said here today by a Member that there were some European political parties that would be excluded from the scope of the new regulations: that is not the case as all are eligible.
Finally, I want to very sincerely reiterate our commitment to do everything we can to conclude this process by the end of the year.
rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, the Council has just stated that there is broad agreement on the content of this Regulation.
On Thursday, prior to the vote on this item, I will propose that the vote be postponed, so that we can get an agreement at first reading before the end of this year, probably at the December part-session.
I have noted the information you have given us, Mr Leinen, and we shall finish our debate with a contribution from Commissioner WallstrÃ¶m.
Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr Lobo Antunes, I definitely think that you should take all the credit that you deserve for hopefully being able to conclude this particular file before the end of the year.
Then I think we should have a glass of wine, or port, to celebrate what the Portuguese Presidency has achieved on this very important file.
If Mr Helmer had remained in plenary, I would have turned to him and said that he is a living proof of how European democracy works because European taxpayers pay his salary to be here to oppose, to be against the European Union and all the rest of us.
We welcome him here, we accept him here because his voice is also necessary in this debate.
So those who oppose also play a very important role in this Chamber in the European political debate.
This is exactly the idea behind giving all the political parties the possibility of forming and contributing to the European political foundation, to have a lively debate where both sides and all the different views can be expressed.
And we do it in an open and transparent way about the criteria, about the rules, about exactly what legal base to apply for all of this.
There are no secrets in this particular proposal.
As the situation is right now, all the 10 currently existing political parties at European level have set up political foundations which represent a very wide range of political views and programmes.
This can only stimulate this lively and diverse debate on European policy issues, and it will contribute to bringing Europe closer to its citizens.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday.
Written declarations (Rule 142)
in writing. - (HU) I feel that the Commission's recommendation is important and shows the way forward.
The European political parties play an important role in politics at European level.
They have a big role not only in European political life but also in the creation of a European public sector in the broadest sense, so I feel that their role and the redefinition of their activities are topical.
It is a central question whether we should support the initiatives of these European political parties in the interests of encouraging citizens to participate consciously in the democratic life of the Union, and in its creation.
I trust that there is demand and an opportunity for measures to reinforce and extend political dialogue: ensuring the most widespread participation possible of citizens in the democratic life of the Union, not least including young people, in order to ensure that everyone is heard.
I would like to mention here that one of the political goals decided for the European Union is still the promotion and advancement of the creation of a European public life.
In order to do this, one of the elements emphasised in the Commission's document is support for political foundations at European level that provide assistance or support and supplement the activities of groups of political parties that are close to them, through various initiatives such as, for example, organising European seminars, training and conferences.
Finally, European-level foundations like this can ensure an efficient financial framework for cooperation between national political foundations and teachers at European level, including other representatives of youth organisations and civil society.
Question Time (Commission)
Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, euro exchange rate trends do of course affect the relative price of European tourism products for consumers from third countries.
Although the euro exchange rate is not a political instrument, but is formed freely on the foreign exchange market, the consequences of the recent rises in the euro-dollar exchange rate on tourism should be viewed on a differentiated basis.
