Prime Minister, Madam President, at the Laeken Summit, we shall be reviewing the Union' s progress in implementing its social agenda.
Steady and solid implementation is essential if we are to succeed, this decade, in making the Union' s economy truly dynamic and competitive while, at the same time, ensuring that our social model remains anchored in the principles of justice and sustainability.
I agree with the new presidency' s emphasis not only on the essential drive towards achieving full employment but also on the equally essential need to improve the quality of work.
Modernising our pension and social security systems is also an important part of our social agenda.
This is one of the most important challenges of today' s society and, yesterday, the Commission adopted a Communication proposing an integrated European strategy for tackling it.
We are also committed to the fight against poverty and social exclusion.
I am therefore pleased to see the Belgian government' s commitment to action on these issues in its presidency.
In particular, I share the concern that underlies this commitment: the gap between rich and poor in Europe is widening at an alarming rate.
We have a duty to stop this trend.
If we do not change our economic and social policies, we will be in danger of undermining solidarity, the very value on which the European social model is based.
The rapid drift towards an increasingly divided society is happening not only in Europe but also on a much wider scale. An entire continent, Africa - about which you made a highly relevant point in your speech, Prime Minister - has lost contact even with the developing world.
We must do everything in our power to stop this unjust development model and to give voices and rights to those who have neither.
Ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, the Laeken Summit and declaration are also vitally important for another reason.
Laeken must determine how we are to structure the second stage of the 'Future of Europe' debate.
This is a far-reaching debate with huge implications.
I am particularly glad that, in contrast to the situation six months ago, it is now being conducted widely in all the media.
At last, our fellow citizens and their governments are beginning to realise how important these issues are for their future.
Prime Minister, in a recent speech, you stated that 'the Union has turned into an institutional and instrumental imbroglio' .
It is my unenviable privilege to share your concern.
The diagnosis is clear: what we need now is treatment, proposed and discussed freely and openly.
There must be no more attempts to settle these questions behind closed doors.
In my opinion, the only acceptable way to reform the institutions is for a Convention to be set up at Laeken.
The Heads of State have also talked about a forum - I personally prefer the word Convention -...
...which will bring together, on an equal footing, representatives of the governments of the Member States and the candidate countries - and I stress, the candidate countries as well - representatives of the national parliaments, the European Parliament and the Commission.
It is in this Convention that we will be able to find the best solutions to Europe' s most serious problems.
Ladies and gentlemen, not only must the future of Europe be firmly in the hands of its citizens but they must also understand what needs changing.
Whatever else it may imply, the Irish 'no' to Nice tells us clearly that we have to close the gap between the institutions and the citizens.
The Europeans want a Union that meets their new demands. They want far more than an economically integrated continent, which we have already largely achieved.
They want a Union they can understand - and that means we must simplify our procedures and our Treaties - where the responsibilities of each institution are clearly defined and decisions are taken at the appropriate level.
They want a Union that delivers the quality of life and the type of society they desire.
A Union that is clearly accountable to its citizens for what our policies have achieved and how our resources have been used.
Their calls for greater democratic control over the Union' s institutions are fully justified.
This too is an issue the Convention must address.
The Laeken Declaration must therefore set an ambitious and comprehensive agenda for this Convention and lay down the methods and timetable it is to follow.
Ladies and gentlemen, the position I recently adopted on the Treaty of Nice and the Irish referendum has raised some concern in this House and elsewhere.
From the very start of my term of office, I have consistently attached great importance to political and institutional relations between the Commission and Parliament.
I firmly believe these relations must be based on a spirit of cooperation and openness.
Therefore, let me conclude with a few more words on the ratification of the Treaty of Nice.
A Union of 25 or more Member States cannot function with its present structures and methods of decision-making.
That is why, for the task that this Commission has set as its absolute priority, the enlargement of the Union, I have always maintained that we need to introduce, at the very least, the institutional changes so painstakingly and laboriously agreed upon at Nice.
We must, indeed, remember that enlargement is not simply an internal matter for Europe: our role as a point of reference for the ideas and politics of a large part of the world depends on the decisions we take on this process.
The candidate countries, for their part, are making a huge, unprecedented effort to qualify for Union membership.
The Union must therefore be ready to welcome the new Member States.
This means revising our institutional system and the decision-making process.
That is why, despite the fact that it did not live up to our expectations, the Treaty of Nice is necessary for enlargement.
Therefore, as I have stressed on a number of occasions before this House, I very much hope that the Treaty will be ratified by the end of next year, in full respect for the democratically expressed opinions of our fellow citizens.
The people of the Irish Republic have recently expressed their opinion of the Treaty.
I do not want to go into the details of the debate that preceded, accompanied and followed the referendum.
I just want to say that I am convinced, particularly after my visit to Ireland, that the Union does not pose a threat to national identities.
Quite the opposite: our real strength lies in 'unity in diversity' .
After visiting Ireland, I can, in any case, affirm without a doubt that the Irish people did not vote against enlargement.
However, we must not underestimate the importance of this 'no' . It raises a crucial question that we cannot ignore: what happens if, in spite of our best efforts, Nice is not ratified?
Some people have not been able to resist the temptation to reply simply that this question is not on the agenda.
However, it would not be responsible for me, as President of the Commission, to give that answer.
Enlargement must not be compromised.
It is, and will remain, our number one political objective.
It is an historic project and I have made it an integral part of my task as Commission President. It has the unanimous backing of the Gothenburg Council.
It is therefore my duty, as President of the Commission, to anticipate the potential repercussions of the Irish 'no' on the enlargement process.
Ladies and gentlemen, in your opinion, is it wise to pretend that the problem does not exist?
No, it is not.
Over the past few days, I have therefore taken up this duty. I chose to be frank and made a carefully-considered, informed decision.
We have all said that Nice is necessary for enlargement.
Well then, we must not give the impression that the process can succeed without the reforms we all wanted at Nice.
I do not wish to dwell further on the views of the legal experts who assure us that we could go ahead with enlargement simply by making small changes to the Treaties.
That is not the political point. The point is that we have to enlarge the Union while, at the same time, deepening it in the ways that Nice itself stated were essential.
Ladies and gentlemen, a 'no' to Nice would inevitably delay the enlargement process.
We want to avoid that if at all possible but, were it to happen, we would have to bring forward the date of the next Intergovernmental Conference. This would allow us to fulfil our solemn commitments with the strong support of this House expressed completely within its mandate.
As you can see, the Treaty of Nice is already an integral part of the debate on the 'Future of Europe' .
Our 'yes' to ratification is not, therefore, about tactics: it is about the need to ensure the political coherence of the Union.
Prime Minister, what you have said confirms that your presidency fully agrees with this analysis and endorses the strategy we must therefore adopt.
(Applause)
Thank you, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are appearing here today with a great political ambition, with a coherent programme which is a significant commitment, and you are offering an alliance with Parliament.
On behalf of the Socialist Group, I can tell you that, in the terms that you have presented the issue - as Prime Minister of a Belgian rainbow government, which has demonstrated that democratic alternation also works in Belgium - of course you can count on our support and our cooperation.
Firstly, with regard to the future of the Union and its challenges, you have insisted that unity creates strength and that there must be cooperation with Parliament.
We agree on the diagnosis of the specific problems.
The question is now to know whether the way we are going to deal with them will be effective.
I believe we have two possible fundamental points of departure, which you have mentioned: on the one hand, the development of European citizenship and, on the other, the introduction of the euro.
It seems to me that over the last twenty years, since the draft Spinelli Treaty, the Adonino report, our work in preparing the Treaty of Maastricht, our drafts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Parliament has always been an ally and an accomplice in European progress.
Specifically, at the moment, we believe that it is extremely significant that, faced with the Laeken Declaration, there is an agreement on what you call the 'constitutionalisation' of the Treaties, which demands a public debate.
You have the responsibility to provide it, on the one hand, with a method and, on the other, with content.
That is a fundamental issue: we believe that the convention must be the forum which, with the participation of parliamentarians, governments and the Commission, prepares the work for a decisive Intergovernmental Conference.
You began by talking about your appearance as Minister of Budgets in 1988.
I was the rapporteur who presented the financial perspectives which have allowed us to make progress, but, as you know very well, anyone who ignores the budget is making a big mistake.
I believe it is absolutely essential that you argue that funding must be a public, democratic and fundamental element of our future.
Another basic element is the economic and social agenda.
You have asked for a coherent economic policy.
We need one.
We are in a period of far-reaching conversion and restructuring.
We need to defend our competitive capacity, but we must also respond to the thousands and thousands of workers who are affected by this very broad and decisive process.
It is therefore absolutely essential that we have an ambitious social dimension, that we insist on the quality of employment, and deal with pensions and the demographic future of Europe, and all these things are in your programme.
Finally, Madam President, our international dimension.
The European Union is the first experience of civilised globalisation in history.
We must defend that and take it to the next Millennium Round of the WTO.
But there are also some important challenges in relation to our personality in the world.
You have correctly pointed out that you can receive two telephone calls.
Two is better than none, which is what happened before.
We must consolidate what already exists.
I believe that, in this respect - think, for example of the number of calls received by the President of the United States - what we need is a clear approach, that must maintain a presence in the Balkans, in the Middle East, and I thank you for mentioning Africa.
At the Council of the Socialist International last weekend in Lisbon, we spoke about Africa as a fundamental priority.
That is one of our moral commitments.
I would add something more: for the first time there is a minister in Ecofin who proposes a debate on the viability of an international tax on speculation.
That must also contribute to making globalisation more civilised, and we welcome the fact that the Belgian presidency has taken that initiative.
Lastly, Mr President, and I will end here, I believe that 99 working days is very little; surely you are going to end up without any holidays.
However, if you are able to implement this ambitious project, you can count on our support, our cooperation and our understanding.
Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been said more than once that the Belgian Presidency comes at a crucial moment.
There are ample reasons for this.
To begin with, the indispensable and broadly based debate on the future of Europe which you must initiate.
The Laeken Declaration must be an initial outline of a Union which, although enlarged, can nevertheless work efficiently and with which citizens can identify.
Precisely because of people' s declining interest in Europe, you rightly said that the European Union must pay more attention to the concrete complaints of its citizens.
Another crucial point is the place of the Union in the world.
It is correct that the European Union should exercise more influence on world developments in the monetary, economic, social, ecological and commercial spheres, but also and especially in the field of international policy.
On that point, you are right to point to Africa, where there is a humanitarian problem.
But the EU could also play a more active role in relations with, for example, the United States, Russia and Asia and, particularly, in relation to the peace process in the Middle East.
Be that as it may, the merits of this Belgian Presidency will be largely judged by its internal achievements.
The Belgian programme appears many-faceted and ambitious, involving the European social model, concern for the quality of life and work, better cooperation in the fields of migration and asylum, the transition to the euro, the follow-up to enlargement and many other points.
Prime Minister, an onerous task awaits you.
The European Parliament and European citizens are waiting for a powerful signal.
In Belgium, you have proved yourself able to breathe new life into politics.
Let us hope that you can transfer this to Europe too.
You are said to be a keen and energetic cyclist.
It is true that you frequently enjoy cycling, and in a variety of conditions: without wind, with the wind behind you and with a headwind.
You will now learn that, in Europe, you will often be cycling into the wind.
However, we know that you are undaunted and we wish you the success you deserve.
Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Prime Minister, during your presidency we will be travelling down a long and winding road, which began with Nice and will end with Laeken.
As we saw at Gothenburg there have also been obstacles along that road.
Along the way there was also Dublin, where the people said they did not want to go any further along this road unless there were radical changes made to the plans.
I would now like to ask whether we must therefore return to Nice in order, finally, to get to Laeken.
My own view is that at Nice some big mistakes were made, which must at all costs be put right.
Future Member States were treated unfairly there. For example, they did not all receive their rightful share of seats in the European Parliament.
Secondly, we were by no means able there to confirm and clarify decision-making conventions in the European Union.
You yourself gave an example of this: there are more than thirty instruments at our disposal, which means it cannot really be clear how the European Union functions.
I think that the European Union can continue its expansion, even if the Treaty of Nice should not be ratified in its present form, and you, Prime Minister, have an excellent opportunity in this respect.
At Laeken a consultative committee must certainly be set up, to commence drafting a constitution for the European Union and to deliberate on fundamental issues.
It is most important that this is the path we should take and that future Member States can also be involved in this work, this convention, which must be established at Laeken.
You mentioned globalisation.
I was pleased to note that during your presidential term the Tobin tax is to be discussed, which civil society is speaking so much about.
I think you have a perfect opportunity to show you understand what President Prodi was talking about: that globalisation also causes problems, dividing European societies into two and, furthermore, adding to the two-way split in societies in the global context.
Show you understand this concern, so that globalisation may then finally serve to benefit the development of the European social model, which you have named as one of your goals.
I would also like to mention the forthcoming talks on climate, which are to start in Bonn in two weeks' time.
You must use all your diplomatic skills to bring the United States, Japan and Australia back to the negotiating table.
My group will lend you all the support it can in your efforts to continue the work Sweden began in the name of sustainable development.
I would also like to note that we now have a president of the Council and a president of the Commission, who are both cyclists!
I believe that you understand the need to give sufficient weight to environmental problems relating to traffic and mobility in particular, which are contained in the programme of the Belgian presidency.
In this connection I might say that the President-in-Office of the Council in the Transport Council represents my political group and is doing some creditable work.
Finally, as we approach Laeken, first the king' s mighty castle appears on the horizon.
But do not, however, make this European Council meeting a royal event of bygone days, where decisions are reached over the people' s heads.
Remember that democracy and transparency are what are needed more than anything else, and do not in any event build more castles in Brussels for future European summits!
This would not be giving the right signal to the public.
I nevertheless hope that your presidency will come to be even half as popular as a certain well-known royal princess - Mathilde - is in your country.
If you manage as much, your presidential term will have been a job well done.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I appreciated the fact, Mr Verhofstadt, that you frankly acknowledged what you rightly called an 'identity crisis' in Europe between the citizens and the European Union, and that you stressed the need to take their aspirations seriously so that, as you said, we can bring the citizens closer to Europe.
It makes a change from the all too frequent speeches designed to mollify, which people can no longer listen to because of all the contradictions that are glossed over.
It is only natural that new issues will arise from experience, which call for changes, innovations, and sometimes a questioning of matters that were believed to be done and dusted.
No subject should be taboo - we must acknowledge the problems, as you stressed.
In this spirit, I would like to mention a few issues that surface increasingly often in the debate provoked by the changes that are now affecting the European Union.
I believe that these issues should be raised as part of the exchange of ideas that you are hoping to promote during your presidency.
We have been repeatedly told, for example, that the eurozone was shielded from the major repercussions of the economic slowdown in the US.
We must now admit that, unfortunately, this has not been the case.
This is quite a serious misdiagnosis.
What sort of analysis is being carried out?
What sort of lessons in economic and monetary policy must we learn from this, so as to avoid the European economy becoming entangled in the American financial bubble that is now about to burst over us?
I would reiterate that, over six years, there has been a nine-fold increase in the amount of European capital flowing to the United States which, last year, reached over USD 220 billion.
There is another example that Mr Duisenberg himself sometimes uses - in contrast to the US Federal Reserve, which is required under its mandate to promote employment and growth, the European Central Bank is not required to deal with these problems, which are indeed at the heart of all of our concerns.
Do the European citizens know this?
And what do they really think of this, when in fact unemployment is on the increase and growth is in decline?
Should we not give some thought to this subject?
I have another example - the Stability Pact requires Member States to rationalise their public and social spending.
If we merely follow this policy over the coming months, will it not lead to an economic slowdown, at a time when we actually need to stimulate growth?
In what way can we revise the usual criteria or the way in which they are implemented in order to overcome this contradiction?
Generally speaking, the fundamental question that the new, and rapidly deteriorating, economic circumstances raise and indeed force us to consider is, in my view, the following: what sort of political creativity can we come up with in order to avoid serious tension arising in all our societies even between some of the Member States, and, more importantly, with the candidate countries?
This question cannot be answered by some sort of project to elect the President of the Commission by universal suffrage.
I think that we will have to attack the hard core of the neo-liberal model, which pervades European integration to an excessive degree. I also think that we are going to have to listen as well as involve the social actors and citizens in this necessary change.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to know how courageous and daring the Belgian presidency, which you have launched today, is prepared to be in this area?
Madam President, firstly I should to thank the Belgian government for outlining in its legislative agenda the priorities it intends to pursue during its six month presidency of the Union.
It has already made it clear that it intends to promote wider cooperation between law enforcement agencies throughout the Union.
Within the Union a new institutional framework to fight against organised crime is being put in place, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The European Council has since launched two action plans to combat organised crime, aimed at overcoming disparities in national procedures and encouraging more efficient judicial cooperation.
The creation of Europol represented a major step forward in this context.
It is important that all EU institutions work together to ensure the development of a coherent European strategy against organised crime.
We must, at the same time, overcome difficulties to ensure that crossborder crime is tackled without curtailing the freedoms and legal rights of individuals and economic operators.
We should all recall that the primary motive of organised crime is financial gain.
I support a European-wide political agreement concerning the identification and confiscation of the proceeds of crime in all its forms.
We are all aware of the success the Irish Criminal Assets Bureau has had over the last five years in confiscating the proceeds of crime.
In Europe much has already been done to fight cyber crime.
The Council of Europe is in the process of completing preparations for the world' s first international convention on cyber crime.
The Commission has already presented a legislative proposal on child pornography on the Internet, in line with the provisions of the Council of Europe' s cyber crime convention.
I support the Commission' s framework programme to combat trafficking in human beings; the aim is to develop effective judicial cooperation across the European Union.
Over the next six months the Belgian presidency will have a coordinating role as we put in place the finishing touches to the launch of the euro notes and coins on 1 January next.
It is important that the information campaigns, which are to be intensified later this summer, are successfully managed.
In recent weeks the Israeli foreign minister and the Palestinian leader have visited Parliament.
It is now evident that the European Union has come to assume a pivotal role in pursuing peace within the Middle East.
I very much hope that the Belgian presidency will use this important time to help end the spiral of violence in the Middle East and seek the recommencement of dialogue between all parties in the region.
We are all aware that the EU leaders will be meeting in Laeken later this year to agree the format of a structured debate on Europe' s future.
It is very important that we avoid contributing to the creation of a two-tier Europe.
I certainly do not want to build a European Union that is controlled by the larger Member States to the detriment of the smaller Member States.
Smaller Member States must be strongly represented within the overall EU institutional structure.
Finally, I would urge the Belgian presidency to ensure that the difficult chapters of negotiation with the applicant countries are opened as soon as possible.
Solutions must be found to the chapters of discussion which to date have remained closed concerning the future accession of countries from central and eastern Europe.
Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard the Presidency being very quick to talk of a Laeken Declaration, but feel obliged to remind them that the Treaty of Nice no longer exists, since it was rejected by an impeccably democratic referendum in Ireland.
The way in which this established fact is being ignored by European officialdom is very characteristic of the undemocratic, dangerously totalitarian turn that the European Union is taking.
For that matter, in other European Member States, even holding referenda is considered too risky.
No referendum on European expansion plans, no referendum on the introduction of the euro and no referendum on Europe' s ever-tightening grip on strictly national powers over, for example, culture or social security.
Gentlemen with the word democracy forever on their lips refuse to let the people decide for themselves.
Last week in the leading Flemish weekly Trends, Frans Crols put it as follows: 'On 1 July, Belgium will become head of the Brussels mafia.
An amalgam of unelected apparatchiks in Brussels who are trying to build an ersatz-superpower in consultation with European politicians who outdo each other in vagueness' .
In that sense, it is very symbolic that the Belgian Presidency should be represented in Parliament by Prime Minister Verhofstadt and by Foreign Minister Michel.
Mr Michel is the man who led the hate campaigns against Austria and against Italy, since the people of those countries paid no attention in democratic elections to the paternalistic voting advice of a self-satisfied Belgian diplomatic machine.
Mr Verhofstadt is an undisputed champion, not only in cycling, but also in lying and breaking his word.
He is the man who came to power in Belgium, and remains in power, by denying his own civil manifestos and election promises and through a policy of systematic horsetrading and lying to the detriment of his own people.
Mr Verhofstadt is the man who cannot defeat the opposition Flemish Block party at the polls and who therefore is trying, at the taxpayers' expense, to have my party banned by the courts with methods that would not have been out of place behind the Iron Curtain or in Nazi Germany.
What the French lawyer Isorni once said about Michel DebrÃ© applies equally to Mr Verhofstadt: Qu' il marche Ã  plat ventre sous le poids lourd de ses reniements, he crawls flat on his belly, weighed down by the weight of his denials.
Mr President, Prime Minister and Mr President of the Commission, the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities and the cross-party intergroup, SOS Democracy also wish to welcome Mr Verhofstadt as President-in-Office of the Council and pledge our critical and constructive opposition, at the same time as reminding the prime minister of his promise of a meeting with SOS Democracy.
Your speeches in Austria and here today would have been much better if you had also talked with the democratic EU opposition.
We can perhaps help you to understand why people have voted no in the last three referenda on the EU in Denmark, Switzerland and Ireland.
When we discussed the Irish 'no' vote in the conciliation committee, there was not a member who dared to say that the Treaty of Nice could be adopted in a referendum in their country.
Those who expressed an opinion thought it would fail to be adopted.
One person said that it was fortunate that no referendum was to take place, for in that case it would also fail to be adopted in his own country, Portugal.
It is easier to replace a treaty than a country' s people.
Respect the ground rules that have been adopted unanimously.
Respect the Irish 'no' vote.
The Treaty of Nice has failed to be adopted.
Instead, support grassroots discussions concerning a treaty which people will be able to vote in favour of in all the countries, because it does not restrict, but rather extends democracy.
Acquire a more comprehensive circle of advisers.
With all due respect, your new think-tank consists mainly of elderly people who have all contributed to shifting power from voters and elected representatives to officials and ministers.
There are no young people and no women and not a single person who shares the views of the democratic majority which votes 'no' in EU referenda.
Mr Delors, Mr Dehaene, Mr Amato, Mr Geremek and Mr Milliband are hardly in a position to write a treaty which can attract majority votes in referenda.
SOS Democracy has sketched out a thirteen-point alternative which we should like to discuss with you.
It can be read at EU.observer.com, and its demands could presumably be adopted in a referendum because the heading refers not to a more intrusive European Union characterised by secrecy, bureaucracy and remoteness from the people but to a considerably slimmed-down EU, characterised by transparency, democracy and proximity to the people.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, although the Belgian Presidency has only just got into gear, many people have the impression, President-in-Office of the Council, that your tour of Europe began earlier with the rather premature launch of the sixteen priorities programme, or even in the wings at Nice, where your well-oiled communications machine managed to project the notion of Laeken even before it was fully appreciated that Nice, in several respects at least, would prove a failure.
The road ahead of you is not an easy one.
On the one hand, you yourself have chosen it through your ambitious announcements but, on the other hand, you will not have escaped the tricolour rucksack given you as head of government of a country that is traditionally known to be able to reconcile the irreconcilable and, at difficult moments, to have launched visionary proposals that help the European community to progress.
On behalf of the Belgian members of the largest group in this Chamber, I wish you the same success as Jean-Luc Dehaene in 1993.
He was virtually buried under the weight of praise.
We are not part of the coalition headed by you, but we have no intention of putting a spoke in the wheels of your Presidency or of reducing this Chamber to an arena for internal Belgian use.
What our predecessors constructed in Europe is too precious to us for that.
We are even prepared to give you a helpful push, at least when the race official is not watching, but only if your Presidency sets a course that really improves people' s lot, both here and elsewhere in the world.
Mr President, there is insufficient time to dwell on the matters on the agenda, but the list is not really that important.
What does matter is the quality of the solutions and the vision that they project.
Whether we are talking about the conversion to the euro, enlargement, the Laeken Declaration on the future or the legislative matters, one thing is clear: the people are no longer behind us, they have lost their way, the peloton no longer really knows where the European course is leading it.
Prime Minister, work to ensure that people feel at home again in Europe.
There are no miracle cures, but there are key words: information, democratic involvement and transparency.
In December, you have the king' s permission to use his palace.
I hope that you will also be given the use of the royal greenhouses. Their symbolic value is great.
Naturally, you will also be expected to ensure that the palace at the summit of Laeken is not demolished.
There will be no shortage of demonstrators and troublemakers in Brussels either, unless you ensure that there is real involvement.
Why do you not conduct a Europe-wide NGO consultation exercise?
Not at the same time as Laeken, but about four weeks beforehand.
You would be offering genuine demonstrators the opportunity to make themselves heard in a positive way while it were still of benefit to do so , and if the mass of genuine demonstrators were subsequently absent, the attraction for the anarchist hooligans would be immediately removed.
I look forward to your reaction to this suggestion.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I think, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the applause from my group just now on the presentation of the programme of the Belgian Presidency has shown you that you can count on the full support of my group and, for that matter, I should also particularly like to emphasise the complete support of the Belgian Socialists in this group.
I was especially glad that you began with Europe' s crisis of identity, because it is definitely not just in Ireland but everywhere in the European Union, even in Belgium, that there is a sense of there being a gulf between ourselves and ordinary citizens.
It will therefore not be 'business as usual' for the Belgian Presidency, certainly not with a historic task such as enlargement in prospect.
In that context, I should therefore like to bring to your attention three points that strike us as being especially important.
Firstly: it is clear that the future of Europe can no longer be worked out in exclusive groups either of diplomats or of technicians.
Europe must again become a political project, and that means, for example, that the debate on the future must really become a large-scale, albeit difficult, exercise in European democracy.
It must therefore be carried out in dialogue with civil society and be more than a virtual debate on a website being instead a kind of parliamentary assembly of civil society.
The second point concerns your Laeken Declaration.
As you yourself quite rightly say, the discussion must centre on where we are heading with the enlarged Union and cover how we are to proceed, with what institutions and with what finance.
I should like to ask you, please, to remember to include a healthy environment and the quality of life in this vision of the future of Europe.
I believe it is a wise decision that you wish to prepare for this debate with the help of the advisors of the Laeken group.
But allow me, with the greatest respect for the mainly grey-haired wise men, to say that it will surely not be prepared for without the presence of a single woman.
I truly hope that you will correct this blemish, because the future of Europe concerns the future of men and women alike.
A final point.
I am convinced that people' s confidence in European institutions can also grow through the practical issues.
And I believe that your programme guarantees a social, sustainable and politically stronger Europe.
I should like to come back to one specific matter, namely that concerning the taxation of speculative capital flows.
This may seem a detail in your list of priorities, a symbolic matter, but for everyone, MEPs and NGOs, throughout Europe who are convinced that globalisation has produced distortions, this is a very important issue.
The Belgian Presidency could show, in connection with this matter, that there really is a difference between the thousands of peaceful demonstrators who stood in the street of Gothenburg and have a political message and those who know only the language of violence.
I wish you every success with the Presidency, and you can rely on our support.
Mr Verhofstadt, first of all, if I may, I would like to praise what I shall call the Belgian presidency' s clear analysis.
I think that there really is a democratic deficit and that we must resist a hard core.
I would like, however, if I may, to clarify that I am not thinking of the hard core that Mr Wurtz referred to, but the hard core of excessive bureaucracy, red tape and administrative hassle, which have prevented the public from being able to see clearly what Europe is doing.
Stay focused, therefore, on what you have presented.
What we must destroy is this Europe which lives by means of paper, by means of an image which does not correspond to what the citizens effectively want.
I would like to wish you good luck, because we know full well how demanding your political task is.
I shall now come back to three points.
The Laeken Declaration must, without question, give more weight, credibility and depth to our diplomatic approach.
It is clearly important to transform the current mechanism for international relations in order to gain the means to enable us to intervene, as you have said, in Africa and in other countries, as well as in Maghreb and in events that currently unfolding, particularly in Algeria.
We need a stronger diplomatic mechanism.
Secondly, as regards the power issue within the European Union itself, do what you have said you would; set a challenge for the debate to clarify the responsibilities of each of the institutions and, possibly, to extend the co-decision procedure in Parliament.
My third and final point is that, with reference to the lack of clarity for citizens, I believe that it will be essential to dare to bring up the problem of the European constitution.
The people of Europe have to know who wants and who does not want this European constitution, and, finally, after Laeken, the process must be more definite.
I wish you good luck and I hope that at the end of the presidency, you will have been able to make progress on most of the points that you highlighted in the presentation on this presidency.
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can obviously count on this Parliament being predisposed in your favour.
That of course has to do with your high ambitions, which correspond with our own and also with the great disappointments that we as parliamentarians were forced to endure at Nice and during various presidencies.
But, as you know, the higher you climb, the further you have to fall.
It will count more heavily against you in this Parliament if you fail, than against those of whom less was expected.
There is already a first: regional ministers will also operate during your Presidency of the Council.
And I am speaking here as chair of the European Free Alliance to tell you that the regions are counting on you to ensure that, during this Presidency, their request to be directly involved in the discussions on the future of Europe will be granted.
Our wish is that the role of the European constitutional regions should be strengthened in the Union.
At the same time, we want a federal Europe that is better equipped for its core tasks, such as foreign and security policy.
Is it not appalling that, so close to enlargement of the Union to include five hundred million people and over twenty Member States, we do not yet even have a coherent European migration and asylum policy although, every day, traffickers in human beings dump desperate people on our coasts and allow them to drown?
A safe and just area, able to remove people' s fear of enlargement, is one of your priorities.
The battle against illegal trading in arms, drugs and human beings must be vigorously engaged in, as must the battle against fraud.
Of course, I have a number of other wishes, but I shall be able to make them known to you on other occasions.
I wish you every success.
Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to give my sincere and heartfelt thanks to Mr Verhofstadt for presenting the work programme of the Belgian presidency.
Unlike Mrs Thyssen, I believe that Mr Verhofstadt is showing us the way.
He has made some revolutionary proposals, and I am slightly saddened, Mr Poettering, that you and many others have not picked up on this.
Mr Verhofstadt is proposing nothing less than saving the Commission, because the election of President of the Commission by universal suffrage is the only way to save the Commission, since we know that the European Union will perish without it.
Therefore, I would say to the dead souls of bureaucracy, who would prefer to choose a president using fundamentally obscure parliamentary manoeuvres, that those who are not on this wavelength must strongly support Mr Verhofstadt' s idea and proposals.
I hope that we too will be allies of the Belgian presidency and the Belgian presidency not just an ally of the European Parliament.
There is, of course, no doubt about the main message of Mr Verhofstadt' s statement, of which we were also aware in advance: the integration process is to be consolidated, where that fine up-beat word 'integration' means more power to the EU institutions and a corresponding weakening of the national democracies.
This is something of which the President-in-Office of the Council and, for that matter, the combined EU machine is very well aware, and they betray the fact when they talk about the distance between the EU and its people.
This is described as a democratic deficit, and it is said that people must reconcile themselves with the EU' s institutions.
What, then, is to be done about something that is undeniably, of course, a fundamental democratic problem?
What is to be done when, time after time, the people vote against integration on those notably exceptional occasions when they are asked?
Is the voice of the people being listened to?
No, it is not.
Instead, a complaint is voiced, most recently to the effect that the Irish people had voted wrongly, and it is also pointed out that there were not a great many people who voted and that those who did must have thought they were voting on something else.
What is more, the vote was about the same as at the elections to the European Parliament.
And so the integration and ratification process in connection with the Treaty of Nice is continued with as if nothing had happened.
However, rhetoric is not enough, as the President-in-Office of the Council so commendably said.
Ignoring a people' s clear statement about the integration process is not democracy, but autocracy.
Autocracy must have a democratic faÃ§ade, however, and the very telling words of the President-in-Office of the Council are designed to reconcile the people to the EU' s institutions.
The Benelux Declaration of 21 June is a frightening example of this process.
It is a so-called structured debate.
Whether it be called a forum, a convention or whatever, what essentially it is about is excluding one side: the crucial side of the agenda.
The historical model to return to in this case is the Supreme Soviet' s democracy arrangements.
It is a parody of democracy: government by the people, but without the people.
You say that more than rhetoric is needed here, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. I agree, and that 'more' is to ask the question, 'Is integration the solution or the problem?'
Mr President, whether the presidency' s chosen epitheton ornans is achieved - and it is an ambitious aim - is something which we will only be able to assess at the end of the year.
In any case, the programme which has been presented today indicates as much.
I am particularly pleased that the issues surrounding the future of Europe play an important role in this programme.
Allow me, in this connection, to make two comments.
Firstly, I think that we cannot simply ignore the Irish referendum and proceed with our agenda without harming the European Idea.
Secondly, I am convinced that if the intergovernmental conference were brought forward to 2003, as the European Parliament has proposed, this would be seen as an attempt to escape the people' s vote.
The result would be a further fall in turnout at the elections.
I particularly welcome the fact therefore that the report on priorities will still be produced in 2004, hopefully after the elections.
I should like to recall one further point: it should come as no surprise to the Belgian presidency, of all presidencies, if it is forced to realise when implementing its ambitious programme that, because the sanctions are still ringing in their ear of solidarity, the Austrian people have become rather hard of hearing.
I would like to focus on one of the central ideas of the Belgian presidency, according to what has been said this morning.
I believe we can all agree on the following consideration: the free movement of people, goods and capital which we enjoy in the European Union has also given rise to the free movement of criminals within our borders but, nevertheless, since there is no free movement of police or judicial decisions, we are running the risk of creating an area of impunity within Europe.
Furthermore, we must recognise that the progress made since Tampere in the development of the third pillar has not responded to the ambitions drawn up there.
In Laeken, within the planned assessment of the degree of compliance with the European Commission' s scoreboard for the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice, the Heads of Government are being offered an excellent opportunity to provide a political impulse for this process.
I would therefore ask Mr Verhofstadt to decide to favour a political declaration of this nature, which would inject new dynamism into the process started at Tampere.
This means creating more efficient instruments for combating terrorism, such as the European arrest order.
The European Union, Mr President, is an area with harmonisable judicial systems in the field of judicial guarantees and respect for human rights, and we must therefore 'communitise' the fight against organised crime.
Mr President, I very much welcome the programme and priorities of the Belgian presidency in the employment and social field.
It is a programme essentially about the modernisation, but also about the renewal and reinforcement of the European social model, and as such it obviously strikes a positive cord with the Socialist Group in this house.
One key element of that programme will be the work you will do to set out clearly the social goals we need to achieve in the reform of our pension systems.
That, rather than a concentration on the concerns of the financial institutions, should be our proper starting point.
Your work should also fit well with the communication announced in Parliament by Commissioner Diamantopoulou yesterday.
In that broader field, you will be putting in place the most important building blocks for an open coordination for social protection, and we wish you well, although I was disappointed not to hear specific reference to social exclusion in that context.
Three specific points in the employment and labour market area: first, in relation to quality of work, it would be very useful if you could work with us in Parliament to incorporate amendments on quality indicators into the employment guidelines for 2002 to jump-start the Commission' s communication on that subject.
Second, also in relation to quality, I hope you will apply some pressure to the Commission to speed up its preparation and launching of a new strategy on health and safety.
The delay is unacceptable.
Finally, I know that you will work with us to adopt, as quickly as possible, the general framework on information and consultation and the company statute.
But I also hope again that you will apply pressure to the Commission to speed up its work on the revision of the European Works' Council Directive.
That too is a very important ingredient and there is no good reason for its delay until the end of this year or the beginning of next.
Ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, after what you have said I am satisfied that the great, but also difficult, debate on the future of the Union is in good hands with you.
So, open that door as wide as possible in Laeken so that we can have a thorough debate.
And, as a Fleming, I should like to ask you to ensure that, in this debate, the regions are finally able to play a role in the Union.
As you quite rightly said, a radical intervention is necessary to make it clear to people how important the Union can be for them.
But more is required than that.
The Union must also work through, and carry to a conclusion, the decisions that it has taken and is still taking.
And you have already mentioned a number of things.
As a Liberal, I should like to stress a few more: the Tampere Summit , the rights and duties of the citizen and security.
I am glad that you have said that it is high time that some impact was felt.
That Tampere Summit is almost two years old.
The Lisbon Summit was about achieving the most competitive and efficient economy in the world. It was a very liberal declaration, but the fire has gone out of it.
I am glad that there are a few important liberalising issues on the table and that you have said that, during this Presidency, a few must be solved.
The Gothenburg Summit of a few weeks ago was about sustainability, including the decision to comply with Kyoto.
Therefore, the Commission must table a proposal as soon as possible on the trading of emission rights and, under your Presidency, something must be done as soon as possible with that proposal so that we can apply Kyoto in an economically feasible manner.
That is of huge importance to the European economy, and certainly to the Flemish economy.
The Feira Summit is my last example.
At that summit, already over a year ago, a charter for small and medium-sized businesses was approved.
The Union has had a policy on small and medium-sized businesses for such a long time, but the benefits of the Union sometimes seem very far off, especially for small businesses.
People find it all too complicated, so give concrete form to a few of those provisions of the charter for small and medium-sized businesses.
And if you implement a number of decisions where security, competition policy, small and medium-sized business policy and the environment are concerned, , you will increase the impact of Europe on people and we shall be able to say at the end of the year, as in the TV commercial: "a little pride can do no harm" .
Mr President, we are aware of your interest in businesses, and particularly the role they play in society in each of our Member States.
A genuine policy of cooperation for businesses is even more essential due to the fact that economic growth is slowing down, the number of people out of work in our societies is still too high and because of regional planning, especially in our rural areas.
What became of all our good intentions and the objectives that were laid down in Lisbon in March 2000 to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic area in the world - or those set at Feira last year, where the Council adopted the European Charter for Small Enterprises?
This charter has gone unheeded.
No appropriations have been set aside and no practical measures have been planned.
Mr President, what decisions are you going to take in order to draw up a work programme for the practical implementation of the ten policy guidelines laid down in this charter?
Furthermore, the Sixth Framework Programme on Research and Development, which will be voted on during your presidency, is in the process of being drafted.
What place will you grant to businesses?
What are your proposals to enable every business to gain access to the consumer society, regardless of its size and business sector?
I am thinking in particular of all small enterprises and traditional businesses.
Mr President, thank you for the warm reception.
Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Belgian presidency comes at a time when the European Union is at a crucial crossroads.
Rarely, in my opinion, has a presidency taken office in such a difficult situation, where there are nevertheless so many opportunities on offer.
This is the presidency which must shape the future face of Europe: it must steer the post-Nice process, which will have to be concluded in Laeken, and at the same time it must also set the necessary preparations for the enlargement of the European Union in train.
A link must also be established between the two.
This means that an important point is being made to President Prodi, namely that following the Irish referendum we need to keep a further option open and consider how enlargement can be achieved without Nice, and without enlargement being delayed as a result.
This must remain an option so that we do not put the accession countries into a state of uncertainty.
I am delighted, Mr President-in-Office, with your proposal for a convention, or whatever you would like to call it, because this paves the way - and I am sure that you will make this a reality in Laeken - for the European Union to find a new method of working which will take us away from the routine of intergovernmental conferences hitherto.
This convention will move the preparations for the intergovernmental conference onto a political level, and this will allow us to seek solutions and a means of having a treaty which the public understand, a treaty in which the division of responsibilities is clear to the public, so that the drawbacks and rewards which it has to offer can be articulated by the public and so that, above all, we have a Union of 27 Member States which is capable of making decisions.
I am also particularly pleased that you mentioned the Council in this context, which will have to be active as a legislator, as a second chamber, and - crucially - in public, so that in this way we really can foster public involvement in the decision-making process.
At the same time, in the light of what is happening in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is important for this presidency that, where foreign, security and defence policy is concerned, we move away from the 'too little, too late' and finally make the necessary decisions to ensure that we do not have to face military conflicts of this kind again.
Mr President, I feel I can say that the Parliamentary Committee on Constitutional Affairs firmly supports the statement which launched the Belgian presidency' s term of office this morning, particularly one of the points you made, Mr Verhofstadt, to the effect that it is not enough to provide the citizens with tangible solutions to the tangible problems which affect them most.
Of course, the new developments in the Union' s policies such as those you outlined will enable us to win back the citizens' confidence in the European project, but the citizens also feel a strong need to be able to take part in the development stage of the Union' s guidelines and decisions.
The democratic legitimacy of the Union is not an abstract question, of interest only to institutional affairs enthusiasts and experts; moreover, enlargement on a large scale imposes the urgent need and provides the opportunity for a genuine renewal, both symbolic and institutional, of the European Union.
We therefore appreciate your clear, unequivocal commitment to producing a European Constitution.
In this regard, I would like to point out that, only yesterday, in Milan, the Italian President of the Republic, Mr Ciampi, made a speech along precisely those lines.
As regards the Convention, Mr Verhofstadt, as you know, the dispute over the name is not meaningless.
Those who insist on the term 'forum' have something different in mind from what you said.
We support the line you have taken and we are confident that Laeken will opt for the Convention.
Mr President, the Belgian presidency' s ambitious programme for this presidency gives us hope that it is possible to combine tangible, solid steps on the way to an even more successful future for Europe with vision.
You see, I actually believe that the public not only expect practical solutions, but also want to know where we are heading in the European Union.
This will also become apparent in the case of economic policy.
Here too, Mr President-in-Office, we need more democracy and transparency, and I would be pleased if the Belgian presidency were also to take on board the proposals which the European Parliament has already developed.
It is in economic policy in particular that we see that, on the basis of the Lisbon and Stockholm conclusions, further progress needs to be made so that we can also actually bring about growth based on effective employment.
At a time when one negative prognosis about the development of the European Union follows hot on the heels of another, it is important for the Belgian presidency to try, with a steady hand, to set priorities so that we can actually successfully achieve our ambitious goal of bundling and coordinating policies in the fields of the economy, employment and social affairs.
There is still a lot of catching up to do here, and coordination must not only be a word; it must also be reflected in the bundling of policies and in the creation of greater transparency so that steps of this kind are also taken in tandem across the Member States.
The same applies to fiscal policy, Mr President, because here we have unfair competition within the European Union.
I am counting on the Belgian presidency here.
In conclusion, I should like to make one further point: yours is a twofold presidency and you also have the task of leading the eurozone in the run-up to 1 January 2002.
We all know that there is still a lack of information and a lack of acceptance.
I call on the Belgian presidency, together with its colleagues, to make the introduction of the euro really a top-level issue so that we not only have brochures being distributed but also confidence-building measures being initiated by your side, so that as the euro moves from being a virtual currency union to being a reality it is accompanied by confidence and credibility.
Mr President, the Belgian presidency' s ambitions coincide with the ambitions of Parliament.
There is continuity in foreign and defence policy, in the implementation of the single currency and in sustainable development, but there is also insistence on the relationship between European integration, economic competitiveness and the social agenda.
We need to modernise the European social model, which is characterised by solidarity.
Nevertheless, the key issue concerns the relationship between enlargement and reform of the European institutions.
Enlargement must be a success for Europe.
The Laeken Summit must remove the intergovernmental uncertainties of Nice.
It is now a question of method and of political substance as well.
The response can only be provided by a Convention which in which, first and foremost, the national parliaments and the European Parliament participate as democratic representatives of the citizens.
In order to restore the citizens' confidence in Europe, we must make the institutions of this Convention more transparent, more efficient and more democratic.
This is the point - it has even been said today - on which Council, Commission and Parliament all agree.
This is a challenge which is highlighted by globalisation, a challenge that we must tackle together as we work towards a European Constitution.
Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Belgium is Europe in miniature with all its advantages and disadvantages.
This experience is partly the key to the success of the Belgian presidency.
The Belgian work programme is ambitious, and it is also set against an extraordinary context in order to regain the trust of the citizens, in other words, with the introduction of the euro, a debate on the future of Europe and also a debate on enlargement.
If we wish to gain the trust of the citizen, however, I believe that, above all, it is essential to make Europe credible and to make our policies credible.
(DE) Mr President, in this context I should like to highlight a specific problem, namely the typically European behaviour which we have observed in recent years and which consists of fighting for one' s own country and for one' s own region, even if this is at the expense of Europe' s development, and then being astounded that the public have lost faith in Europe.
However, this analysis goes even further.
The end product of this - and this brings me to what the President of the Commission said - is a denial of solidarity, and we are only too aware of this.
Just as it is in Belgium, it is also an easy but very dangerous policy at European level to convince the rich to refuse to show solidarity with the poor.
I believe that today we need more courage to show solidarity, but the forthcoming enlargement means that we need even more courage.
Making Europe credible therefore also means answering the very simple questions posed by the public, which are part of your programme.
Why do we talk about a Europe without borders when in health, fiscal and social policy we still have borders, which even create competition?
Why do we not simply say: we want enlargement towards the east, but no country is prepared to pay even one additional euro towards the cost of this.
There are numerous questions and I would say to the Belgian Prime Minister: in the language of figure skating, your compulsory programme is outstanding, but you will be judged on your free programme, and in these efforts to win over the public Parliament will be at your side.
(Applause)
Mr President, ambition is a practical joke played by the gods on mankind.
They give us ambitions so we believe we can climb the heights of Olympus and then they ensure that we never reach the top.
The programme of the Belgian presidency is ambitious.
It would be ambitious for a two-year presidency, but for one of 99 days, as the President-in-Office has pointed out, I fear that it is too ambitious.
I welcome, of course, his intention that the Union should listen to the people.
"We have to resolve the Irish question."
How often have those words been uttered down the centuries?
But Mr Verhofstadt has to lead the Council towards a resolution of the problem, posed by the failure of Nice and by the Irish referendum.
The democratic decision of the Irish people cannot be ignored or ridden roughshod over.
Democracy may be inconvenient, but it is all we have between freedom and tyranny.
Moreover, the Irish referendum and the concerns exposed in the demonstrations - even though they were hijacked by extremists - should be telling us something.
As the President-in-Office has said: they are telling us that Europe is not being listened to.
People all over the Union, and indeed in the global market all over the world, have lost their faith in the institutions of governance.
They are looking to us, their elected representatives, not for initiatives, but for reassurance. Not for change piled upon change, but for stability.
Not for ambition, but, for that rarest of all human virtues - common sense.
If I may paraphrase the ancient Greek proverb for the President-in-Office: "Those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first raise high."
Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciated Prime Minister Verhofstadt' s call in his speech to make Europe not just a Europe of red tape but, first and foremost, a Europe of citizens.
However, it is not enough, ladies and gentlemen, to tell the Europeans that they are European citizens.
We need to make them feel like European citizens.
The euro is certainly an important step - and I agree with the line taken by President Prodi - but it is not enough.
Without substantial political support, the euro is likely to encounter difficulties, as it has in recent months, in relation to the dollar and other currencies.
This is why we cannot disregard the outcome of the Irish vote but must give it our utmost attention.
This is why we must involve the European citizens in a convincing rediscovery of our common cultural, historical and political identity through an incisive policy linked to the principle of subsidiarity. Therefore, what can be decided at a lower level - and here I agree with Prime Minister Verhofstadt - must be.
The European Union must not concern itself with too many things but must lay down the guidelines, the policy lines for genuine involvement of the people and parliaments in the process of unification and enlargement.
The Convention preparing the forthcoming IGC must therefore directly involve the representatives of the people, that is the representatives of this and the national parliaments.
Involving the people too in the reform of the institutions will give this European Union an increasingly significant political - and I stress, political as well as economic - role.
These, I feel, are the bases for achieving an enlargement which we strongly believe to be an irreversible, necessary step for the European Union: an enlargement in which my political grouping believes and which the government, which my political grouping supports in Italy, stressed both in its meeting with President Prodi and at the last Gothenburg meeting.
However, if we really want to achieve permanent enlargement, it is vital that we involve the citizens and their representatives more and more.
Mr President, the Belgian Presidency is an important link in the preparation for enlargement because, during this Presidency, the first steps will be taken towards the next IGC. That will be the conference that represents the last chance before enlargement to modify the European institutions and decision making process.
Despite this, the wider context is difficult.
The Germany-France axis will be partly blocked by elections next year in both countries.
Public alarm in the face of enlargement is real.
When it comes to Europe, the courage of the present Member States is not very great, and time is short.
Against this background, Belgium must succeed in having a declaration approved at Laeken which must, at any rate, contain an improvement in the decision-making process and must increase democratic legitimacy.
I am consciously not talking here about much larger projects that are being launched and that are aimed at bringing about a real revolution in all the institutions.
I have my doubts about the political feasibility of these.
As far as the improvement of the decision-making process is concerned, two things are essential.
Firstly, the unanimity rule must be abolished, except for matters related to the institutions themselves and to the transfer of powers.
With twenty-seven or thirty Member States, you cannot continue to work with the unanimity rule.
In conjunction with this change, the co-decision procedure with Parliament must be expanded.
The one must be linked to the other.
Secondly, there is an absolute need to make Europe less complex.
The Treaty of Nice is scarcely comprehensible, let alone explainable.
A host of decisions, directives, regulations, orders, guidelines and recommendations cannot be understood without a dictionary or accompanying notes, and even then they pose problems.
The decisions from Gothenburg are still puzzling even after three readings and four translations. This is true not only for ordinary people but also for extraordinary ones.
European seems to be becoming a twelfth language, with terms that, if they are not incomprehensible, have at least taken on a life of their own.
You must also already have been 'benchmarked' , 'mainstreamed' , etc. The language of Europe has not become the language of Europeans.
On the contrary. In order to channel the involvement of the population productively, I believe that the Belgian Presidency should make a real project out of such involvement.
You should include this project among your priorities.
Euronews is financed by Europe.
If we want to know something about Europe, we follow CNN, not Euronews.
And you can say the same about many things that Europe does to inform the population.
Make it a project, Prime Minister!
Add this to your priorities and try to agree a relevant course of action with the countries of Europe.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have announced an ambitious programme, Mr President-in-Office, and the ambition of your proposals is commensurate with the challenges which lie ahead.
That is why, at the end of this debate, I should like to express the wish that you will be equal to your own ambition and that you will enjoy success.
On behalf of the CDU/CSU Group in this Parliament, may you be an effective President-in-Office of the Council.
You will need our support and you will also have it.
You rightly said at the beginning that you want to reconcile the public with Europe.
This has been expressed in various different ways.
The reasons for the loss of confidence in Europe, which before was hidden beneath the surface but which, since the referendum in Ireland, is now there for all to see, are many and diverse; they have been mentioned.
In passing, however, it should be stated that a further factor in this was the way in which the powerful members of the Council for example dealt with a country like Austria.
Perhaps your foreign minister will have the opportunity to repair some of the damage which has been done to Austria' s faith in Europe.
The method adopted hitherto in intergovernmental conferences has had its day because decisions of consequence - such as those made when treaties are amended - must no longer be made in Council back rooms in the dead of night; instead beforehand we need a phase of public consultation.
That is why we are calling for an assembly, similar to a convention, to be set up which will organise a public dialogue in Europe before decisions are made in the Council.
To achieve this we need, above all, your support.
Mr President-in-Office, it would be a first and very specific step forward - and would also send out a signal to the Irish - if the intergovernmental conference were to be opened up and made more transparent.
In taking a step of this kind, we would also be justified in going before the Irish for a second time and tabling the treaty for a vote.
This is what you will be judged on, and we wish you every success for your work in the interests of Europe.
Mr President, first and foremost I should like to thank the various speakers and especially the group chairmen.
I should also like to thank the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, for his words.
I should like to make a total of four marginal comments on the various declarations.
First and foremost, I should like to comment on the outcome of the Irish referendum and on the suggestions that the Irish referendum be seized upon to argue that, in fact, we need less of a European input.
That should, apparently, be the result of this Irish referendum, at least if we were to take it into account.
Well, I find that a reductionist view.
There is certainly a democratic deficit in Europe, but you do not solve that deficit by having less of a European input, but by creating more democracy in Europe.
I believe that such an attitude is certainly not an arrogant one.
I have always, including at the meeting of the Council in Gothenburg, argued that we must not adopt an arrogant attitude to Irish voters by saying 'there is no problem, we shall not bother about the referendum and will simply continue as if there is nothing wrong' .
No, we must take that 'no' vote seriously and take it on board in our reflections. The problem must be tackled.
However, it is an unacceptable solution to draw the conclusion from the Irish 'no' vote that we must simply again take the European Union into reverse.
My second marginal comment concerns the convention.
I agree with the various speakers that the governments must also be represented there at a high level, because it would be a mistake to exclude the governments and only to have them represented at a low level, resulting in a possible incompatibility between the outcome of the convention and that of the intergovernmental conference which, in the normal course of things, will be organised in 2004.
In addition, I believe that we must ensure that the constitutional regions are involved in the whole process.
(FR) The third comment that I would like to make, Mr President, concerns the European constitution.
I believe that we should also emphasise the positive aspects during this debate.
Some years ago, when we were discussing a European constitution, this was an idea that seemed impossible to achieve.
Today, I notice that, in speeches that have been made in the last two years, every European policy leader has taken up a position in favour of a European constitution.
I believe therefore that, as expressed in the Laeken Declaration, this is an idea that is possible to achieve.
(NL) Fourthly, I should like to make a comment on the Treaty of Nice.
Like the President of the Commission, I feel that it is absolutely vital that this Treaty is ratified.
No one need explain the weak points of the Treaty of Nice to me.
For four days we discussed and debated them constantly until four in the morning.
However, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
The advantage is that enlargement of the Union can finally take place, an enlargement that is more than just an enlargement.
It is a change that will finally bring about European unity.
It is therefore vital to ratify this Treaty quickly.
Finally, not one but several speakers wondered if all this were not too ambitious, warning that it is mainly deeds that matter.
Let me make it clear at the outset that I have no intention of playing Icarus, since that is one of the allusions that have just been made.
I believe that it is time that significant plans for reform were put on the table.
Anyone predicting ten years ago that we would have a single European currency, was in fact called an idealist.
The same applied to the introduction of the internal market, when the idea was floated twenty years ago.
I have no desire to play Icarus, but my motto is that of the first President of the European Commission, Mr Hallstein, who said, "Anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist" .
That strikes me as better advice.
(Applause)
Thank you very much, Mr Verhofstadt.
I wish the presidency and Belgium every success.
The debate is closed.
Situation in FYROM
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since its inception, the European Union has followed developments in the crisis in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with a great deal of attention and concern.
The EU has also played a very active role in finding a peaceful solution to this conflict.
Since April, Javier Solana, the High Representative for the CFSP, has visited Macedonia on several occasions and has met the political authorities and representatives of the country' s main ethnic groups in Skopje and other areas, in order to gain some understanding of the situation and to encourage a peaceful solution to the crisis.
In April, a European Union ministerial troika, made up of Mrs Lindh, Mr Patten and Mrs Neyts also visited Skopje and, on 10 April 2001, the European Union and FYROM signed a stabilisation and association agreement in Luxembourg, which is the first agreement of this kind between the European Union and one of the Balkan nations.
The conclusion of this agreement helps to give the Union a vital and indispensable role in seeking an outcome to the crisis.
Furthermore, it has also given us an instrument with which we can put pressure on the parties in FYROM.
Since the first outbreaks of violence, the European Union has strongly condemned the violent acts committed by ethnic-Albanian extremists and urged them to bring an immediate end to this action, to lay down their arms and to retreat.
On the other hand, the Union made a firm request to the authorities in Skopje to adopt a measured military response to the rebel provocation and highlighted the need to pursue interethnic dialogue with a view to achieving the reforms that are urgent and necessary to resolving this conflict, particularly reforms relating to the law and to the protection of minorities.
This should also help to isolate the extremist groups, by providing the people involved with a clear prospect for hope.
In this spirit, the European Union and Mr Solana, the High Representative, welcomed the agreement of 11 May to form a broad coalition government, which includes the democratically elected leaders of the major Slav and Albanian political parties.
The EU urged them to step up their efforts to swiftly bring about practical and substantial results on the main issues currently under discussion.
At the Gothenburg European Council, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union reasserted the need to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.
In terms, this involves launching a genuine political dialogue within the coalition of governments on all the questions under discussion, including constitutional reforms.
The European Council urged the local political forces to come up with results as quickly as possible.
Their deadline was the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 27 June 2001.
With regard to the security situation, the European Council has very strongly condemned the extremists and the use of violence.
The Council stressed the importance of establishing a lasting cease-fire agreed by the parties, which might require some direct or indirect contact between them.
The European Union and NATO may have a role to play in this as an intermediary or facilitator.
The disarmament plan proposed by President Trajkovski is the other pillar of the security situation.
The plan gives a central role in this process to NATO, since the parties consider that the presence on the ground of NATO and of European Union observers is essential to providing the necessary element of trust.
NATO has already adopted the necessary measures to enable it to act.
This intervention with a view to disarming the ethnic-Albanian rebels is, however, subject to specific security conditions which the parties concerned have not yet fulfilled.
The essential elements of this are concluding a lasting cease-fire on the basis of a political agreement which seeks to bring about a negotiated solution to the crisis.
We must point out that, since the beginning of the crisis, the European Union has closely coordinated its actions with NATO on this matter, by holding joint, regular and frequent meetings between the Atlantic Council and the Political and Security Committee, by regular liaison between various Secretariats, and by direct contact between Mr Solana and the NATO Secretary-General, Lord Robertson.
Both Mr Solana and Lord Robertson have also made joint visits to FYROM, during which a consistent and unequivocal message was conveyed to both parties on behalf of the international community.
In order to ensure that the European Union has permanent political representation in Skopje, the Gothenburg European Council agreed to appoint a special EU representative to work to FYROM, and, on 25 June, the General Affairs Council appointed FranÃ§ois LÃ©otard, the former French Minister for Defence, to this position.
Mr LÃ©otard has been in Skopje since Thursday 28 June. Mr LÃ©otard' s mandate is, first of all, to establish and maintain contacts with the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the parties involved in the political process.
His mandate also requires Mr LÃ©otard to offer advice and support from the European Union for the current dialogue, to closely liaise with the representative of the presidency and the Commission in Macedonia, with the heads of the Member States' missions and also with European observers.
Mr LÃ©otard must also establish and maintain contact with the other relevant international and regional players, including NATO, the OSCE and the United Nations, in order, of course, to ensure the necessary cooperation.
Lastly, Mr LÃ©otard must assist, if necessary, in implementing possible agreements and to closely monitor all developments and initiatives concerning the security situation, in conjunction with the appropriate bodies.
The path that the Belgian presidency should follow has, therefore, been clearly mapped out by the decisions and the approach taken by the European Union over recent months, by the use of the instruments I have mentioned, by Mr Solana' s considerable commitment, and by Mr LÃ©otard' s work on the ground.
The European Union is demonstrating its active commitment to resolving this crisis.
We are also working together with other actors, particularly the US envoy, Mr Pardew, and with the international organisations in Macedonia, in order to help to make rapid and tangible progress.
At this stage, the new presidency has to be consistent and be determined in pursuing and encouraging political dialogue in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
We must welcome the agreement that was reached last night, under the auspices of President Trajkovski, to resume political dialogue between the political parties of FYROM.
As a result of this agreement, intensive meetings will be held over the coming days.
Particular emphasis will be placed on constitutional matters, as a follow-up to Mr Badinter' s recent visit to Macedonia.
At the same time, and in close cooperation with NATO, the dialogue on the security situation will be pursued with equal determination, since these two aspects of the crisis are intrinsically linked and progress on both points should be made in parallel.
Mr President, the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia remains, as the minister has just said, a matter of intense concern to all of us.
In the three months since I last discussed this matter with honourable Members, there has been a steady deterioration in the security situation, a growing polarisation of political opinion and an exponential rise in the number of refugees and internally displaced persons.
The violence in front of the Parliament in Skopje just over a week ago, without exaggeration, brought matters to the very brink of the abyss.
It is welcome that in the last week there has not been a further serious deterioration in the security situation, and it is welcome, as Minister Michel has just said, that the political dialogue pioneered by President Trajkovski has been resumed.
I want to pay tribute to the President' s efforts, I want to pay tribute to the President' s calm decency in the face of this crisis.
As honourable Members will know, the European Union has been intensively involved, from the outset, in efforts to contain and extinguish this conflict.
All of us who have some responsibility for this region are acutely conscious of the danger that a descent into civil war in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would pose, not just for the community there, that would be bad enough, but for the region as a whole.
Working with NATO, working with the OSCE, working with the United States, we will leave no stone unturned in the search for an end to this conflict and an agreed way forward based on dialogue and political settlement.
One feature of this crisis, has been the very close cooperation between the relevant international organisations and bodies involved, not drawn from any manual or textbook, but because we know how vital it is that we tackle this problem in a united and coherent fashion.
We have not yet succeeded in bringing the conflict to an end, but we are absolutely clear that it is only by working together and working with the democratically elected government in Skopje that we will succeed in doing so.
The leading role on behalf of the European has, of course, rightly been taken by my friend and colleague, High Representative Javier Solana.
He has been to Skopje on countless occasions and I have accompanied him on a number of those visits as well as making visits on my own.
He has worked, and is working, tirelessly for a peaceful solution, ably supported on the ground in Skopje by the outgoing presidency ambassador, Mark Dickinson, and by the head of the commission delegation, JosÃ© Pinto Texeira.
I want to pay a particularly warm tribute to him for his courage and steadfastness and wise advice.
A week ago, as the minister has said, the General Affairs Council appointed Mr LÃ©otard as the European Union' s resident envoy, in Skopje, under the authority of Mr Solana.
I met Mr LÃ©otard last week and promised him the full support of the European Commission in his work.
We stand ready to do all we can, anywhere and at any time.
Mr LÃ©otard is initially locating himself in the Commission' s delegation office in Skopje.
As honourable Members know, in April the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia signed a stabilisation and association agreement with the European Union.
That agreement includes important commitments by the government in Skopje about respect for human rights, including the rights of minorities.
It is essential that those commitments should be honoured, and we all want to see early results in the inter-ethnic dialogue.
That is the only route to a lasting political solution.
The European Commission is providing very substantial support, EUR 42 million under CARDS in 2001.
Much of it will specifically help with the implementation of projects which will assist the Albanian as well as the Macedonian Slav community.
For example, the EUR 5 million we have delivered for the South-East Europe Albanian language university at Tetovo, funds for the census and funds for local government reform and the implementation of small-scale local infrastructure projects, which make a visible difference to people' s lives and communities.
We have made it very clear, and I want to repeat this point today, that we will be ready to come forward with substantial assistance for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as soon as a political agreement is reached between the parties.
I hope that all involved will regard that as a serious incentive to work intensively and constructively with Mr LÃ©otard and Mr Pardew, the United States representative, in the coming days.
Let it also be an incentive to extend the cease-fire and to halt the military activities on both sides which are costing so much politically, financially and in human lives.
I just want to underline this point.
This Parliament would not take kindly to proposals from the Commission, or from anyone, to spend more money supporting reconstruction and development, supporting the budget in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, if at the same time money was being spent, which frankly no one really has, on more bombs and more rockets, and if there was not a clear prospect of a political settlement and continuing cease-fire.
When the foreign minister of FYROM reports to the Political and Security Committee of the Council in Brussels on Friday, she will be in a position to speak about substantial progress, because the alternative is frankly too awful to contemplate.
It is not too late to avoid catastrophe, but it requires the courage of every citizen of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to pull back from the brink.
It requires those with influence in Kosovo over the rebels to pull them back from the brink and it requires the continued stand for moderation exemplified by the government in Tirana to whom I pay unreserved tribute for their contribution.
There cannot be a solely military solution.
There has to be a political settlement and it cannot come soon enough.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, we welcome Mr LÃ©otard' s appointment and also Mr Badinter' s intervention in the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
I believe that, in them, we have two representatives of the European Community who are in a position to do good there.
Like Commissioner Patten, however, I should not like it to be forgotten that the EU Delegation on the spot has already been doing beneficial work for years and has constantly intervened.
We need a permanent presence on the ground, not because we want a protectorate of some kind but because we want to demonstrate our interest in preserving the state of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
They need a mediator and I think that we have now identified him.
However, I do not believe that we can disregard the fact that it might also be good for NATO to be seen to have a presence in Macedonia as a preventive measure.
Neither does the fact that we now make our financial assistance conditional on there being a clear desire for peace on the ground mean that we are interfering in domestic matters, as this is described in the region.
After all, we cannot indefinitely spend our taxpayers' money in a country in which the desire for peace is not underpinned by joint initiatives to create that peace.
We cannot, for example, build roads and infrastructure while government troops and rebels are buying weapons.
I underline the fact that it was the KLA that brought conflict into the country; there is no doubt about that.
Nevertheless, the government must not now give in to the KLA' s demands so as to avoid civil war; instead it must take account of the long-standing demands of the elected Albanians in Macedonia and seek solutions with them.
In my opinion, however, the solution cannot be to divide the country along ethnic lines.
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia belongs to all of its citizens and this must also be enshrined in the constitution.
A right of veto, however well-meant, cannot be awarded to any section of the population; this causes division.
The president of the country is the president of all the people of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and an Albanian vice-president with a right of veto would therefore be an unreasonable demand from the Albanian side.
It must be possible for all citizens to use their mother tongue.
The long-standing plan to decentralise power and strengthen the cities and local authorities must finally be executed.
But decentralisation of the army and the police, which the Albanians are now calling for, cannot reinforce the country' s cohesion, quite the opposite.
The desire for peace must be underpinned by moderate and justified demands.
The European Union must foster reform and reconciliation in its vicinity, which means that we cannot stand idly by and watch while a civil war looms in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The KLA rebels were taken from Skopje to northern Macedonia with their weapons on air-conditioned buses.
Can you imagine what kind of an image this gave of our involvement in the country?
It did us serious damage and it falsely portrayed us as supporters of the Albanians.
Macedonia makes it all too obvious to us that we finally need to force ourselves to develop an overall policy for the Balkans, because it is only as part of a joint strategy with Kosovo that it will be possible to resolve this problem.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, our Group abides by its clear position.
The constitution and also the reality of societal relations in Macedonia or FYROM must be brought into line with the needs of a modern multi-ethnic society.
In this process, citizens' individual rights should be to the fore and collective, ethnic rights should only be enshrined to the extent that it is absolutely necessary; this is also why there should be no right of veto for an Albanian vice-president, for example.
Above all, these matters must be addressed in a democratic context and by democratic means.
In the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a democratic state, violence is not necessary; it is unjustifiable, even damaging, above all to the reputation of the Albanian people themselves whose rights we represent with great conviction.
If this is clear and obvious to the Council and the Commission, then admittedly this raises a number of questions.
Mr President-in-Office, this Parliament has a right to be given answers to several questions.
Firstly, how was it possible for a representative of the EU, FranÃ§ois LÃ©otard, to be appointed, who, in his very first statements, has already contradicted these principles and has put the terrorists on the same footing as the government?
Was Mr LÃ©otard not informed of the Council' s agreed position?
Secondly, the KLA was allegedly disarmed in Kosovo.
Where are the weapons coming from now then?
After all, we are not just talking about a few Kalashnikovs which can be bought on the market anywhere.
Does America or do certain groups of Americans have an interest in supplying arms?
Thirdly, the terrorists were able to withdraw from Macedonia with their weapons.
Should someone not have noticed where these weapons came from?
Fourthly, how is the proposed disarmament process supposed to work if the weapons have already been taken out of Macedonia?
Is it intended that it should be just as successful as it was in Kosovo?
These are a few questions, and I have to make the critical comment that the reality of the situation is being addressed here, whether consciously or not, with some naivety; I am talking about the reality of a small extremist group, which to all appearances is being financed by the Albanian diaspora, which was not prepared to fund the university in Tetovo but which has paid for arms in association with other organisations, some of which are criminal.
The Albanian population and their representatives must have the greatest interest in these small extremist groups no longer being able to go about their business.
The Council and the Commission must do their bit to achieve this.
Making changes within the states by force and changing the borders by force is something which we reject out of hand.
It is the elected representatives of the governments and, in the parliament, the representatives of the Albanian and Slav-Macedonian sides which need our support, our advice and our ideas.
We must make it absolutely clear to the violent groups that we reject them.
If the Commissioner thought that we did not want to spend any money on arms, then he was right.
But we certainly do not want to spend money on weapons which extremist groups use to plunge democracies into a state of unrest.
Mr President, we in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are clearly working on a joint position which we will vote on at noon, in order to condemn violence and support dialogue, but also so that the short-term efforts, such as the appointment of a mediator and the support for the Traikovski plan, should be immediate measures.
It is also important that the medium-term efforts and the Union' s responsibility in this area - the association agreement is clearly an important factor - make positive progress.
I would like to devote my speech to two additional aspects of what is happening in the FYROM and which clearly affect the European Union.
The first is that there have rarely been such difficult tests of the European Union' s external image as the successive crises in the Balkans, and that is still the case.
Although there has been a substantial improvement since the appointment of the High Representative, Mr Solana, due to his management and his cooperation with Commissioner Patten and the Council, it is clear that all our will and our effort must be aimed at making our action more effective and saving our political prestige, since, for the image of the Union - and this has been made clear today by President Verhofstadt and Mr Patten and Mr Michel - a lot is at stake.
Another important effect for the European Union - which has not been mentioned and is indirect, but very important - is its repercussions for the enlargement process.
Although by chance, it happens that the countries directly neighbouring the FYROM - Bulgaria and Rumania - are the countries which have the greatest difficulty in achieving the sufficient economic development with a view to enlargement and the negotiation.
I believe that this proximity has a negative effect on the conflict in many respects - not only economic - and a very direct effect on the process of direct investment in these countries.
I believe that our intervention, or that of our countries, should take good account of this, because countries such as Bulgaria, for example, have made a very positive contribution to stability in the area.
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me begin by praising the efforts of the European Union, the Council and the Commission up to now.
We have spoken with one voice, unlike on other occasions when we debated the Balkans, and a powerful moderating influence was quite rightly exercised upon the use of violence, with the emphasis placed on finding a political solution.
Nevertheless, I have two concerns.
One of them relates to the link between EU aid and the parties' playing a constructive role.
This is a very tricky business.
Of course, aid is not automatic.
But - and this is a question to the Commission - do we withdraw our aid to the Albanian Language University in Tetovo if we do not like the attitude of the Albanian parties in the government, or do we halt the construction of small-scale infrastructure if we do not like the compromises of the Macedonian parties?
I would be very careful about this.
I am in favour of exercising pressure, I am in favour of the involvement of the EU, but I am against vague threats.
My concrete question to the Commission is therefore about whether that link applies to the new aid, as seems to be implied in the words of the Commissioner, or whether it also applies to existing aid.
In other words, will there be a moment at which the European Commission says to the parties, 'we do not like your attitude, and so we are discontinuing all aid or part of the aid' ?
My second concern relates to the reaching of an agreement.
It has been said that military involvement will only come when there is an agreement within the government and an agreement with the rebels, and it is with this last point that, in my view, the problem lies.
That is because the special representative, Mr LÃ©otard, whom Mr Swoboda has already said, even before he was on the scene, that it would be necessary to negotiate with the rebels.
The world was too small. Mr LÃ©otard was almost not allowed into Macedonia.
But if the government refuses to negotiate with the rebels, who will negotiate with them?
Is the Commission involved behind the scenes, or has it been party to negotiations?
Is the Council involved?
Someone will have to make the link between the governmental agreement and the rebels.
I have no sympathy at all for the rebels and believe they should put an end to their violence but, whether we like it or not, an agreement which does not include an agreement with the rebels is not worthy of the name.
The governmental agreement therefore needs to be linked to an agreement with the rebels.
My question to the Council and the Commission is: who is prepared to make that link?
Mr President, I should like to assure you that our group is overwhelmingly in favour of the unity and democratisation of the FYROM and, more importantly, in favour of safeguarding rights for everyone living there, for all its citizens.
We have said as much on previous occasions, but they appear not to trust us.
And I wonder why the people living in this area do not trust the European Union.
My fellow members have cited several examples: KLA weapons, extremists being transported by air-conditioned bus under NATO escort so that they can continue to wage war in other areas, the declaration made by Mr Leotard - was that a faux pas or a calculated declaration?
And now we hear you, Mr President-in-Office, calling for a minimum of contact - that is what I heard - with the extremists so as to find a political solution.
Are these not the people whom Mr Robertson was calling criminals just a few days ago?
How come we have lost Mr Robertson?
We have heard you quoting Mr Badinter.
What are Mr Badinter' s views?
If I remember correctly from what I have read in the papers, Mr Badinter said no to a state of two separate ethnic groups.
Do you support that?
We have heard Mr Patten say no to more money unless there is a political settlement.
In other words, we are depending on the political will of the extremists.
There is no symmetry between the two sides.
More is the pity.
For reasons which they know best, they do not want the European Union or NATO to get involved in supporting the legitimate government and they are telling them: "sort it out amongst yourselves".
There is no symmetry.
I was in Skopje and I had discussions not with the extremists but with the official Albanian parties there and they told me they do not want majority voting on major issues.
Whether or not this veto will be exercised by a vice-president or whether the constitution will make provision for some other procedure for this is irrelevant.
If we move in this direction, we are moving towards the dissolution of the state.
We therefore need more stable, more serious, more reliable support from the European Union for the unity and democratisation - and they go hand in hand - of this country.
Otherwise we shall fail yet again in our policy in the Balkans.
It will not be the first time!
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, I should firstly like to express my satisfaction and also congratulate the High Representative of the CFSP and Commissioner Patten, because I think that in our attempts to resolve this conflict we are actually revealing the form which our CFSP will take.
Commissioner Patten spoke of the responsibility which we have in the region.
Commissioner, I should like to go a step further and say what mistakes have been made.
In this specific case there are two things which, in my view, have not happened and which are nevertheless contained in Resolution 1244: firstly to disarm the KLA in Kosovo and secondly to disband the KLA in Kosovo.
Neither have been done.
Quite the opposite!
The KLA has been given organisational structures which it did not have before.
The sin also bears a name, because it was the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General - Bernard Kouchner is his name - who failed to do this.
We need to state this openly here.
That is why it is not enough to offer our good services for conflict resolution; we also have a duty to put right the mistakes which we have made.
I welcome the fact that NATO is on standby.
The disarmament of the KLA terrorists allows me to recognise them for what they are: terrorists and criminals and not rebels!
These KLA terrorists must be disarmed and NATO is offering to do this.
I wonder why we should now send an additional 3 000 soldiers there, under the conditions with which we are all familiar, when we could have disarmed these criminals and disbanded their organisations back in Kosovo.
Under no circumstances - and here I fully agree with Mrs Pack and the other speakers - must a long-term NATO presence engender the division of the country along ethnic lines and under no circumstances must NATO entrench that split by its presence and its willingness to help.
NATO must be deployed in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with a very specific mission, namely disarmament.
Mr President, I think we should remember how the multiethnic Macedonian population coped with the conflict in Kosovo.
They received around a quarter of a million refugees, which is a very large number, considering how small a population we are talking about.
That is something we must not forget now that things are going so badly in Macedonia.
I also think that we must take note of the fact that the Albanian population in Albania is not participating in this conflict, presumably because they see a possibility that peace may give them a future.
They can see economic and democratic development.
There is a need for that development throughout this area.
I cannot refrain from reminding you how easy it was for the NATO countries and many EU Member States to find money at the time when the former Yugoslavia was to be bombed.
Where is the same will to find money now that there is a need for reconstruction and for economic and social development in the area?
This is the core of the whole peace process.
It is about finding the means, for that is how the way is also found.
Mr President, it is particularly worrying to see armed conflict persisting in a country which borders my own country at a time when intensive negotiations are under way for the sole purpose of settling once and for all the differences which gave rise to the conflict in the first place.
Ethnic segregation, penning nations in after a war or uprising behind fortified borders which no-one considers definitive and which in turn become a new source of conflict is, unfortunately, the pattern which has been repeated throughout the history of this region in the Balkans.
And for centuries, ethnic cleansing has been the method used to impose these solutions.
What we see in our neighbouring country is a repetition of the time-honoured pattern. This time the main perpetrators are organised armed Albanian extremists taking advantage of what is often justified ethnic discontent on the part of their many, unarmed, fellow countrymen, as is always the case, in order to incite them to wage war on other ethnic groups.
The European Union was, historically speaking, the last factor to appear in the area, advocating certain principles which, if they really could have been imposed, would have released the area from the nightmare of its history.
But if modern European solutions are to apply, nations with different ethnic groups need to be persuaded to abandon segregation behind closed borders and agree to cohabit under one state roof.
This enlightened solution is currently being tested in two countries in the wider area: the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Cyprus.
The benefits to the people of a European type solution would be incalculable, but they presuppose abandoning armed violence as a method of forcing historical development and, on this point, the European Union has not excelled either in the case of Cyprus or in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
It has not acted forcefully towards those engaged in violence or it has only done so unilaterally.
Violence will not be abandoned as the result of conferences, talks and visits, especially when international obligations are breached in the process, nor will it be abandoned by giving into the temptation of the old colonising forces and granting armed forces from any one ethnic group favoured status.
One gets the impression that ÃÃÃÃ is reacting as if the armed Albanians were going to turn into the region' s Ghurkhas.
It was the responsibility of the forces which intervened in Kosovo to disarm the KLA. They failed to do so.
It was their responsibility to impose a security zone around Kosovo. They failed to do so or they did so unilaterally, against the Serbs, while allowing the KLA to come and go as it pleased.
It is a well-known fact that the KLA is backed by drug dealing and by contributions which originate in our countries.
According to one newspaper article, the US administration has frozen Albanian accounts which were funding the KLA.
Europe has done no such thing.
How can we expect armed violence to end, to lose its reputation in people' s eyes, if we grant favoured status to armed forces such as those in Yugoslavia or 30-year occupying armies as in Cyprus?
As long as we fail to act decisively where decisive action is required, it is hypocritical to say to nations clashing on the ground that they are responsible for the tragedies which befall them.
They are responsible, but we too are jointly responsible, Commissioner, for the recurring nightmare which is the history of the Balkans.
I understand that because of time, the President-in-Office is not answering.
For many groups there was serious concern about armaments in the Balkans and the non-disarmament there.
I hope that, even if the President-in-Office of the Council cannot answer now, he will take the concerns of all the groups very seriously and bring them before the Council of Ministers.
This is a permanent and not just a local problem.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall very quickly answer all the questions that have been raised.
First of all, the presidency will try to ensure that the European Union steps up its presence in the area.
In this respect, the Federal Republic of Macedonia gives us the chance to apply our overall objective to make the European Union' s external action more visible and more effective.
Like you, we deplore the ethnic tension, which is affecting everyone including the government.
As for disarmament, this is currently taking place on a voluntary basis under NATO supervision.
However, as Mr Patten mentioned, priority should be given to trying to resume the political dialogue.
With regard to the effects of the crisis on enlargement, I would like to remind you of the process that has been launched in Zagreb to bring the Balkans round to the European way of thinking, in order to arrive at a negotiated agreement.
Mrs Lagendijk asked me the question to find out if contacts had been established and how they have been arranged.
I would say just this - in order to arrive at a negotiated agreement, all sorts of contacts are needed, as well as opportunities to establish contacts with rebel forces, and, Mrs Lagendijk, they are a matter for the judgment of those who are at the head of the negotiations.
Thank you for the answers you have given, Mr Michel.
The debate is closed.
We shall now proceed to the votes.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a suitable occasion to raise a topical point: we all have groups of visitors and we are glad to see large numbers of the general public in the EU coming to see us and, as is the case here, attending part-sessions.
We also know, however, that it is difficult to find a hotel for fifty visitors.
That is why the visitors have to make do with hotels which are not in Strasbourg but in the surrounding area.
Obviously we want to bring Europe closer to the people and foster personal discussions between the people in the Union and Members of Parliament.
This is achieved on the one hand through their visit to the European Parliament and, on the other hand, by the Member going to see the visitors in their hotel and talking to them there.
As Members we travel to Chile, to South Africa...
(The President cut the speaker off)
I would like to consider this as a point of order, but, at this stage in the agenda, you only have one minute of speaking time.
VOTE
Before we vote on this, I should like to announce, Madam President, that to help things run smoothly I am prepared to withdraw my amendments relating to landmines and particularly call attention to low-threshold biological anti-mine work.
I should like to negotiate further with the Commission on this, but I will not force the issue now provided that we can continue talking.

Before the vote
Madam President, in these circumstances, I must put to you a personal question.
But if you voted on this then I will not put the question.
Did you vote on this matter?
No, Mr McMillan-Scott, I did not vote.
My actions were however in line with those of all the presidents before me, who always used the sensible rule of only voting in extremely exceptional circumstances, and not on problems that have divided Parliament to this extent.
Madam President, the Conciliation Committee is of the view that the President of Parliament should vote on that matter ...
(Mixed reactions)
... and had she done so the conciliation procedure would have been sustained.
I believe that is the point.
(Mixed reactions)
Mr McMillan-Scott, you may well believe that I have not acted in the proper manner.
I gave this matter a great deal of thought beforehand.
I did not rule out the possibility that I would be in this situation.
I acted as my conscience dictated.
I may well have done the wrong thing, but that is how things are.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all presidents are at liberty to vote or not.
It is their decision.
This result is absolutely clear.
There is no majority in favour of the report and we should not call this result into question.
To do so would be to challenge the effectiveness of decision-making in this Parliament.
I would, however, point out to Mr McMillan-Scott that he is pre-empting the way I would have voted.
Madam President, I apologise to you and to colleagues if by rising I test their patience, but since you have indulged some others, I should like to express a very brief view.
I fully respect your personal choice.
On the matter of the vote, you have given the correct interpretation.
I entirely regret this result, but one must live as a democrat with due process.
On behalf of the Liberal Democrat Group, I would like to the European Commission.
It is clear that, in the form presented, the mergers and acquisitions (takeovers) directive, has now fallen.
It is such a fundamental and important issue that I hope we do not abandon the attempt because of this difficulty.
We must learn from the difficulty and I invite the Commission at the earliest date to redouble its efforts to submit a new proposal, so that we can drive the Lisbon reform forward.
We cannot give a signal from this house that we are not concerned with fundamental economic dynamics in the European Union.
The Council and the Commission can help us in that regard.
The Commission has listened to you very carefully, Mr Cox.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0227/2001), by Mrs Rothe, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market [5583/1/2001 - C5-0133/2001 - 2000/0116(COD)]
Before the vote
Madam President, I asked for the floor before other Members and I wanted firstly to say that, with regard to your statement, it is not your personal position, as other Presidents have taken the same approach on previous occasions, both Mr HÃ€nsch and I. It seems to me absolutely disgraceful that there should be a sort of police vigilance of how Members vote.
That is an individual and personal right.
With regard to this directive, I would like to address not only the Commission, but also the Council.
It is a technically complex directive; Parliament cannot be called irresponsible for exercising its rights.
We have worked on it - you yourself as rapporteur, in the past - and the lesson which the Commission and the Council must learn today is that if there is a double parliamentary reading and a conciliation, then notice must also be taken of Parliament on issues on which, although we have offered many opportunities for transaction, we have come up against a brick wall from the Council and the Commission.
I shall now give the floor to Mrs Rothe, who wishes to make a short statement on a point of order.
Madam President, thank you very much for giving me the floor briefly.
To avoid there being any confusion, I should like to clarify just very briefly that - with the exception of Amendments Nos 2 and 4 - Amendments Nos 1 to 11 already represent compromises which were struck with the Council even before the second reading, within a kind of informal conciliation procedure.
I should really like to urge you to vote in favour of these amendments because I believe that we have succeeded in improving the common position considerably.
Thank you, Mrs Rothe.
Regarding Amendment No 11
Madam President, I should briefly like to call your attention to a necessary language correction.
In the final clause of Amendment 11, the Dutch translation should be amended.
At present it reads: "if the hierarchy were undermined by this" .
A correct translation of the English should read: "if this hierarchy were to be undermined" .
Madam President, I have a similar problem.
I would like it to be recorded in the minutes that there is an error in the Finnish translation of the common position regarding Mrs Rothe' s report.
Article 2(b) regarding definitions should read as follows: " 'Biomass' shall mean the biodegradable fraction of products, waste and residues from agriculture (including vegetal and animal substances), forestry and related industries, as well as the biodegradable fraction of industrial and municipal waste."
The word 'products' has been left out of the Finnish version.
I have not noticed any such omission in the other language versions.
Very well.
Thank you very much for pointing this out to us.
(The President declared the common position approved as amended)
Report (A5-0220/2001) by Mr Karas, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the activities of institutions for occupational retirement provision [COM(2000) 507 - C5-0596/2000 - 2000/0260(COD)]
Before the vote on Amendment No 118
Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor.
Firstly, I should like to say that Amendment No 118 does not replace Amendment No 46; in fact both need to be put to the vote.
Secondly, with your permission, I have an oral amendment to propose to Amendment No 118.
If the change were to be adopted I would be able to vote in favour of Amendment No 118.
The change is as follows: instead of the word 'exemption' the words 'this restriction' should be added, and after 'after legal personality' we add, 'only apply to the institutions responsible for the administration and management of such IORPs, if this restriction cannot be enforced under relevant national law against IORPs without legal personality.'
If this oral amendment is accepted - and I have agreed it with the Member who tabled the amendment - then I would be able to support a vote in favour.

EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE
Lehne report (A5-0237/2001)
Madam President, this is the first time I have delivered an explanation of vote and it concerns the decision of the Conciliation Committee to adopt the directive on takeover bids, which had been rejected by a tied vote by Parliament.
In one respect, I am sorry because I would have preferred the directive to have been adopted.
However, my prevailing sentiment is one of deep satisfaction, and that is because, with our votes and the votes of the other members of the Conciliation Committee delegation - 8 to 6 - we made it possible for the decision to be taken by this House.
We knew that there was disagreement between and within the 15 governments, that the trade unions and economic organisations were divided and that practically all the Parliamentary groups were divided in their opinions.
Therefore, why should the decision be 7 to 7 at 2 in the morning in Luxembourg?
It was the right decision and I believe that even our friends who would have preferred to conclude the matter in Luxembourg should be grateful to us.
It was a remarkable day, an emotional vote, one of those days which make you even more enthusiastic about that amazing victory of human history which is democracy.
Madam President, the EPLP delegation voted in favour of the mergers and takeover conciliation text.
While we realise that the prime objective of this directive was to protect minority shareholders' and investors' interests against unscrupulous directors and inefficient company boards in a takeover or merger, in conciliation we achieved the incorporation of amendments tabled by the Socialist Group, which meant that this directive would have recognised the legitimate interests of employees in a takeover bid.
Some believe that this directive did not go far enough in this direction and that there is no real genuine consultation of the workforce.
Let us be clear: this was a choice between no information and providing information to the workforce in the process of a takeover or merger.
As a senior British trade union general secretary said, it is a significant step forward and offers a chance to build a substantial foundation.
It would be wrong to oppose the directive because it does not give sufficient rights of information and consultation.
This directive would have had no effect on the acquis communautaire of employment rights in the EU, or in the national Member States.
It was a minimum requirement.
I think you agree, Madam President, that Parliament has not covered itself in glory with its tied result today.
We will have no directive on mergers and takeovers and we will have no information and consultation with rights for workers, even though mergers and takeovers will continue to happen across the European Union.
Madam President, I welcome Mr Imbeni' s entry into the ranks of expounders of explanations of vote.
I have to say that this is not my first!
Madam President, I was very uncertain as to which way to vote - for or against the motion - not least because this is a financial, economic issue of which I do not have much experience. Therefore, I was happy to follow the recommendations made by Mrs Kauppi - in her speech, not in my dreams, I am afraid, Madam President.
Mrs Kauppi is sitting here behind me. It is true that she is young, but she cares about the interests of all pensioners, including Italian pensioners, to whom she has spoken on a number of occasions.
She said that if this directive had been adopted in conciliation it would have benefited pensioners.
I believe her and so I voted for the motion.
Madam President, I think it is highly regrettable that the compromise achieved in the conciliation procedure is being rejected today by the smallest possible margin.
This takeovers directive was and is an important part of the final implementation of the European single market.
Preparations for this had been going on for a very long time - twelve years - and I hope that the work will not have all been in vain in the wake of this very close vote.
In other words, I hope that the work to formulate harmonised rules on company takeovers in the European Community will carry on, and perhaps one day we will find a compromise in this matter that would achieve majority support in this House.
I would just like to raise the question of how this will affect flows of capital in Europe.
In my opinion, it is very worrying that at Lisbon last year we made some ambitious plans, which now seem to have turned out to be mere empty words.
The rejection of this directive shows that we lack the political will to take the decisions of Lisbon forward.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today' s decision against the joint text for an EU directive on company law concerning takeover bids is regrettable.
As a result of this House' s decision to reject the directive, the European capital markets will continue to be fragmented in a key area, namely the trading of companies.
Future-oriented opportunities to increase prosperity can only be achieved through open markets and free trade.
Sadly, Parliament has deviated from this position.
It would have been infinitely preferable, in my view, if we had called for management boards to be required to remain neutral, as the interests of owners do not always coincide with those of senior executives.
The implication that Germany, for example, requires greater protection from hostile takeovers because golden shares and majority voting shares exist in other countries reflects protectionist attitudes.
One cannot pursue a protectionist course simply because other countries are doing so.
In the wake of this vote, the European national states will now protect their slices of industry and financial trade; in sum, this is a bad day for the internal market, and a bad day for Europe as a location for industry.
- (FR) The rejection of the proposed directive on takeover bids will spell the end of any serious attempts to harmonise financial services in the European Union for a long time to come.
Parliament' s decision reflects a number of profoundly different expectations.
For example, it reflects the legitimate frustration of the supporters of genuine legislative harmonisation, who felt less and less at home with a text that became more and more minimalist, technically unsound and politically imbalanced, and who wanted to punish arrogant governments for refusing to make any concessions towards Parliament.
The rejection inflicted on the EP delegation in the conciliation committee can be explained, however, by the growing strength of a quite different sense of nervousness that led to a retreat into protectionism, which shattered the fragile agreement that had been reached in conciliation.
The German MEPs found that many Netherlands, Spanish and Italian colleagues gradually came to support their strategy of rejection.
As for France, its Socialist government taught rather paradoxical lessons in liberalism, while at the same time allowing a hyper-protected national company to launch a spectacular, all-out takeover bid and rouse the demons of protectionism from their hopelessly light sleep in many parts of Europe.
Many people still regarded the directive as too much of a threat even when it had been watered down and emasculated and even though it did not have to be implemented for another five years.
No-one will mourn the final shipwreck of a text that went from concession to surrender, ending up as little more than the shadow of a common policy.
At the same time, no-one can be unaware that this bad text was largely rejected for the wrong reasons.
After the Irish referendum, the rejection of a directive concerning a vital economic issue is yet another sign that Europe is going through a very serious political and moral crisis today.
. (NL) It is a good thing that the European Parliament has just consigned the result of the mediation on the thirteenth directive (hostile takeovers) to the wastepaper basket.
It means that this rickety proposal for a directive is now no longer on the table and the European Commission can quickly get down to work and work out new proposals.
If the Commission takes account of the feelings of the great majority in Parliament a new proposed directive can be tabled very quickly.
Conditions for rapid adoption by Parliament will be that the decision on a hostile bid should rest not with the shareholders but with the Board of Management, that the Board of Management should decide in the light of all interests, i.e. also those of the employees, that the new proposal creates a true "level playing field" in Europe, which means, for example, that government intervention, in the form of "golden shares" or anything else, to combat takeovers, should be banned, and that companies in the EU are allowed to maintain at any rate the same protection constructions as in the US.
Only in this way can a balanced proposal for legislation be tabled that accords with the socio-economic tradition in most European countries and puts a decisive stop to the market fundamentalism that underlies the proposal just rejected.
. (SV) The issue is about the institutional regulations of European big business regarding the acquisition and takeover of major companies.
On the one hand, there is the Anglo-Saxon tradition, characterised by laissez-faire and open market principles. On the other hand, there is a corporate and protectionist continental tradition.
It is no coincidence that one proposal was put forward by a German fellow member and that the counter-proposal in yesterday' s debate was advocated mostly by British fellow members.
Although Mr Lehne' s report contains certain corporate-patriarchal consideration for the staff of major companies, we do not believe that any of the alternatives serve the interests of employees.
We reject them both and instead require the Commission to return with a proposal on this issue which deals with ways of protecting the interests and needs of employees and consumers in conjunction with the acquisition and takeover of major companies.
. (PT) The controversy surrounding the conciliation process for this proposal for a directive, clearly visible in the outcome of Parliament' s vote - it was rejected, since the vote was tied - demonstrated that two ideas with various practical differences were involved in the process of harmonising legislation on takeover bids.
Although some slight progress was made during the conciliation process on protecting shareholders who do not have control of the company and on adopting some regulations on making the information of workers mandatory, the situation still fails to safeguard all aspects of workers' and minority shareholders' ability to take action.
Lastly, although the position arising from conciliation might be of benefit to Portugal, given that Portuguese companies are a potential target and an easy one for cross-border takeovers, there are other, more appropriate ways of protecting national interests.
Hence our abstention from voting.
. It was with some regret that I voted against this outcome of a conciliation procedure.
I am aware that great efforts were made to give the workforce greater access to information and to protect the rights of small shareholders.
However, I feel that Member States were not sufficiently committed to the extension of worker consultation and indeed, in some Member States, the results will be regressive.
I do not believe we should extend the rights of some workers at the expense of others, nor should we vote for fewer consultation rights than we wish to see in the forthcoming Directive.
Our approach must be coherent.
We now have to push our national governments to raise their standards to those of the best, and not hide behind an international compromise.
For small shareholders, it will take more than the proposals in this document to protect their rights against those of large shareholders whose legal position can require them to seek maximum return within a short-term perspective.
We should not be encouraging this approach.
- (NL) The amended version of the original text has incorporated Parliament' s position, and the delegation of the People' s Party for Freedom and Democracy can go along with this text.
There is a greater information duty for the benefit of workers, and openness must be offered with a view to future employment.
Furthermore, the Commission has pledged to instruct a committee of experts, by March 2002 to report on a number of alleged ambiguities and apparent imbalances which could lead to distortion of the internal market principles.
If the investigation confirms the said suspicions, the Commission will take measures accordingly.
Opponents want to reject this directive and would prefer to wait for a fresh proposal in the short term.
However, we have witnessed how national interests can substantially frustrate and delay a fresh proposal.
The time for navel-gazing is over and we cannot overlook the globalisation of our economies.
European companies must be able to compete with the rest of the world. That also applies to our investors.
We realise that this directive will not win any prizes, but rejection brings us back to square one, and that is not in the interests of Europe.
In the final analysis, to stand still is to regress, and fear is a bad advisor.
We have therefore voted in favour.
. (DE) The joint text for a European Parliament and Council directive on company law concerning takeover bids is rejected by my group.
The compromise approved by the Conciliation Committee is unacceptable to us.
As the proverb says, 'Time brings everything to those who wait' , and after 12 years of discussion, we could have expected that a perfect directive would be produced.
Yet the opposite is the case.
What are the problems?
1.
There are protected companies in the Member States, either through voting restrictions, 'golden shares' , or multiple voting rights, etc. The directive entrenches a situation in which protected companies can take over unprotected ones, yet unprotected companies cannot take over protected ones.
This means that there is no equal treatment ( 'level playing field' ).
2.
The directive fails to include principles governing the definition of the 'equitable price' to be offered in the case of a mandatory bid; it also contains no provisions on 'squeeze-out' (the right of the majority shareholder in a company to acquire the shares of minority shareholders).
3.
European companies would be exposed to pressure from the major financial corporations in Europe, with wealth creation henceforth giving way to the sole aim of maximising profits.
This in turn increases the danger that this type of takeover will result in large-scale job shedding.
4.
The co-determination rights of workforce representatives are not sufficiently articulated.
The requirement that appropriate information should be given to the representatives of the company' s employees offers no guarantee that they will be able to exert any influence on the takeover process.
The Commission itself is quite aware of these problems as well, for it proposes that a group of company law experts be requested to examine the further harmonisation of company law and define a clear position on Article 9 of this directive by March 2002.
What kind of logic is that?
I think it would have been more sensible to convene a group of experts to present its conclusions and then produce a directive, rather than first producing a directive and then asking a group of experts to discuss the unresolved problems.
Moreover, in conjunction with the directive on company law concerning takeover bids, a directive on the requirement for neutrality is urgently required.
This has been available in draft form since 1972 and has still not been adopted.
It is time for Mr Bolkestein and the Council to do their homework.
To give them the chance to do so, we have rejected the text before us.
The Parliament and Council Directive on the subject of company law concerning takeover bids is designed to harmonise Member State legislation in cases where companies governed by the law of one Member State are subject to a takeover bid, with their assets, i.e. property and shares, admitted to trading on a regulated market.
The main purpose of the directive is to protect the interests of minority shareholders, and, by means of harmonisation, to protect these interests when the takeover bid is of a cross-border nature.
By defining a principle for the equal treatment of all shareholders, the directive therefore seeks to establish minimum conditions for all shareholders to state their views and to study the terms of any bid made. At the same time, it seeks to ensure, by means of regulations on making the bid and time limits on the acceptance period, that the company remains operational during this period.
I therefore give my full support to the agreement that has been reached and, consequently, to the joint project, adopted by the Conciliation Committee, for a European Parliament and Council directive on takeover bids, which thereby seeks to create a set of harmonised rules that will add rigour to the process and ensure equal protection for all shareholders.
. (NL) Most companies used to be small-scale and linked to a town or an area.
Their ownership was not anonymous and their staff worked there all their lives.
For a long time, governments supported the efforts of companies to remain in regional or national hands, and the setting up of companies on a non-commercial basis, so that they could better serve the interests of employees and consumers.
In a society where everything is subordinated to a free market and worldwide competition, companies have now become a commodity.
