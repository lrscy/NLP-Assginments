Some will be raised during the planned mid-term review.
You only have to look at how far the take-up of money under the Structural Funds is behind schedule, namely over EUR 80 billion, to see that EUR 200 million is not going to break the bank.
One thing stands, however.
If we ask ourselves, do we need reform?
And Parliament has said that we do on several occasions.
If we ask ourselves, do we have stock problems?
Can we not keep going with the present resources?
If we ask ourselves, should we reduce capacity?
If we ask ourselves, do we have a social responsibility? Then we only have to look to the Commission proposal for an unequivocal answer to all these questions.
(Applause)
Mr President, I appreciate that in a debate like this the Commissioner has many, many questions to get to in the summing up, but my questions were specific, in particular in relation to relative stability, which was not mentioned in the summing up.
The document "Summary of Chapter 4" says "relative stability should be maintained, however, the method of allocation of each stock should be decided by Council in order to make the application more transparent".
What does this mean?
Does it open the possibility that the allocation keys could be ...
(The President cut off the speaker)
Mr Hudghton, that is not a point of order, that is a point of detail.
We will have plenty of time to discuss this report before it comes back to Parliament.
The debate is closed.
The next item is the report (A5-0144/2002) by Mr Konrad on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee on the draft Commission Regulation on the application of Article 81(3) of the Treaty to categories of vertical agreements and concerted practices in the vehicle industry.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honoured visitors, the purpose of this reform of the block exemption regulation is to re-regulate the motor vehicle industry in the European Union.
This proposed reform is, in my view, of real importance, including to European competition policy.
This being so, Parliament has tried, in liaison with the Commission, to adopt important detailed regulations.
As rapporteur, may I add that you, Commissioner Monti, held very intensive talks with Parliament, with the rapporteur and with numerous Members of this House, in a personal bid to ensure that numerous suggestions by Parliament were taken up alongside your considerations during the course of this constructive dialogue.
So how do dealers in the European Union at present stand under the old block exemption regulation?
What sort of agreements does the old block exemption regulation allow between dealers and the all-powerful car manufacturers?
There are a number of very interesting comments we can make on the current situation. At the moment, dealers can only act for one manufacturer.
At the moment, manufacturers can demand that dealers provide servicing as well as sales.
At the moment, spare parts can only be sourced from the car manufacturer, not the spare part manufacturer.
At the moment, car manufacturers can specify how many stock vehicles dealers must display on their forecourts.
This situation clearly bears all the hallmarks of a very one-sided division of power between the dealers and the manufacturers.
I think that this draft for a new block exemption regulation will provide a broader base for small and medium-sized undertakings, as well as giving consumers the opportunity to buy on better terms by improving the market situation.
In future, dealers will be able to sell several makes.
In future, dealers will not be obliged to offer both sales and servicing.
In future, there will be more independent garages, independent repair businesses which can obtain the information needed to service and repair cars directly from the manufacturer, we have seen to that.
These future advantages are all contained in this block exemption regulation.
If you look at the current situation, manufacturers are sacking dealers by the dozen.
I am not criticising that.
Manufacturers must be free to reorganise their sales networks.
But a total of 3 000 businesses have now been given their marching orders.
This reform will let them stay in the market, this reform will give them the chance to continue trading.
Now to the question of sales structures in the European Union. I think that the proposed sales structure, the structure proposed by Mr Monti, will give a tremendous boost to liberalisation.
It represents a huge shake-up in the industry, compared with today's difficult conditions.
This being the case, Parliament has proposed extending the transitional periods in order to give the market time to adjust.
There will therefore be a broad majority tomorrow in favour of a proposal to extend the transitional period for the location clause to 2005.
At the same time, we need a timely review clause so that we can see, given the market situation, if this location clause is still needed.
The majority in Parliament is in favour of this proposal.
I think that, with it, Mr Monti is assured of a broad majority in favour of his proposed reform.
Commissioner, your reform proposal will receive the backing of a broad majority tomorrow.
Our conclusion I think, looking at this reform at the end of this negotiation process, is that, once again, a specific industry has been granted an exemption from fair trading legislation.
And I would also say that we need fewer exemptions for specific industries in future.
The industry would therefore be well advised to gear itself up to the fact that there will not automatically be a follow-on regulation in 2010 and that we are working towards a time when there will no longer be any exemptions from fair trading legislation.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and to thank him and all the other members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for being so cooperative.
The committee responsible was able to include some of what we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market proposed in one form or another.
We were able to confine ourselves in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to a very small number of proposed amendments, because we support the Commission's basic approach.
You can never quantify it exactly, but I would say that we fully endorse 95% of the Commission's proposals.
On numerous other questions, it was rather up to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to express an opinion.
We came to one main basic conclusion in committee.
The current debate and all that has gone before have shown that this block exemption regulation, however esoteric it may sound, directly affects all our voters and will have far-reaching ramifications throughout Europe.
And yet it is an act which the Commission can decide on autonomously, with the European Parliament only involved under a voluntary consultation procedure.
With all due respect to the Commission and, more importantly, given the need for the Commission to remain impartial when it makes unilateral decisions and for the Commission to be shielded from unacceptable political pressure, I think that, when it comes to general competition law, these matters should come under the codecision procedure in future.
As a member of the European convention, I took the liberty of submitting a proposal to the convention along these lines last Friday.
Naturally, the Committee on Legal Affairs also considered measures to maintain confidence and legal certainty, which is why we have proposed improvements to conditions of notice and compensation for dealers and focused on the location clause.
My proposed transitional arrangement, which will be put to the vote tomorrow as the lead committee's Amendment No 28, is based on a number of considerations which give us cause to believe that it will improve competition.
If nearly every other restriction on competition is removed from the new block exemption regulation - which, as we have said, is a good thing which we expressly support - then I think that we can keep the location clause in place for dealers for the time being, in order to ensure, among other things, that dealers in areas with less purchasing power - and I come from just such an outlying region - can survive and that the consumer supply line is not cut.
Location clauses on a non-growth market can help to protect us from the all too negative fallout from the concentration process.
I think it is worth keeping an eye on this process for another two years.
Then it will automatically be up to the Commission to introduce the final, decisive measures.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur and everyone involved in this report. I should also like to thank the Commissioner, who held a plethora of individual talks for the purpose of hearing our views and arguing his own.
That alone illustrates how sensitive this issue is.
We have before us a regulation which contains a derogation from competition law.
We believe that this derogation cannot be maintained in the long term.
Anyone who takes the view that freedom of establishment is one of the four freedoms and that competition is a fundamental factor in strengthening the internal market must say yes to both and to the basic idea behind Commissioner Monti's proposal.
And we shall do so.
But the point is, how can we bring the interested parties around to the idea of freedom of establishment and more competition? The interested parties are the manufacturers, consumers and, in between them, the small and medium-sized businesses represented by dealers, workshops and sales.
We believe that it therefore comes down to the how and when of the changeover.
What Parliament has proposed are longer transitional periods, greater legal certainty and measures to maintain confidence, a yes to competition and protection for investments and new regulations for terminating agreements, even going as far as compensation if good faith is abused, together with a longer period and stronger form of notice.
Commissioner, we have said it all, the transitional period until 2005 and a facility for review were the core elements of the debate in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. What we now ask is that you accept that we support your basic line but that you meet us half way on implementation on the basis of Parliament's resolution.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. You have now received the praises of three Members and it will probably come as a surprise to you when I join them in their praises.
Yes, I too must compliment you on having basically made a move in the right direction with this initiative, because the old block exemption regulation, for all its good points, is quite simply and painfully out of date.
It has proven to have so many shortcomings that we really do need to make a clean sweep here.
But you also resisted the temptation to say, let us do away with the block exemption regulation altogether.
No, you have submitted a proposal which, to my mind, really does have a great deal to commend it: multiple brand sales, for example, the abolition of the compulsory linking of sales and servicing, which can now be unbundled, more independent workshops, independent spare part manufacturers and much more besides.
On balance, this is the way towards more competition as the consumer understands it.
But, surprise, surprise, the devil is in the detail and needless to say, fault can be found on a few counts.
But, let me be perfectly clear, we are talking about details and I think, after a long debate in committee, we have reached a good compromise in several areas, for which we have the rapporteur to thank.
However, I must say, Commissioner, as you know, I have reservations on one point and that is the location clause.
As I am sure you realise, there are several ways of looking at this clause.
You say - the Commission says - that what is being proposed here is good for competition and will slash prices.
I have my doubts.
I wonder if what is being proposed really is competition and if it really will improve competition.
Because what is being proposed here means quite simply that manufacturers will pick and choose and limit the number of sales.
From that point of view, there is little difference in comparison with the old system, except that they really will be able to compete with each other.
What sounds perfectly plausible and reasonable to start with may harbour a huge risk; because it is a closed circle, the big fish will be able to eat up the little fish.
That is what worries me; that the end result will be that the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sales sector will be the first to go, eaten up by the large companies and resulting in more concentration even more quickly than is presently the case.
That may cause prices to rise again at a later date, due to a lack of competition.
That is why we have not suggested doing away with the whole idea. What we are saying is, let us include it in the regulation but postpone it.
Then we really can look at it again in the light of specific events and decide whether or not to stick with it.
Mr President, I should like to thank you very much, Commissioner Monti, for the courage and the will you have shown in tabling this proposal.
The Commission's proposal is a step in the right direction, but we should like to have seen it go further in terms of free consumer choice, and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will therefore be tabling some amendments tomorrow.
We were, however, obliged to support the Commission's proposal in order to avoid any further watering down.
There are many interests at stake, with many interested parties involved, and, as you yourself, Mr Monti, recently mentioned in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, some of these interested parties will stop at nothing in their attempt to organise future car sales in the way that suits them best.
Unfortunately, the car manufacturers' view of what is in their own best interests does not coincide with what is beneficial for consumers.
We have clearly seen this in the form of the massive lobbying that has gone on everywhere in recent weeks and months in order to prevent a genuine internal market for car sales being established, with the consequent benefits for both dealers and consumers.
We are surely not giving away too much by naming names and saying that it was, in particular, a couple of major German car manufacturers, Mercedes and BMW, who knocked on our door.
A majority in the European Parliament obviously do not want all the benefits, however, while many of the key aspects of the Commission's original proposal were voted down in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
I had hoped we might have been able to reach a sensible compromise but, unfortunately, I have to say that I have been disappointed in this matter by a number of my otherwise good friends and allies in the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and in the Group of the Party of European Socialists.
I should nonetheless like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Konrad, for the sound work he has done and for having tried to move things in the right direction.
I should like to conclude by giving Commissioner Monti the greatest possible encouragement to stand firm on this matter and by, for once, asking him not to listen to the majority of the European Parliament who have not known how to look after the interests of the ordinary citizen and consumer.
My message is therefore: do not allow special interests to steer developments in a direction which is of benefit neither to dealers, consumers nor the overall European economy.
Mr President, this draft regulation is very important.
It has not, however, been subject to co-decision.
One of the Convention's priorities must be to subject all the important regulations to the co-decision procedure and we are counting on Mrs Berger to do this.
The draft text aims to reduce the substantial price differences in the Union, but these would be much less substantial if we harmonised taxation.
Regarding the other points, must we really reduce competition and step up the intensity of distribution?
There are limits to consumerism.
Vertical agreements enable us to guarantee consumer safety and contribute to enhancing the industry's robustness.
We must make these agreements more flexible in order to increase the independence of the local dealer whilst maintaining the chain of responsibility.
The chief danger of the draft text is the withdrawal of the location clause.
This would pave the way for large, specialised companies and large retailers.
We have also witnessed the sacking of the CEO of Virgin; you forgot to mention him, Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen.
If these distributors entered the market, it would spell disaster for small- and medium-sized businesses and it could lead to considerable job losses, and a loss of proximity to the consumer, except in the most profitable territorial areas.
We are particularly concerned that the consumer will be exposed to the risk of a break in the sales and after-sales service link if the distributor is able to award after-sales service contracts to authorised repairers which are not subject to a location clause.
Our committee calls for an assessment to be carried out in 2005 before any final decision is made regarding the freedom of establishment of distributors.
This will provide an opportunity to examine the practices of reducing price differences that are compatible with maintaining the location clause.
This is a reasonable compromise.
Of course, other reforms could be envisaged at a later stage.
The dialogue with the Commissioner was extremely positive overall: although we are not in agreement, we had an extremely useful discussion.
And the work by our committee was also very thorough and I feel that it produced some worthwhile amendments.
Parliament would be well advised to take on board most of these conclusions.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dossier that we are discussing today is, as we all know, fundamental.
The draft Commission regulation, which seeks to revise the block exemption regulation on motor vehicles, concerns the future of an economic sector that is absolutely essential for many European Union Member States.
Apart from the distribution of motor vehicles itself, several hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout Europe are at stake.
This brings me to my next point: the debate underway today is not only a technical debate in which specialists alone can take part, it is a political debate as well, there is no doubt about that.
What is being discussed here is a specific concept of Europe, or to be more precise, the way that our fellow citizens perceive Europe.
Consumers are entitled, therefore, to speculate on the true motives of the Commission, a Commission that is desperately trying to transform a distribution system which, everyone agrees, has not only proven its worth but has also respected the main principles of competition.
Why withdraw the location clause and the concept of territory?
Why break the essential link between sales and after-sales service?
Why pursue this extreme notion of multi-branding?
Why introduce even more competition, when our motor industry is already one of the most competitive in the world?
In my view, all these inconsistencies arise from a terribly dogmatic approach to competition, an approach that can also be found in other dossiers, such as merger control, for example.
In the specific case of motor vehicle distribution, the truth that the Commission is deliberately ignoring is that we cannot achieve ideal competition and preserve what is a determining factor for consumers, namely, a network of dealers selling and repairing motor vehicles that is as extensive as the one we have in Europe.
I urge all my fellow Members to draw their own conclusions, taking into account economic and social realities.
We must therefore have a vigilant and cautious approach.
We must demonstrate a more balanced and fair frame of mind in relation to this dossier in which many different factors are at stake, ranging from those relating to consumer safety to that of employment in all Member States, as well as in the most remote regions.
Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the method, I feel that it must be pointed out, as Mr Karas has done, that we are discussing the exemption of a sector from normal competition rules, an exemption which would not be possible in Europe, or in the United States either, if it were not for the political influence of politicians involved in that sector.
With regard to the substance, the objections and prophecies of doom that are being voiced in opposition to the liberalisation of this sector are identical to those which were voiced in opposition to the liberalisation of all the other sectors.
This liberalisation will bring greater efficiency, more competition, greater benefits for consumers and, not least, more employment as well.
The Italian radicals will therefore firmly support the work of the Commission, aided by the Parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, supporting the amendments tabled by Mr Konrad, Mr Karas, Mrs Villers, Mr Huhne and Mrs Riis-JÃžrgensen, which seek to strengthen, where necessary, the liberalisation process envisaged by the Commission.
Mr President, the British Conservatives do not believe that the Commission's proposal should be diluted, postponed or reviewed.
We support the liberalisation proposed by the Commission.
We believe that in the UK consumers have paid too much for their cars for too long and this Parliament should not postpone the cheaper car prices which will be the result of a more competitive market.
Parliament should remember that though we must be sensitive to the concerns of small businesses, every dealer who writes to us probably has 100 or 500 or 1000 customers, whose interests we must also consider in this difficult debate.
I believe that a ban on location clauses is essential to delivering a competitive framework in the EU car market.
Without the ban on location clauses, we would see almost no change from the present position, because without that ban consumers would still have to travel to another country to use a non-domestic dealer.
We believe that we will not see price reductions in the EU unless location clauses go and dealers are free to set up in different EU Member States.
If we want to protect dealers, we should be protecting them from anti-competitive practices by car-makers and unlawful and unjustified termination of their franchises by car-makers.
We should not be protecting dealers from the market and from ordinary competitive pressures because that is to deny consumers the cheap car prices which they deserve, and which this Parliament should be prepared to deliver to them.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with a new document which forms part of the effort being made by the European Commission to reform and update Community competition law.
Furthermore, this document is consistent with various other regulations and documents which this Parliament has declared itself in favour of.
The distribution of automobiles has always had special treatment, a sectoral treatment, and, if pushed, I would say that this system may have made sense before, when there were different regulations for the different distribution systems, but perhaps it makes less sense now.
The fact is, however, regardless of this, that the different regulations that have been in force in this sector have not managed to remove the obstacles in that market.
The differences in prices in the different countries are still considerable, essentially as a result of the actions of manufacturers who are determined to maintain national borders and prevent cross-border trade.
We only have to look at all the decisions the Commission has taken and consider the considerable fines and penalties imposed on manufacturers as a result of this anti-competitive behaviour to realise how true this claim is.
The Commission is now presenting us with a new proposal for a Regulation which I believe takes us in the right direction.
Some of the sectors involved tell us that they will go through hell if the Regulation is approved, and they forecast harmful consequences for the sector.
I do not believe that this is true.
However, I am sure that with the proposed measures manufacturers will be asked to maintain unjustifiably high prices as a result of anti-competitive actions.
The essential point of the proposal is the disappearance of the location clause for the dealer, and that measure is a step in the right direction.
It is true that it may affect the structure of the distribution market, and I can therefore agree to a transitional period.
However, not to approve this measure until a study is carried out and a new decision adopted, let us not deceive ourselves, represents subterfuge by those people who do not want this measure to be approved.
Not now, not ever.
Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur on the Legal Affairs Committee working with my colleague Mrs Berger, I would like to thank our colleagues on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for accepting so many amendments from our committee.
I want to focus on those, particularly by talking about some of the complexities of this regulation and making it work in practice.
But, first of all, I want to join in the congratulations to Professor Monti on having the courage to move ahead with such a bold and a wide-ranging reform.
I remember sharing a platform with him at a conference back in May 2000 when he set out his concerns very clearly.
He has worked through that consistently.
I am lending my support even though I am one of the relatively few people who have not been lobbied by the Commissioner.
I know he has been very active in lobbying round Parliament for his proposal.
I want to declare an interest because I have, in my former years, been a director of sales for a major car company.
I have managed distribution all over the world.
I am pleased that you see, Commissioner, that independent competing dealers will continue to be the foundation of providing good quality sales and service for consumers.
In that connection I encourage colleagues to support the amendments that my colleague Mrs Villiers has proposed to reinforce that independence.
It is crucial.
I want to say to you, Commissioner, that these regulations are exceptionally complex.
You have given dealers a huge range of new weapons.
They need to be encouraged to use those quickly and you will need to produce clear and unambiguous guidelines, on both sales and service.
We must not underestimate the service you have done for consumers by opening up competition in after-sales and spare parts.
That will in fact mean more to most consumers on an annual basis.
They only buy cars relatively infrequently.
This across-the-board approach will be good for consumers and I encourage you to make sure that those independent dealers really have the business security they need to invest and take advantage of your proposals.
Commissioner, I would like to say that it takes real courage to tackle the substantial vested interest in the way that you have.
Particularly when that interest is one that can plead consequences right across Europe in terms of our economic viability.
Please do not let Europe's consumers down with undue delay in view of what you may have heard today.
The principle of unripe time is always there to slow things down.
New entrants to a multi-choice free-for-all will always be demonised as too rich or too unscrupulous.
The fact of the matter is that we have never been able to bring about greater competition in any area, and I include the airlines, without some rich people and some people varied in their approach coming into a market which is being opened up.
The small dealer is being invoked as a victim here, but he has much to gain from a reform of franchising, as Mrs Villiers has said.
The choice we expect from any other sophisticated personal equipment, the competition we look for in the maintenance of our houses, our computers and, yes indeed, our second-hand cars, is condemned here.
It should not be.
This is a widening of choice.
Commissioner, you should listen to what is said in this debate, but you probably have more support here than the debate itself will disclose.
Stick to it!
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are debating a subject that affects every consumer, every citizen in the European Union.
It affects all our guests and, as far as the industry is concerned, it affects a great many jobs and a great many small and medium-sized businesses, not just in the countries in which the cars are produced, but throughout Europe.
I too am affected and I shudder when I think of my last service bill, which was extortionate.
That is why I am most grateful to the Commissioner for this courageous draft in favour of more competition.
We have included a number of factors in this positive proposal, such as uncoupling sales and servicing and multiple brand sales, the location clause will be dropped and garages must be provided with information.
So there will be much more competition here and I am most grateful to you for that, Commissioner Monti.
I am also most grateful to you for arranging such an intensive dialogue with Parliament, for exchanging views with us and for stressing time and again that Parliament's support is very important to you.
For that too I am most grateful to you.
We have a situation here in which the industry stands on one side, the consumers, whose rights we are strengthening, stand on the other, with the dealers sandwiched in between.
It may well be that the dealers will suffer most.
I personally lobbied in committee in favour of strengthening dealers' rights - and I am most grateful to Mr Konrad for his support here - by including an investment protection clause, for example.
One point under discussion is the transitional period for the location clause and the question of a review.
I think there is no need to stress out about the review.
If we opt today for a specific transitional period and if we are convinced today that it may not work, then we should say so in no uncertain terms, we should state our reasons and then those of us who said as much today will be able to say we were right all along.
It may be a way of introducing competition here, but if we are talking about a transitional period, then we should not shy away from a review.
The European Parliament will come to its decision tomorrow and I for one would be delighted if the Commission, starting with Commission President Prodi, were to respect the vote of the only elected representatives of the people of Europe, even though we are not officially involved in the decision-making process here.
Mr President, the Commission's proposal for the motor vehicle market would provide Community legislation with undoubted benefits for consumers.
For that reason it deserves our support, regardless of any changes that may still be made with a view to achieving a better overall balance of all the parties involved, but at the same time recognising that Parliament is currently being consulted on this.
In particular, there is a place for actions to improve road safety through proper vehicle use.
The new regulation represents a significant advance across the motor vehicle market, because above all it puts an end to the excessive power of car manufacturers, which in some cases are not far from abusing a dominant position.
For example, the draft regulation deals with the roles of the motor vehicle trade, of wholesale distributors and of retail distributors in a balanced way.
However, the basic philosophy of the new regulation is, and I would like to reiterate this, essentially to defend the interests of consumers, not so much immediately, because there is no guarantee that there will be instantaneous significant changes in vehicle prices that will benefit consumers, but above all in the medium and long-term, once all the rules for active competition enshrined in the regulation have been assimilated.
It is therefore vital for rapid progress to be made with this regulation so that economic operators can prepare for total liberalisation of this sector as from 2010.
Nevertheless, we can and must accept that the entry into force of the localisation provisions should be deferred for a reasonable period, and I regard such a deferral as being very much a question of positive discrimination for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The public debate surrounding this legislative initiative has at times been dominated by the suggestion that there will be immediate and significant cuts in car prices.
This will certainly not happen automatically.
There could even be some perverse upward movement of prices in the short term.
The objective announced by Commissioner Monti on behalf of the Commission will only lead to a satisfactory outcome if we make progress towards fiscal harmonisation.
I hope that this new regulation will contribute to that.
Mr President, Commissioner, I will get straight to the point and enter directly into the debate on the location clause, which is the main focus of this debate in this House.
I perfectly understand the Commission's objective in proposing the removal of this clause.
The Commission believes that the removal of this clause would increase competition between dealers and that would lead to a reduction in prices.
Nothing could be more laudable for the Group of the European Peoples' Party than the defence of freedom and consumers.
The proposal as presented by the Commissioner, however, raises certain questions which should be cleared up before accepting a drastic solution.
It seems clear that the current level between brands is sufficient.
If the location clause is removed suddenly, do we not run the risk of reducing manufacturers' capacity to organise their distribution network?
Is there not a risk of the larger manufacturers swallowing up the smaller ones, thereby reducing competition?
Secondly, the Commission's proposals, many of which are interesting, contain sufficient elements to promote competition within a single brand.
Would it not be prudent to see how it works before we use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?
Thirdly, is it not clear that investments made by dealers are in danger, and the smaller the dealer the greater the danger is, which would increase the market share for the large dealers, thereby working against the objectives of the Commission?
Therefore, Commissioner, since there have been no clear replies, I believe that the rapporteur's proposal is a prudent one, there are times for valour and there are times for prudence and, in this case, it is clearly necessary to wait and see how the new elements to promote competition introduced by the proposal work before going ahead with the removal of the location clause.
Mr President, congratulations to the Commissioner for a very bold and courageous proposal.
Indeed, you should rest assured that many in this House support you in this move even if some would perhaps suggest quite the opposite.
Car manufacturers will not change their behaviour.
They are doing too well to want to do that and we have waited the best part of decade for them to do so since the last review.
Will we have to wait another decade for them to come back to this House to say the same things time and time again?
And, in the meantime, consumers across the European Union will have to pay, as they have always done, and as they will continue to do unless we tackle the issue of the cartel.
It is very clear from your proposals, Commissioner, that you want to do just that and you have the support of the Labour delegation in this group and other delegations across this room.
I hope that the support which you have received here will give you the courage to continue in this bold move and that we will finally see some reduction in the activity of this cartel and some improvement for the consumer across the European Union.
Mr President, a warm welcome to Professor Monti, who appears to be deep in thought at the moment.
My heartiest congratulations to Mr Konrad on the huge amount of work he has done and the considerable effort he has put into this report.
The main aim of the new regulation is to increase the level of competition across the board with a view to improving consumer well-being and safety and the functioning of the internal market.
In order to achieve this last goal, it will also have to provide protection for dealers and encourage the small and medium-sized businesses operating in the European automotive sector.
We therefore agree that the interests of consumers should take first place, and there are a huge range of possibilities within the common market.
Increasing competition between sales distributors and in the after sales market and increasing competition in the manufacturing and distribution of spare parts must therefore be seen as positive.
We must not, however, overlook the fact that, if the measures laid down in the new regulation are interpreted too rigidly or too loosely, they could reduce legal certainty and lead to forms of concentration in distribution location, in after sales services and in spares production, causing a considerable number of small and medium-sized businesses to disappear from our market and impacting negatively on employment and the expected benefits for consumers.
For these reasons, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has adopted an extremely favourable stance; it endorses the idea of a transition period until 2005 and a review clause.
Naturally, we hope that the other groups will take the same stance.
The implementation of the idea of protecting consumers by reducing car prices, the effectiveness of which is, as yet, completely unproven, will have to involve an evaluation of what happens during the transition period.
The necessary conclusions will be drawn from the results which emerge and the new regulation will then be applied accordingly.
During that period, dealers will, however, have the opportunity to invest, taking into account any restructuring of industry, and this would, in any case, be less harmful than a regulation which might work against the consumer and which would certainly penalise a large number of small and medium-sized businesses operating in the car dealership sector.
Mr President, this draft regulation is the product of a lengthy, in-depth process analysing the situation in the motor vehicle sector.
In its November 2000 evaluation report, the Commission concluded that the current system had not yielded the intended results and that, therefore, it could not be preserved in its current form.
The main goals of the future system are therefore clear: it must, first and foremost, promote the interests of the consumer, introducing greater competition and not just in the sale of new vehicles but in repair and maintenance services as well.
In addition, the draft regulation seeks to guarantee the smooth functioning of the internal market in new cars.
It is unacceptable, ladies and gentlemen, for cars, which are the very symbol of mobility, to continue to be one of the least mobile commodities on the internal market.
In the past, the Commission has had to fine vehicle manufacturers which have blocked parallel trade.
These practical cases show how consumers have been deprived of the benefit, of the right to choose where they purchase vehicles.
In this sense, I would stress that the Commission's aim is not to harmonise prices as such, but it does have the further-reaching, more fundamental goal of guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the internal market and, in particular, of allowing consumers to purchase vehicles directly or indirectly wherever they are cheaper.
Lastly, independent dealers and repairers will benefit from the new package of rules for it will consolidate their financial independence and provide them with new commercial opportunities.
The reactions of consumer associations, automobile associations, spare parts manufacturers' associations and independent repairers' associations to the Commission's draft regulation have been very positive.
They feel that such a reform is definitely in the interests of European consumers.
Indeed, some of their reactions say that the draft regulation does not go far enough.
The leaders of European industry are continuously calling upon the European institutions to promote liberalisation and flexibility as the basic ingredients for a more competitive economy which will boost growth and employment.
The draft regulation was conceived according to this approach, consistently advocated by European industry, which the Commission fully supports.
We are therefore surprised by the heavy lobbying against the draft regulation by a number of interest groups associated with the industry.
The veritable twisting of facts and simply erroneous statements which have sometimes been produced in relation to the draft regulation are regrettable.
They are in contrast with the availability and openness to dialogue shown by the Commission towards all the interested parties.
We are fully convinced of the benefits which will be derived from the new regulation.
It takes into account the specific nature of motor vehicles as a product.
The new regulation seeks to ensure that vehicles are safe products, that they are provided with very reliable after sales services and that they respect environmental standards.
We must have confidence - we do have confidence - in the many highly competent dealers who will take the appropriate commercial decisions.
Ultimately, they are the ones who are most familiar with consumers' needs and they are the ones who run the commercial risks.
I welcome the in-depth debates that have taken place on the Commission draft regulation in the European Parliament, particularly in the context of the discussions on Mr Conrad's report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I too have found the dialogue extremely useful and constructive.
I have taken note of your comments and I welcome the fact that the report adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs broadly supports the general lines advocated by the Commission, particularly with regard to the need to change the current system.
I will now focus briefly on the most important draft amendments contained in the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.
One of the most important elements of our new system is the prohibition of use of the location clause.
This is the linchpin of the system and it is necessary for the other measures to be fully effective too.
The abolition of this clause applying to vehicle sales, which will allow dealers to open secondary sales and delivery outlets in other areas, including in other Member States, is essential to facilitate consumer access to vehicles sold by dealers from other Member States at lower prices.
This will increase competition between dealers selling the same brand of car and encourage market integration, making multi-brand sales possible too.
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes to establish a transition period for this measure - the abolition of the location clause - lasting until 1 October 2005 and to make abolition of the location clause dependent upon the results of an assessment.
I realise that the transition period would allow both manufacturers and dealers to prepare themselves and to adapt to the new system, but I feel frankly that it would be detrimental, extremely detrimental to postpone a decision on abolishing the location clause until a future assessment.
It is not advisable to prolong a state of uncertainty regarding the future system; rather, we need to establish clear rules right from the word go, or else - we have to admit - this transition period would serve no purpose: the operators would not know which future system to adapt themselves to and it follows that they would not make any preparations for the entry into force of the new rules.
It would not be a transition: it would, let us be quite clear about this, be a mere waiting period, a period of waiting for a new Parliament and a new Commission in order to decide on the future motor vehicle distribution system in Europe. As one of you has said, it would be an excuse to put off the decision indefinitely.
The Commission believes that we must shoulder this responsibility as of now.
We cannot continuously declare that we want a European Union that is closer to the citizens - how many times have I heard that said in this House and how I agree with it - and then, when the time comes to take decisions, fail to behave accordingly.
That aside, as I said to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am prepared to consider whether a longer transition period than that laid down in the draft regulation might be appropriate, but purely with regard to the location clause.
Nevertheless, we must not forget that, if we extend the transition period, we will also be putting off the time when consumers will be able to benefit from the new system.
As regards multi-branding, one of the draft's key objectives is to make it genuinely possible for dealers to sell different brands if they so choose.
The draft seeks to make multi-branding easier for dealers while still protecting the brand images in which manufacturers have invested, thus facilitating consumers' freedom of choice and increasing competition between brands.
I agree that the brand image is the most important competition tool for vehicle manufacturers, but there is no justification for requiring separate showrooms or different staff for different brands and this would remove the financial advantage of multi-branding for dealers.
I would also point out that multi-branding is particularly important for small dealers especially, for it can help them to establish themselves and survive in rural areas.
It would not be right to leave this aspect to the two parties to negotiate while dealers are financially completely dependent on their suppliers.
To strengthen the position of dealers, therefore, we must give them the facility to decide whether to display different brands of vehicles in separate areas of the same showroom or whether to display them in separate showrooms, and whether to employ different sales personnel for each brand.
I feel, moreover, that Parliament should agree on the need to protect dealers in the way the Commission has proposed: the minimum period of notice and the obligation to provide detailed reasons for termination of a contract are intended to strengthen the position of dealers.
The draft regulation also seeks to alter the, at present, extremely close link between the sale of new vehicles and after sales services.
A dealer can choose whether to focus its activity purely on selling vehicles or whether to provide after sales services as well: this right strengthens its independence.
Since after sales services can only be subcontracted to authorised repairers, a high level of quality and safety is guaranteed.
In my opinion, in its original form, the Commission's draft already ensures that there will be a service point near a dealer where the dealer subcontracts the activity, but, in the light of the amendments put forward in this regard, a solution could be to require the dealer to inform the consumer of the distance of the premises of the authorised repairer from the sales outlet as well as the location.
I must stress that it is particularly important to make the link between sales and after sales services less binding in a period when networks of dealers are being restructured and their numbers reduced.
Dealers whose agreements are terminated can now remain in the market as authorised repairers.
In view of this and in order to safeguard the consumer interest of having a wider network of service centres, it would be a mistake to limit the number of authorised repairers.
Lastly, I broadly endorse the amendments intended to increase access to technical information and to clarify the definition of spare parts.
By way of conclusion, Mr President, I have noted and I welcome the favourable attitude of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the approach taken by the Commission.
I have told you where I stand with regard to the main amendments proposed by the committee and I would ask the Members to be so good as to take these considerations into account when they vote.
The very fact that the Economic Committee's report broadly supports the line taken by the Commission is evidence that Parliament is not giving any heed to the black picture painted by the lobbyists who presented the Commission's draft as some sort of disaster.
You might remember that there were similar reactions when the Commission opposed continuing duty free.
It was said that we would cause 140 thousand job losses.
Considerable political pressure was exerted at high levels then too and there was a huge lobby.
The Commission refused to be influenced by the pressure.
Duty free was abolished, to the benefit of the taxpayer, and there was absolutely no disaster.
I would like to thank the Members for this dialogue.
I would also like to thank them personally for their appreciation.
Some of you have described our actions as courageous.
I am much obliged, but I really do not think that working to promote the citizens' interests is being courageous.
If I might express my personal opinion, I am sure that the citizens, your electorate, expect Parliament to be at least equally courageous.
The next item is the debate on the Commission and Council statements on the EU/Latin American Summit of 17 and 18 May 2002 in Madrid.
Mr President, I am here on behalf of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to inform Parliament of the results of the summit between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries held in Madrid on 17 and 18 May.
Following a long preparation period, the preparatory work having begun a year ago under the Swedish Presidency and continued under the Belgian Presidency, we must say that noteworthy results have been achieved at the summit, which are in line with the objectives set by the Spanish Presidency for this six-month period.
As Parliament knows, the slogan chosen for the summit was "The European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, promoting a strategic partnership for the twenty-first century", which I believe sums up what we are creating between these two geographical regions: a common area and joint action in the international field between two regions of the world which share principles and values as fundamental as democracy, the Rule of Law, respect for human rights, equality between men and women, the market economy, rational thinking and many others which form the foundation of what we understand to be the western world.
Mr President, the preparatory meetings had grouped the issues for the summit into three areas: political dialogue, economic and trade cooperation and cultural, educational and social cooperation.
The working sessions conformed to these three areas, including the following points, introduced by different countries: the political session dealt with the strengthening and modernisation of the State, cooperation in the fight against terrorism, cooperation in the fight against drug-trafficking, multilateralism and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the Rule of Law.
The session on social policy and cultural and educational cooperation dealt with cultural diversity, the danger of technological backwardness, education, equality and social cohesion, sustainable development and the environment.
Finally, the economic session discussed the international financial architecture, bi-regional trade, international cooperation for sustainable development and development funding, measures to stimulate economic growth and development and, finally, regional integration processes.
Furthermore, there was a working lunch with the President of the European Central Bank and the President of the Inter-American Investment Bank.
Mr President, next I will tell the House what the Presidency believes are the most important results of this summit in the three areas I have mentioned.
Firstly, in the political field, there have clearly been significant results such as the firm commitment to fight terrorism and drug trafficking which threaten the whole world, and to this end to strengthen the mechanisms for cooperation between governments.
Secondly, strengthening bi-regional political dialogue through agreement within international fora, in particular the United Nations.
This agreement will allow those of us who share the same principles and values to deal with the main issues on the international agenda.
In this respect, it is absolutely justified to renew the commitment to cooperate in the strengthening of the democratic institutions.
It is on the second aspect, in the economic and social field, that there have been more considerable advances in comparison with the situation resulting from the first summit in RÃ­o de Janeiro in June 1999.
On the one hand, the entry into force of the Agreement with Mexico, which has had a very positive impact on commercial movements between the European Union and Mexico.
On the other hand - and this is undoubtedly the most important thing - the signing of the association agreement with Chile.
All the participants have indicated the great importance of this act following complex and sometimes difficult negotiations which will lead us, as was the case with Mexico, to a privileged relationship with direct social and economic benefits for Chile, but which will go beyond that country and send a message of trust to the whole of Latin America at this time of economic uncertainty, in certain sub-regions in particular.
With regard to Mercosur, there has been progress in the negotiation, of which the political chapter and the chapters on cooperation and the promotion of trade are practically concluded.
Furthermore, it has been agreed to continue commercial negotiations with a ministerial meeting in July, which will give impetus to the negotiation despite the adverse circumstances resulting from the situation in Argentina.
With regard to Central America and the Andean Community of nations, we have managed to open the way to the possible negotiation of association agreements with both regions.
Meanwhile, agreements on political dialogue and cooperation are being negotiated and cooperation in the field of trade, investments and economic relations is being strengthened.
The intention of all of this is to prepare the ground so that, once the Doha Round is completed, association agreements with these two Latin American sub-regions can be negotiated.
In view of the experience with Mercosur, it is essential that we strengthen both integration processes in order to promote the agreements we all aspire to.
I can tell Parliament that the Central Americans have accepted this formula to a large extent, although they would have preferred a more precise timetable that began following the Madrid Summit.
The Andean Community has expressed less satisfaction with the agreement reached although they recognise that the formula obtained opens the door to a future association agreement which will replace the unilateral concessions they currently receive through the system of generalised preferences relating to the fight against drug trafficking.
I would like to end my comments on the different geographical areas by mentioning the decision of the Caribbean countries, together with all the ACP countries, to begin negotiations next September for the economic association with the European Union within the framework of Cotonou.
As we can see, these decisions and agreements have a broad perspective, creating fluid and intense relations between the two sides of the Atlantic in the not too distant future which, as I have said, will benefit the societies of both America and Europe.
I would also like to highlight three more issues in this economic field: the decision to cooperate in the eradication of poverty through, amongst other instruments, the strengthening of institutions.
Important decisions on this and its consequences were taken at the Monterrey Conference in March, which appeared in its final document known as the Monterrey Consensus.
Secondly, the creation of better conditions for development and macroeconomic balance, an effort which will involve both the Inter-American Development Bank and the European Investment Bank.
Both institutions will thereby be incorporated into the process of strengthening the strategic partnership with all their experience and resources, which is a considerable innovation.
It is also worth mentioning the support for the introduction of the euro, acknowledging its positive effects, as both the Council and the European Central Bank have done at the Madrid Summit.
There are also new elements of interest in the field of cooperation.
I will mention the following: the ALIS programme for the development of the information society, a four-year programme which will receive EUR 85 million, of which the Commission will provide 63.5 million and the Latin American countries will provide the rest, until that figure is reached.
Although the Commission will be able to provide more information, I would simply like to point out that included in the objectives of the programme are the normalisation of the regulatory framework and the interconnection of networks.
In the field of education, which the summit has paid particular attention to, the new ALBAN scholarship programme is of particular importance.
This programme was presented by the Commissioner responsible for External Relations, Mr Patten, within the framework of the Cultural Forum which ran parallel with the summit and brought together cultural foundations and bodies from European and Latin American countries.
The programme consists of the funding of - 3900 grants for postgraduate studies, to be provided by the Commission - EUR 75 million - and the European universities participating in the programme - EUR 38 million.
I believe that this is a milestone which deserves to be highlighted since it will decisively promote educational cooperation between Europe and Latin America and will allow for the highest-level education for Latin American postgraduate students, with all that this implies in terms of aiding the development of these countries and overcoming the almost unilateral relationship between these societies and the United States of America.
I believe this is a very significant programme, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Commission for the work it has done through Commissioner Patten.
I should also mention the support which the summit gave to the 2002-2004 Action Plan in the field of higher education with the objectives of improving the quality of education and facilitating the mobility of students.
Mr President, the second European Union/Latin America and the Caribbean Summit has taken place within a none too favourable international context, on either side of the Atlantic.
In fact, as well as the economic difficulties resulting from 11 September, difficult situations in several South American countries - the particular situation in Venezuela a month after the serious crisis in April, the peace process interrupted in a climate deeply affected by the unacceptable terrorist violence in Colombia, the profound crisis in Argentina - all of this added to the European preoccupation with enlargement and the various elections taking place at the moment in certain European Union countries, did not appear to offer the best possible climate for the summit.
Nevertheless, the Madrid Summit involved a very large number of participants, achieved very noteworthy concrete results and has been very positively assessed by the participants and, in general, by public opinion.
As a result of the agreements and decisions adopted at the summit, included in a political declaration of 33 points known as the Madrid Commitment, a new phase in our bi-regional relations has begun, which is an important step in the process of consolidating the strategic partnership.
The scheduling of the next summit in Mexico in 2004 guarantees the continuity of this process of strengthening and consolidating the bi-regional association.
To that end the commitments made in the Madrid Declaration must be suitably followed up so that the Mexico Summit may represent a significant new step in this process of alliance between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, a process which has always been promoted by this Parliament.
Mr President, honourable Members, when my colleague, Commissioner Patten addressed you a fortnight ago regarding the Commission's preparation for the Madrid Summit, he specifically highlighted the need for the partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean to be a credible process and for the summit to produce concrete results.
Now, with the summit behind us and after the very comprehensive account that the Presidency has just presented to you, I can confidently say that we have succeeded in our aims.
Madrid clearly proved that the bi-regional partnership we established at Rio is much more than just another talking shop.
Today my aim is not to provide you with an in-depth analysis of the three principal documents that the Madrid Summit produced, the Presidency has already discussed this issue in detail.
The already widely available documents are, as you know, the political declaration, the common value and positions paper and the assessment report on our progress since Rio.
I want to draw your attention to the fact that the assessment report clearly stresses that the European Commission is most probably the most active institution in promoting the concrete implementation of the strategic partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean launched in Rio de Janeiro in 1999.
On behalf of Commission Patten, I would like to pick out the most important points to come out of the summit.
The fact that heads of state and government from both regions confirm their conviction that multilateralism is the best way to handle the problems and challenges that face the world today.
Both parties have rejected unilateralism in political and trade matters and have committed to joining forces and promoting a common vision on these significant issues within the framework of multi-lateral mechanisms.
This represents a strong commitment which will help us to move the partnership forward on a daily basis.
The Commission is particularly satisfied with the outcome of the meetings and events that took place in the context of the Madrid Summit.
Firstly, we were able to successfully complete the European Union-Chile negotiations in due time to allow Mr Prodi, Mr Aznar and Mr Lagos to announce the official conclusion of the negotiations and the establishment of our much awaited association agreement.
Secondly, the Madrid Summit provided an occasion for the European Union and Mercosur heads of state and government to note with satisfaction the progress made by the bi-regional negotiations committee towards the establishment of an inter-regional strategic association.
They also agreed on a new mechanism for their meetings with greater frequency, so as to strengthen and deepen the EU-Mercosur political dialogue.
Furthermore, a ministerial meeting will take place hopefully next July in order to provide impetus for negotiations of the trade chapter.
Thirdly, the demands of both the Andean Community and Central America, for the opening of negotiations towards association agreements with the EU were also answered adequately at Madrid.
Significantly, a decision was taken to negotiate political and cooperation agreements with both regions.
It was also decided to strengthen cooperation on trade, investment and economic relations.
These three initiatives should establish the conditions under which feasible and mutually beneficial association agreements, including FTAs could be negotiated between the European Union and both regions.
Evidently, these will have to build upon the outcome of the Doha work programme which we have committed to complete by the end of 2004.
Fourthly, the 18th Ministerial Conference of the San JosÃ© dialogue held on the periphery of the Madrid Summit, decided on a renewed agenda and on a new format for the political dialogue.
The Commission shares the view of our Central American partner that it is necessary to keep alive the particular nature of the San JosÃ© dialogue.
The outcome of the Madrid Summit shows that the bi-regional strategic partnership is now well under way.
Certainly the Spanish Presidency's hard work played a key role in ensuring the success of the summit.
The Commission is particularly focused on the need to lead the EU-Latin American-Caribbean partnership in implementing new concrete bi-regional initiatives.
In the field of education, the Commission has just launched a brand-new scholarship programme, ALBAN, which will allow 4 000 Latin American postgraduate students to complete their training in Europe.
The existing bi-regional programme for SMEs exchanges, AL-INVEST, will be renewed on the basis of its success.
The ALIS programme has recently started to function and pilot projects in the information society field should soon be put into place.
Additionally, we are currently working on the design of a new social initiative by fostering contracts between administrations and the programme aimed at disaster prevention.
Finally, we look forward to working with Member States and coordinating our initiatives with theirs in order to better implement the bi-regional partnership.
By the time the next EU Latin American-Caribbean Summit takes place in Mexico in 2004, I hope we will be pleasantly surprised by how much progress has been made in the six short years since the launch of the strategic partnership in 1999.
Mr President, the results of the Madrid Summit can be read from various points of view.
We could make a subjective assessment, aimed at our political advantage, or we could try to make a balanced assessment which, by taking account of all the positives and negatives, would allow us to examine the results of the Madrid Summit in light of the positions of the European Parliament.
I would particularly like to highlight the fact that the European Parliament was not present at the RÃ­o de Janeiro Summit and that, for this very reason, the Inter-Parliamentary Conference requested that it be present at the Madrid Summit, and that is what has happened.
I would therefore like to acknowledge the efforts of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to receive the representatives of our Parliament at the Madrid Summit.
Mr President, last November, the European Parliament requested that the association agreement with Chile be concluded at the Madrid Summit and that has been done.
Last November, the European Parliament asked that impetus be given to the association agreement with Mercosur despite the difficulties being experienced by Argentina and that was done at the Madrid Summit.
Also in November, Parliament requested the presentation of negotiation guidelines with a view to concluding association agreements with the Andean Community and the Central American Community.
The Madrid Summit has not been able to respond definitively to this wish of Parliament's, but there has been substantial progress in the sense that conclusions include a prospect for association in terms of relations with the countries of the Andean Community and the Central American Community, since they cannot be discriminated against in comparison with other geographical areas, and therefore when the system of generalised preferences expires in 2004 they can aspire to this future association.
In November we also congratulated the European Commission on the ALIS programme, which was adopted at the Madrid Summit, together with other initiatives such as those referred to by the Presidency-in-Office and Mr Vitorino, and we should all be pleased about this.
We also believe the Madrid Summit's conclusions in relation to the International Criminal Court and the fight against terrorism and organised crime to be particularly noteworthy and, in this respect, I would like to remind the House that I have just returned from an electoral mission with other members of this Parliament to Colombia, where there is no question that the citizens of that country have offered a wonderful example of democratic maturity and civic courage, ensuring that the peaceful will of the citizens has prevailed over threats, violence, extortion, intimidation and blackmail.
Mr President, Colombia needs the support of the international community and also the European Union.
Mr President, I would like to make two comments which do not relate to the Madrid Summit, but which I believe are particularly relevant in this context.
I always say that Latin America does not need charity but rather opportunities, but it seems to me a bad political signal, and I have said this to Mr Patten, that in this symbolic year of the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union and Latin America, the Commission has presented a preliminary draft budget for 2003 containing fewer resources than in 2002.
Commissioner, we cannot deal with new priorities with fewer resources.
We hope that during the budgetary debate this Parliament will be able to re-establish the kind of sums that Latin America deserves.
Secondly, Mr President, we believe that the European Union needs to develop a common strategy for the region which, in full accordance with the bilateral or regional agreements in force or under negotiation, can offer a complete geographical perspective to relations with that region.
Finally, Mr President, despite the suspicion and the constant doubt as to whether these summits can achieve concrete results, I believe that the Madrid Summit has achieved complete, tangible and thorough results and that it represents a very reasonable balance between what is desirable and what is possible, between pragmatism and idealism.
Mr President, in order to assess the results of the Madrid Summit we must take good account of the context in which this meeting has taken place, a context of great uncertainty and fragility.
Therefore, in order to make a balanced assessment, we must understand that in the time that has passed between RÃ­o and Madrid not all the hopes raised at the RÃ­o Summit have been fulfilled.
Developments, in particular economic developments, have lessened expectations and I therefore believe that all the participants and observers at the summit can be moderately satisfied with the fact that the summit has taken place within a context of general agreements, of common denominators, and by the fact that we have been able to present an assessment of relations between the European Union and the Latin American and Caribbean countries which contains concrete achievements, association agreements with Mexico and with Chile, the maintenance of the prospect and the will for an association agreement with Mercosur and also the maintenance of a positive outlook in relation to the partnership with the Andean countries and the countries of Central America.
I warned the Council and the Commission during the debate prior to the Madrid meeting of the foreseeable risk that these countries might be disappointed.
I am pleased to acknowledge today that this risk has been successfully prevented, the opening up of a prospect for agreements with the two sub-regions has been maintained, and I hope that this is not a rush forward but a genuinely serious and consistent commitment, because nothing could be worse in this disturbed context than raising expectations and perspectives which are not then met.
Summits are only worth so much.
The important thing is to maintain political momentum and, as Mr Salafranca said a few moments ago, to maintain commitments which must not only be political commitments but practical commitments which are reflected in the budget.
If this is the case, things will move forward.
If not, that person who said at the Madrid Summit that 'we go from summit to summit while our peoples go from abyss to abyss' will unfortunately be proved right.
Mr President, it is important that not only Spaniards take part in this debate.
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the effort to improve relations between the EU and Latin America.
It is incredibly important to develop cooperation further.
We have much in common, not only from an historical perspective but also with a view to the future.
As President Fox said in this Chamber not so long ago, many Latin American countries see the EU as a role model where human rights are concerned.
The attitude to international conventions such as the Kyoto Protocol and to the International War Crimes Tribunal is considerably more constructive in Latin America than in North America.
This is an important alliance to build on.
The fight against organised crime and drugs also requires us to work together to a greater extent.
Much remains to be done in the area of trade.
The EU must open its markets to Latin America, especially when it comes to agriculture.
We are always quick to criticise others for protectionism, often with good reason, but what is our food market if not protectionist?
We Liberals would also like to highlight the issue of Cuba and regret that there was no room for it in Parliament's joint resolution.
We are pleased that a resolution on Cuba was adopted in Geneva.
A significantly stronger commitment is required in this area than is currently the case.
We agree that the US embargo must be lifted.
We need to do more to strengthen the democrats in Cuba, however.
At the moment, the opposition is more coordinated and more willing to enter into discussion than ever before.
The referendum project, the Varela project, is worthy of all our support.
The free libraries play an important role in providing Cubans with literature other than the collected speeches of Fidel Castro.
Cuba is still a dictatorship, but there are democratic forces there which are strong and organised and which desperately need support from the EU and from Latin America.
We must not let them down.
Mr President, I want to highlight a number of disturbing aspects of this summit, which we, by contrast, Commissioner Vitorino, feel really has been a talking shop which was completely closed to the voice of civil society and silent, not least for reasons of diplomatic good form, on the genuinely important issues.
We have already said on many occasions that, for Europe genuinely to be able to play an important role in Latin America, it must say something different from the United States.
However, here too, the only clear deadline set at Madrid was the implementation of the Doha agenda and the negotiation of new free trade agreements.
Therefore, free trade is the only prospect we can give Latin America.
However, as we all know, this too is very often pure rhetoric.
The European Union is not able to provide access to the markets that Latin America would like it to.
In any case, even if we achieve a project with the FTAA which we might call the FTAEU, we really do not feel that it will be possible to avoid very large demonstrations such as those which took place in Madrid.
One hundred thousand people came to Madrid to demonstrate during the summit - we really cannot say that is insignificant!
I would briefly mention some other issues.
With regard to Argentina, for example, the declaration reads: 'We welcome and support the present efforts of the Argentinean authorities to complete a sound and comprehensive economic programme, which shall enable successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ?'
Now, no one can deny that the International Monetary Fund has been one of the main causes of the crisis in Argentina.
What do you think the Argentinians protesting in the streets will say when they read those words?
They will feel deceived and think that the Europeans are cynics as well as the Americans.
Nothing was said about Venezuela and this is clearly a problem.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has already mentioned Cuba.
In other words, we feel that the summit declaration is a list of missing items and missed opportunities.
I am becoming increasingly convinced, however, that the real problem is the type of vehicle we are using - the summits - and that we will not achieve much through these megasummits.
In my opinion, we should rather take up the proposal made by the Commission for a genuine foreign policy and equip ourselves with the tools and resources to give Latin America an alternative to the United States too.
Mr President, I am sorry to say that given the outcome of the summit, we are unable to endorse the positive assessment of it.
We very much regret this. We had indeed hoped the major problems would be dealt with appropriately and appropriate solutions found.
I should first like to list briefly some areas where success seems to have been achieved.
Ratification of the agreement with Chile is one of these.
Confirmation that things are going well as far as the agreement with Mexico is concerned is another. I should also mention the Commission's excellent work on the ALBAN proposal for postgraduates previously mentioned, and of course the standard declaration on the benefits of the association strategy.
There is also, however, a long list of omissions and missed opportunities. I should like to remind you of Mr Salafranca's own report supported by the whole House.
It provided an opportunity to adopt the broadest of approaches to the strategic association between Latin America and Europe, and to take determined action. Unfortunately, this did not come about.
There is a whole raft of very worrying issues, for instance the fact that all the critical points in Latin America seem to fall within what could loosely be described as the dark shadow cast by the United States in the aftermath of 11 September.
Certain aspects of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of America) process are also giving cause for concern.
With regard to Argentina, it should be pointed out that taken together, the European Union countries constitute a majority in the International Monetary Fund. It was within their power to generate quite a different response to the crisis in Argentina.
Over and above all this there is the very worrying situation in Guatemala and in other Central American countries. Freedoms are under attack again.
Once again too, leaders and human rights defenders are being done away with. The European Union has failed to rise to the challenge presented by Venezuela, and it has also missed the opportunity of improving relations with Cuba.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that the situation in Colombia calls for peace and negotiation, not for lists. In a sense, the latter are the exact opposite to what is needed.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to welcome the Madrid agreement reached at the second European Union, Latin America and Caribbean Summit and to welcome the recognition of common values between our two continents.
I have in mind in particular the protection of fundamental rights, economic cooperation, and the fight against terrorism and drugs.
Even if this summit had not achieved any other results, these would be enough to demonstrate that cooperation between the two sides of the Atlantic is a politically credible process, as Commissioner Vitorino has said, which will proceed at a good pace despite the difficulties being experienced by some Latin American countries.
Nevertheless, I wish to strike a note of realism. As with all summits, the objectives set and the means of achieving them are two quite different things.
In this context, I believe that it is crucial to adopt initiatives and concrete actions that will give the objectives agreed upon some real substance.
It is also essential to increase trade and to stimulate investment in both regions by means of a prudent but decisive policy of opening up markets and by resisting the unjustified temptation to resort to protectionism, as President Prodi has also said.
All this presupposes support for private initiatives in the countries of Latin America as a vital element of this twofold strategy of economic development and combating poverty.
Lastly, we should not lose sight of the need to defend and strengthen human rights and to promote democracy in all the countries of the region, without exception, and those words 'without exception' need to be stressed so that we do not overlook the dictatorship in Cuba once again, except for my colleague Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m that is.
Despite the gaps in it, I support the joint motion for a resolution, which is also supported by my own political group, and I am certain that the European Parliament will continue to contribute in the months and years to come, and will continue to devote its attention to this, to developing appropriate conditions for a successful summit to be held in Mexico in 2004.
Mr President, the second EU/Latin-American and Caribbean Summit we are discussing today should be viewed in a positive light by a majority in the House.
There has been progress, and positive signals have certainly been sent out.
Specific agreements such as the association agreement with Chile have been finalised. The latter will result in the most ambitious and innovative free trade area to date, in line with the preferential agreement signed with Mexico two years ago.
Our friends in Mercosur, the Andean Pact, the San JosÃ© Group and the Caribbean should view the agreement with Chile as a further incentive for subregional integration. It is now up to them to make further progress in this respect, through specific actions, not mere words.
The case of Mercosur and the crisis in Argentina are one example of this, but there are others.
Latin American democracies are now more soundly based than they were two decades ago. Nonetheless, their institutional weaknesses must be made good if we are to prevent social imbalance and poverty from afflicting an increasing number of sectors of those societies and destabilising and threatening the democratic institutions.
We ought not and must not rest on our laurels.
We should instead forge ahead bravely as regards cooperation with specific countries and projects. Only a few hours ago, the people of Colombia demonstrated their determination and courage as citizens.
They came out in favour of peace and coexistence.
Sadly, however, terrorists continue to kill, kidnap and blackmail the people of that country and of Peru and Venezuela, whilst we continue to debate whether or not to include those who murder, kidnap or blackmail on the list of terrorist organisations. We are setting a disgraceful example of the use of double standards.
I should like to point out to the Commission's representative that the management of our development aid is not up to standard.
Funding for projects we have committed to arrives late and sometimes badly.
Well-founded complaints are received daily, together with examples that do nothing to enhance the Union's reputation.
Still more unfortunately, development aid is being withheld from large sectors of the population that simply cannot afford to be deprived of its benefits.
Mr President, may I say to the President-in-Office that he should not be deceived by the number of empty seats in the House.
We have a great deal of interest in Latin America.
Perhaps we are behaving like a semi-conductor.
Sometimes, the more empty positions, the higher the standard.
Maybe that also applies to Parliament.
I should like to join with Mr FernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­n in asking the Commission to speed up the implementation of projects.
When we parliamentarians visit Latin America, the response to our proposals is always, yes, you make excellent proposals, you decide to give us money, but the money never comes.
The credibility of the European Union does not depend on a to-do list, but on whether or not we keep our promises.
So my request - and I assume I speak here for the whole House - is that the projects be implemented. That the money we budget be disbursed.
Thirdly, and this comment is addressed to the Latin Americans with us now, the more Latin America joins forces, the more Mercosur and the Andes countries and the whole of Latin America joins forces, the more clout they will have in negotiations with the European Union and other countries.
Take a leaf - and this really is meant as well-intentioned advice - out of the European Union's book in this case.
The problem for us in negotiations with Mercosur and other regions is that we have to listen to several, rather than one voice.
And, whether we like it or not, it slows down the negotiating process.
I personally am not involved in negotiations, but several people have told me as much.
It would be better if you were to speak with one voice.
I should also like to say how delighted I was with the Mercosur-Europe Business Forum which was held in parallel in Madrid. This is the third time this forum of companies, associations and politicians from Mercosur and Europe has been staged.
We need economic and technical dialogue between Europe and Latin America similar to our dialogue with the United States.
Perhaps the Commission could make a contribution here too.
My last comment is that there are numerous problems, but there are also opportunities waiting to be exploited.
In Parliament, we are currently processing several directives which will offer trading opportunities: a directive on biofuels - where we can offer them new markets - and a directive on CO2 emissions trading in the wake of the Kyoto agreement.
This too offers new opportunities for collaboration, to Latin America's advantage.
All this deserves to be discussed.
Mr President, I support this resolution by the PPE-DE, PSE, Liberals and the UEN.
I see it as a particularly good thing that, at the start of the joint resolutions, we are emphasising the values which Europe and Latin America share, as it is important that we see this partnership not only in an economic light, but that we can also speak of our common values and their consequences in political terms.
I believe that certain elements which the Greens have tried to introduce are also positive - for example, that we should have more to say about sustainability.
Overall, though, the Greens' resolution, and that of the UEN, are too negative, with their opposition to the USA, to globalisation, and to free trade, which I do not think gets us very far.
We need here a balanced relationship between constructive cooperation and justified criticism of details.
I expressly support what Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra had to say about the Budget.
Nothing is achieved by much talking and putting on great summits and at the same time allocating less money.
That is what the Commission has proposed over and over again in the last few years.
Over and over again, we have prevented it, but the Commission really should, for once, come up with constructive proposals at the outset.
Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m and Mr QueirÃ³ had a certain amount to say about Cuba.
I believe it to be of the utmost importance that we should avoid sending the wrong signals to Cuba at the present time when people there are calling loud and clear for democracy.
We are of course opposed to the embargo, but we also oppose dictatorship and the violation of human rights.
That is why dialogue with the European Union can gain Cuba concessions only if the situation there as regards democracy and human rights improves.
I would like to conclude with the suggestion that, in opening up markets, we should focus above all on the poorer countries of Latin America.
I believe we can agree on mutual free trade with both Mexico and Chile, but perhaps not with the same timetable, but with countries such as Nicaragua, Honduras and Bolivia, we should also prioritise unilateral preferences, and I believe that these countries have the same right to preferential treatment as most of the ACP states.
I think the dialogue should give more attention to that.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Presidency's desire to make a particular mark and send a signal of solidarity and political rapprochement by holding the Latin American and Caribbean Summit in Madrid is something to be welcomed.
It ties in with Spain's unique involvement in Latin America, which results not only from its history but also from major economic interests.
When Latin America sneezes, Spain catches a cold, or so I read recently.
There is of course a good deal more underlying this summit.
Linking the two continents is, as President Prodi has put it, a matter of European concern.
There is of course far too little public attention paid in Europe to the political upheavals and economic crises in the region.
Very often, we are surprised when a country as rich in crude oil as Venezuela slides into a crisis which is grave not only for that country's economy but also for its democracy.
We seem to have grown accustomed to Argentina collapsing, and the international capital markets go more in fear of Japan's possible economic downfall than of Argentina's economy going bust.
Again and again, though, we put our hopes in a new beginning for democracy, as we have done now in the aftermath of the elections in Columbia, a country which is a prime example of how closely combined are drug crime and international terrorism.
It is for our Parliament in particular to demand energetically that the Colombian politician Ingrid Betancour be released from the hands of left-wing guerrillas.
At the end of the day, the EU has to give life to Latin America's strategy, which, as Mr Salafranca SÃ¡nchez-Neyra said, means making available the financial resources to do it.
In real terms, that also means the establishment of a free trade area comprising the EU and the central American and Andean States, which should eventually lead to an association agreement comparable to those with Mexico and Chile.
Negotiations on an agreement of this sort with the Mercosur countries have unfortunately taken their place.
The European Union should not just leave the Latin American market to the USA.
Any Latin American strategy is about much more than economic interests, and we need it also to combat organised crime and illegal immigration.
The final measure of what will have been achieved will be the EU-Latin America in Mexico in 2004.
Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has enjoyed the support of this House and coordination with the Commission throughout the preparation for the second EU/Latin American and Caribbean Summit, and throughout the summit itself. Parliament was properly represented at the summit sessions and during the preparatory work.
Its constant support has proved most useful.
I believe everything we have heard in this debate confirms my impression and this process. True, shortcomings have been identified, and we could all have hoped to achieve more, make faster progress, and for the outcome to be more meaningful.
It is always possible to expect more from a process. I do however honestly believe that any assessment of the summit has to acknowledge that its results have been satisfactory.
This is substantiated by media reports in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and also through direct contacts with political leaders in Latin American countries. In particular, the summit is deemed to have developed political, economic and cultural dialogue between two parts of the world called upon to establish closer links and understand each other better.
I believe the European Parliament has been at the forefront of these negotiations and has served as a touchstone. A number of speakers have already made this clear.
It is from your viewpoint as trailblazers that some of you have pointed critically to areas in which you feel frustrated, because we have not made as much progress or achieved as much as we could have hoped and could probably have attained. Our experience within the European Union has however taught us that processes of this nature, such as the one we are ourselves engaged in on our continent, do take time.
They involve very many procedures.
Progress can be fast, but there are occasions when setbacks are experienced. I have to say quite frankly though, that if we review the relationship between Latin America and the European Union in recent years, taking into account that the Madrid Summit was only the second of its kind, we can appreciate that this is a relatively new process.
A date has already been set, however, for the third summit, in Mexico, which will take place in two years' time. Consequently the interval between summits is now shorter, and we can assume the relationship has become established.
I agree that a great many meetings and significant public ceremonies are crammed into the day or day and a half a summit lasts. It is however important not to overlook the preparatory work which begins long before a summit.
In this case, the work was triggered by Parliament and pursued determinedly by the Commission. The Swedish and Belgian Presidencies were very involved with the groundwork for matters that would be dealt with during the Spanish Presidency.
I honestly believe that the result is positive and that we can congratulate ourselves.
Mr Salafranca mentioned Colombia, and rightly so.
I believe it is very important to keep Colombia in mind.
This country has endured more than its fair share of crime and violence, but has now elected a new government democratically. The incoming government deserves the same trust and support from the international community, and in particular from the European Union, which has long been involved in peace and development in Columbia, as it has had from the Colombian people.
Speaking as a Spaniard, I endorse what several honourable Members said, namely that it is good to have non-Spaniards involved with Latin America. In this connection, I very much welcome the Commission's ALBAN programme.
It promises to be of great benefit as it opens up all European universities to postgraduate students. In the past, such students were channelled to the United States, or sometimes to Spain, because a strong bilateral programme was in place.
I believe it is very important for postgraduate students across Latin America and the Caribbean to be able to choose what they consider to be the most reputable and appropriate university or higher education institution in which to pursue their studies.
In this way, the relationship between our regions will be strengthened still further.
The relationship is not merely a political one, centred on the Madrid Summit. After all, a summit only involves Heads of State and of Government.
It should be borne in mind that before, during, and even after the summit, a great many meetings involving what could broadly be termed civil society took place. Relationships were created and reliable channels of information established to allow information to flow freely between the Commission, the Presidency of the Council and authorities in the Latin American countries.
It is only right today to commend all the work underpinning what was approved at the summit. It was excellent work involving many individuals.
As is usual at such Councils, issues were approved in a few hours. One should however remember that they were previously the subject of lengthy discussion.
In conclusion, Mr President, it is my view that the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean have strengthened their political, economic, cultural, educational and social links.
The European Union is currently engaged in a process of internal consolidation. Nonetheless, it, as a world player, is called upon to be actively involved in a part of the world with which it shares so many principles and values.
What took place after 1492 was the grafting of a European element on to a pre-existing reality. This resulted in what we term the Western world.
The centre of gravity shifted westwards.
We share principles and values we had developed here. Nowadays they are enshrined in expressions such as democracy, the rule of law, gender equality and respect for human rights.
The situation is precarious in some cases, and continual monitoring and support are needed. Nonetheless, the European Union is a lodestar for Latin America and for the Caribbean.
It serves as a social model, an economic model, a political model, and also as a model of integration.
We could point to the successful integration of the European Union, located on a far more heterogeneous and diverse continent, and faced with the challenge of so many European languages.
Our challenge was far greater than that facing Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite all this, European Union integration has been a resounding success.
It can be an example for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean and I think it is incumbent on us to help them rise to this challenge.
A strengthened relationship will be in our mutual interest.
We have no wish to act against any other party. Instead, as Mr Linkohr stated, we hope to exploit opportunities in areas where we are currently facing difficulties and uncertainties.
Mr President, the Presidency-in-Office is pleased with the debate generated. In addition, the Presidency is grateful for Parliament's unfailing encouragement and would like to acknowledge publicly the support and inspiration this House has always offered.
As we conclude this debate I should like to say that, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received five motions for resolutions
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs:
A5-0168/2002 by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain with a view to the adoption of a Council decision on the setting-up of a network of contact points of national authorities responsible for private security (5135/2002 - C5-0052/2002 - 2002/0802(CNS));
A5-0166/2002 by Mr Sousa Pinto, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain establishing a European Institute of Police Studies (5133/2002 - C5-0055/2002 - 2002/0803(CNS));
A5-0167/2002 by the Earl of Stockton, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain setting up a European network for the protection of public figures (5361/2002 - C5-0051/2002 - 2002/0801(CNS));
A5-0173/2002 by Mr Deprez, on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Act drawing up a Protocol amending the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office (Europol Convention), the Protocol on the interpretation, by way of preliminary rulings by the Court of Justice of the European Communities of the Convention on the establishment of a European Police Office and the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol, the members of its organs, the deputy directors and the employees of Europol (5455/2002 - C5-0053/2002 - 2002/0804(CNS)); and on the Recommendation of the European Parliament to the Council on the future development of Europol and its automatic incorporation into the institutional system of the European Union;
A5-0165/2002 by Mr Deprez, on the initiative by the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff. (14628/2001 - C5-0682/2001 - 2001/0830(CNS)).
Mr President, policing is one of the key functions of modern states. An important part of policing involves guaranteeing the safety of citizens as a fundamental principle of living together in freedom.
The dramatic increase in the range of activities within contemporary societies has however led to a need for additional security and control services for goods and persons. These may be provided by either natural or by legal persons.
It has proved necessary for states to respond to this situation and find a way of integrating private security operationally into the monopoly rightly held by the state, given that this is a complementary activity which comes under the public security service.
The Member States of the European Union have adopted a series of legislative measures to establish administrative controls.
These differ from state to state. Freedom, security and justice must be guaranteed by the states.
It is for each one to guarantee the safety of its citizens.
With this in mind, the creation of a single market and the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice are bound to mean that it is necessary to harmonise private security services within the European Union.
This is no easy task, however.
Research has shown that a number of obstacles must be overcome.
Firstly, national legislation in this field varies considerably.
Secondly, there are significant legal barriers between Member States restricting or preventing the free provision of services in the private security sector.
Thirdly, essential features of the various national regulations pertaining to the sector must be harmonised.
These therefore are the problems making it imperative for the Member States of the European Union to harmonise their legislation regarding the private security sector. Only then will the free provision of services across a European area of freedom, security and justice be possible.
That said, I am bound to request the House to support the report of the Committee on Freedoms in tomorrow's vote.
The report calls on the Council to withdraw the initiative in question. This is not because it is inappropriate, but because the legal form chosen is a decision, and also because of the legal basis chosen by the current Spanish Presidency to regulate the matter.
That basis is Article 29(a) and Article 30(1) of the Treaty of the European Union. Both Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and I myself at the Committee on Freedoms have already stated the need to establish whether the activity to be regulated under the draft initiative presented by Spain is within the competence of the Community or that of the Union.
In this connection, I should like to draw your attention to three rulings by the Court of Justice against Spain, Belgium and Italy, on the grounds that they had retained in their legislation a number of conditions relating to the provision of services in the private security industry. This contravened the principle of non-discrimination provided for in the Treaty of the European Union.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am against the provision of private security services being part of a public service.
The Court of Justice has ruled to this effect also. Consequently, as regards the free movement of workers, the exception concerning posts in the public services Article 39(4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community does not apply.
Accordingly, I believe that the activities of private security services do not amount to exercising official authority. It is my view that when such services act in support of the public security services they do so merely in an auxiliary capacity.
I must stress also that the private security sector is an economic activity, as the Court of Justice has confirmed. All legislative arrangements governing its activity in the Member States must therefore be subject to the Community's provisions aimed at establishing a single market and eliminating internal borders within the Union.
It should also be pointed out that to date, the Community has not adopted a directive aimed at regulating the private security sector.
Nonetheless, this should not present an obstacle to future harmonisation of this sector.
As rapporteur, I am therefore of the view that if the present draft decision were adopted, it would contravene Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union. The latter requires the Union to respect the Community's competence to act within the scope granted to it under the Treaty establishing the European Community, and prevents the Union from legislating within that scope.
The initiative is certainly pertinent and worthwhile.
Nonetheless, for the reasons cited, I propose that its content be reconsidered. I further propose that pursuant to Article 208 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Council should request the Commission to undertake a study of what should be involved in a common action in the sector of legal or natural persons providing private security services.
If appropriate, the adoption of the necessary provisions should be proposed.
Mr President, I therefore propose that the draft decision submitted by the Kingdom of Spain be rejected. It is not legally possible to regulate what falls within the scope of the first pillar of the Treaty establishing the European Community from the scope of application of the third pillar, regulated by the Treaty of the European Union.
To do so would run counter to Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union, amongst others.
Mr President, I shall surpass your most optimistic expectations as regards time keeping by saying that the subject of this report is the establishment of a European Institute of Police Studies which would essentially consist at the outset of setting up a network bringing together the various national police training and research bodies and which would subsequently develop in a way not specified by those proposing it with a view to offering added value to the European Union in coordinating the various police agencies in the Member States.
As we see it, this initiative is a victim of one of the teething troubles of the building of Europe, which is a tendency for bodies with more or less overlapping aims to proliferate.
In this particular field we already have Europol, Eurojust, the European Police College, the operational Task Force of European Police Chiefs, the European crime prevention network and the European criminal law network.
So this proposal, as presented to us, suggests an increasing lack of rationality and a growing incoherence of systems in a field of Community action which is in its infancy.
It may well be that certain commendable objectives which deserve to be addressed and on which we should consider coordination and experience sharing by the police, and which have been touched upon by the Presidency, would be better served by amending the statutes and regulations of the European Police College, given that, if Spain were to fully participate in that mechanism that would also give an important boost to the coordination of police agencies.
It is important to identify what the new features are that would really bring added value and really represent gains in efficiency for the system, making it more coherent, setting aside changes that would result in a wasteful duplication of agencies, officials and costs, reflecting a certain bureaucratic tradition which does not serve our interests and which will not really assist EU action on crime.
For these reasons, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs agreed to deliver a negative opinion in plenary on the adoption of this initiative.
Mr President, this is a third and, I believe also slightly unnecessary, proposal that has come from the Kingdom of Spain.
It seeks to institutionalise the provision of protection for public figures.
The protection of public figures is, by definition, something which should be arranged between the Member States, or other states, and in the case of visitors, between the visiting state and the host state.
I found it quite odd that there also it was based only on Article 29 of the Treaty of the European Union when it seems to me that both Articles 30(1) and 34(2)(c) needed to be added.
However, there is the germ of a good idea here.
So I have taken the proposal and amended it in such a way as to facilitate cooperation between national intelligence, police and security services without setting up a bureaucratic institution and with no further cost.
One of the problems that I had with the proposal initially, was that it seemed to want to codify or create a tariff of protection.
Therefore, someone like yourself, Mr President, of supreme importance in the affairs of the European Union, would no doubt have been provided with two armoured cars filled to the gunnels with armed policemen with machine-guns, whereas a mere humble back-bencher like myself would be lucky to see one policeman walk past his house every other day.
This struck me as being a slightly odd idea because, if nothing else, it would provide an absolutely perfect guide to a would-be assassin, as to what he was likely to come up against.
So I removed all that.
However, there is, as I still say, the essential point and what I have added to it is that there should be cooperation and some kind of harmonisation, not only of the protection that is afforded, but the response mechanism in the event of such a tragedy, or an attempt being made.
There are a number of institutions ranging from the SAS in Britain through the German border guards, the excellent military police in Spain and Italy and other countries, who, since the tragic events of the Munich Olympics, have acquired a great expertise in the response.
It seemed to me madness to leave the response element of this problem out of the question.
On the issue of shared information, I think that the information should be shared on a need-to-know basis and, above all, should be kept away from politicians, bureaucrats and even the people who are being protected themselves, because operational security in this area must be paramount.
Nor should there be any extra levels of decision-making that could interfere with operational effectiveness.
Knowing how long it sometimes takes for all the institutions of the Union to arrive at a decision, the thought of introducing another tier between the attempt on your life, Mr President, and the response by the policeman, and it would have to pass through several committees, I hope sends a shiver down your back.
Finally, the other important thing that I have added is that any sharing of information must be subject to the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This is an area in which information would be shared on known threats, known possible suspects but, nevertheless, we have to make absolutely certain that fundamental rights are maintained.
That said, I hope that the House will be sufficiently impressed to know that my amendments were the only ones that went before the Committee.
They were passed unanimously without any votes against, which I understand may be a rare if not unique event.
Mr Stockton, thank you very much for your kind remarks concerning the importance of the acting president but I must say I have a shotgun in my house and this will be quite enough.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to reassure you that I will not need the full ten minutes that have been allocated to me.
Mr President, the two reports that I have the honour of presenting to our Assembly today are very different in scope and nature even though they both deal with the same subject, namely Europol which, as we all know, is the European Police Office.
The first report was drawn up on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium, and relates to the adjusting of the basic salary and allowances of Europol staff.
The scope of the report is very limited and it obviously does not require very lengthy comment.
Quite simply, I formally call on Parliament to reject this initiative for two fundamental reasons.
First of all, I do not see why - and I hope that Parliament will support me on this point - Europol staff should be given a salary increase of 5.2% for the period 1 July 2001 to 1 July 2002, when, over the same period, European Union officials based in the Netherlands - in the same city of The Hague - will receive an increase in their salary and allowances of 4.3%.
No serious or credible justification for this increase has been given.
Secondly, I think it is inconsistent and unacceptable for the Council to consult the European Parliament on such a routine issue, when it systematically refuses to do so on the Europol budget, despite the fact that both decisions fall under the procedure laid down in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union which stipulates that the European Parliament must be consulted.
I therefore have no hesitation and no qualms in proposing that this initiative be rejected.
The second report, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, deals with a different matter altogether.
It has been drawn up on the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Spain and proposes, in addition to a necessary change to Europol's tasks, a new mechanism to amend the Europol Convention.
As things currently stand, ladies and gentlemen, Europol is, as you know, an institution which comes under the umbrella of inter-governmental cooperation pure and simple.
Within this framework, any change, however important or however urgent, to the Europol Convention requires ratification by all the Member States in accordance with the requirements of their respective constitutional rules.
In other words, for example, it took no less than three good long years to ratify the Europol Convention.
This procedure, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is obviously too lengthy, too slow and totally inadequate if we want Europol to have the capacity to take swift action against the manifold forms of serious crime.
The initiative of the Kingdoms of Belgium and Spain, which proposes that the Council should from now on adopt further amendments to the Europol Convention, seems to be a step in the right direction.
In reality, in my opinion and the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, this initiative has three major shortcomings:
1. it restricts Europol, in law, within the ambit of simple intergovernmental cooperation, contrary to the express requests repeatedly submitted by the European Parliament and at a time when the European Council, at nearly all its meetings, is entrusting to Europol an increasing number of tasks to be carried out on behalf of the Union;
2. after enlargement of the Union, this decision may well cause excessive slowness, or even result in an impasse, in the decision-making procedure, given that the Convention stipulates and will continue to stipulate that all decisions relating to Europol must be taken by the Council acting unanimously.
I ask my fellow Members how they think 27 Member States will be able to agree unanimously on operational police decisions, with crime levels as they stand in Europe and with serious crime spiralling out of control in certain sectors;
3. this proposal confirms the purely marginal role to be played by the European Parliament with regard to everything relating to Europol, while depriving it of the legal means and institutional framework which might enable it in the future to exercise genuine democratic control.
I hope there are no objections regarding the fact that, thanks to the Convention, the national parliaments can now exert a degree of democratic control over Europol.
Anyone who is familiar with the way Europol works and the way in which the national parliaments work is well aware that, at the moment, there is no proper or effective democratic control over Europol.
The Council's choice to propose a mechanism which possesses the major shortcomings that I have just mentioned is all the more incomprehensible, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since the Treaty provides for an alternative route which would provide a simple solution to the problems that I have just outlined.
All we need to do is to use the provision which is formally enshrined in Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union as this would enable the Council to simply replace the Europol Convention with a decision.
The use of this provision would have the direct effect of integrating Europol into the third pillar and, consequently, into Community legal order, with the following three considerable advantages in the short term:
1. the improvement of Europol's operational capacities, since, pursuant to Article 34 of the EU Treaty, all decisions relating to Europol are to be adopted by the Council acting by a qualified majority with no derogation possible;
2. the improvement of parliamentary scrutiny of Europol, since, pursuant to Article 39 of the EU Treaty, the European Parliament should be consulted before the Council adopts any implementing measures and, secondly, Parliament may bring an action before the Court of Justice should these rights not be respected;
3. the automatic application of the rules governing the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to all the decisions adopted by the Council pursuant to Article 34 of the EU Treaty, something that Parliament has constantly called for.
On the basis of this argument, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I call on the House to reject the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Kingdom of Spain, due to its lack of operational and democratic substance. It is a bad day for the Kingdom of Spain!
I also call on the House to approve the draft recommendation which seeks to transform the Europol Convention into a Council decision and to thus incorporate it into the institutional system of the European Union. I would like to point out to Mrs Frassoni in particular that, as far as I am concerned, this operation must only be a transitional phase, and preferably a short one at that, before integral communitarisation takes place, in other words, before the treaties are merged and the paralysing and archaic distinction between the three pillars is abolished.
I hope that, in this area, the Convention will live up to the historical challenges that lie ahead and the expectations of the citizens.
Mr President, I shall restrict my comments to the initiative concerning basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff. I was responsible for this as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets.
This might appear to be a minor issue, almost a routine matter.
As currently presented, however, it lacks the necessary rigour.
Parliament already ruled on the appropriateness of including the Europol budget in the Community budget when called to do so in the past.
Europol has indeed broadened the scope of its competence in recent years. This process has not, however, been accompanied by a change in its legal framework.
Parliament has therefore been unable to exercise its function of democratic control. The decision on salary adjustment must be included in the scope of the budget.
It so happens that this area, which does of course include the financial Rules, operates without Parliament having to rule on such matters. This is the background against which we have been consulted on the adjustment of salaries and allowances, pursuant to Article 44 of the present Convention.
As Mr Deprez has already pointed out, the decision does not give the reason why the salary adjustment was set at 5.2%. The salary adjustment for Community officials in the Netherlands for the same period was 4.3%.
This figure was based on statistics supplied by the OECD for all Community institutions.
True, Article 44 of the Convention does not link adjustment to a procedure similar to that applied to other officials. Nonetheless I believe such lack of justification is not in line with the principles of sound financial management applicable to the Community budget.
This initiative has therefore been rejected because of the lack of justification provided in the procedure adopted. The salary level of Europol officials is not at issue.
Mr President, we trust Europol will be strengthened and that it will fulfil its duties efficiently so that the citizens feel protected. This is all perfectly compatible however with the democratic control the House always insists on when the legal status of this instrument for police cooperation is debated.
Mr President, I would like to thank the House for being able to address them at this point in the debate as I will have to leave for Rome to participate in the launch of a feasibility study on the external border guard.
So let us say that I am allowed to speak because I have to leave for the front.
The five initiatives that were presented by the Member States have different scope but all relate to police cooperation.
I will start with the initiatives concerning Europol.
The first one, initiated by Belgium, aims to adjust the basic salaries and allowances of Europol staff.
It is a formality since it results from the application of the Europol Regulation and the Commission has nothing against such an initiative.
Concerning the second initiative of Belgium and Spain for a Council act drawing up a protocol amending the Europol Convention, this is a significant step to implement the provisions regarding Europol as laid down in Article 30(2) of the Treaty of the European Union, which, as you know, foresees Europol's participation in joint teams and the possibility to ask Member States to conduct and coordinate investigations.
It also directly follows up to the Tampere Conclusions 43 and 45 on the subject.
The Commission is therefore pleased that the Justice and Home Affairs Council of last April arrived at a political agreement on this part of the initiative while awaiting the opinion of Parliament.
Regarding the part of the initiative on the simplification of the procedure for amending the Europol Convention, the Council is currently considering two different alternatives.
The Commission's firm opinion, and there I follow Mr Deprez' arguments, is that the Europol Convention should be replaced by a Council decision pursuant to Article 34(2)(c) of the Treaty of the European Union.
On this point, the Commission fully agrees on the draft recommendations of Parliament on the future development of Europol and its formal integration into the institutional framework of the Union as introduced by Mr Deprez' report.
A Council decision will not only allow the amendment of articles of the convention through a simplified procedure but also the adoption of implementing measures with a qualified majority in accordance with Article 34(2).
If Europol were to be established today, it would probably be based on a Council decision, this being the modern legal instrument.
Furthermore, the legal basis of Europol will then be in line with the one chosen for Eurojust.
Finally, a Council decision would bring the role of the Court of Justice into line with that which has been provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty.
I will now comment on the draft recommendation.
We are in full agreement with Recommendation No 6 on the cooperation with Eurojust and OLAF and with almost all of No 4 of the Recommendation regarding democratic control.
Regarding the latter, I am pleased that Parliament agrees with what the Commission proposed in the communication that we have launched on the democratic control of Europol.
We have some misgivings with the proposal to have representatives of Parliament on Europol's management board.
I believe there are alternative forms of parliamentary control that are more appropriate to the specific nature of Europol.
Concerning Recommendation No 2 on the budget, the Commission feels, as it has explained in the communication that I have mentioned above, that the question of Community financing should be settled in the context of Europol's possible future operational competences.
As regards Recommendation No 3, the tasks, we can agree with everything except the first two points: participation in joint teams and asking Member States to open investigations.
From a Commission perspective, these latter two points are superfluous since the Council arrived at political agreement on them last April.
As regards the three initiatives submitted by the Spanish Presidency, I would like to express to the Spanish Presidency the Commission's gratitude for putting this subject on the agenda as they meet a real need for progress in police cooperation in the European Union.
With respect to police studies, the Commission has on different occasions underlined its interest in advancing cooperation in an area in which knowledge at European level is often insufficient.
At the same time, however, we have warned against a multiplication of networks, the functioning of which, according to the experience gained the European Police College may prove difficult.
The Commission has, therefore, suggested a more pragmatic formula proposing to amend the Council Decision of 22 December 2000 creating the European Police College to allow the police studies institutes of the Member States, where these institutes are separate from police training institutions, to participate as full members of the European Police College network.
I am pleased that this suggestion, which is very much in line with the suggestion of Mr Sousa Pinto, has found an echo in a number of Member States and now seems to be the most favoured option in the Council.
Regarding the initiative for a Council decision setting up a network of contact points for national authorities with responsibility for private security, the Commission agrees that the growth of the private security sector in our countries, as well as in the candidate countries, requires a general policy discussion about division of responsibility between the public authorities and the private sector in providing security to our citizens.
However, as much we would like to see a serious policy discussion taking place at European Union level on this subject, we must totally respect the division of competences established by the Treaties.
The Commission has pointed out on several occasions that even though it would be positive to establish contacts between the responsible authorities dealing with private security in the Member States, it should be underlined that, according to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, private security is a service as any other service.
As such it falls within the remit of the European Community, as Mrs Cerdeira Morterero has just emphasised, and creating a network based on Title 6 would violate Article 47 of the Treaty of the European Union, which states that "Nothing in this Treaty shall affect the Treaties establishing the European Communities or the subsequent Treaties and Acts modifying or supplementing them".
The Commission has therefore taken the necessary steps to proceed within the context of the first pillar to a study of the need for common measures to regulate the provision of security services by private providers in the European Union.
In addition, the Commission would like to reiterate its argument on the inconvenience of creating another network with the administrative and budgetary consequences this implies.
Finally, concerning the proposal to set up a network for the protection of public figures, the Commission welcomes this initiative which identifies an area where the need for strengthened cooperation in the European Union has become evident.
Although we must question the basic convenience of creating yet another network, it seems obvious that this initiative responds to a real need confirmed by experts in the field.
An important point made by the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, and shared by the Commission, is that the network should not be competent to harmonise Member States legislation and regulations.
The network should have no power of decision but should only function as an advisory body and should have not budgetary implications.
There is only one caveat to the support by the Commission for this initiative and this is linked to the question of the Commission's participation in the network: we should be more involved.
In conclusion, I would like thank the rapporteur, Lord Stockton, whose work is a valuable contribution to this initiative as regards its legal basis but also as regards the added value this network will bring to police cooperation.
Thank you very much, Commissioner.
Have a good flight and kiss the soil when you land.
Mr President, my good friend and colleague Mr Deprez has overlooked the fact that today is not a particularly good day for Belgium either.
My group's position is in line with the conclusions of the Cerdeira and Sousa Pinto reports, insofar as we believe private security companies must be regulated at Community level. Given the size and activity of the sector across the Union, its activity should be regulated, as is recognised by Mrs Cerdeira Morterero in her report.
I do however admit the validity of the arguments put forward in favour of reconsidering the initiative given the need to adjust it to its legal basis.
With regard to setting up a European Institute of Police Studies, this ought surely to come within the scope of the European Police Academy, precisely because we should avoid creating a multiplicity of rival bodies.
Both these initiatives do nonetheless demonstrate the Spanish Presidency's emphasis on and commitment to achieving maximum efficiency from bodies established to guarantee the safety of the citizens of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, European public opinion is becoming increasingly concerned not only about the rise in delinquency, but also about the increasing tendency to resort to street violence.
All too often, mass events such as football matches or public demonstrations turn into pitched battles resulting in the destruction of street furniture and sometimes in personal injury. The demonstration may start out as legitimate and peaceful like those organised by anti-globalisation movements, but then things go wrong.
The average citizen will not venture into certain areas of our big cities after dusk.
The citizens are clearly concerned about the present lack of security and unhappy with the situation.
This is why private security companies are flourishing and need to be regulated at European level.
More thought should also be given to the relationship between public and private security.
It does seem as if those who can pay for their security can be sure of it, and those who are not in a position to do so are at greater risk.
In other words, those who have the money can buy the security the state is unable to guarantee.
I do therefore believe that the issue should be dealt with in greater depth.
Furthermore, street violence, cyber crime and child pornography are all new offences and involve a significant psychological element. This may possibly result from the dynamism and hyper development of a society with a great capacity for the transmission of information and communication, in which values such as safety, justice and urban peace have been sidelined in favour of misconstrued notions of modernism and progress.
Coordinated police action is required if we are to rise to the challenges posed by these developments at European level, together with the swift implementation of initiatives designed to overcome them, such as the one before us today.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first, and on behalf of my group, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, for the excellent report he has produced on Europol.
We talk a very great deal about this topic here in Parliament, and I believe we are agreed that Europol is an important department and one that it is right and proper that the European Union should have.
It creates greater security for the public and can help us to contain cross-border forms of crime.
To guarantee that, we need good staff, who of course cost money.
On that much we can agree.
It is therefore somewhat painful for us to have to make clear our present position on the issue of employees' salaries.
It really does sadden me that we at present have to resort to sanctions when it comes to officials' salaries.
We do not actually want to get into a row with officials, and would much rather deal with the Council, but that is how things are at the moment with Parliament.
The question has been put to us, and this is our answer.
We demand that structures be set up to facilitate the control of Europol by Parliament.
This is something that the Council, in the long term, cannot ignore.
To the Council, I say that its conduct in this matter will determine the extent to which the great majority in Parliament will cooperate with it.
My group sees the strengthening of Parliament as one of the most important aspects of a future stable Europe.
The success of enlargement is also dependent on Europe becoming more parliamentary.
This is true in all areas, including internal affairs policy and internal security.
We want not only to have co-decision when it comes to money; we want the shaping of internal affairs policy to start with Parliament, and budgetary law is part of that.
Let me remind you, in this context, that we have hitherto been highly cooperative.
The Council's post-11 September measures have our full support.
We gave our full agreement to terrorism being combated without delay.
Being convinced that it was right to do so, we also did not hesitate to join in drawing up lists of persons and groups whose assets were to be frozen.
We have added essential aspects of counter-terrorism to our agenda, and that has been in cooperation with the Council and the Commission.
Having given our full support, we now, though, expect the Council to make its move.
We have conceded something in advance.
It is now for the Council to meet us halfway.
Until that happens, we will support our rapporteur Mr Deprez' proposal that the Belgian and Spanish initiative on Europol be rejected, and will hope that Europol's officials will be able to understand why we do so.
My group will support you, Mr Deprez, on the first two issues, the initiatives of the Council, but unfortunately not on the recommendation.
We believe that it is risky to recommend something new without having a democratic safety belt and we believe that it is rather dangerous to support the idea that it is possible to have a majority in the Council without having co-decision as well.
Furthermore, experience in Europe demonstrates very clearly that the principle of 'provisionally definitive' and 'definitively provisional' is certainly in use here too, in the European Union.
Mr President, the European Convention has been meeting in this building since February, and in its sittings, the European institutions' lack of transparency, deficient openness to the public and inadequate democratic control have repeatedly, and rightly, been decried.
None of this, though, seemed to have anything to do with Europol, an office whose tasks are decided on by the governments among themselves rather than by a majority in the Council, which is, by the way, itself not exactly the epitome of transparency and democracy.
We, Europe's Parliament, are utterly excluded from any control or co-decision, and that is why I will say quite clearly, here and now, that it is a continuing scandal that the Member States' governments refuse to change this.
Whilst democratic influence and control have been left out in the cold, though, Europol's competences have been extended, step by step, since 1998.
Money-laundering and counter-terrorism were the watchwords when this was given renewed impetus in the aftermath of 11 September.
Europol's functions are about to be extended again.
It is already engaged in active preparations for enlargement.
According to newspaper reports, new buildings have now been occupied at the Office's headquarters, and the first liaison officers from the candidate countries, for example Poland, have taken up their duties.
All these breathtaking changes are taking place without Parliament being granted even the slightest opportunity to obtain information and exercise control.
It is unable either to demand a debate on the Office's annual report, or to summon its director before the competent Parliamentary committee.
Parliament is not even accorded the right to send two representatives to its Board of Management.
As directly elected delegates, we are left to rely on newspapers for our information, and that, Mr Deprez, is why my group supports your call for the Belgian and Spanish initiative to be rejected.
Mr President, the two reports by Mr Deprez on Europol provide an opportunity for the European Parliament to demand that it be given responsibilities for control over this body.
In February, Parliament was given quite strong support by the Commission on this issue.
In its communication entitled 'Democratic Control over Europol', the Commission proposes to strengthen the European Parliament's powers of control, but at the same time creates a diversion by referring to the creation of a joint committee consisting of members of the European Parliament and the national parliaments, an appealing reform by all appearances, but one that is in fact meaningless, since the proposed joint committee would have no power.
In our view, in order to achieve coherence, the control of European police cooperation, such as that of national police forces, must instead be granted to the national parliaments.
This control might well be organised under the inter-parliamentary pillar, the creation of which was proposed by the cross-party group SOS DÃ©mocratie to the Convention that is currently considering the future of the Union.
I shall return to this point, Mr President, in my explanation of vote.
Mr President, here we are today discussing five initiatives from the Member States, and the Council is again conspicuous by its absence.
These initiatives may well be a good thing in themselves, but they are increasingly creating problems for us. The problems arise because they are founded on a legal basis which often turns out to be absolutely unusable and we are then consulted, even if we do not absolutely have to be, as with the salary rise for the employees of Europol.
Let me say to the Council: Give them a decent income, so that Europol's staff are paid according to their performance, and so that they are motivated rather than frustrated.
You address problems, but end up proposing solutions that go against further integration.
Here again, I am referring to the Europol Convention.
We need quicker decisions, decisions reached by the Council on a majority basis.
These initiatives create difficulties for us when more and more new institutions are created, meaning more bureaucracy and more expense, but nobody can explain to us what added value these new networks, institutions and facilities bring to the European Union or to security.
Rather, these initiatives give the impression that activities are being announced without any desire to strive towards real solutions.
This plethora of initiatives increasingly clogs up our work in committee, with the result that tomorrow will probably see four of these five initiatives having to be rejected and one of them adopted only if amendments to it by Lord Stockton and others among us can actually be accepted.
All in all, that does not make for a good day for this form of parliamentarianism or for initiatives of this kind.
We have to consider whether future initiatives like these will require us, perhaps via the Convention, to take a new path in order to achieve sensible solutions in the interests of security and also of Parliament.
Mr President, we are not, in principle, against the proposal to create a body which would both ensure effective cooperation between police forces in Europe and gather developments and results of studies and research on combating crime.
However, the proposal appears to ignore a criminal challenge which is present in many European countries, a challenge of extreme criminal danger, namely the mafia: this is a challenge that must certainly not be disregarded by the European Parliament.
I am afraid that it is something more than and different from what is defined in the proposal as just 'organised crime'.
The mafia is expanding increasingly beyond its traditional areas of activity, it is forging literally global alliances, it is penetrating the economic and financial sectors through extremely sophisticated money laundering systems.
The objectives of the European Police College - which I propose should be named after Giovanni Falcone, who gave his life 10 years ago this year in the fight against the mafia and was the first to point out the transnational dimension of the tentacular mafia network - must include precisely the fight against the mafia and prevention of the risk it represents.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has been consistent in approving various initiatives to widen Europol's mandate.
In addition to drug trafficking and its initial powers, we have given it additional powers relating to trafficking in human beings, terrorism, money laundering, forging money and means of payment, as well as all kinds of serious international crime.
We want to help transform Europol into a more efficient organisation for fighting against organised crime.
The initiative before us today is intended to go further still, to revise the Europol Convention itself, which as it stands limits Europol's functions to collecting, analysing and exchanging data.
We welcome the idea of giving Europol operational powers in line with our interpretation of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
But we also wish to stress the need for this to go hand in hand with measures ensuring democratic scrutiny or judicial control.
The procedure adopted for revising the convention is, however, of a strictly intergovernmental nature.
We therefore support the proposal put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, that this initiative should be withdrawn and that a new proposal should be presented with a view to replacing the convention by means of a Council decision under Article 34, which would make it possible to integrate Europol into the third pillar and accordingly into the institutional framework of the European Union, as has been repeatedly requested by the European Parliament.
What we wish to see in these parts of the area of freedom, security and justice are firm, specific and carefully considered measures.
We reject initiatives which suggest that something is being done but which lack any real substance.
That is why I support the Sousa Pinto report and am proposing that the Spanish initiative for the establishment of a European Institute of Police Studies, which would overlap with the structure already in place and in particular the European Police College, should be rejected.
We also support Mr Deprez's report on increasing the basic salaries of Europol staff: if the European Parliament is not consulted on Europol's general budget, it does not make sense for it to be consulted on a matter of detail.
I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of incorporating Europol's budget into the Community budget.
Mr President, the ever-increasing threat from terrorist organisations, and the greater concentration of terror in the murdering of public figures, with the recent hideous murder of one of the Netherlands' leading politicians, make this matter one of vital importance today to Parliament.
All security agencies in the EU countries, whether public or private, must fully cooperate one with the other in every way possible.
The bringing together of the data in their intelligence banks and policy strategy is of imperative value to them in their fight against terrorism.
Those EU countries who have faced the might of terrorist destruction and who have succeeded, and are succeeding, against the terrorists should be encouraged to take a lead and help others who might be faced with a similar situation.
I believe that it is not the incorporation of the police forces or security agencies of the EU which will solve this problem, but the fullest cooperation between all these agencies now and urgently.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
(A5-0169/2002) by Mr Fiori, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the mid-term review of the reform of the common organisations of the market (COMs) in the context of Agenda 2000 [2001/2127(INI)];
(A5-0164/2002) by Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on rural development in the framework of Agenda 2000 - interim balance in the EU and the applicant countries [2001/2041(INI)].
Mr President, it is a pity that the Commissioner is not here because I wanted to start my reflection on the own-initiative report of which I am the rapporteur by saying, on the basis of today's debate, that I am sure he will find the atmosphere in the agricultural sector much more friendly than that in the fisheries sector.
The subject of our own-initiative report is the mid-term review laid down by the reform known as Agenda 2000: it is an analysis stage which comes after a phase in which the second major reform of Community agricultural policy was introduced; over recent years, Community agricultural policy has taken on a much stronger, much more definite connotation than that intended by the signatories to the Berlin Agreement in 1999.
This is because European agriculture is going through one of the most difficult, complex and sensitive periods of change in the existence of the common agricultural policy, and the difficulty currently facing agriculture - a difficulty which is quite obvious to the farmers, for whom the European effort is a major point of reference - was also mirrored in the preparatory work for the report, in the debate in committee and in the difficulty of putting together a report with a broad consensus.

In actual fact, there are two major philosophies underpinning this own-initiative report: on the one hand, there is the school of thought which asserts the need to preserve the current framework of the common agricultural policy and declares itself to be virtually opposed to any change which could alter the nature of the objectives or principles of the common agricultural policy as we know it; on the other hand, there is the school of thought which calls upon us to intervene with hefty measures, measures which would considerably alter the current legislative framework, to take into account the crisis situation in a number of sectors, to take into account eastward enlargement, under negotiation with the European Union, to take into account the WTO negotiations and, most importantly, to take into account the need, of which farmers are perfectly aware, for a direction to be found for the market and for production systems too which will guarantee an acceptable level of income in the long term.
This is therefore one of the thorny issues we need to address.
The MacSharry and Agenda 2000 reforms ensured - so it is written - a reasonable and stable income for producers.
It is no longer possible to monitor or verify this in many European countries.
Apart from anything else, we do not yet have an analysis framework providing accurate data on changes in producers' incomes which would allow us to carry out a review of the effects of Agenda 2000 in terms of income too.
There have been many exchanges of opinion and ideas, and I would like to comment on some of them for I have tabled a number of amendments on points of importance to me which have been the subject of lengthy debate.
Firstly, we call for a direct aid system where the granting of direct payments is decoupled from production.
This is certainly a viable method of dealing with the changes taking place in the agricultural sector, but the minimum level of income received by holdings must be taken into consideration as a parameter.
We do not have this information at present and, above all, we cannot even remotely hope to make the income of holdings dependent solely on State intervention.
Secondly, there are two instruments which have been on the table for a long time: modulation and degressivity.
Modulation has thus far been voluntary.
In the Member States in which it has been applied, it has not yielded the results that might have been expected.
I realise that modulation is a system for transferring resources and funds.
It is a perfectly good system.
Transferral, under the present proposal to switch from a voluntary to a compulsory system, is certainly a viable working instrument, but, if it is diminished by a mechanism which does not allow review or analysis according to the formula we have identified in the own-initiative report, then I can see it causing holdings major revenue problems and requiring very close analysis.
Consider, for example, a large farming country, France.
Just a few days ago, the Minister for Agriculture revealed that there was a surplus of EUR 300 million in the modulation system developed and updated over the last two years, which remained in the hands of the State and was not redirected to the agricultural holdings.
If we then propose to combine modulation and degressivity, applying them side by side, we will find ourselves in the situation, clear from any econometric model, where the income of holdings is falling by, in the case of a medium-sized holding of 100 hectares, almost 30%.
This aspect therefore warrants a great deal of attention.
I will close with one last point.
I have been accused of failing to include the concept of multifunctionality in my own-initiative report.
Well, my task was to produce an own-initiative report firmly anchored to the first pillar.
The aspects relating to changes in the development of agriculture are dealt with exhaustively in Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report, with which I identify, which I voted for and which I fully support.
However, in the context of a report, such as Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report, on rural development in the world, we must on no account forget that agriculture is an undertaking, it is an economy, and it needs a first pillar which allows Europe to assume a strategic position on the major international commodities, especially in the light of the decisions of the US Government relating to the Farm Bill.
Mr President, this is an own-initiative report on the interim review of Agenda 2000 in relation to the second pillar - rural development.
We believe that rural development has to consolidate a multifunctional agricultural system across the Union, and that rural development therefore needs to be one of the European Union's priorities.
The first and second pillars are two indissociable instruments of the common agricultural policy and should, therefore, complement each other and be used for the benefit of a multifunctional agricultural system that will enable many farms to be maintained across the European Union.
We think that the first and second pillars complementing each other is the only way of preventing a dual system of agriculture from being created within the European Union, with one type only looking towards the markets and depending solely on market aid while the other has its back to the agricultural markets and depends on aid that is disconnected from production.
It is not and would not be a good model for the first and second pillars to be like two sealed and unconnected compartments and for all the multi-functionality to be concentrated in the second pillar, on rural development.
Mr Fiori, as you have just referred to my report, I have to tell you that I think that your view is wrong and ultimately inefficient.
Multifunctional agriculture must enable us to combine market management and management of rural areas and enable farms across the current and enlarged Union to exist and be viable.
It is true that Agenda 2000 created the second pillar of the CAP, rural development, and we welcome that.
However, we have to criticise the fact that it has a meagre budget: 10% of the total CAP budget is what we devote to rural development.
We therefore ask for a greater budgetary allocation, a budgetary strengthening of this pillar, so that it can meet the challenges that it is faced with.
We have also been unhappy to see that the uneven application of rural development measures by the Member States does not always produce a positive result for the rural areas of the Union.
This is particularly the case for those areas that are most rural, most remote and which are lagging the furthest behind, which are not finding a truly satisfactory solution to these problems.
We therefore propose that, without diminishing the powers of the national authorities, we should establish priorities under the second pillar of the CAP in order to move forward in defining a core of priority measures at Community level that guarantee sustainable development in the Union.
We also propose that the Commission define a new typology for rural areas to enable us to set priority measures for each area and also to help us to apply different percentages of co-financing according to the various rural problems that exist in the Union.
We ask that, as part of the interim review of Agenda 2000, there should be compulsory and uniform modulation of aid under the first pillar.
Mr Fiori said that voluntary modulation has failed.
There should, therefore, be compulsory and uniform modulation of aid under the first pillar, in order to use those freed-up resources, not only for the measures that we can currently use them for, the agro-environmental sector, early retirement and reforestation, but also for all the measures established in the regulations on rural development.
We think that as part of this measure and in the interim review we should strengthen the eco-conditionality of aid and establish a link between the disbursement of direct payments and the provision of services within a multifunctional system, extending eco-conditionality measures in favour of sustainable development.
We also ask for the Community support framework for rural development to be simplified through the creation, on the basis of the two EAGGF Guarantee and EAGGF Guidance sections, of a single agri-rural fund for the whole of the CAP.
And on the occasion of this report in favour of multifunctional agriculture and of a different multifunctional agricultural policy, I would like to finish by asking for codecision for Parliament on agricultural policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking most warmly both rapporteurs, Mr Fiori and Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos, for the work they have done.
Most of all, I would like to speak to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report. As shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE group, let me express my heartfelt gratitude for the good cooperation with Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos.
Agenda 2000's mid-term review is a very important stage for agriculture, as the further development of the common agricultural policy is very important specifically in a global context.
The right course must be set at the right time, so I welcome both these own-initiative reports to an extraordinary degree.
I see the considerable attention paid by Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos in her report to rural development, with all its demands, problems, opportunities and possibilities, in a favourable light.
Its continued promotion within the second pillar of the CAP really is an important matter of concern to me, although such promotion must not be to the detriment of the CAP's first pillar.
It is also important to emphasise the multi-functional agriculture by which jobs can be created, and which also has many other beneficial effects on rural areas as a whole, on their environment, the economy and the maintenance of the cultivated landscape.
I would also like to point out that the promotion of all farming concerns, above all those belonging to young farmers, in all Europe's regions, is a matter of great concern to me as rural structures depend on the concerns' existence and on the latter's willingness to protect them.
Agriculture is to be strengthened and steered towards sustainable development in many parts of Europe, although its competitiveness must not, of course, be disregarded.
I urge that care be taken to maintain guarantees of food safety.
Consumer confidence and the quality of agricultural products are important principles in the agriculture of today.
What is important to me is that this mid-term review should not be taken as an opportunity to generally call into question the existing rules of the CAP.
For me, a 'mid-term review' means reviewing Agenda 2000 and the current rules.
Necessary adjustments must of course be made in response to the results of this review, but Agenda 2000 has to be transposed, and its long-term implications have to be reviewed.
Moreover, the problems of enlargement must under no circumstances be mixed up with the discussion we are having today on Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review.
The European agricultural model must be secured for the future as well.
If compulsory modulation of compensatory payments is to be advocated, it must also be ensured that the Member States cofinance it.
I would like to sum up by saying, by way of emphasis, that the promotion of rural development must - as already said - under no circumstances be to the detriment of the CAP's first pillar, but additional funds need to be made available for it to be extended.
We Members of Europe's Parliament therefore look forward with great excitement to the Commission's proposals, in response to the mid-term review, for positive development of agriculture, forestry and rural areas, and thus for the future of farmers in Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I too plead for the respect of the founding principles of the CAP, against any form of renationalisation and for significant changes to be made to the CAP within the framework of the Berlin financial accords so that we can meet European society's new expectations.
Now more than ever before, all the policy's COMs must promote or enhance the multifunctionality of our agricultural policy in order to guarantee food safety, sustainable development, rural development and territorial cohesion, in addition to animal welfare.
This is what our fellow citizens now expect from Europe's agricultural policy.
This is what forms the basis of the European agricultural model, the recognition of which we must forcefully promote on the international stage.
In other words, we need an agricultural industry that does not 'produce more' but 'produces better'.
We must make ourselves clear on this issue, however.
If, on the one hand, European agriculture has no future other than to respond appropriately to the expectations of European citizens, there will, on the other hand, be no genuine multifunctionality unless the policy that is implemented provides its actors with sufficient income to enable them to make a living in all the Member States.
Consumers and taxpayers must shoulder their responsibilities in this area.
This means that we, as politicians, must concern ourselves, with the same degree of commitment, with both the needs of modern society and with agricultural incomes.
In this area, I would warn against any approach that aims to limit the CAP to receiving only public funds for multifunctionality under the consolidated rural pillar, and submitting other areas of agricultural policy to market deregulation.
Furthermore, I condemn the policy of the United States which, by means of excessive public support, will help to bring down world prices and flood our markets with GMO products.
When all is said and done and to sum up, I personally plead for a restored CAP which, first and foremost, is based on a budget equal to its priorities, with public support that is distributed fairly amongst farmers depending on modulations. Secondly, a CAP that is based on an enhanced market management policy that promotes quality products and reduces our reliance on certain imports, such as those of vegetable protein.
And thirdly, a CAP that is based on a policy relating to agricultural incomes which guarantees the continued existence of farms in all the Member States. Any change to the CAP that dismisses these three requirements would deceive both the citizens and farmers of Europe.
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos and Mr Fiori for the enormous amount of work they have put into both these reports.
I do not have much to add when it comes to Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos' report, but I have a few comments on Mr Fiori's.
I think it is important that we think about whether we should retain agricultural policy or develop it.
We have to realise that improved communications, both physical and electronic, are making us increasingly dependent on the world around us.
This makes it impossible for us in the EU to isolate ourselves and conduct a completely separate agricultural policy.
We have to take into account what is going on in the world around us.
The negotiations of the World Trade Organisation are becoming increasingly important and are setting the standard for what we do.
This is emphasised by the fact that the countries of central Eastern Europe will soon be included in the EU.
An enlarged EU will in fact be the largest player on the global food market.
Therefore, we must also take on the role of the most important player when it comes to pushing development forward.
Now that the US has increased its agricultural subsidies, the EU must seek to be the driving force behind further opening up the global market, involving the developing countries in that market and thus making it work better.
This would also create an opportunity for the developing countries to demonstrate, through their growth, that they are a purchasing force on the global market due to their having an enormous need for food.
Mr President, I believe it is important that we think this through both ahead of the interim report and ahead of a new agricultural policy after 2006.
Being aware that a functioning global market is much more important for the farmers of Europe may be a much greater guarantee of their obtaining a reasonable income than an increasingly fragile political support system which we no longer particularly agree that we wish to develop.
Mr President, the Berlin European Council limited the interim review of Agenda 2000 - and the two own-initiative reports referred specifically to the Commission's future proposals on the review of Agenda 2000 - in terms of the limits on the financial perspectives and the possible review of the intervention prices for cereals and milk quotas.
The financial perspectives have been respected, and what is more, expenditure has been far below what was budgeted.
With regard to the price of cereals, in my opinion, the real need is for the price differential for oilseed crops to be restored in order to correct the strategic deficit of vegetable proteins.
However, there should be no experiments with durum wheat or rice in order to prevent the risk of cultivation disappearing.
With regard to the system of milk quotas, we should refrain from any experiments that could have disastrous consequences for mountainous areas.
I therefore think that the interim review of Agenda 2000 should under no circumstances lead to what I would call a radical reform, with budgetary restrictions, with the prospect of enlargement.
However there could be reforms of certain aspects of Agenda 2000 that have shown signs of not working or of lacking in efficiency.
For example, the application of modulation should be compulsory and uniform across all the Member States, and the scope for use of the funds freed up through it should be considerably extended.
With regard to rural development, I have a few comments to make: political bargaining could be a threat to achieving objectives set for rural development.
The requirement of co-financing, as it is currently designed, creates a deficit of rural development measures in the poorest regions, which are the most needy ones, and the predominant measures in some countries frequently have little to do with sustainable rural development.
I think that the report by Mrs RodrÃ­guez Ramos deals with these problems very well and it will therefore receive the unreserved support of my political group.
With regard to Mr Fiori's report, it should be recognised that it has some structural problems, possibly due to the large number of amendments that he received.
Mr Fiori knows that my political group, and I personally, made a considerable effort to reach a consensus on some aspects of the amendments that I had tabled, and I thought that the final result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development reflected agreements between all the members of the committee.
I was surprised by the final amendments from Mr Fiori that will be voted on tomorrow, and I would like to say, with all due respect, that I do not share the opinion that he has just explained to us, that we need to set an economic, business-like view, which should also exist in a large proportion of agriculture, against modulation policies.
I think that public policies should refer to specific objectives, such as sustainable development, job creation and social criteria, and that under no circumstances should they be incompatible with that business-like, economic view of agriculture.
I have a difference of opinion with Mr Fiori on this issue and if his amendments, which remove modulation, are adopted, I will advise my political group not to vote in favour of his report.
Mr President, the fall in the price of cereals, poultry, pork, beef and veal, cheap imports, instability of the international markets - this is all in a day's work for farmers.
Yet agriculture, just like other economic activities, is in dire need of clear prospects for its future development.
The mid-term review of the CAP must be used as an opportunity to confirm the objectives set by Agenda 2000 and to reassure farmers that the negotiators are determined to defend our crops and to firmly establish the European agricultural model at the international talks.
This task has been made all the more difficult by the Commission defying the views of the Member States in the reform of the common fisheries policy.
The aim of the CAP is to produce a wide-range of crops throughout the Union.
Its two pillars must be made consistent in order to guarantee farmers a decent income, the major part of which must be based on the price of products.
The common organisations of the market and their market regulatory instruments must continue to play an essential role whilst reinforcing the rural development pillar.
The latter must also enable farmers to meet society's new expectations in terms of quality, environmental protection, animal welfare and financing the additional costs that the market is not ready to assume.
However, the second pillar can also become, on the one hand, a tool for innovation by encouraging, for example, varied farming activities, crop diversification such as vegetable protein, and, on the other hand, a tool of the future by encouraging the setting-up of young farmers, in particular by helping farmers return to their activity whilst enabling older farmers to leave the profession in dignified conditions.
The task of rural development is not, however, to tackle all the environmental, social and territorial challenges of the countryside.
This is not the role of the CAP either.
Its role is to draw up land development policies which fall within the remit and are the responsibility of the Member States by virtue of subsidiarity.
The agricultural budget cannot become a substitute for the insufficient financing of projects that have anything other than an agricultural vocation. There might have been the temptation to do this for projects with purely environmental objectives such as the LIFE programmes, to take just one example.
Lastly, enlargement is a further challenge for our farmers.
We must ensure that they do not bring into question the already fragile circumstances in both Member States and candidate countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 'mid-term review' in connection with Agenda 2000 is one of the crucial concepts in current political discussion across Europe.
Every one of us has his own personal preferences when it comes to this important topic, as both the discussions in the Agriculture Committee and the number of amendments submitted bear witness.
Both rapporteurs deserve a great deal of gratitude for having made very serious attempts at incorporating in their reports, as much as possible, the well-founded concerns of Members of this House.
As a basis for the balance sheet, the mid-term review must be an option for the future; in other words, Agenda 2000 must be a valid and binding framework up to 2006.
It is on this basis that the common agricultural policy must be developed further.
It is quite clear that the situation in a globalised world market means that all tendencies towards regionalisation have to be rejected.
Our common agricultural policy has to be planned on a long-term basis and capable of being worked out by anyone, which means that we must not lose sight of the objective of using streamlining as a means of dismantling bureaucracy.
The production types society desires are, above all, to be achieved more by incentives and not so much by commands and prohibitions.
One major question is that of how we care for rural areas and keep them alive.
The efficient promotion of young farmers is indispensable in this.
We also want the second pillar to be strengthened, but what, in the area of agriculture, is meant by this?
The objective must be to make clear that environmentally friendly services and maintenance of the countryside do not 'cost nothing', but maintain an accountable market value.
Reliability and competitiveness for the farmers and hence greater freedom for their business operations when their performance is considered as a whole is the first objective.
First-rate product quality, no matter what the production type, and the required income from it, is the second.
Monitored safety right along the production chain, Commissioner, is our third objective in further development of the common agricultural policy, and it is an indispensable one.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is now perfectly clear that we must rebuild a European agricultural model. Instead of having a model based exclusively on production, we must instead redefine a multifunctional agricultural policy which provides social balance and job stability, land management and respect for the environment.
I believe that this political choice is, without doubt, the right choice.
However, it also brings a challenge with it, that is, to reform the European common agricultural policy so as to adapt it to the requirements of the twenty-first century in order to guarantee a future for the European agricultural model in an increasingly globalised economy.
This is an ambitious project but one that is crucial.
We must allocate the resources to achieve this ambition by gradually re-allocating a significant part of the Community budget of the 'market' pillar to the 'rural development' pillar, whilst encouraging all types of agricultural businesses, and particularly the most fragile.
This is because Europe must not sacrifice the crops that it does not consider sufficiently profitable on the altar of outright profit.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am also speaking to you on behalf of the producers of the outermost regions, who sometimes feel abandoned when faced with the breaking up of many COMs imposed by the WTO under pressure from the Americans.
