I am positive about the idea of Amendment 17.
Sugar beet growers who continue sugar beet production in Member States which significantly reduce their sugar quota should be eligible for some kind of state aid for a transitional period.
The proposed amendments to which I have not referred are of minor importance and for technical reasons I do not consider it necessary to take them on board.
This also includes the last-minute amendments tabled last week.
I took note of the particularly harsh comments that were made concerning the treatment of the ACP countries.
Indeed, this has been the subject of very intense discussion, but we have not forgotten the ACP countries.
The foreseen price cut only kicks in for the ACP countries in 2008, two years after it is imposed on the European farmers.
Let us not forget that after the full implementation of the reform, the ACP countries will still benefit from a price that is twice as high as the world market price.
The Commission has always proposed an action plan for the ACP countries, with EURÂ 40Â million for 2006.
These funds are expected to be at their disposal in 2006, even if the prices are not lowered until 2008.
Funding of EURÂ 40 million is certainly not a lot, but it is enough to get started and it has always been the intention to provide significant funds for the remaining period from 2007 to 2013.
It is quite clear that the size of these funds will depend on the ongoing discussions on the financial perspectives.
The reform also introduces a number of obligations for undertakings that want to take up the restructuring fund.
I must say that I am sorry and disappointed that quite a lot of Members â among others the Polish Members â are obviously unable to be here, because it must be completely clear that sugar companies cannot, I repeat,just take or cash in the restructuring fund and leave the country.
They simply have to provide measures for employees in the sugar industry.
These rules apply to training or early retirement, or what you will.
This money is going to be spent in cooperation with the government.
There seems to have been a complete misunderstanding about these restructuring funds.
I can answer Mrs McGuinness' question on the levy, which is: yes, the only way to avoid this payment to the restructuring fund would be to do away with the production in 2006/2007.
Lastly, some Members criticised the fact that the Council agreed on a political line for the sugar reform on 24 November 2005.
The definition of a political line at the November Council was driven by exceptional circumstances.
The current regime remains applicable only during the ongoing campaign and our growers and operators face some very difficult choices.
We owe it to them to provide, in a timely fashion, acceptable conditions in which they could make those choices.
We have lost in the WTO panel on sugar, and compliance with the panel's conclusion is a matter of urgency.
Finally, we had to prepare for Hong Kong in order to be able to defend our sugar sector, and we therefore needed to know what we had to defend.
However, I must emphasise that these circumstances should not have come as a surprise to anyone.
Since I presented my reform proposal before this Parliament on 22 June, I made it absolutely clear that the Council would have to define its political line on the sugar reform at the November Council.
I repeated this when I appeared before the Committee on Agriculture on 13Â September 2005 and when I wrote a follow-up letter to all the members of that committee on 26 September 2005.
I have operated in full transparency throughout the process to allow Parliament to play its role to the fullest.
But, finally, let me say to those of you who are critical here today that we owe much credit to the many committees and members of this House who have provided very valuable input over the last 12 months.
The reality is that you have managed successfully to influence the shape of the reform â a reform that will secure sustainability of this sector in Europe and a reform that allows us to offer a real alternative to those farmers and to those regions that will be most affected by the restructuring.
That is the result and it is a good one.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A6-0381/2005) by MrsÂ Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters to Community institutions and bodies (06273/2/2005 â C6-0297/2005 â 2003/0242(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, the regulation to be voted on tomorrow on the application of the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention to Community institutions will force us to confront decisions which are very political in nature.
It concerns important environmental legislation which relates to access to environmental information and the right of citizens to participate in decision-making.
The Ãrhus Convention, ratified in the European Community by the Member States and the EU, will be implemented by means of three directives, for which the first two pillars have already passed through the codecision procedure and conciliation.
During the entire process I have been rapporteur for the reports on the Ãrhus Convention.
These pillars concern the transparency of environmental information and the Communityâs right to be involved.
The third directive, access to justice, will probably not go ahead, because the Member States have not achieved consensus in the matter and there has been a general feeling that the project should be shelved.
The right to access to justice has also proven to be the biggest problem area in this regulation.
I have always stressed the importance of the rights of citizens regarding matters of the environment.
Openness and transparency are the lifeblood of democracy and a fundamental component of our own safety.
The regulation now before us, which extends the scope of the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention to Community level, is nevertheless in danger of acquiring some worrying features.
The European Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, when it voted, clearly altered the focus of the provisions, taking the Convention to what in my opinion was an undesirable level.
It is one thing to monitor and regulate how, for example, an authority applies and interprets the provisions of environmental legislation but quite another to monitor and regulate how a democratically elected legislator goes about his or her task.
The committeeâs design as it stands would in practice give all non-governmental organisations that fit the description very loosely the right to take the Community institutions to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, thus according them a kind of watchdog status with regard to said institutions.
As a politician, I am not, however, prepared to delegate in this way the power democratically bestowed on me and controlled by the people, and I hope that tomorrow this matter will be put right in the plenary vote.
The most crucial areas in tomorrowâs vote relate to Amendments 22, 24 and 25.
Article 230 of the Treaty allows citizens to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice of the European Communities if a decision affects the citizen directly and individually, which is only right and proper from the point of view of democracy.
The position of Parliamentâs Committee on the Environment now means, however, that any NGO within the EU can evade this provision by requesting an internal review, which the Community institution must reply to with a formal decision.
This decision, in conjunction with Amendment 25, will clear the way for examining the legality of the original decision, and not only its procedural but also its substantive legality, and will thus give NGOs the power ultimately to evaluate the work of the Communityâs institutions.
This would automatically allow them to take the Communityâs institutions to court, and, with such supreme authority, oversee our work.
In a democracy it is the people who are the highest authority, and the decision-makers whom they elect implement their will.
Now, however, we would be placing NGOs above the people and that is difficult for me to accept.
This is a political matter and one of principle.
Please do not misunderstand me: we need environmental organisations, and the world would be a much poorer place if NGOs had not justifiably raised many important questions.
Nevertheless, what they are now trying to drive through for themselves, with some heavy lobbying, is disquieting.
Furthermore, the definition of NGOs in the regulation is a very loose one, and for that reason I have tabled two amendments for the House which set out the criteria in greater detail.
The first states that an NGO must have operated in more than one EU country for at least two years.
The other amendment adds the words âcompliant with the lawâ to the definition.
These amendments are essential for requests for reviews to remain within controllable limits and in order to obtain additional criteria for the nature of the work of NGOs.
The members of our committee in this report have tabled amendments which I am happy to agree with.
I myself have emphasised the importance, for example, of the quality and comparability of environmental information.
Similarly, I support the democratic nature and transparency of our decision-making whenever I can.
In fact, however, that is all I want from the environmental organisations.
If they themselves complied with what they demand of us, if they were more transparent in their activities and funding procedures, and if they gave less misleading and mistaken information, we would not need to impose these restrictions and criteria.
From the global point of view, it has been disappointing to observe that NGOs do not by any means always disseminate the correct information or correct what has been shown to be mistaken information.
A good example of this is the letter that came this week from the biggest environmental organisations, which gives the wrong picture of the opportunity that is possibly now opening up to them of access to justice in court.
They mention that industrial companies are able to institute proceedings in the Court of Justice, and now this legislation would only bring them to the same level.
The letter fails to mention that the environmental organisations do by no means aspire to the same level as companies, regarding which there is a call for this decision to affect them âdirectly and individuallyâ, in other words, as an interested party.
Instead, the environmental organisations should now be able to choose, within the entire Union and ignoring criteria relating to interested parties, which area they are interested in.
It was misleading that this essential detail was left unsaid.
The Ãrhus agreement is an important part of viable democracy.
For that reason, citizensâ rights should not abuse the right to access to justice in order to put the brakes on projects or provide a forum for organisationsâ fund collecting campaigns.
Neither can I accept that the work of political decision-makers should flounder amid endless complaints from organisations.
It is not appropriate to resort to the right to appeal incessantly.
Abuses would undermine those citizensâ rights which we originally set out to defend.
Accordingly, at the plenary reading we now have to be careful regarding how the Community actually applies the right to access to justice.
I hope that Parliament will move closer to the Councilâs view, which I hold to be a balanced one.
Â Â  . I should like to thank the European Parliament and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their perseverance in drafting this report at second reading.
I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, for her contribution to efforts to apply the Ãrhus Convention to Community institutions.
It is worth noting that, following the directives on access to environmental information and public participation, this proposal for a regulation is the third legislative proposal in succession on the application of the Ãrhus Convention, this time to the Community institutions, and Mrs Korhola has made a valuable contribution.
This regulation has been proposed in parallel to the decision to ratify the Ãrhus Convention, which contains obligations not only for the public authorities in the Member States, but also for the Community institutions.
Consequently, the provisions on this matter already in existence needed to be supplemented.
That is why the proposal covers all three parts of the Convention, namely access to environmental information, public participation and access to justice.
The Community became a contracting party to the Convention in May 2005, just before the second conference of the parties in Almaty.
At that time, the first reading of the regulation had already taken place and political agreement had been achieved at Council level in view of the common position.
The common position improves and completes the initial Commission proposal from numerous points of view.
It also incorporates, either literally or materially, many of the amendments which the European Parliament formulated at first reading.
To be specific, as far as access to environmental information is concerned, a new Article 6 is proposed which refers to the application of the exemptions relating to access to environmental information, as proposed in the European Parliament's amendment.
The common position also incorporates elements of the European Parliament's amendments relating to more detailed requirements for public participation in the preliminary preparation of plans and programmes relating to the environment.
As regards access to justice, the Council simplified the criteria and the procedures on the basis of which non-governmental organisations can file a request for an internal review of deeds of Community institutions.
It is worth noting that the organisations in question no longer need to act at Community level in order to exercise this right.
The Commission is in a position to accept the changes in question, given that the current wording retains the obligation of the organisations in question to have environmental protection at Community level as their basic objective.
The Commission was also able to accept changes to the provisions which refer to the outcome of the internal review and the facility for non-governmental organisations to take recourse to the Court of Justice.
The Council effected the changes in question in a bid to avoid a text which might clash with the rules of the Convention concerning the right of access of individuals and groups of individuals.
The Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, endorses the Council's intention in this case, especially given that the common position is in keeping with the Ãrhus Convention, which allows the contracting parties to adopt criteria for public access to justice.
I hope that agreement will soon be reached on this specific proposal.
We have already come a long way from the overall application of the Ãrhus Convention and the adoption of this regulation will prove just how much we wish to apply it to the Community institutions.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like to express my agreement with Mrs Korhola; I really cannot agree with Amendments 22, 23 and 25.
I believe that the Ãrhus Convention, which is already being transposed in some countries, such as Spain, is clearly a victory for the possibility of transparency, training and so forth.
Nevertheless, I am extremely worried that positions that move away from the common sense demonstrated by the Council and from the Commission's position intend to give non-governmental organisations excessive legal capacity, in my view, as Mrs Korhola has said.
I believe that democracy must be symmetrical.
It is not logical that non-governmental organisations should have more rights than local councils in this field.
Neither do I believe that regions can have a particular capacity which we here would give them.
Furthermore, there is a principle in law, that of direct interest, which has been the subject of much debate in legal history and which is normally applied to the family or to certain problems that occur in the territory in question.
Nevertheless, I believe that applying direct interest to any NGO in Europe would take us into the realm of infinite law, and we would have no idea where that would end.
I believe that this may create a huge number of problems, above all because, as we know, sustainable development requires knowledge of the direct resource, because not every case is the same.
The main principle, which we have raised here many times, is that the concept of sustainable development is integral, it must relate to a specific place, and in one place certain things can be done for economic and social reasons which cannot be done in another place.
The idea, therefore, that certain NGOs, often not located in the relevant place, can demand this right by virtue of their interest in the environment, seems to me to be excessive.
I therefore agree with the Councilâs position.
Â Â  . Mr President, I would like firstly to point out that this report by Parliament, which must facilitate the work of adapting to the Ãrhus Convention, is a necessary and appropriate instrument.
I therefore acknowledge the efforts of the rapporteur and the other Members to apply this Convention to the mechanisms currently in place in the Member States and the Community institutions with a view to guaranteeing the legitimate right to environmental information and justice.
In this regard, we believe that better access to information and greater participation by the public in decision-making will make it possible to apply those decisions more effectively and will contribute to increasing awareness of environmental problems amongst the public.
The Convention will have to enhance transparency, responsibility and good governance in such diverse areas of public action as energy, agriculture, transport and tourism, by recognising a series of rights aimed at guaranteeing the effective participation of the citizens in public decision-making processes.
That information must provide sufficient knowledge to allow them to participate actively and consistently in the different administrative procedures.
Furthermore, the right to promote the administrative or legal resources they consider appropriate must be recognised when it is judged that those rights have been violated by public administrations.
With regard to the specific aspects of the report, I believe that in relation to access to justice for NGOs, the latter should not have excessively restrictive requirements, such as the requirement to work at international level and, above all, that of not having been registered for more than two years for the presentation of requests.
I believe that in many cases that would be a serious injustice.
Furthermore, with a view to ensuring that justice is universal, I believe that we should reject the idea of the European Investment Bank being able to deny access to environmental information, since the Ãrhus Convention states that exceptions must be interpreted narrowly and the inclusion of the term âbankingâ enlarges the notion of confidentiality.
In fact, the directive on public access to environmental information does not lay down specific rules for banks.
I would like the Commission to agree on these two specific issues because I believe them to be the most important ones.
I hope that this Regulation will be applied as soon as possible, in order to guarantee access to justice on all environmental issues.
Â Â  .
Mr President, the application of the Arhus Convention to the European institutions constitutes a major step forward, because it helps â as is necessary â to make the process of drawing up European legislation transparent, so that the public has more of a say in the preparation of environmental plans and environmental programmes.
This regulation enhances democracy in the environmental area.
The provisions of Arhus with regard to access to information, participation in decision-making and judicial access for environmental issues will apply across the whole of the EU.
From now on, not only the Member States, but also the Community institutions, will need to comply with these provisions.
Accessing justice, as provided for in the Arhus Convention, entails that the public must have the option of bringing environmental decisions taken by the EU institutions before the European Court.
At the moment, citizens with an environmental interest or environmental NGOs have no opportunity of raising any issues with the Court because they are rarely affected personally â the conditions included in the EC Treaty apply to access to justice, something that is often easier to demonstrate in the case of economic operators.
It is, of course, important for NGOs to enjoy the same level of access to justice, although the way in which this has been fleshed out by the Commission and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety â particularly in Amendments 22 and 25 â is liable to attract some criticism.
To prevent many hundreds of NGOs from bringing minor objections before the court, amendments are used to prescribe strict conditions for NGOs who can make a request for internal review.
Even with those conditions â that are now before us and that the rapporteur has presented to us separately â in place, there will be many NGOs who can submit requests of this kind.
It is not the intention to bring every single environmental decision taken by the European institutions before the Court, for that generates legal uncertainty and will only increase the European Courtâs heavy workload.
On the other hand, at times when there is serious doubt as to a certain environmental decision, it must be possible to raise this with the relevant authorities.
My group is divided over this issue.
Whilst some are great fans of Amendments 22 and 25, because they feel that these remove an imbalance, that the Arhus Convention is thus better implemented and that this is in line with the EC Treaty, others think the reverse, namely that these create inequality because environmental NGOs would be given a privileged position and that moreover, the Convention would be at least at loggerheads with the Treaty.
I can only regret that there is no room for a middle way, as a result of which NGOs would have the opportunity of having their say at times when it is really necessary, without there being the risk of numerous insignificant objections being lodged.
In fact, I now believe that it would be preferable if the Convention were to simply give greater opportunities for access to justice, which is, in fact, what the late Constitutional Treaty would have done had it not now been abandoned.
Â Â  MrÂ President, if the Ãrhus Convention is to work as intended in the EU, it is crucial that the rules also guarantee certain environmental organisationsâ access to testing by the courts.
The Councilâs common position does not, however, give the NGOs such access.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has therefore, quite correctly, supported the Commissionâs original proposal and re-introduced this element.
I regret that many members of the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are attempting to prevent the Ãrhus Convention from being fairly implemented.
Have they learned nothing from the French and Dutch ânoâ votes?
If we are to increase understanding of, and support for, the EU project, grass-roots participation and control are hugely important.
Take a current example.
The European Parliament has decided to take proceedings against the Commission in the case of the brominated flame retardant BDE, on which the Commission has lifted the ban without having been given the right to do so by the legislator.
Moreover, the Danish Government has followed suit by taking similar legal proceedings.
The environmental organisations too need, however, to be able to take action when EU laws are broken.
Now, the chemicals industry has been at its tricks again, keeping the citizens at bay.
Individual citizens cannot have decisions in the environmental sphere tested because there is no individual interest.
However, NGOs take care of public interests within the environmental and health spheres, so they should have access, in the EU too, to testing by the courts.
What we have here, of course, is a case of David and Goliath.
The environmental organisations take care of public interests, while the chemicals industry, with huge sums of money behind it, can force decisions through the EU system.
We saw this with REACH.
Without transparency and grass-roots access to the Court of Justice, the EU is developing into an apology for a democracy.
Â Â  MrÂ President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports all the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety to this regulation on the EUâs application of the Ãrhus Convention.
Two points are of special importance to us.
Firstly, it is crucial that the decision be comprehensive in scope so that projects funded by the European Union are also covered by the regulations.
The European Investment Bank too needs to be covered by the rules.
Much criticism has been directed over the years at the EIBâs handling of environmental issues, its failure to take due account of the environment and its considerable lack of transparency.
Secondly, we want environmental organisations to be given a genuine right to take legal proceedings when the environmental rules are not observed.
We are therefore opposed to any restriction on this right, for example that proposed by the rapporteur in Amendments 28 to 30.
Such a restriction would in practice mean that many of the most important national environmental movements would not have the opportunity to take legal proceedings, and that is unacceptable to us.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the present proposal for a regulation is to create greater transparency by means of increased public participation in the drafting of legislative texts, something which I very much welcome.
We MEPs are dependent on receiving information from associations, organisations, non-governmental organisations and interested citizens, and reflect these in our legislative procedures.
Only by incorporating the individual interests of the relevant groups in compromise legislative texts can we produce good legislation.
That being the case, the public naturally needs access to information, something which â I should like to emphasise â is also extremely important, and there needs to be more of it.
It surprises me, of course, that the Commission occasionally sends information to NGOs and associations rather than to the Members of the European Parliament; I have discovered â for example, in connection with REACH â that many organisations and associations have been getting such information before it reaches our pigeonholes.
That does not worry me, but what does worry me is the shape and form of the amendments to the present regulation.
Stipulating that NGOs â which, incidentally, safeguard sectoral interests â may take legal action to see their views incorporated into legislative texts actually presupposes considerable mistrust in Parliament.
As a rule, all European institutions seem to be regarded with general suspicion.
Permit me to allude to my previous occupation as a veterinary surgeon when I say that we are castrating ourselves and depriving ourselves of power here.
We are calling ourselves into question and, in my opinion, we cannot allow this to happen.
It would be a grave error to endorse this proposal; we should firmly oppose it.
I am not implying that any NGO intends to exert a harmful influence on social developments, but I do request that it not be implied that Parliament is not up to its job.
I wholeheartedly support the Councilâs views on the second reading; everything else goes distinctly too far.
That includes the proceedings for infringement of Community law, where intervention in ongoing proceedings is permitted: this does not benefit the public, either.
Â Â  â Mr President, there is a particular need for the full and integrated application of the Convention in all the Member States.
Its importance is decisive for further progress with environmental policy.
We need to place particular emphasis on the need for the integrated provision of electronically digitised information, as this will provide the basis for the proper implementation of public participation in all environmental control and awareness-raising procedures.
This will quickly smooth out the problems of bureaucracy which have to date been the basic brake on all similar endeavours.
Finally, it is most important that there should be a direct and intense response from the public sector to all aspects of the report and the proposed actions, because in numerous states the public sector is also the provider of most of the environmental information.
The Korhola report, which carefully and cautiously addresses the complicated points of such a venture must, as far as non-governmental organisations are concerned, be open to these questions and not only strict or unfair towards them.
To close, I believe that an important job has been done and I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her efforts.
Â Â  From its inception the Ãrhus Convention was praised as one of the most ambitious achievements of democracy in the area of the protection of the human environment, not merely because it lays down a human right of the new generation, namely the right of people to a healthy and high-quality environment, but also because of the logical assumption that involving citizens would raise the level of environmental protection, firstly through the adoption of measures and then through the implementation of those measures.
This assumption needs to be taken further, however.
Rules need to be established whereby the authorities are required to share environmental information with citizens, and they in turn must be able in extreme cases to demand that standards are enforced in the courts.
We are talking about the implemented regulations of an environmentally-protective participatory democracy.
In view of the fact that the European Union is drafting a White Paper with which it will endeavour to bridge the information gap separating it from its citizens, the content of the regulation under discussion is highly topical in the broader sense of relations with citizens.
On the basis of the Ãrhus Convention, in pursuit of an improved implementation of environmental protection legislation, the Commission envisaged certain non-governmental organisations having the right of access to the highest judicial instance, the European Court.
The logical conclusion to be drawn with regard to this regulation is that non-governmental organisations play an important role in the protection of the environment.
Yet the common position of the Council with regards to this area reveals a different interpretation of the Convention.
It is based on fear of an improper use of the European Court, although this is not a logical interpretation.
Half-measures in the efforts to implement environmental protection legislation and the removal of certain areas of work of the European institutions from democratic control would send the wrong political signal to Member States.
It is possible that this would lead to a reduction rather than an increase in their responsibility in the implementation of environmental legislation.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I would ask the Commissioner to conclude this debate with a few explanations.
I believe that there is a fundamental flaw in this eveningâs debate.
The common position that is the subject of MrsÂ Korholaâs report contains no rules whatsoever on access to justice.
The Commissioner has presented rules for access to the first part of the Ãrhus Convention: access to information, but, as things stand, there is no treatment whatsoever of the third pillar of this Convention.
I believe that there is some confusion in this regard.
In my view, the opportunity to request an internal review, for which provision is made in the common position, should not be confused with access to justice.
I would ask the Commissioner to clarify this point.
I should like to add, however, that I consider it absolutely indispensable that non-governmental organisations be given access to justice in the environmental field at European level, so that, if necessary, the practical transposition of European legislation can be examined on site.
Experience with the right of collective action in Germany has been very positive: there has not been an abundance of actions, and actions have been purposeful, with most of those brought by associations there ending in success.
Â Â  Mr President, the Ãrhus Convention, signed by all 25 Member States, gives the public rights in the three areas of accessing environmental information, participating in environmental decision-making and accessing justice in environmental matters.
This regulation before us has the objective of applying these rights against the EU institutions: Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the ECJ, the European Investment Bank, .
It is essential that individuals who are directly affected by breaches of environmental law have a means of redress, whether through an appeal body, the Ombudsman or, if necessary, through the courts.
This does not mean, however, drafting a lawyersâ charter, which is what we are in danger of doing.
While there are many excellent NGOs and pressure groups, which bring to our attention legitimate concerns on environmental matters and act as watchdogs holding the institutions to account on our behalf, I would urge caution in allowing any self-legitimising group to put an added burden on the institutions and clog up an already overburdened justice system.
While I am opposed to Amendments 2, 7 and 12, my biggest problem is with AmendmentÂ 26, which proposes that all NGOs, regardless of the legitimacy of their interests or the transparency of their constitutions, should be granted the right of unfettered instigation of court proceedings against Community institutions for their administrative acts or omissions, such as in enforcing the implementation of EU environmental law.
In some countries, an NGO can be formed with a membership of less than five people.
Such a body is not democratically accountable by any definition, but these amendments would allow them to challenge the Commission without providing evidence of how or by whom they are funded or for what purpose.
It is a long-established principle of EU law â built up over many years of case law and underpinned by Article 230(4) of the EC Treaty â that citizens need to have a direct and individual concern in order to have a standing in the ECJ.
Bypassing the Treaty with secondary legislation such as the amendments to this regulation makes a mockery of the idea that it is the victim of infringements of the law rather than interested observers â whose motivation and support base may not always be clear â who should be able to seek a remedy.
If the European Parliament wishes to extend the internal or judicial review process, it should do so through an amendment to the Treaty in the first instance.
As a politician, democratically accountable to my electorate, I am also not prepared to delegate my responsibility to unelected, unaccountable bodies.
Â Â  Mr President, the role of the Ãrhus Convention is to promote public control on environmental issues.
In this way it helps to make our societies more environmentally conscious and encourages NGOs to be active in environmental policy.
The most important part of the Convention is public participation in the decision-making process.
Member States were not brave enough to accept the entire concept of the Convention.
However, that is the way forward.
We politicians will be judged by our voters on the state of the environment and on a sustainable future, and not on empty promises.
I have tabled an amendment along with other colleagues, which is the 23rd one on this matter.
Some Members of this House oppose it.
Nevertheless, the amendment is only a retabling of the Commissionâs original words.
It says that if an internal review concludes that there is a contradiction with environmental law, then the body concerned should take a decision to eliminate the problem.
I think that is quite obvious.
If we realise there is an environmental problem and we do not do anything about it, then the whole process is senseless.
By the way, all Member States â and I mean all â signed the original Convention, which contains this idea.
The PSE Group is working in general, and in this particular case, for a clean environment and for public participation in the decision-making process.
That is why we support this report in the form that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety adopted it.
Â Â  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this regulation must indeed ensure that all Community institutions apply the provisions of the Ãrhus Convention, an agreement that intends to increase public involvement in environmental concerns.
Whatever some Members may claim, it is certainly not the intention to go beyond what is needed to enable the Community to be a party to the Ãrhus Convention.
I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has firmed up the Councilâs common position.
I am therefore completely behind the report and hope that it will be adopted in its entirety without the need for any amendments.
Given the increasing importance of Community environmental policy, the challenge for the regulation to comply with all provisions of the Ãrhus Convention is significant, not least in terms of retaining some credibility in the eyes of the Member States and at international level.
In other words, the same obligations and rights should exist at EU level as they do at Member State level.
That certainly applies to the establishment of possible grounds for refusal of environmental information.
The main point of discussion has already been mentioned here, namely the transposal of the third pillar of the Convention, the one on access to justice.
Clearly, the general interest of the environment cannot only be upheld by people who have a direct or personal interest, as the Convention provides.
For that reason, the Commission wanted to restrict access to justice to environmental organisations that meet certain conditions.
The wish to remove anything or add additional conditions is not only unacceptable but also contravenes the Ãrhus Convention.
I therefore sincerely hope that those Members who endorse open and transparent environmental policy in the EU will also approve the present report as it currently stands.
Â Â  . I would like to thank the speakers this evening for their very important speeches.
I shall make an appraisal of the basic amendments and, at the same time, reply to the main issues raised today.
As far as access to environmental information is concerned, the Commission cannot accept Amendments 4, 14 or 15, which aim to apply the regime of exceptions to the provisions of the 2003-2004 directive to access to environmental information and requests for information addressed to Community institutions.
The proposed regulation is being extended so that existing Community legislation on access to documents, as provided for in Regulation No 1049/2001, covers all Community institutions.
The specific amendments by the European Parliament could bring about, as a corollary, the creation of two, partially overlapping regimes of access to documents, which would not help transparency and legal clarity.
The new Article 6 of the common position already covers the exceptions in question and access to environmental information; these exceptions must be expressly clarified anyway in accordance with the requirements of the Ãrhus Convention.
Amendments 7 and 12, which aim to include in the definition of environmental information the degree of progress of access procedures cannot be accepted.
There is no such provision in the Ãrhus Convention.
Similarly, access procedures are not environmental information per se.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that it is the Commission's practice to publish on its website information relating to access procedures for all policy sectors.
The Commission can accept Amendment 16 making provision for a deadline of 15 working days for persons applying for access to be informed, if the Community institution does not have the information requested, and to be referred to the public authority which appears to have the information in question.
As far as public participation is concerned, the Commission cannot accept its extension to policies, as called for in Amendment 5 and, partially, in Amendments 19 and 20.
The Ãrhus Convention encourages public participation in the preliminary preparation of policies within the framework of a best effort clause.
This is a broad meaning and no such requirement is contained in the legislation addressed to Member States.
Nonetheless, it should be noted that the practice applied today, at Community level, makes provision for public consultation with the interested parties during the drafting of Community policies.
In addition, the definition of environmental plans and programmes is broad and covers programmes of a strategic nature.
The Commission cannot accept there is a need to call for public participation for plans and programmes funded by Community institutions, as provided for in Amendment 8.
The Ãrhus Convention refers to public participation for plans and programmes prepared by public authorities.
In addition, permission for infrastructure works with a significant environmental impact is granted at the level of the Member State, where public participation is provided for.
The Commission is able to accept in part Amendment 19, as regards the extension to the deadline for submitting comments within the framework of written consultations from 4 to 8 weeks.
It can also accept Amendment 20 adding the obligation of the Community institution to take account of the results of public participation.
This specific obligation derives from the Ãrhus Convention and corresponds to the Commission's current administrative practice.
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 23 extending the circle of organisations with the right to request an internal review from non-governmental organisations with the basic objective of protecting the environment to those which also or alternatively promote sustainable development.
This specific criterion would be very difficult to define and might cover a broad range of organisations for which there would be no justification in recognising, for environmental purposes, the right of access to such a review procedure.
The recognition of a special regime for environmental non-governmental organisations, the basic object of which is to defend environmental interests, is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Ãrhus Convention.
Similarly, as regards the criteria for legalising non-governmental organisations, the Commission cannot accept the final amendment proposed by the rapporteur, namely that non-governmental organisations should develop activities in more than one Member State.
Even though it is true that the initial Commission proposal talked of activities at Community level, it became clear during discussions prior to the common position that such a decision would cause unjustified barriers to the right of access to justice.
The Commission is satisfied with the present provision in the common position, which talks of the Community dimension of the environmental objective which the non-governmental organisation should promote within the Community.
Finally, Amendments 22, 24 and 25 refer to the outcome of the internal review of administrative acts adopted by the Community institutions in accordance with Article 10 and how they relate to the provisions on access to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 12.
For the reasons I have already mentioned at the beginning of my statement, the Commission cannot accept them because they would exceed provisions governing the legalisation of litigants under the Convention.
The Commission can accept in principle Amendments 26 and 27 concerning adaptation to the rules of procedure and the date of entry into force of the regulation.
I shall send the European Parliament Secretariat a full list of the Commission's views on the amendments.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0001/2006) by MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from the extractive industries and amending DirectiveÂ 2004/35/EC (PE-CONS 3665/2005 â C6-0405/2005 â 2003/0107(COD)).
Â Â  MrÂ President, there is a very tangible and practical background to this directive on which we are now to take a decision.
It is the major disasters that occurred a few years ago, involving collapsing mine embankments, above all in Romania and Spain.
They were environmental disasters that had huge consequences for the surrounding environment and that also poisoned the water systems.
In addition, there are our constant environmental problems in which waste from existing and old plant spreads heavy metals and other poisons in our immediate environment.
This means that a special directive is needed to regulate waste from the mining industry and other extractive industries.
When we look at the proposal put forward by the Commission a few years ago and at the proposal on which we are to take a decision tomorrow, there are significant differences.
Parliament has definitely helped make this directive better and more forceful.
A host of Parliamentâs amendments were adopted as early as at first reading, and quite a few have been added at this reading.
I should like to highlight a number of specific parts of this report as being particularly important.
Firstly, rules on embankment safety have been devised to prevent this type of disaster from occurring in the future.
The method involving high concentrations of cyanide, used in Romania, is also banned by this directive.
There will be clear rules on authorisation and on how this is to take place, and it will be possible to see which environmental problems can be remedied.
An absolute obligation is also laid down to respect the Water Directive, whereby no water status deterioration may be caused.
There are also rules to the effect that the site at which the mining takes place must be rehabilitated.
This directive is to put an end to the era in which waste and damaged sites were left behind.
So that it might do this, a financial guarantee is introduced for which companies must earmark resources for the purpose of rehabilitating the sites at which they have engaged in mining.
When it comes to the new Member States, above all Romania but also Bulgaria, we reached a stage during the conciliation when these countries produced declarations in which they undertook not to seek exemptions but instead to respect all the rules of the directive.
This is important, especially because Romania has significant problems in this area.
When it comes to historical waste, the Member States are required to compile an inventory whereby they have to investigate where there may be historic waste causing environmental problems.
Overall, there will be a significant improvement in the environmental situation in the EU.
The arguments against these measures have mainly been financial in the sense that the measures would cost companies money.
It is important to realise, however, that the environmental costs of rehabilitating the land would be part of companiesâ production costs and that this is only right.
Not including them in production costs would benefit the less than serious players.
A directive such as this favours serious mining companies that accept responsibility for their environmental policy.
This directive will also make it easier to produce new environmental technology, enabling the historical waste to be dealt with, and it will provide European industry with an opportunity in this sphere.
Last but not least â and most important of all â is the fact that it will benefit the environment and the health of those who live in the areas concerned.
The directive is not, of course, perfect.
Directives are very rarely perfect.
There are a few aspects of it I should like to have seen given more weight.
The rules governing waste not classified as dangerous are weaker than they should be.
This is due to the Council, which made changes for the worse to the directive at first reading.
I did not obtain the decision I should have liked from Parliament that would have enabled these changes to be negotiated away.
When it comes to waste plants, the definition is too weak and too generous towards the industry, and this is in danger of creating certain loopholes.
Where historic waste is concerned, there are no clear requirements to take measures for dealing with this.
It is important to realise, however, that under the EUâs other environmental legislation, above all the Framework Water Directive, there is an absolute obligation to deal with those cases in which historic waste is seen to lead to water status deterioration.
This means that the directive as a whole is still sound.
We can be satisfied with the work we have done during the last few years.
Finally, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank those with whom I have worked, including the shadow rapporteurs for the various groups whose constructive cooperation I have enjoyed.
I should like to thank the officials of the European Commission who, this time, have been excellent to collaborate with, together with the Presidency, which conducted a very constructive conciliation.
It has been a simple matter to cooperate with them and to find practical solutions to the various problems we faced.
Â Â  Mr President, I shall be very brief.
I should like to thank the European Parliament teams which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 6 December 2005.
I extend my particular thanks to Vice-President Roth-Behrendt and to rapporteur Jonas SjÃ¶stedt, whom I also congratulate on the result.
The discussions in the Conciliation Committee were constructive and I believe that Parliament achieved concessions on the vitally important issues of financial guarantees, excavation sites, transitional provisions and acceding countries and on a number of other important points.
The Commission supports the conciliation text with particular satisfaction and I hope that Parliament will ratify the positive result achieved by its negotiating team.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have travelled a long road, with many ground-breaking discussions along the way, and today we are meeting for the finale, so to speak.
There are only a few of us left now, this being the third reading.
I should like to thank the rapporteur, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt â our âpacesetterâ â who, with expert knowledge and a great deal of energy, managed to maintain the momentum of the negotiations all the way to the Conciliation Committee.
MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt succeeded in never losing sight of the goal, whilst clearly recognising when the time had come for closure and ultimately also for final compromises.
I am much obliged to him for this.
The directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is, therefore, a success for the environment, for enterprises in the mining industry, and thus also for human beings.
Environmentally sustainable activity does not just consist in doing nothing and making unspoilt nature the measure of all things, so to speak.
Instead, we human beings have been set the â even biblical â task of subduing the earth.
Europe is not characterised by primeval forest and unspoilt landscapes, but rather is known worldwide for its cultivated landscapes, developed over centuries.
These should be used by people for people according to the principle of sustainability.
Yet all intervention in nature also has concomitant effects; it would not be correct to say that mining has no impact on nature and the environment.
Therefore, when assessing all intervention, return must be weighed up against expenditure, benefit against burden.
As a result of the positive developments, technical possibilities and heightened environmental sensitivity of today, the yardsticks we use now are different from those we used just 50Â years ago.
We must put these achievements to good use in the interests of human safety and of preserving the health of our environment.
We must also continue to stay on the ball at all times so that we can make use of the new possibilities that will undoubtedly present themselves in 5, 10 or even 20Â yearsâ time.
It was the serious accidents in the metal ore mining sector in Spain and Romania in the last 10Â years that induced Parliament to call for this directive.
Now that we have it, I think that we are on the right track towards achieving something positive for the environment and for human beings.
Â Â  . Mr President, some five years ago the cyanide pollution of the River Tisza caused by a gold mine in Baia Mare, Romania, showed us Hungarians how dangerous mining waste can be.
At that time my country was not a member of the European Union.
Still the Commission and the European Parliament understood the problem and initiated a directive on the management of such waste.
MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt went to the site of the pollution, studied the facts, heard all the witnesses and experts, and then drew up an excellent report.
That is what I call a good and responsible job of a politician.
His report is based on real facts, on real dangers, and provides us with real solutions.
Thank you, MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt.
The PSE Group supported the report from the beginning.
At second reading, together with other colleagues, I tabled many amendments for stricter regulation.
Most of them were accepted by the rapporteur and later by the Conciliation Committee.
On water pollution issues, we tried to ensure compliance with other Community obligations, most of which were imposed under the Water Framework Directive.
The compromise reached by conciliation is not ideal, but it is acceptable.
The financial guarantees must be sufficient to cover the cost of the rehabilitation of the land affected by the waste facility.
This is a success for us.
We are also satisfied with clarification of the closure operation.
However, we lost an important battle.
We Socialist MEPs wanted the discharge of waste to any receiving body of water to be authorised before the operation.
For me, prevention is the most environmentally friendly solution.
Perhaps later everybody will understand this principle, not only in this House, but in the whole of Europe.
In general we obtained a good directive.
Member States, would-be Member States and third countries should respect the new regulatory framework.
We have to monitor the strict implementation of this directive.
Â Â  Â Â Â MrÂ President, the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the management of waste from various extractive industry sites is a key document in terms of environmental and health protection.
It is also of major significance for the extractive industries, which will have to bear the cost of implementing it, and it will have a major impact in that it will allow an agreement to be reached and the interests of all parties to be reconciled.
This directive is worthy of our approval.
Nevertheless, like every document it will be subject to changing economic conditions, and we will only discover how effective it is once it has been implemented in practice.
Future revisions will provide us with an opportunity to make certain amendments to it.
For example, mining waste frequently contains mineral components that should be reclaimed in order to limit the need for further excavations.
Â Â  Mr President, the European Union and its Parliament are frequently criticised by many, for introducing laws that are unnecessary or at least not absolutely necessary.
No one will say this about the Directive tabled before us.
On the contrary, we succeeded in creating an internationally groundbreaking, milestone regulation.
This regulation was created in the aftermath of the mining disaster that took place in 2000 in Baia Mare, Romania, to make sure that the environment and nature do not suffer such pollution ever again.
When disaster strikes, all we can do is to limit and mitigate damages and pay compensation, but, as we have seen in this case, with little success.
Natural environment was destroyed, and so far there have been no judgments passed in any of the damage compensation trials, which have almost stalled.
Therefore the directive tabled before us emphasises prevention, which is always a key issue in making our future safe and avoiding environmental disasters caused by human negligence.
However, the Directive does not only regulate future mines and their waste material, but also the old, abandoned mines and those that are still operating, often in a deplorable technical condition.
As a member of Parliamentâs Conciliation Committee, I would like to say a particular thank you for the work of Mr SjÃ¶stedt, Mr Roth-Behrendt and Mr Florenz who took part in the trialogue.
On behalf of Hungary, I would also like to thank them for identifying with my concern and proposal, as a result of which we achieved that the acceding Romania and Bulgaria are not applying for transitional exemption from the implementation of the Directive, as demonstrated in their attached statement.
The Eastern Carpathians hold many treasures, and their extraction constitutes an important economic foundation of regional development.
However, extraction should only be performed in a sustainable manner, taking into account the interests of the environment and nature to the highest extent.
This is the subject matter of this directive, and this is what it facilitates.
I am delighted that I had the privilege to participate in the creation of this regulation, which is so important for our common future.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, I am obliged to MrÂ SjÃ¶stedt, who negotiated very prudently on behalf of Parliament, and also to the Commission, which lent us its support in our endeavours to reach a compromise in the Council.
Let me echo my colleague MrÂ Olajos, who rightly emphasised that, with this legislative proposal, we have really hit upon an issue that directly affects the safety of the public and of the environment, and thus we are by no means creating superfluous European regulations that, as it were, only serve to burden the economy.
In this case, too, of course, a compromise does mean that the regulation gives rise to certain costs, but I believe that these costs are justified and can certainly be borne by industry, since assets as important as human health are at stake.
A particularly important achievement of the compromise is that financial guarantees are now required to cover the potential cost arising from land affected by a waste facility.
Arrangements such as these have to be made in advance, of course, as accidents very often result in mine operators declaring bankruptcy.
This means that the funds necessary to at least institute countervailing measures are lacking, and the general public is left to bear the consequences again.
Various aspects of waste management have also been specified much more precisely, particularly for the eventuality that the operator puts extractive waste into excavation voids during rehabilitation of the site.
This kind of rehabilitation requires strict compliance with the legal provisions so as to preclude any soil or water pollution.
In addition, operators have to take monitoring, maintenance and remedial measures: for example, they are obliged to collect or treat contaminated water or leachate.
It is important that the acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, too, make statements pledging to respect the new provisions â let us not forget Baia Mare.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0415/2005) by MrÂ Maaten, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the management of bathing water quality and repealing DirectiveÂ 76/160/EEC (03659/2005 â C6-0373/2005 â 2002/0254(COD)).
Â Â  . Mr President, in the past few days and in fact, in general, during the discussion of this directive, the question of whether it is really necessary to prescribe standards for bathing water at European level has been put to me on a regular basis.
Is this not a classic example of a matter that could be dealt with at Member State level?
I am aware of the fact that Members belonging to the Dutch Social Democrats, who are sadly not here at the moment, even referred to it in a report as a disgraceful directive for swimming pool water.
Well, it is not a directive for swimming pools, let alone a directive for bath water.
It deals, of course, with coastal waters and lakes.
The question has been raised as to whether European action in this field adds any value.
Parliament did not have any doubts about this when the House debated this very point at first reading.
What is more important though, is that the Member States, and especially the Member States, felt that a directive was needed.
If that is what they want, that is what they should get, but I do believe that it should be a serious directive rather than one that allows for more exceptions than anything else.
In any event, after more than 12 years of discussion, a compromise has been struck â albeit with difficulty â between the Council and Parliament, which I assume will be translated into legislation tomorrow.
The new directive provides for cleaner bathing water along beaches and lakes in Europe, better information for bathers and less red tape for local authorities.
Across the whole of the European Union, more than 80% of bathing water locations already meet the stricter standards and in a number of Member States, even more than 90% of the swimming locations comply with them.
At present, some 12% of bathers annually suffer from nausea, from stomach infections, rashes, tightness of the chest or eye or ear infections.
The effect of the new directive is to tighten up health standards, as a result of which only 8% of bathers are expected to contract an illness.
From 2015, bathers will also be informed of the current bathing water quality at their bathing locations by means of symbols that will be identical across Europe.
At the moment, bathers can only access the quality that pertains to the previous year with some difficulty and only on the Internet.
What appeals to me is that before long, I will be able to see for myself what the quality of the water is on the spot, because I do not know about you, but I only take my laptop to the beach on very rare occasions.
Instead of 19 parameters, Member States will only need to measure 2 parameters, and that is an example of how the red tape will be cut when water is measured.
For a long time, the European Parliament and the governments were at loggerheads over the question of how strict the standards should be and how high the associated costs for the Member States.
We have reached a compromise that is satisfactory for all parties, and I think that in this respect, whilst the British Presidency deserves a compliment, it is the Commission â and you, Commissioner, in particular â who have been instrumental in bringing this compromise about.
I should also like to thank many of the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in this respect.
Bathing water will not only be cleaner, it will be cleaner, the costs will be manageable and deregulation is underway.
In conclusion, I am interested to hear what comments the Commission will have to make on the article that is soon to appear in the scientific magazine âEnvironmental Health Perspectivesâ, written by Mr Albrecht Wiedenmann and which carries the rather complex English title âConcentration responsive effects with no observed adverse effect levelsâ, abbreviated to NOAELS.
I cannot quite describe the term myself, but I am sure that you can.
I am at any rate interested to see if the Commission will also use this study in its 2008 assessment report, because it contains quite a few terse comments about the directive as we are about to adopt it.
I would add, though, time for incorporating it is rapidly running out.
I will be delighted when the directive will actually be adopted tomorrow.
I think it is a success for all of us, including myself, even though I am not exactly a keen swimmer.
I only go in if I have no other choice.
After 2015, I will be at least happier to take a dip.
I hope, Commissioner, that I will be able to do so without any concerns in your Member State too.
Â Â  Mr President, I love the sea and swimming and I am therefore interested for personal reasons in the seas and waters of Europe being as clean as possible.
I should like to thank the delegation of the European Parliament which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 12 October 2005, and vice-president Mr Trakatellis and the rapporteur Mr Maaten in particular, and to congratulate them on their outstanding work and on the result achieved.
Discussions in the Conciliation Committee were complicated.
However, at least, as far as the vital question of introducing ambitious standards for the classification category of adequate quality is concerned, I consider that Parliament achieved noteworthy results and a significant improvement in comparison with the Council's original position.
The quality standards may not ultimately be as strict as certain would have wished â and indeed the minimum quality standards are not as strict as those which the Commission had originally proposed.
Nonetheless, they were strengthened considerably during discussions in the Conciliation Committee, with the result that the final text is a considerable improvement over the provisions which apply today and which date from the time when the directive was issued in 1975 and, as such, have been overtaken by modern scientific data.
The Commission supports the conciliation text with particular satisfaction and, as such, I would like to hope that Parliament will ratify the positive result achieved by its negotiating team.
Thus, this evening, we are closing the debate on two very important directives, which no doubt will improve the environment and protect the health of European citizens.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, I am obliged to the rapporteur for the very good work he has done, and to the Commission for this proposal for a directive, in particular.
To be frank, I was a little disappointed in the Commission when it gave its opinion on the Council common position.
I should really have liked to see more support for a tougher, more sharply defined line on bathing water quality as, after all, we have considerably watered down the standards to which the Commissioner referred.
With the support of the Commission, we could have put together a tougher directive, one that obliged Member States to introduce higher standards without the States being faced with the heavy spending that is so often talked about.
Let us not forget that the main problem today as regards the pollution of bathing water is not localised pollution, but diffuse sources of pollution â agricultural sources in particular, of course.
We could have achieved a substantial improvement on this issue with a relatively small amount of money.
Yet we have reached a compromise, and one should stand by compromises; which is why I would appeal for the adoption of the proposal for a directive in Parliament tomorrow.
We have, however, taken a step in the right direction.
I am now pinning my hopes on 2008, when the Commission is due to review the directive and assess the situation prevailing by then.
May I, then, anticipate this by asking the Commissioner, who is of course a keen swimmer, to make sure that his services carry out this assessment accordingly and perhaps after all raise the health standards to OECD levels, on which all States have in fact agreed, so that we do not find ourselves attempting to level down the health standards in this field.
Bathing water undoubtedly has a strong ally in the Commissioner.
Â Â  . Mr President, as a Hungarian Member of the Socialist Group I am satisfied with the outcome of conciliation on the Bathing Water Directive.
We have had extensive debates both in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and later in the Conciliation Committee.
It was not easy to make clear that we cannot apply the same criteria to inland and coastal waters and lakes â such as Lake Balaton in Hungary â as we apply to the Atlantic Ocean.
That does not mean that we do not want to have strict rules as regards our inland waterways.
However, lakes and oceans are obviously different.
Landlocked countries such as Hungary and Austria should have a right to their own bathing water as well.
The area around Hungaryâs bathing lakes is subject to a ban on certain industrial and agricultural activities, and the sewage system covers almost 100% of households.
We can improve many things, but we cannot turn a lake into an ocean.
The present compromise is acceptable to us but means a lot of work for my country: some beaches will be closed and many others should be improved, but that is the cost of a clean and healthy environment.
The compromise on a stricter version of the category âsufficientâ is to be welcomed.
Public information on water quality at bathing sites is also very important.
Indeed, on all beaches around Lake Balaton there are huge information signs written in Hungarian, English, German and Russian.
Of course, we could add French, hoping that more tourists will come from France and other French-speaking countries.
In my last speech, at second reading, I had a rather tough tone, due to the one-minute limit and the speed of a heavy debate.
Now I should like to thank Mr Maaten for his report and readiness for constructive compromise.
He did a good job.
I hope, when I welcome him to Hungary, that he will be able to see how clean and sweet our Lake Balaton is.
Â Â  . Mr President, hundreds of thousands of European citizens fall ill every year as a result of entering contaminated bathing waters.
The diseases acquired in this way range widely in severity.
Most are clinically benign to moderate, but some are serious and a few are fatal.
As expected, children, the elderly and the immunosuppressed are the most vulnerable.
It is thus imperative for the legislative bodies of the EU to be greatly concerned with the quality of bathing waters.
They have indeed been working on this issue for many years, and one would expect the parameters used to monitor the quality of bathing water to be as strict as possible.
Unfortunately this is not quite the case, and the reason for that is simple.
It is that vast amounts of money are involved in the recreational and tourist industries associated with bathing waters, and if an area is pronounced to be of low bathing water quality then this has a serious economic impact on that region and that country.
So the doctorâs opinion is no longer paramount, and âpolitical compromisesâ are the order of the day.
Thus it is that after many years of talking, discussion and arguing â mainly about things that, if seen purely from a common sense point of view, are crystal clear â we end up in a conciliatory position in which we reduce the possible economic damage to countries with unhygienic bathing waters and increase the collateral risk of causing ill health among our citizens.
Many colleagues will disagree strongly with what I say, but how else can it be explained when, for example, we have invented a distinction, as far as health risks are concerned, between inland and coastal bathing waters, and we are prepared to accept that inland waters can be almost twice as unhealthy as coastal waters yet still be of sufficient quality for bathing in.
And how else can it be explained when we are prepared to label bathing waters as being of good quality when the risk of falling ill after swimming in them is of the order of 5% â i.e. 1 in 20 swimmers.
Although I will support this directive, it does not go far enough to make our bathing waters really safe.
It just makes them less hazardous.
In conclusion, many thanks are due to everyone who has worked so hard to produce this directive, and especially to my colleague Mr Maaten â although he is not a swimmer he has still worked extremely hard â to the Commission and, of course, to the members of the Conciliation Committee.
Â Â  . Mr President, on behalf of my group, I wish to say that, in spite of the good offices of the rapporteur, we believe the compromise in front of us is unacceptably weak.
That is why my group will be abstaining in tomorrowâs vote.
With that abstention, we intend to indicate the following.
First, that the values agreed on fresh water protection are completely unclear: the parameters have been so tampered with by statistical changes that the degree of protection they will provide is extremely dubious.
According to the peer-reviewed article about to appear in the scientific journal , which was mentioned by Mr Maaten, these values will bring no improvement for the quality of fresh water at all.
Second, the real opportunity we had to extend this directive to cover recreational uses has been completely lost in the compromise.
Third, after a strong fight for higher standards, Parliamentâs delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category.
Finally, the process by which this final agreement was reached was highly unsatisfactory, with last-minute technical proposals being introduced â verbally, not in writing â and with no time to properly study their implications.
This is a disappointing result, but, in spite of that, I should like to thank everyone involved.
I appreciate that it is not an easy business, but we will be abstaining tomorrow.
Â Â  . Mr President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mr Maaten on the achieved result.
It is partly thanks to his efforts that we will be able to adopt the review of the bathing water directive.
I should also like to thank the Commission for its cooperation, because without the ambitious proposal it tabled, it would not have been possible to tighten up the criteria.
I can inform you that I will agree to the result of the conciliation, even though I am not entirely satisfied with it.
The category âacceptableâ that has been created is nothing but an excuse for covering up the fact that the standards have not been seriously firmed up.
Moreover, the division that has been created between salt and fresh water is based on very limited information, and all of this means that the protection of bathers has improved far less than it might have done.
I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the article that Mr Maaten mentioned, which will be published next month.
In that article, the standards are set out as to what we need in order to really protect bathers.
I hope, Commissioner Dimas, that you will be prepared to use this data in your next review, which I hope will not be as long in coming.
Â Â  Mr President, clean and safe bathing water is an obvious necessity, and an essential aid to a prosperous tourist industry.
In my region of Northern Ireland there are many beautiful beaches, several of which proudly boast blue flag status.
We have others yet to attain that accolade.
I trust that this directive will assist in their achievement of that status.
Equally relevant is compliance with the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.
This has been easier for countries eligible for cohesion funding, which makes available grants precisely for such projects.
However, regions like mine, which have not and still do not qualify for cohesion funding, have greater difficulty in bringing their water treatment infrastructure up to acceptable standards.
Extra national funding is, therefore, the only resort and has to be found.
It is important to realise that the Bathing Water Directive should be considered in that wider context.
Â Â  Mr President, I would like to point out that the ten years of effort it has taken to draw up this document have been ten years of constant agreement and cooperation.
This demonstrates how effective European Union policy can be, because, from the outset, local councils, local authorities and the States began to work to improve the condition of beaches and bathing waters, both inland and on the coast.
I believe that it is important to stress â whenever I am teaching in the future, I shall explain this to my students â that this is a genuine example of the extent to which environmental policy is an added value for the economic system, for the wellbeing of the citizens and also in terms of increased land values.
A beach with clean water is a welcoming and high-quality tourist area.
If it is not clean, we know that the public will not go and will become increasingly conditioned.
This is the result of a policy of cooperation and of a mutual effort.
I therefore believe it to be satisfactory and furthermore the introduction of the category of âsufficientâ for water seems to me to be very realistic, because we must remain within the bounds of reality.
Ensuring that waters are clean costs an enormous amount of money and takes an enormous amount of management effort, many sanctions for dumping along river banks and an integrated policy.
We politicians must be aware that that effort comes from the citizensâ pockets and from a very significant scientific policy for controlling dumping, and that it is not easy to achieve all of this.
I am therefore pleased and I would point out that this demonstrates the extent to which the quality of the environment adds value to the economic system, to industries and also to social welfare.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am much obliged to MrÂ Maaten for the good work he has done and for the negotiations conducted by the delegation from this House in the run-up to the third reading.
I should like to confine myself to a few of the medical aspects of the directive.
Bathing water is not free from germs, but low in germs.
In principle, bathing water should be of drinking-water quality, as many bathers and swimmers do end up drinking it.
In southern Germany, for example, we have one of the largest drinking-water reservoirs in the whole of Europe in the shape of Lake Constance.
It must be mentioned, however, that even drinking water is not completely free from germs, but only low in germs, and that many germs â albeit of varying pathogenicity â are present throughout our daily lives.
The degree of protection we have now achieved with this directive is not perfect, of course, but is an initial step in the right direction.
After all, the limit values of 330 intestinal enterococchi for inland waters and 185 for coastal waters that have now been agreed â for the âsufficientâ category â represent a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12% to 8%, and âhealth riskâ does not necessarily mean illness.
The same goes for bacteria, with counts of 900 and 500 for the âsufficientâ and âexcellent qualityâ categories, respectively.
In my view, standardised laboratory methods should be as much a matter of course as uniform sampling quality.
The main concern as far as I am concerned should be that the public be informed sufficiently and in good time and that the âexcellent qualityâ designation be achieved in all our waters.
A further aim â subject to strict scientific provisos at first â must be to control the viral load of the waters.
This is progressively gaining in importance: there has been a rapid increase in the number of people falling ill in Europe as a result of enteroviruses and noroviruses.
If only for this reason, we can expect a further revision of the directive in the not-too-distant future.
I support the directive.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to follow on seamlessly from where MrÂ Ulmer left off.
For my electoral district, which directly adjoins Lake Constance, the Bathing Water Directive represents a difficult balancing act between protection of consumers â bathers â on the one hand, and nature conservation and tourism on the other.
The compromise we have reached on pollution requirements and quality standards in the âsufficientâ category, as MrÂ Ulmer put it, is a fair compromise between all the three interests that meet there.
For this reason, I have found that this compromise has met with a great deal of acceptance back home, for which I am much obliged to all the MEPs concerned, the rapporteur included.
It is also important to point out, however, that, by reducing the number of categories of polluter from 19 to just 2, we have found a solution that also serves the objectives of better lawmaking and less-bureaucratic regulation.
This is a good example to demonstrate that we are all at pains to cut down the excessively numerous regulations that were commonplace in the past to the really important aspects, and for this, too, I am very much obliged to everyone involved.
In the view of my group, the scope of the directive as a whole is very satisfactory.
It is also to be welcomed that Parliament did not keep to its original intention of extending the scope of the Bathing Water Directive to other water-related leisure activities, too, and for this I am obliged to all the MEPs concerned.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  Â The next item is the report (A6-0383/2005) by MrsÂ Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the environmental aspects of sustainable development (2005/2051(INI)).
Â Â  . â Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank all those who helped improve my report, and I should like to say straightaway that I shall be supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance.
It is worth remembering that if all the inhabitants of Earth were to adopt the Westâs lifestyle we would need several planets to meet their needs, and that the West, and primarily the EU, is duty-bound to carry out a root-and-branch rethink of its modes of production and consumption.
This assessment is undisputed in the Chamber, cutting across traditional political boundaries, and has led the Commission to incorporate sustainable development into the Unionâs priorities.
The time has come for us to take stock of our actions in this area, and the results so far have been mixed.
Progress has been made, but there have been setbacks or, at least, some shortcomings.
Under pressure from public concern about the continued degradation of our environment, the EU has worked hard to warn the international community about ecology issues.
Assessment of the situation has led to a large amount of rhetoric, but this has not always been followed up by actionÂ âÂ far from it.
The time has come for action to be taken, because there is an urgent need for a proactive policy aimed at reversing climate change, especially in light of the magnitude of recent natural disasters.
I welcome the conclusions of the Montreal conference and the positive role played by EU representatives should not go unmentioned.
Whilst the Union has adopted important legislation intended to reduce industrial waste and to make the cars we use more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, the significant increase in road traffic has meant that its efforts have come to nothing.
This is a clear illustration of one of the paradoxes facing the EU: on the one hand, the free movement of goods and, on the other, the detrimental impact of the free movement of goods on the EUâs environmental objectives.
There are two approaches to addressing this problem: firstly, to encourage the use of more environmentally-friendly means of transport, with the Union providing financial support for large structural projects, and secondly, to incorporate the environmental cost of transport into the price of goods or to tax transport in relation to its environmental impact.
There is an urgent need for proactive policy on water. In spite of the laws that have been adopted and the measures that have been taken, the state of water remains unsatisfactory.
Do we need to point out once again that chemical pollution levels are still too high?
Do we not have a duty to hold certain farming methods responsible, as they are such a major consumer of water and various fertilisers?
The forthcoming reform of the CAP should take this into account and press ahead with the reform of grants and environmental cross-compliance.
There is an urgent need for a proactive policy to maintain biodiversity.
The list does not stop there.
There is an urgent need for measures to be taken â such as the reports already adopted, the one by MrsÂ Ries and the one expected to be adopted on REACH â to offset the negative impact of the environment on health.
There is an urgent need to take action on development aid, because inequality on Earth generates more and more conflict and the poorest countries are the first victims of natural disasters.
Sustainable development provides part of the answer, because it represents a model of production and consumption that could and should be extended to all countries.
The Union needs to be proactive and propose effective measures if it is to be up to the task of reversing the most worrying trends and of preventing irreversible situations from arising.
To this end, it is essential that each sector be set quantified objectives and be subject to regular, strictly timetabled, evaluation.
On a broader level, the political foundations of the EU must be further strengthened.
This entails greater solidarity and more effective coordination; to encourage widespread dumping is incompatible with the requirements of sustainable development.
It also entails a breakdown of the implementation of sustainable development at all international, national and local levels.
Every legislative proposal would benefit from being viewed from the perspective of sustainable development.
We have much to do in this area.
Similarly, if we want to move sustainable development forward, we should no longer accept that the legal basis for draft laws on the environment or health should be the sacred cow of the free movement of goods.
The Commission has a responsibility, but protecting the environment is not sufficiently high on its agenda.
While it may have published five of the seven thematic strategies, these do not mask the weakness of the proposed review of the sustainable development strategy of the end of 2005.
I must say I am concerned about the plans presented to us by the Commission.
For example, when one reads in the thematic strategy on waste that there could be a return to national approaches whereby the Member States themselves would set their modes of managing waste, that, to my mind, would be a retrograde step.
When the Commission announces that it wants to make fewer laws by refusing to propose laws that would indeed be burdensome for the Member States or for business in the short term, but that are necessary for the future, it is condemning the Union to political losses. It is all the more incomprehensible for the citizens that the Commission persists with certain legislative proposals that have either already been rejected by Parliament, such as the directives on port services, or been subject to fierce objections from the citizens, such as the directive on services in the internal market.
I should like to conclude on a positive note. As much bad news for the Union as for our idea of developmentÂ âŠ
Â Â  . I should like to start by assuring you in connection with the thematic strategy on waste that, whenever we need to legislate in order to protect the environment and the health of European citizens, we shall legislate.
Consequently, you need have no concerns on that account and the thematic strategy on waste truly is a step forward.
We shall debate this when the time comes.
I should like now, on behalf of the Commission, to welcome the contribution by the European Parliament to the review of the European Union sustainable development strategy.
The exceptional Ferreira report contains many valuable proposals for the review, putting particular emphasis on the environmental aspects of sustainable development.
Many of the proposals are reflected in the Commission communication.
Following the approval of the Commission communication on the sustainable development strategy, the Commission wishes to cooperate more closely with Parliament and the Council and, on the basis of this communication, to get a European sustainable development strategy approved in June.
The Ferreira report will be very useful in the consultations leading up to the European Council in June.
Allow me to analyse further the Commission communication which we approved on 13 December and to add certain comments on the Ferreira report.
The Commission communication is the third and final stage in a detailed review procedure which has lasted over 18 months and in which many interested agencies have participated from the whole of Europe.
It is true that a fair amount of time was needed for the review but careful discussions were needed on such an important, broad-ranging strategy.
The Commission presented three communications on the strategy in 2005: the guidelines in February, the draft statement of principles on sustainable development which the Council approved in June and the revised strategy with objectives and a more effective monitoring procedure on 13 December 2005.
The Ferreira report focuses mainly on the environmental aspects of sustainable development.
These aspects are indeed very important, given that non-sustainable environmental trends constitute some of the main threats in relation to our present and future prosperity.
Nonetheless, it should be emphasised that the sustainable development strategy refers to all three aspects of sustainable development, namely the social, economic and environmental problems.
In an effort to suppress all non-sustainable trends, it also aims to maximum possible synergisms between these three dimensions.
The broad range of challenges covered includes climate change and clean energy, natural resources, transport, public health, social exclusion, demographics and immigration and global poverty.
Sustainable development addresses issues which truly relate to citizens.
They want prosperity but they also want a clean environment, good health, social protection and justice.
The new strategy proposes a long-term vision for a sustainable Europe which goes well beyond 2010.
Sustainable development is the primary objective of the Union.
Both the Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy are predicated on implementing this objective in a fast-changing world.
The Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy reinforce each other.
The new strategy addresses some of the weaknesses in the previous strategy, such as unclear priorities and the lack of a clear monitoring mechanism and it confirms the main challenges, clarifies the objectives, responds to the existing, often fairly questionable objectives within the framework of the corresponding policies and defines a new and stricter monitoring mechanism.
It pays particular attention to action and effective application in all policy sectors and the participation of all the interested agencies in the relevant procedure.
We wish to go beyond words and to identify priorities for the next five years.
The Commission wishes to cooperate with Parliament and the Council over the coming months, under the aegis of the Austrian Presidency, so that a common strategy can be agreed which will be broadly supported by all the institutions of the European Union and the Member States.
A strategy agreed at European level is needed if we want to galvanise European society into making important changes and to put the European Union on a more sustainable course.
Â Â  . â MrÂ President, this report by MrsÂ Ferreira is a very extensive, healthy, sound and also critical policy paper on the key fields of environmental and social policy, and I am obliged to her for it.
Yet the more we in this House discuss this issue, all the stronger is my impression that, while we espouse quite wonderful principles at heart, the unfortunate fact is that the reality of practical implementation does not look so rosy.
Most of us here probably agree, at heart, with the Commissionâs proposal â that new market instruments are necessary, for example ecotaxes and the internalisation of all costs.
Yet if we think back to the last sitting before Christmas, we recall that the majority in this House decided the opposite, under pressure from the Council and the transport lobby â here I am referring to the Eurovignette Directive â thus precluding any chance of recovering external costs, specifically costs to the environment and health.
I am glad that the tone is reversed here.
The many fine principles of environmental and social policy must also find expression in tangible measures.
The Commission must set medium- and short-term objectives.
Monitoring and evaluation activities are also necessary, as indicated in the conclusions in paragraphÂ 64 of this motion for a resolution.
A real change in our modes of production and consumption is needed: inaction on this will come at a high price and have serious consequences, especially for the growing number of poor people in our society.
The EU has an ethical obligation to remain the leading actor on global sustainability.
We politicians must not let ourselves be governed by the momentum of capital.
Â Â  .Â Â Â MrÂ President, the European Union is making every effort to ensure that environmental concerns are incorporated into all of its policies.
The rate of natural resource consumption in Europe currently exceeds our biological capacity by more than a factor of two.
What this means is that our continent is appropriating a disproportionate share of the worldâs natural resources, whether terrestrial or marine.
Let me refer Members to the communication adopted by the European Commission on 15Â OctoberÂ 1998, which committed the EU to improving the integration of its environmental and energy policies, and which contained concrete measures to this end.
Eight years have passed, and yet none of the goals set out in this document have been achieved.
Before our very eyes, a decision has been taken by politicians to construct the largest energy network of its kind, incorporating a double gas pipeline and a system of electric cables, along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
Its construction poses a threat to environmental safety, and will have a disastrous impact on the marine environment in the land-locked basin of the Baltic Sea.
There are a number of key questions that we must ask ourselves.
How much longer will we go on drafting legislation that is divorced from reality?
How much longer will our legislative acts and opinions continue to be nothing but empty slogans and platitudes that are not followed up by practical measures?
Instead of focusing our attention on solving the most pressing problems at hand, proposals have been put forward for an alternative project, namely the introduction of an environmental tax.
I am opposed to this approach.
Environmental problems will not be solved by creating tax systems.
They will instead be aggravated, since an increased tax burden will have a direct and negative impact on investment in costly new technologies.
There will also be additional costs for employers that may lead to redundancies.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work, as it shows clearly how many different issues we are actually talking about when we use the expression âsustainable development strategyâ.
Sustainable development concerns all Union policies, including, in particular, cooperation with the rest of the world.
The Commission communication makes good reading, with many well-meant, kind words, but I am disappointed that the chapter entitled âSetting objectives, targets and milestonesâ has turned out very short and also very superficial.
One has the impression that the authors are well acquainted with the problems and have analysed them well but that, as soon as it comes to combating them, they fail to penetrate beneath the surface.
I hope that the strategy announced under the Austrian Presidency is more ambitious and gives more specific answers on the subject.
We must not confine ourselves to this single strategy, however.
How seriously we take the concerns of sustainable development will also become clear from the development of Union finances in future.
If environmental and species protection are important Community objectives, that must also be reflected in the budget.
We must do our utmost to ensure that instruments, such as LIFE, that work well and are so important for the environment in Europe are allocated sufficient funds.
The Commission communication lists a number of unsustainable trends, predominantly climate change.
The Commission is therefore called upon to take those measures that represent important instruments for combating climate change.
The Eco-design Directive adopted last year provides it with ample opportunities for this.
I hope that the Commissionâs first implementing measures to this directive will soon be in place, namely for those products with high potential for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases at low cost.
Â Â  MrÂ President, firstly, I should like to thank MrsÂ Ferreira for a splendid report, which unfortunately received a couple of nasty dents in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.
The report contains some fine objectives.
I shall not repeat them in this Chamber, but they are all important.
Whenever something is really about to happen, the EUâs good intentions often all but evaporate.
Unfortunately, there is reason for fearing that that will also happen where this matter is concerned, and I was not in any degree reassured to hear the Commissionerâs contribution, which contained very few practical elements.
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has put forward three amendments: one calling for more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gases, another calling for an end to dependence on nuclear energy and a practical one concerning the problems with waste that we have due to an inconsistent approach to drinks packaging.
Each year, Denmark alone has 400 to 600 million German beer and soft drink cans floating about the countryside or on their way through the waste incineration system because the Germans allow the Danes to avoid paying deposits on beer cans bought in Germany.
With a common European deposit system, the Danish countryside and environment would fare much better, as would the cows that at present suffer torture when they chew on some of the many German beer cans lying around the countryside.
Â Â  â MrÂ President, I am much obliged to you for giving me the floor at so late an hour, on what is indeed a very important and interesting report.
I should like to start by agreeing with MrsÂ Scheele: it is true that all the policies dealt with by the Union are, and must be, subject to the principles of sustainability.
The financial situation undoubtedly forms part of this, too, and so not only should we be deliberating where we could be spending still more money, but we must also ask ourselves how we can spare the young generation excessive debt within our financial programming, whilst setting â possibly different â priorities; because debts left behind by Member States for the young generation surely cannot be considered sustainable either.
I should like to examine one point that seems to me to be very important in connection with this directive.
Firstly, I believe that strengthening ownership by improving cooperation with the actors in this field is an important tool for actually reinforcing the understanding at grass-roots level that sustainability is not a hollow principle that we only uphold when we get up on our soapboxes â to quote my fellow Members here â but that it affects each one of us quite specifically.
I should now like to discuss a specific point, namely the financing of Natura 2000 sites.
As we are of course aware, we in Western Europe, in particular, have a very high level of prosperity, and this is not god-given.
If farmers suddenly see large sections of their land marked out as Natura 2000 sites with stock protection in force, it will be very difficult to convince them that sustainability is something tangible.
We have to show these farmers that sustainability has benefits for them, too, by paying them compensation or offering them other ways of earning a living.
For this reason, we must stipulate in this directive that an effective financing system is necessary for the Natura 2000 network.
I therefore support this directive.
Â Â  Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go in particular to Anne Ferreira, and it is an agreeable opportunity to be here speaking on this subject.
Sustainable development is a phrase that should apply to all EU policy and decision-making.
Sustainable development cannot be separated from industrial, competition or economic policy, and even less so from energy, traffic or agricultural policies.
For this reason, it was a slight disappointment that this sustainable development strategy was not reviewed at the same time as the EUâs strategy on competitiveness.
EU competitiveness, of course, relies on increased growth being environmentally friendly both in production and consumption.
Consumption can be influenced by products and services at the right price.
The cost to the environment must be priced in.
This will provide an incentive for environmentally better production.
To achieve real results, reliable indicators need to be found for policy on sustainable development.
The rapporteur, among others, is of the same opinion.
Such indicators can only be obtained by establishing sufficiently ambitious quantitative and qualitative targets.
Quantitative objectives, if they are set correctly, tell us where the successes have been and what needs improving for us to achieve a state of the environment which no longer causes harm to human health anymore than to natureâs ability to withstand pollution.
If we set sufficiently high targets, they will also encourage the development, for example, of new environmental technologies, which in turn will boost European growth, and in this way we will attain real sustainable development.
Â Â  Â The debate is closed.
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12Â noon.
Â Â  The next item is the presentation of the programme of the Austrian Presidency.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, I extend my very warm greetings to all of you here this morning.
It gives me great pleasure to be able to address the European Parliament.
It is an honour to present, on behalf of the Republic of Austria, a brief summary of the programme for the six months of our presidency.
The European Parliament is a very special institution, embodying as it does, in a unique way, the strength of the new Europe.
This Parliament is the result of a historic election in 2004.
For the first time, 25 nations held free elections simultaneously; they elected their assembly to represent them, the , the European people.
The division of Europe was thus ended once and for all, although the process of reunifying Europe is still proceeding unabated.
This Parliament is a marvellous illustration of the greatest strength of this new Europe, with its diversity of ideas and experiences, its history and also its life stories and its hopes.
We know that the tone of Europe is not that of a solo instrument but that of an orchestra, and the same applies to this Parliament.
Europe is not monochrome but colourful, as the logo of the Austrian presidency symbolises.
And this strength, this diversity, the numerous identities of Europe, make our Union what it is.
No country has lost out by acceding to the European Union.
All of us have benefited.
We have gained freedom, peace, security and paths to prosperity.
Yet if everything is so wonderful, you might well ask, why are so many of our citizens distinctly sceptical?
We must be quite specific about this and analyse the situation honestly.
The high points of the historic year of 2004 were followed by a particularly difficult phase.
After three years of intensive negotiations on a new constitution, the outcome was rejected in referenda in France and the Netherlands.
Then came the strenuous tug-of-war over the Financial Perspective for the next seven years.
There were terrorist attacks in some EU capitals, growing concerns among the population about further enlargements of the EU and a real lack of trust among the people of the EU in its institutions.
For this reason we have made it an aim of the Austrian presidency to tackle this particular problem.
By the end of our presidency we want to see new growth in peopleâs trust in Europe, in trust between the Member States and indeed in trust between the European institutions.
If we want to achieve that aim, we must first seek answers to the major questions that occupy peopleâs minds.
A friend of mine, the great Austrian quantum physicist AntonÂ Zeilinger, drew my attention to a facet of physics of which I had never really been aware and which I certainly found extremely fascinating.
He told me that the question is the important thing.
In quantum physics, he said, this is far more elemental than in the general ideological context.
The question elicits the truth, and the way in which the question is asked determines the quality of that truth.
This is why we must begin by asking these questions.
They must be straight questions, and we must also be aware of their unpleasant implications.
We shall not have equally satisfactory answers to all of them, but we must also beware of rapid shortcuts.
There is a need to listen, for Europe must be both useful and protective.
The many real threats that exist are helping to focus our minds on these attributes.
On 1Â January of this year, the day on which we took over the presidency, the New Year concert was held in Vienna, an event in which we try to radiate a little optimism as well as merriment.
Just as the Latvian conductor, MarisÂ Jansons, raised his baton, the Russians cut their gas deliveries, first by 30% and then, in the night of 1 to 2 January, by 50%.
Martin Bartenstein, the Minister for Economics and Labour, who is responsible for energy affairs, then had the task of seeking solutions with our partners â the Ukrainians, the Russians and our European partners â and with Commissioner Piebalgs.
This incident brought home to us that, in a matter that has hitherto fallen within the reserved powers of the Member States, major problems can now be resolved only at the European level.
This is an area where we need more European involvement.
When it comes to reducing dependence on a single supplier, of diversifying, of stocking sufficient reserves and of making energy-supply networks secure â which will only be possible, incidentally, if we encourage long-term investments and permit long-term supply connections and contracts â we must not take the short-term view and focus on profits for the next quarter; long-term solutions are the only answer for Europe.
It is also a matter of choices.
I have always defended the right and responsibility of every country to choose its energy sources.
We have chosen our way, which does not include nuclear technology and its peaceful use, and I shall uphold that decision.
But I shall also campaign for every countryâs right to preserve its freedom of choice.
I believe that we must take very great care not to slide into a one-sided approach.
We in the European Union must work together to put safety standards first, and we must devote more attention than ever to renewable sources of energy and ensure that every option of importance to us and to our environment is fully explored.
This question of the security of energy supplies will be an important topic in the European spring summit.
At this point I should also like to thank the British presidency of the Council for dealing comprehensively with this question and showing a good nose for imminent developments by giving it ample attention at Hampton Court.
We shall cooperate closely with the Commission too in this matter.
Other topics are the fight against bird flu and the need for a firm stand against the Iranian nuclear modernisation programme.
In these areas, more Europe and a united European front in the global arena are essential if we are to be able to give security guarantees to people in the world and especially in Europe.
The second very important topic which is preoccupying people is that of growth and employment.
It is the key subject of the spring summit, for without jobs, without the prospect of finding work, it goes without saying that the people of Europe will become increasingly apprehensive.
Many feel that Europe is doing too little for them in this area.
There are now 25 reform programmes on the table, which the Commission will assess.
We have opted for a mix of specific verifiable voluntary commitments by the 25 Member States plus recommendations from the Commission with a view to moving into the practical phase of the initiative and achieving visible results.
No politician can promise jobs today; to do so would be rash.
But we can create favourable conditions.
Everyone knows, and you know best of all, that with 1% of Europeâs gross national income, as in the present budget, or with 1.045% or 1.1%, it is not possible to create millions of jobs.
We can, however, set an example, and we can verify the Member Statesâ fulfilment of their voluntary commitments.
Above all, we can put some new items on the European agenda that have perhaps received less attention in the past.
One of these items, in my view, is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises.
Many such businesses used to complain that they received insufficient attention, that they did not have enough access to capital and to EU programmes.
We have to realise that SMEs could be the only real job machine in the Union.
SMEs are a sleeping giant that we must waken.
SMEs need access to capital markets, research and development, and this is something the Commission must address in the SME programme it presents.
They need access and consideration when it comes to the allocation of regional support from the structural funds.
The Better Regulation programme must include specific measures to lower SMEsâ administrative costs.
Cutting red tape is an important objective, particularly with regard to SMEs.
Another great source of strength that has not been adequately tapped is the partnership between the representative bodies of management and labour at the European level, the European social partners.
From our Austrian experience, I can say that democracy and the market economy cannot work properly without free, strong and independent representatives of employers and employees.
The Austrian model is certainly quite interesting.
It is not as if agreements are reached without discussion: there are very frequent exchanges of opinion and sometimes even wrangles.
It would be absurd to think that these things could be settled without arguments in a democracy.
They often serve to pep up the political debate.
Under our presidency, I should also like to invite the European social partners to join us in the pursuit of these goals â jobs, growth, energy security â and I have already had very good talks with the European Trade Union Confederation and the employersâ organisation UNICE.
The Services Directive will be very important in this respect.
I know that Parliament has been grappling tenaciously with this matter.
After more than 1Â 000 amendments, you will have seen for yourselves how difficult it is to combine the opening of such a large sector of the market with the guarantees that the public expect of us.
It goes without saying that the opening of markets must necessarily be accompanied by resolute action against social dumping and by efforts to protect the familiar public services that our local authorities have traditionally provided.
We need that balance.
Openness and protection are what is expected of us.
I should like to have the social partners with us in this effort so that a proper balance can be struck.
The key to all of this, of course, is sufficient growth.
There is no getting away from that.
Above all, the spring summit must be devoted to the stimulation of growth.
This requires not only research and infrastructure but enlargement too.
Enlargement, if prudently and properly carried out, can be a growth strategy for Europe as well as for our industries in the old Member States.
If we had 3% growth, coupled with at least 1% employment growth, the present unemployment figure of 19 million would be halved within five years.
That is a hugely ambitious target, but if we also enhance our training systems and create greater flexibility, we can achieve it.
This is surely where the real work has to be done.
Faced with fierce competition from Asia and the United States and in the light of present demographic trends, we simply cannot afford to have part of our labour force inadequately trained or fail to maximise its employability.
A very important issue for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament will, of course, be the negotiation of the Financial Perspective for the next seven years.
I make no bones about this.
We need and want your cooperation, because the creation of a seven-year Financial Perspective â a rare occurrence, since most of our budgeting covers a period of only one or two years â naturally brings security and predictability.
I know there are many in the European Parliament who are not content with what the European Council only just managed to adopt in December after much toil and trouble, but I must also tell you plainly that those who want more research must look first and foremost at the national budgets.
If we in the Member States were truly committed to implementing what was, after all, our own decision to devote 3% of our national budgets to research by 2010, that would produce not only EUR 200 billion a year for research but 50% more, in other words EUR 300 billion â far more than an allocation in the general budget, however ambitious it might be, could yield.
I must be frank with you: we are reaching our limits with the Financial Perspective.
If we go on having to, or choosing to, engage in the surgical removal of membership contributions from national budgets to finance the work of the Union, this will have been the last time we managed to put together a Financial Perspective.
I shall tell you straight â and some may not like to hear this â that Europe needs to become more self-funding.
It is not right that we should have to extract all our resources from the national budgets, which are already under pressure.
That is precisely what drags us into this lamentable tension between net contributors and net recipients, into a situation where everyone looks for winners and losers.
The idea of a shift in the direction of self-financing may not be universally popular, but my duty as President of the Council is not to say popular things but rather to say what needs to be said.
I believe we must focus attention on this point, and I know that the President of the Commission, MrÂ Barroso, takes a very similar view.
It is up to the Commission to put all these considerations on the table in the review of 2008/09.
It is surely absurd that the profits of short-term financial speculation are completely exempt from taxation today.
It is unacceptable that tax loopholes exist and that international air or sea travel is practically tax-free.
Europe cannot tolerate this situation when there are important tasks that cannot be financed.
I therefore ask the Commission to include this issue in its review, and I also ask explicitly for the support of the European Parliament.
If we want a strong Europe, we cannot coyly or timidly avoid this issue.
Here in the front row I see Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, and our esteemed High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, who often have to go round cap in hand to raise money for vital peace missions, and all because we have not had the courage to discuss these matters sufficiently.
The new Europe you represent also needs new solidarity among the institutions.
It makes no sense for the Council, the Commission, Parliament and the Member States to criticise each other.
We are all in the same boat, and we have to row in the same direction.
Not head-to-head confrontation but hand-in-hand cooperation â that is my principle and my motto for this presidency.
We must listen when some of our citizens bemoan the misuse of EU funding or the squandering of resources within some programmes.
There are cures for these ills in the form of independent scrutiny.
We must listen when some people call for greater transparency in European decision-making â in the Councilâs legislative activity, for example â or for funding awards to be publicised so that people know who has actually benefited.
Why not?
It is only right that such information should be published.
This is European taxpayersâ money.
We must work together on this.
We must also listen to people who say, âIt is all very well to have a fairly efficient economy, but what has happened to the protection of ordinary people, to social cohesion and to care for the vulnerable?â
A few days ago, in his at the European College of Parma, JacquesÂ Delors made a statement that struck a chord with me.
He said, âFinding a balance between the market and social policy means recognising social issues as a development factor and not as a by-product of the market economyâ
âFinding a balance between social values and the power of the market economy, and recognising social issues as a development factor and not as a by-product of the economy.â
I find that incredibly interesting.
This is the very motto that ultimately sums up our European way of life and that we shall also take with us into the discussion on the future of Europe, with which I should like to conclude my remarks.
In the first half-year up to the June summit, it falls to us to conduct this discussion on the future of Europe.
Since last June the Austrian presidency has had a mandate to engage in such a discussion together with the European Parliament here, with the Commission, which we also ask for fresh impetus, with the national parliaments and, of course, with the European public.
Parliament, I know, will â today or tomorrow â adopt a good and well-balanced resolution on the basis of a report from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
I take that very seriously and will continue to do so during the Austrian presidency.
It must not be an elitist debate; Europe concerns everyone.
Many Europeans are longing for involvement, for a stake in the future of Europe.
It is not only about a document.
It is about far more than that: it is about the identity of Europe. What connects us?
What internal forces actually hold us together? It is about a fair division of responsibilities: what can Europe do, and what must it do?
Those who seek to resolve the major issues must have both hands free to tackle the task.
Our hands will not be free unless we let go of other things.
An earnest desire to resolve major issues presupposes readiness to relinquish responsibility for minor issues to other institutions.
This is where the word âsubsidiarityâ comes into play, a concept we are forever invoking in our soap-box rhetoric.
We must bring it to life.
To this end, we shall devote a special conference to it after Easter.
This discussion is also about the boundaries of Europe.
Translated into concrete terms, this means the criteria that determine the absorption capacity of the Union.
These boundaries must not be drawn by surveyors or geographers.
They are a political matter.
The political debate must focus on absorption capacity.
It must also focus on the visibility of Europe in the world and within its own borders.
I think it is wrong that we should only meet in Brussels or here in Strasbourg.
Europe must be visible in its peripheral areas too, in other aspects of life.
As a presidency, we see how interesting it is for people to discover, experience, grasp and sense that Europe is not afraid to reach out to its citizens.
They must even be able to vent their anger on occasion so that this European model can work.
I am talking about a European way of life.
I have never understood why, when the Americans talk proudly of their way of life, we Europeans never dare to talk openly, boldly and with pride about our own.
Peace, security, democracy, human rights, solidarity and quality of life â these are things that are not to be taken for granted, nor are any of them achieved without a struggle.
In the light of these considerations, we shall present a draft route map with timetables and/or an interim report by the month of June.
Controversies and divergent points of view are not only deemed acceptable in this discussion but positively welcomed.
The worst thing would be for me to convene a discussion here to which nobody came or no one contributed.
As MartinÂ Buber once said, everyone is called to bring something in this world to completion.
This applies especially to Europe.
Europe is teamwork.
The British held the presidency before us.
We shall build on their work, and this year, we and the Finns have a well-coordinated joint operational programme on the basis of which we shall conduct our presidencies in tandem.
In so doing, we intend to be reliable partners for you in the European Parliament and for you in the Commission.
I look forward to our cooperation with great confidence, and I also hope that we can enthuse and inspire the people of Europe with our joint efforts.
I wish you all the very best.
Â Â  MrÂ President, MrÂ SchÃŒssel, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to take the floor today on the occasion of the presentation of the work programme of the Austrian Presidency.
We are all aware of the skills and the traditions of Austrian diplomacy.
If I may say so, I have long been aware of MrÂ SchÃŒsselâs intelligence and of his devotion to the European cause.
I am particularly pleased that this Presidency can begin its work already, armed with a vision of the financial perspective, thanks to the agreement obtained at the December European Council.
As I have already said, this agreement marked an important moment for Europe, a moment in which Europe was able to demonstrate that it continues to be effective and relevant.
The agreement has enabled a relatively optimistic climate to be created for 2006, which will be a crucial year.
We must now pursue, and give concrete expression to, this dynamic approach.
Although the Council took a step forward in December, it is now up to us to take the next step together, that is to say to make very swift progress in negotiating and concluding an interinstitutional agreement.
I have been saying this for months: the agreement of the three institutions is necessary, and effective cooperation between them is crucial.
It is now time for us to turn our words into deeds.
In this context, allow me to lay special emphasis on the measures connected to citizenship, particularly those related to culture and to young people.
Further efforts are required in this area in order to fulfil our shared commitment to make our people more in touch with our measures and to promote the European dimension.
As from 1Â February, the Commission will be proposing an amended draft interinstitutional agreement, which will serve as the basis for our negotiations.
As you know, aside from the question of resources, we still need to specify important points on which the Commission has fully exercised its influence: more flexibility and adaptability of our resources, the creation of a Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the prospect of a revision clause.
The Commission considers that these elements of flexibility will be crucial in reaching an agreement between the three institutions.
We must also work together towards the adoption of a set of legislative proposals that will give effect to the interinstitutional agreement, once it has been adopted.
In that area too, efforts will be required of the Council groups, the parliamentary committees and the Commission services.
This is a real challenge but one that we cannot overlook.
We must in fact see to it that the Union is ready to get down to the job on 1Â January 2007.
If the deadlines were to be missed, then we would seriously run the risk of being late in implementing the Structural Funds, which are key elements for solidarity within an enlarged Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, in the context of Europe, the forthcoming year is, on the one hand, rich in possibilities and, on the other hand, fraught with responsibilities.
The Presidency will be able to count on the Commissionâs full support and cooperation.
We see a close interrelationship between the programme of the Austrian Presidency and the objectives pursued by the Commission since taking up its duties, and particularly its strategic objectives.
Armed with its culture and values, Europe will be able to go forward if it can simultaneously make progress in three areas: economic performance, social cohesion and the sustainable management of its resources.
To succeed in this, Europe needs a real partnership involving all the actors.
We need everyoneâs contribution so that Europe can release its full potential.
Mr President, growth and jobs are the core preoccupation of our citizens.
We must show them that Europe can deliver a credible response to their concerns.
The Spring European Council in March is the first real test of the determination of all actors to move forward towards economic reform and modernisation.
Member States have drawn up their national reform programmes.
The Commission is finalising its appraisal of those programmes and will report to the Spring European Council.
I should like to thank the European Parliament for its support and look forward to continuing working closely with you on the growth and jobs agenda.
The parliamentary dimension of the Lisbon Agenda is not window dressing but an essential element in promoting and ensuring support for the implementation of the necessary reforms.
In that sense, we can say that the revised Lisbon Agenda has already been successful.
It has managed to create a common vision and a strong consensus.
Nobody seriously continues to contest that the priority should be on growth for jobs.
It is now time to turn words into deeds, vision into action.
The message we need from the Spring European Council is that Europe has made a credible commitment to structural reforms and is determined to exploit fully all its potential for growth and more and better jobs.
We therefore welcome the Austrian Presidencyâs willingness to inject new dynamism into the discussion of some pending proposals that are key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, including the Services Directive.
The establishment of a well-functioning internal market in the area of services is a key opportunity to free up the potential of Europe.
The Commission will cooperate fully with the Presidency and Parliament to seek political agreement on directives between the Council and Parliament.
I welcome the fact that Parliament is actively preparing the ground for a balanced approach, that is to say, an approach that will apply the Treaty provisions on trade in services while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with working and employment conditions for posted workers and recognising the specific nature of services of general interest.
For this purpose, I believe the role of the European social partners can be a crucial one.
We will be calling on our social partners for a joint contribution to a balanced ambitious solution for the services sector.
Let us be frank about this: the services sector and small and medium-sized enterprises are the most important drivers for the creation of jobs in Europe.
They should receive the support they deserve from political leaders.
Progress on the revised Lisbon Agenda will have to factor in the work undertaken as a follow-up to the Hampton Court meeting.
This covers key areas like research and development, universities, demographic change, energy, migration, security and the role of Europe in the world.
The Commission will propose new initiatives in the fields of research and education, preparing the establishment of a European institute of technology and furthering work on the mutual comparability and recognition of qualifications.
We will provide a focus for debate on demographic change and on its implications for a fairer work/life balance.
We shall also present a roadmap for gender equality which will look at different European Union policies and see how they can contribute to reducing gender gaps in employment or unemployment conditions and to addressing the phenomenon of violence against women and trafficking.
We will seek to strengthen the effectiveness of the European Union in pursuing its external objectives and interests by increasing the coherence of our action.
Energy issues mark the debut of this Presidency, and I want to thank the Austrian Presidency for its excellent cooperation in dealing with the recent gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine.
Energy issues will remain a dominant theme of our future agenda.
The recent crisis and persistently high oil prices teach a lesson to those who normally resist and obstruct the provision of a European dimension for energy policy and to all those who always resist a European dimension in politics and policy-making.
Europe must have an improved, more coordinated energy policy based on the principles of diversification of sources, security of supply and sustainability.
Well before Hampton Court, when leaders clearly stressed the need for a new approach, the Commission announced a green paper on secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy.
We are also preparing a series of new initiatives on energy efficiency and clean technologies.
We will take up the debate initiated with the Biomass Action Plan and complement it with a communication on biofuels.
Finally, we will put forward ideas for developing a real pan-European energy market, enhancing cooperation with our neighbouring countries.
This is an example of common sense driving a common approach, where no option should be excluded.
National leaders and citizens see the sense of a common, coherent European policy.
Now is the moment for the European institutions to play their role with ambition and rigour.
I look forward to working with you over the coming months to give shape to European energy policy.
This brings me to another important point.
The Commission has presented sustainable development as an overarching objective and, last December, presented a communication on the review of the Sustainable Development Strategy.
We welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency has chosen to put that at the top of its priorities.
This will provide the momentum needed to complete the preparation of a new European Union Sustainable Development Strategy.
The Commission document is an ambitious and concrete one.
It offers a long-term vision for addressing issues such as climate change, preservation of natural resources, social exclusion and world poverty.
It sets clear objectives, realistic targets and procedures for monitoring and measuring progress.
It identifies involving all stakeholders â not only institutions, but business too â in a real partnership as a priority.
Regional authorities and citizens should work together to deliver concrete results.
Another issue that will remain high up on the European agenda in the coming months is security.
I am pleased to see that the priorities of the Austrian Presidency in the area of freedom, justice and security match those of the Commission.
The translation of the aid programme into practical measures remains our common priority.
In the area of migration, we shall pursue the debate launched by the Policy Plan on Legal Migration, adopted in December 2005, and come forward with proposals on the long-term resident status of persons in need of international protection.
During this semester we shall also table a green paper on drugs and civil society, a proposal on the applicable law in divorce matters, and a green paper on conflict of law in the area of matrimonial property regimes.
The Commission will present the first implementation report on The Hague Action Plan.
We look forward to achieving significant progress on those important files during the Austrian Presidency.
One last priority that I want to comment on is our relations with our neighbours.
The year 2006 will be a decisive period.
In the spring, the Commission will review the progress made by Bulgaria and Romania in preparing for accession and assess the level of their readiness to join the Union.
On the Western Balkans, we welcome the priority set by the Austrian Presidency.
Since 2003 the countries of the Western Balkans have had a clear European perspective. That process is critical for ensuring peace and stability in Europe.
The Commission attaches a great deal of importance to the careful monitoring of the situation in the region and the regionâs relationship with the Union.
That is why I have decided personally to visit the region in the coming weeks.
Europe also needs to prepare to take greater responsibility in Kosovo.
As discussions on Kosovoâs future status reach a critical stage, the European Union has to show that it is able to bring a concrete contribution to a complex and delicate issue.
Last year, Heads of State and Government launched a period of reflection on the future of Europe.
Citizens, civil society and political actors are expressing and debating their views, expectations and ideas.
The Commission is playing its part fully, implementing Plan âDâ for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate.
I am pleased to report that members of the Commission made a total of 68 visits to national parliaments in the course of 2005, explaining our policies and their added value to European citizens, and listening, because a process of dialogue is not just about explaining; it is also, and above all, about listening to the message citizens give to us.
The European Parliament, with its counterparts in the national parliaments, is putting its weight behind this debate.
The Commission is ready to cooperate fully with its initiatives.
European leaders before us were prepared to dream of what could be.
They had the courage of their European convictions.
They opened a pathway to reconciliation and progress for Europe which none had walked before.
Today we are the beneficiaries of that legacy and of their foresight.
However, at a time when past achievements and current freedoms are so easily discounted, we cannot take future public consent for granted.
It must be earned.
My vision is of a stronger Europe which provides a solid political, economic and social framework for our citizens, a Europe based on culture, a Europe based on common values. It is of a Europe of democracy, accountability and transparency.
In our troubled world today, we more than ever need a strong European Union, a European Union which promotes security, human rights and respect for the rule of law.
Following the June European Council, the Commission will take stock of the preliminary results of the public debate and of discussions under Plan âDâ.
We also intend, at the request of the Austrian Presidency, to propose an agenda for further debate and action at European level.
This will provide a basis for the Heads of State and Government to determine the way forward for the Union with a renewed commitment to translate our common objectives into actions.
The Unionâs main asset is a core of common values and a rich culture which should inspire our reflection on the future of Europe.
Institutions are important, of course they are, but institutions are instruments for achieving our goals and we should not forget the main goals of our project.
We need to provide determined leadership and reinforced consensus to bring Europe forward together.
We need to concentrate on the essentials. We need to focus on delivery.
We need to communicate our public purpose in plain and meaningful terms.
I shall conclude by saying, as I told Chancellor SchÃŒssel when I and other commissioners visited him in Vienna, that I think it was a great decision by the Austrian Presidency to choose all the beautiful and bright colours of Europe as its logo.
I believe it is now time for us to do away with grey and black colours, to insist on the possibilities of such diversity of Europe and to use these very important six months of the Austrian Presidency to show our renewed commitment to a Europe that belongs to the future and believes in that future.
Â Â  . MrÂ President, MrÂ President-in-Office, MrÂ President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying, MrÂ President-in-Office, that we expect a great deal of you, because, as you stated yourself, Europe needs trust and progress.
These great expectations we have of you and your presidency are not a purely abstract wish but are based on our justifiable hope that you will perform your task wisely, in other words with both ambition and realism.
I remember well when Austria held the presidency of the Council in 1998.
Your countryâs leaders, and you in particular, are convinced Europeans whose commitment to Europe is about action rather than mere rhetoric, and you are competent too.
I hope and believe that, at the end of this half-year, we shall be able to say that yours was a successful presidency.
It is still too early to pass judgment, of course, but the basic conditions are favourable.
You mentioned something that I believe to be the key principle for Europe, namely that public trust in the European institutions must flow from the mutual trust between heads of government.
I am truly hopeful that you will manage to portray the European Council and the governments as a decisive body that is also united in its desire to move Europe forward, thereby dispelling the impression that all heads of government are unable to look beyond their countriesâ perceived national interests and will be the ruination of Europe.
In the European Council, we must begin to act for Europe on the basis of mutual trust.
We in Europe must know that there can be no response to the great challenges of the present day without Europe.
Europe is not the answer to every problem, but the great challenges will not be met without it.
The President of the Commission said that the European institutions are a means to an end.
Yes, that is true, and it means that we need the European institutions to ensure that some governments do not take it upon themselves to dictate the way forward.
This is not confined to the large countries.
We in the Group of the European Peopleâs Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are opposed to a Union dominated by the large countries.
At the same time, having heard the Foreign Minister of the Netherlands say, only yesterday or the day before, that the European constitution was dead, we regard that as no less a bid for dominance, implying as it does that all other countries should follow the Netherlandsâ lead.
We shall not accept that either.
You spoke of employment, the economy and growth.
We endorse everything you said, but when we speak of support for small and medium-sized enterprises, we are not asking for subsidies.
What these businesses want is relief from the burden of taxation and red tape.
If we can provide that through the European and national ground rules, jobs can then be created too.
This is why we say that small and medium-sized businesses should be at the heart of our thinking on economic policy.
This also means, of course, that we say âyesâ to European legislation, including the Services Directive.
You spoke of openness and protection.
That is precisely the balance we must strike.
We are working on this in the European Parliament, and I hope we shall succeed in finding an acceptable solution at first reading in February.
I am delighted that my Socialist friend agrees, but I would never venture to speak for his Group.
He will do that himself shortly.
When we speak of the Services Directive, I must also say that Europeâs ability to deal with the major problems arising from globalisation would be weakened in the absence of an internal market.
This is why we need the single European market as a response to globalisation.
On the constitution, we ask you to draw up a timetable, so that we ultimately arrive at an outcome which all countries of the European Union can support, because we â and here I am speaking for the PPE section of our Group â are firmly convinced that we need the constitution.
Finally, energy was mentioned here.
It goes without saying that the energy debate is partly about our own supply, about ourselves and our prosperity.
Our prosperity will ultimately count for nothing, however, if it is not rooted in democracy.
This is why we shall not tolerate a situation in which one of the G8 countries set different prices for countries such as Ukraine, which are democracies, and countries like Belarus, which is run by a ruthless dictator but gets cheaper gas.
We shall not be a party to this; we want to be an advocate for all our neighbours on the basis of sound social development, on the basis of democracy, the rule of law and human dignity.
We wish you every success in this effort.
Â Â  MrÂ President, ladies and gentlemen, Federal Chancellor â for a German Social Democrat, that form of address already has a wistfully nostalgic charm about it â I listened to you very carefully, and I must say that your speech was impressive, particularly the way it was presented.
Listening to you, one has the impression that it is a real pleasure to sit on the European Council, that it is great to be President of the Council, a truly noble calling.
But appearances are deceptive, as your own bitter experience has shown and as you will have realised from the outset.
