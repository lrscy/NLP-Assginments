Of the remaining amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 8 and 9 or that section of Amendment No 11 that concerns matters to be included in the review, as the Commission considers the common position has taken them sufficiently into account.
Mr President, I would finally like to say that Parliament has, for its part, significantly improved the proposal under discussion.
I therefore want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Heidi Hautala, for the work she has done.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on her great capacity for dialogue and for her work, which have allowed us to reach agreement.
We entirely agree with her that it is important for citizens to have access as soon as possible to fuels with a low sulphur content.
The present directive is a response to the conclusions of the Auto-Oil programmes carried out by the Commission and will allow us to enjoy better air quality, which we are pleased about.
It is clear that the objective of this directive is one hundred per cent environmental and everybody therefore welcomes it.
However, we must be pragmatic and analyse the circumstances.
The production of new sulphur-free fuels will lead to increases in CO2 in the refineries and furthermore those refineries are going to have to make very costly investments in order to produce them.
Nevertheless, thanks to technological advances in relation to vehicle engines and catalytic converters, it is possible today to achieve a positive balance in the reduction of CO2 emissions, because those coming from refineries will be less than the reductions in emissions from vehicles using the new fuel.
But this will only happen when the marketing of sulphur-free fuels is matched by a sufficient number of vehicles technologically adapted to use this fuel.
Current automobiles can perfectly well use the new fuels but without the intended reduction in CO2 emissions.
In other words, if the balanced availability and production of the new fuels does not take place alongside a renewal of the vehicles in use, there may be a global increase in emissions, and this would imply significant costs.
We can oblige companies - by means of a directive - to market fuel with 10 ppm of sulphur, but we cannot oblige consumers to change cars at the same time.
We therefore support - and I would ask Parliament to support - the possibility of reviewing in 2005 the period for the full introduction of diesel fuel, especially for agricultural tractors and other non-road vehicles, because, although it is desirable for them to use sulphur-free fuel, the truth is that the pace of renewal for these vehicles is much slower and the volume of fuel consumed is relatively small.
Finally, although this has been mentioned, as rapporteur for the report on the biofuels directive, I am going to refer to volatility, which could affect its application.
I am talking about the technical specifications for the fuels used in mixtures.
The mixture of bioethanol with gasoline produces an increase in the volatility of the resulting fuel and in countries with hot summers the pressure limits set at around 10% may be exceeded during that season.
This seriously harms the competitiveness of those mixtures.
But the proposal on biofuels was presented by the Commission after the first reading of this directive on the quality of petrols and we have therefore not had the opportunity to present an ad hoc amendment in this regard for this second reading.
I would therefore ask the Commission and the Council, in application of Articles 9 and 10 of Directive 98/70/EC, to propose new specifications and test methods for biofuels and for fuels used by captive fleets.
Furthermore, it is urgent to authorise mixture contents greater than 5%.
I have also spoken to automobile manufacturers and they assure me that mixtures of 10% are perfectly useable in current engines without any need for change and without harming the engine.
Biofuels are a good way to improve the air quality in our cities, as well, and, above all, to diversify the sources of energy supply.
Mr President, in my view, Mrs Hautala has once again drawn up a very important report, which has received much support in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
In addition, the Group of the Greens fully endorses the 13 amendments.
This whole report would, in fact, have been redundant if four years ago, during the negotiations with the Council, we had been able to persuade the ministers to consider the figures too.
The Council of Environmental Ministers, however, proved insufficiently flexible.
In those days, the discussion centred on the question whether we should aim for 50 ppm low-sulphur or whether we should aim for less.
We now talk about 10 ppm sulphur-free.
Sulphur is the poison for catalytic converters, just as lead was the poison for first-generation catalytic converters.
We are now talking about an improved generation of catalytic converters that are about to be used.
This is therefore regrettable.
I should like to point out that it was Germany that got the ball rolling, and I am pleased that we have now reached a satisfactory result.
I do have a few questions for the Christian Democrats, because I do not understand why they claim that tractors should be treated differently.
Tractors benefit just as much from this clean fuel, which means they produce less pollution.
Even old tractors that have not yet been fitted with new catalytic converters stand to gain environmentally.
It is, of course, true that this new fuel will be somewhat more expensive than the old, polluting fuel.
If the problem is that farmers need to pay slightly more, then I, as a member of the Group of the Greens, think that the importance of the issue warrants this.
If this is the real problem to the Christian Democrats, they should say so.
It would be unfortunate if they abstained from the vote tomorrow, for then we would be unable to achieve the required majority.
It is also important for the industry to know at this stage what the exact requirements are without having to wait until 2005.
This is why I should like to urge the Christian Democrats to reconsider this report very carefully and then perhaps to be soft-hearted after all and vote along with the entire Committee of the Environment.
Mr President, with regard to the development of better vehicles from an environmental point of view, we are on the verge of great, radical changes.
Within the next few years, new engines will reduce fuel consumption and improve exhaust cleanliness.
Modern sensor technology, like fuel sensors, makes engines much better from an environmental point of view, but the engines will also at the same time be more sensitive to contamination.
These environmental improvements will not be possible unless they go hand in hand with improved fuel quality.
Cleaner fuels give us the opportunity to make use of all the environmental advantages of new engine technology.
Poor fuel technology, on the other hand, can be detrimental to the new generation of engines and harm the technology and engine function.
This directive is very urgent, and it constitutes an important step towards a lower level of air pollution and a better environment.
Before Parliament's first reading of the draft directive, I prepared 14 amendments with the aim of tightening up the requirements on fuel quality.
Most of them were adopted, and I am very happy that, in the common position, the Council accepts the majority of Parliament's proposals from the first reading.
A large part of the debate in the second reading was focused on the question of whether all vehicles should be covered by this directive.
There is engine technology for mobile machines and tractors, so that they can be covered, like other vehicles, by the Fuel Directive.
No exemption is required for so-called sulphur-free diesel.
It is a misconception that old engines require sulphur in the fuel and that new engines cannot handle sulphurous fuel.
If these vehicles are fully covered by the directive, the environment will be the clear winner.
Why, therefore, should we not also take this step?
A possible tax reduction could counteract the increased costs resulting from cleaner fuels, for farmers for example.
The EU's Auto-Oil Programme, together with this Fuel Directive, will have great significance in reducing the negative environmental effects of vehicle traffic.
This shows that the EU has strength and competence in important environmental issues and that the use of modern environmental technology is better than a ban.
The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has taken the matter forwards to a clear improvement, and it is my hope that Parliament will accept the report from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.
Mr President, I am probably going to be the only person here tonight with my position on this particular report.
This report is viewed with extreme concern, regardless of what the rapporteur has said with regard to the United Kingdom.
It will have an adverse effect on our agriculture, our farmers and our fishermen.
Where I come from in Northern Ireland the rural community is falling apart.
To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong.
I want to make it very clear from the outset that I, my delegation, and those I represent are totally in favour of improvement to the highest possible standards.
I will support those higher standards.
But I have a problem when we impose from on high purist-type ideas on those who cannot defend themselves.
That is what I oppose.
I am totally opposed to trying to impose this on off-road vehicles, be they vehicles that are used on farms, or the many other vehicles used in quarries or elsewhere.
If we have to, let us set standards somewhere down the road longer-term.
Let us work towards that as technology develops, but to sit here and say that we can impose this from this European Parliament is totally unacceptable.
If you want to know why Europe is unpopular in many areas of the European Union, just look at this type of proposal.
What do the people say?
They say 'Oh, there is Big Brother Brussels telling us what to do again'.
Why do we not use common sense?
Why do we not use our own initiative and not have the European Union hurting its own citizens while the rest of the world merely goes on its way destroying the environment?
We have seen from Johannesburg and from Kyoto and elsewhere that they do not pay a jot of attention to what we say.
I understand that off-road vehicles account for about 8.5% of the diesel vehicles in the European Union.
Commissioner, it is within your and the Council's powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way.
That is what I support.
I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow.
I, along with the people I represent, will take great delight in voting against it.
I hope it is defeated because then in the longer term you will come back with a proposal that represents the common sense view of everyone in this European Union, and not just those with purist ideals who do not have to face the consequences of imposing their ideals on others.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0288/2002) by Mr Callanan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position on recreational craft.
Mr President, I have a few points to make, but I can see that the debate has hardly engendered rapt enthusiasm among the packed ranks of Members so I will be as brief as possible and let everybody get away for their dinner.
I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner and all those who have taken an interest in the report for being here this evening.
It might be a minor subject, but it is very important to those involved in the recreational boating industry and those many thousands of people across Europe who also indulge their hobby of boating.
Many of the problems apparent in the legislation at first reading have been substantially resolved by the Council at second reading.
Most of the retrospective elements in the proposal at first reading have now been removed and I can broadly support the Commission's proposals at second reading, albeit with a few riders.
I tabled a few amendments for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, some of which were accepted.
Most of the technical amendments we put forward were accepted.
I shall just run through a few of the problems that I still see with the legislation.
I continue to have doubts about the effectiveness of a regulatory committee, particularly one empowered to alter quite important items of the directive such as Froude numbers.
The committee supported my recommendations on that and the amendments are up for vote tomorrow.
I continue to believe that craft built for users' own use should be exempted for five years, provided they are not placed on the market.
This directive was introduced under single-market legislation and it is self-evident that if those craft are not intended to be placed on the market, then they cannot affect the single market.
The issue of in-use compliance testing is a particularly thorny one.
I understand that at some stage the Commission will be coming back with proposals on that.
I hope it will consider that issue very carefully.
The last thing we want is an extremely bureaucratic system imposed on the boat owners and users of Europe.
It needs to be very simple and effective and, above all, free of charge to those who have boats at the moment.
Finally, I should like to tell our German colleagues that a number of amendments - I call them the Bodensee amendments because they are the result of lobbying from the Lake Constance authorities - have been tabled.
There are broadly two categories of amendments.
Firstly, those tabled to allow Member States to set their own limits in particular local circumstances.
I am not usually against Member States derogating from European regulations, but if we are going to produce a directive whose specific purpose is to permit a single market across Europe and then introduce specific exemptions into the directive, that would defeat the whole point of having it in the first place.
Secondly, I have a particular problem with the so-called Table 1a amendment, again based on the Bodensee limits, but even stricter.
Again it would be a barrier to trade.
However, I would say to our colleagues on the Bodensee that, if there is a problem in this particular stretch of water, then, firstly, there is no evidence that it is caused by recreational craft and, secondly, that if there is a difficulty it can be solved by local measures in the area of Lake Constance.
Speed and navigational limits could be imposed, and I entirely support their right to do that.
But do not saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits just to solve a particular problem that the German and Austrian authorities might have.
I have looked quite extensively at the limits proposed in that table with boat-users' representatives and representatives from industry, and there are no commercially available engines on the market that meet those limits at the moment.
Obviously technology could be developed further, but it would require the use of catalytic converter technology, which is extremely difficult in a marine environment.
By all means let the research go ahead, let us look at the issue again in a few years, but please do not try and saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits.
All that would happen - because there are no retrospective elements - is that, as has happened on the Bodensee, the whole of Europe would become pretty much a museum for old engines.
The companies making new engines go out of business, but those refurbishing old engines continue to make a lot of money.
The engine could be old, polluting or spilling oil into the water but, as long as it was in existence at the time the limits were introduced, it would be perfectly legal.
It is completely self-defeating to impose unachievable limits.
I would strongly recommend the House to vote against those amendments tomorrow.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for the general support in their report.
The Commission's proposal to modify the recreational craft directive aims to avoid fragmentation of the internal market and seeks to integrate environmental concerns.
As such, this proposal provides a good example of the synergy that is needed between environmental and industrial policies for the achievement of sustainable development.
Air and water pollution and engine noise from recreational boating activities have become increasingly sensitive issues.
While exhaust emissions from recreational craft contribute little to the overall pollution of the marine environment, their local effects are nevertheless important.
Recreational boating activities are often concentrated in environmentally sensitive areas so it is important that this activity does not disturb local fauna.
Moreover, boating activities often take place at the weekend and in holiday periods resulting in a concentration of the nuisance they can cause to local inhabitants.
I share with Mr Callanan the hope that the amendments that are adopted will deal appropriately with the need for harmonised reduction of exhaust and noise emissions, while at the same time avoiding over-regulation.
I therefore welcome in particular Amendment 14 to extend the 3 decibel sound allowance to the scope originally proposed by the Commission.
The Commission can also agree with Amendments 6 and 21 as they will provide for consistency in the references to 'placing on the market and/or putting into service' throughout the directive.
Also the first part of Amendment 1 can be accepted, since it provides an improved wording of the recital.
Amendments 4, 5, 12 and 22 re-introducing the proposals to delete or reduce the provisions on the Regulatory Committee cannot be accepted by the Commission.
A regulatory committee is necessary for the efficient implementation and the regular updating of a specified range of technical elements contained in the technical annexes to the proposed directive.
This approach is in line with the principles of better regulation.
Another important topic of debate has been that of the right to adopt more stringent requirements at national level.
Amendments have also been tabled to introduce at Community level more stringent emission limits on standing inland waters.
The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 11 and 13, as they would fragment the internal market.
Amendments 16 to 20 and Amendment 24 envisage changing the scope and timing of future work to be undertaken by the Commission.
They cannot be accepted as they would restrict the Commission's right of initiative.
In conclusion, the Commission can accept the first part of Amendment 1 and Amendments 6, 14 and 21.
On the contrary the Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 to 20 and 22 to 24.
The Commission is looking forward to working with Parliament and the Council towards a solution which on the one hand guarantees a high level of environmental protection and on the other hand meets the requirements of the internal market.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their efforts.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we had a three-hour debate on sustainable development.
At the World Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union advocated a global water initiative.
This should make it possible to realise the aims of the World Summit on Sustainable Development - access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation.
So what are we doing, we who want to achieve such ambitious targets at international level, here in our own countries in Europe?
We are making a law on abating water pollution that will reinforce the use of yesterday's technology for tomorrow's developments.
That, at any rate, will be the result if the opponents of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy succeed in defeating them in plenary.
Regrettably they include our rapporteur, who actually ought to represent the opinion of the majority of the committee.
Unfortunately, amongst these opponents of advanced technology are also colleagues from groups and countries which are usually in the vanguard of any initiatives to protect water and the environment and cannot go far enough.
Go and stand sometime at a filling station in a large harbour for recreational craft; you will see the quantities of fuel, diesel, petrol and oil that are pumped into the tanks of these boats.
A considerable proportion of this fuel, although it depends on the design, is discharged directly into the water - without undergoing combustion - along with the exhaust emissions, because the exhaust pipe is under the surface of the water.
The pollutants accumulate in inland waters and lakes, which are frequently used for the abstraction of drinking water.
Nowhere else is the exchange of pollutants so great.
It is precisely on lakes that the density of boats is often particularly high.
That is why we want more stringent requirements for these waters, that is, stricter limit values for recreational craft.
The technology, Mr Callanan, is available.
As an engineer you ought actually to be aware of this.
Since existing craft will enjoy absolute protection and be able to be used until the end of their life, the argument of our Nordic colleagues does not hold water either.
The limit values laid down now will only have to be complied with by boats newly brought onto the market from 2005.
An individual who buys a new recreational craft after 2005 will be able to use it on all waters.
That is why I would urgently request your support for Amendments Nos 1, 11 and 13.
By adopting these amendments we Europeans would be putting our words in Johannesburg into action.
Mr Callanan, I have already heard your arguments almost word for word here in plenary; it was nearly 20 years ago in the mid-eighties, in the last century, when we were debating limit values for cars and the introduction of new technology.
Then, as now, your country was the first to slam on the brakes.
It is quite astonishing that in two decades you have not learnt any better.
I believe that water is also the life of the future.
We must do all we can to prevent our waters from becoming even more polluted.
Mr President, the directive limiting noise and exhaust emissions from recreational craft is based on the need to harmonise emissions in the EU.
This in turn has its roots in the needs of industry and the manufacturers of recreational craft and the objective of a more viable internal market.
The inverse of this can also be seen, as Commissioner Liikanen said, in that the question is also that we are finding ways of improving standards of environmental protection.
It really is very important in this sector because waterways, for example, lakes, are often very vulnerable and they are also stocks of drinking water.
Furthermore, recreational boating is a leisure activity, and people want to spend their time in the most tranquil surroundings possible.
The reasons given for protection of waters are therefore, I believe, justifiable, and the better emission norms we obtain the better things will be.
The notion, however, that we might specify different emission limits for sea areas and internal water areas will not work on any account.
It would, perhaps, in some parts of Europe but not where internal waters - lakes - are directly linked to the sea by means of rivers or canals, for example, and where people are very keen on boating.
It would be very hard to tell people that they must change engines when they reach the sea.
I am therefore in favour of emission limit values being as stringent as possible, but these kinds of artificial limits cannot be imposed.
However, I do enthusiastically support our being able to impose tighter limits nationally, regionally and locally, as it is absolutely clear that the waters in different parts of Europe also differ greatly from one another.
Certain areas need special protection from noise and other emissions, and this option must exist.
Another issue, not connected with this directive, but connected with boating and the environment, is all the other waste associated with boating.
By this I mean litter and other associated problems that boating causes.
This must also be a cause of concern to us when we talk about the environment and boating.
For example, boating organisations should be given the task of informing and enlightening their members with regard to what it means to be a good yachtsman, one who takes care of the environment.
It will obviously then be society's task to arrange things in such a way that yachtsmen can be responsible for their environment.
Mr President, Commissioner, I usually do not thank the rapporteurs for their work.
Today, however, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, particularly since he has been so unfairly attacked by his own group.
I consider, like the previous speaker Mrs Myller, that Mr Callanan has a realistic, practical and sound environmentally friendly basis for his work.
It is important to have proposals that aim to improve the marine environment, and we Finns know how important it is to have a living sea.
Ever since work began on this directive, and at least since 1966 when Germany and Sweden came up with their proposed legislation, we have seen good developments with regard to the environmental impact from both two-stroke and four-stroke engines.
Already today, we can see a positive development and lower fuel consumption.
Personally I consider, however, that sailing is the activity in this context that is the least harmful to the environment, but that is another matter.
This matter is important for us Finns.
Here in the Chamber, there are now three of us from Finland and Mr Arvidsson, who almost counts as one.
In our countries, there is one boat for every seven inhabitants, so this is an important source of employment for us.
It is very difficult to measure the actual effects of the proposal.
I have an estimate from Finland that shows that if we implement the proposal put forward by the rapporteur, the carbon monoxide emissions in the country would fall by 1.8% and emissions of hydrocarbons by 4.3%.
On the other hand, there is not expected to be any difference in emissions of sulphur dioxide and other particles.
The proposal would therefore lead to a slight reduction in hydrocarbons and at the same time produce a considerable reduction in the burden on the boat sector.
I hope that the proposal for a review clause from the rapporteur and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will continue in its present form, since it is important for us to develop the boat categories.
We know that this has some connection to the so-called Savolax boats, which should be familiar to the Commissioner.
I also hoped that the Commissioner would support Amendment No 22, since I believe that a committee is required.
The present directive contains many technical details that apply to boat safety, and I do not believe that even we, well-informed MEPs who are present here, can cope with it properly.
I understand that Amendment No 22 should be some sort of compromise. The industry is expecting this, and we should not need to dwell so long on issues that require the committee system.
There are technical aspects.
Just as the Commissioner said, this is in line with the principle of improved regulation.
You are concerned about Lake Constance, and we are concerned about our lakes and our Baltic.
Under existing legislation, we can and shall introduce stricter provisions.
These can be limited where there is reason, for example in relation to ground water.
This does not need to be done with a directive, however.
When we adopted directives on lawnmowers and cars, we introduced the same regulations across the entire Union.
In that instance, we did not introduce something different for cars driving through the sensitive Austrian forests.
It is consequently one and the same set of regulations, and afterwards limits are placed on the cars themselves with ecopoints or some other system.
The same logic should apply to boats as well. I therefore support what the rapporteur and the previous speakers have said about the so-called Table 1a.
Mr President, I hail from a country abounding in water and I also have my home in Amsterdam near water.
I can assure you that these boats make a hell of a racket and produce an awful lot of exhaust, much more so than cars.
Why is that?
Because we have considerably improved cars over the past ten, fifteen years.
It is, in fact, on the initiative of the German and Swedish boat industry that this improvement is before us.
The improvement, which will reduce noise and exhaust to some degree, has been adopted by the Commission.
Unfortunately, we did not go far enough; we could have done much better, as Mrs Schleicher has already pointed out.
The new technology is in place.
Since it is not being used, we are forced to afford certain environmentally sensitive areas extra protection.
I am also in favour of the internal market, but we should have used those very high standards that are technically possible.
This will hopefully be done by way of the review clause.
I am pleased though that the rapporteur has endorsed my amendments and that we are going to do something about lubricants.
As a huge number of boats leak, a great proportion of lubricant seeps out.
There is also organic lubricant, which also leaks, but which does not present a problem.
Organic lubricant is used on the famous lake in the Alps, for example, which we talked about earlier, where it is compulsory.
It should, in fact, be made compulsory, or at least be promoted, in many more cases.
This should be feasible by means of a simple tax rule.
We suggest that Member States consider this.
I also suggest that the Commission considers this when we review this directive, because it would then be possible to provide for clean boats which hardly make any noise or hardly produce any exhaust, which do not leak, do not produce any annoying pools, that are not just ugly to look at but also harm the environment.
All these boats combined emit an awful lot of this oil, and something could be done about it without too much effort.
I hope that the Commissioner is prepared to consider this matter carefully during the review procedure.
Mr President, the directive under discussion is one of a series designed to change Community legislation regarding different types of engine equipment, even including lawnmowers, to meet improved standards for noise and exhaust gas.
In this regard we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for a job well done.
Harmonisation is reasonable and necessary, as some Member States, for example, Germany, Austria and Sweden, have already decided to bring in or plan their own legislation regarding exhaust limits for recreational craft.
Harmonisation is necessary for trade, but it is at least as important to fix exhaust norms at the same minimum level in all Member States.
In this way we can achieve ecological benefits and general well-being.
The rapporteur thinks it inappropriate that craft built for personal use should be included in the scope of this directive, as this would not contribute to market harmonisation.
This argument relating to the market is certainly a valid one.
However, the second half of the directive that deals with people's well-being as an aim will not materialise in the case of people living close to these sorts of self-built craft if noise limits, for example, are freely allowed to be exceeded.
It is a dubious notion, however, at the very least that different noise and exhaust limits should be applied according to whether a boat is meant for internal waters or the sea.
Firstly, the amendments tabled with this in mind by my esteemed colleagues Mrs Schleicher, Mrs Flemming, Mr Wieland, Mrs Emilia MÃŒller and Mr Bernd Lange are unrealistic in practice, as the same vessel is often taken from one water system to another, either by road or by driving it along canals or water channels.
This I have done many times myself - I am a keen yachtswoman.
Secondly, it is inconsistent with the idea of market harmonisation: if Amendment No 13 were approved, it would already have to be known when a boat was being manufactured whether it was to be used in fresh or salt water.
Thirdly, the ecological state of the seas in the Community area is already so bad that the argument regarding the vulnerability of inland waters does not stand up, because the converse of what these same colleagues of mine are saying is that it is fine to race around even a little more in the open sea - just go ahead!
Unfortunately this is not true.
The report states with regard to vulnerable waters that the authorities in Member States may issue more stringent regulations than what is contained in this directive and that, I believe, is the correct way to proceed.
In my country, for example, we have already been able to ban the use of motor vessels at local level in certain lakes which it has been seen especially justifiable to protect.
There are more than 182 000 lakes in Finland.
Of Europe's hundred largest lakes, half are in Finland.
There are 647 rivers.
Finland has 314 000 kilometres of coastline, which is about eight times the earth's circumference.
For Finland these natural features are a source of wealth that we have traditionally taken good care of, and it is therefore unnecessary under this directive to establish more stringent emission limits for our waters than for other areas.
Instead, we should urge the Commission to issue proposals for emission limits common to all waters now being decided to be made more stringent.
Mr President, let me begin where the previous speaker left off.
Sweden and Finland have considerably more lakes than all other EU Member States combined.
In our countries, it is common for the lakes to be sources of drinking water or very sensitive natural areas, for example breeding grounds for birds.
In sensitive lakes, we currently meet the environmental demands through limits on boat traffic, for example boating bans in certain areas during the birds' breeding periods.
In Sweden and Finland, it is also common to sail up lakes in boats that are used for coastal journeys.
It is good that environmental requirements are set high even for leisure boat engines, as occurs in this directive.
We Swedes, and my colleagues from Finland, are concerned, however, that this proposal for a directive opens the possibility of higher environmental requirements for leisure boats used on lakes than for those used for coastal journeys.
In our countries, this would be an impracticable EU law, created by those who do not want to listen and take on board the message about the actual conditions in the Nordic Member States with their thousands of lakes.
With a separate environmental standard for boats used on lakes, we should be neglecting the actual reason for the proposal for a directive, the single market.
In addition, we do not currently have the ability to obtain a higher environmental standard for leisure boats on lakes.
The consequence will be that people will refrain from buying modern, environmentally better, boat engines.
This proposal might look good on paper, but in reality the result would be a bad one, and there would be a bad result for the environment.
I would willingly raise the requirements for environmental standards for leisure boat engines in the future, but realistic specifications would then have to be set.
Moreover, the transition periods would have to be adjusted to the time required for the development of new engine technology.
No such amendments have been put forward, which is why the only reasonable thing is for the Commission to come back with new environmental requirements in a subsequent review of this directive.
Boats often lie at anchor, but environmental policy must also be anchored. It has to be anchored in reality.
If this is not the case, environmental policy will come adrift in troubled waters and among hidden rocks, and then it will be the environment that is damaged.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive concerns the exhaust and noise emissions of petrol and diesel engines intended for recreational craft.
We also have these regulations for cars and that certainly does not mean that if our cars meet these standards they too are permitted to be driven anywhere.
At present, for example, there are rules limiting the number of boats on lakes to 100 or even 2 per lake.
It is possible to ban recreational craft from lakes entirely.
There are time restrictions, limiting the use of boats only to certain hours each day.
In the end, this directive does not confer any right to operate recreational craft on all lakes at all times and under all possible conditions; all it does is allow free trade in boats and their licensing and it permits them to be used in authorised areas.
All of us in the European Union value the principle of harmonisation, but only where minimum standards are set so that these technical products can also be used.
As you know, we in Parliament - and in particular in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - attach the utmost importance to the principle of mutual recognition, and I believe that this directive makes boat licensing possible.
We see it as very positive that the general standards in the European Union are being raised substantially here.
This would also automatically have an impact on the market, because with higher standards proportionally more boats would be permitted on the waters of Member States.
If the standards are very low, the Member States will quite certainly take matters into their own hands by prohibiting the use of recreational craft on certain lakes altogether or by imposing time restrictions, for example by only allowing boats to be used in May or June.
There is therefore sufficient room for manoeuvre here.
It is precisely from this point of view that it is necessary to alert individual drivers, as part of their training for their motorboat licences, to the environmental and noise problem, as well as to the problem of exhaust emissions.
There are countless regulations here and these are of course very important in the individual countries.
We should also observe how this directive develops in the future, because it is in all our interests - everyone in this House will agree - to have environmental regulations that are as good, rigorous and sustainable as possible.
The sportsmen and -women who operate these boats are also keen to have the best possible boats, so the switch to a new generation of craft certainly has to be in all our interests.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (B5-0491/02), on behalf of the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the review of trademark rights.
Mr President, may I begin by expressing my disappointment that the people who have drafted this question are not here.
Despite that, I would like to answer the question, if only for the record and because other Members present might be interested in the Commission's answer.
I shall begin by thanking Members of this Parliament for the interest they have shown in this important issue, namely the exhaustion of trade mark rights, whether internationally or just in Europe.
As Members may know from our previous discussion on this issue which took place almost exactly one year ago - on 2 October 2001 - the Commission undertook to prepare a report to Parliament on this subject by the end of this year.
As I stated in our previous discussion, I do not intend to reopen the investigation of issues that the Commission has already studied.
Moreover, I explained at that meeting last year that the Commission would only reconsider its decision not to propose a change to the current EU exhaustion regime if new developments justified that.
To date, there have been no such developments.
Moreover, and as this relates more specifically to the questions raised by the Members of Parliament who drafted the question, I said last year that the Commission would limit itself to investigating cases of possible abuse of trade mark rights, and especially, but not only, competition aspects.
I would like to make it clear to Members of this Parliament that the Commission has acted fully in accordance with the commitments I made on 2 October last year.
I should like to add that in July this year, my services sent out questionnaires to over sixty companies and organisations representing many small and medium-sized enterprises, including both parallel traders and trademark holders, who might be at most risk from abusive restrictions on the sale in the Community of trademarked goods.
The results of this investigation, combined with our ongoing consultations with other Commission services - in particular our colleagues in the Directorate-General for Competition - should allow us to build a clear picture of whether trademark rights are indeed being abused by right holders to stifle legitimate trade.
That report, as promised at our previous meeting, will be transmitted to Parliament by the end of this year.
That is my answer to the question.
I shall be most interested to hear what Members have to say about it.
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to apologise for my late arrival.
The car that was supposed to collect me came half an hour later than arranged.
That is why I unfortunately only heard part of your speech.
However, I grasped the main points.
Commissioner, the committee and indeed Parliament has not raised this matter lightly or for fun, but because we do not believe that the NERA study, on which you are relying, actually provides a solid enough basis on which to make decisions of this kind.
In other words, our main premise is that it has been proved, without the need for a NERA study, that these goods - which are everyday items, which every woman and every man buys, in particular those from the poorer sections of the population - for example jeans, shirts, polo shirts, trainers and suchlike, are being offered for sale outside the EU by the same brand manufacturers at the same quality standards for half the price or even less.
That is one of the reasons.
The second reason is that in our view the purpose of trademark law is not to seal off markets, allowing there to be different price systems inside and outside the EU, especially more expensive prices inside the EU and more reasonable ones outside; rather we are of the opinion that this is a matter for competition and not trademark law.
The function of trademark law is to name, describe and unambiguously classify the manufacturer, the brand and the product and to confer certain rights on the trademark holder.
These rights are justified and we will do all we can to defend them.
A completely different, separate issue is, however, that of exhaustion.
In Germany, for around 100 years from the advent of trademarks we had international exhaustion.
With this system of international exhaustion in place we in Germany achieved the economic miracle, significant growth and much more besides.
In the last five years, since European trademark law has come in, we have observed a system of dual pricing, and we have observed that trademark law has become a preferred option for companies because it is far easier to assert your rights under trademark law than it is under other rights procedures, which are actually product-related, such as rights relating to design, patent and copyright; it is more difficult to present your case here.
That alone is the reason and trademark law cannot after all be stronger than competition law.
That is why we asked these questions.
That is why we have asked you in the Commission not to rely on a NERA study but to conduct your own investigations into these specific matters and to answer on that basis.
Finally there is another question that has arisen since our past discussions on trademark law: what about trade on the Internet?
There is of course nothing wrong with the Internet.
We promote it.
If someone outside the EU makes a purchase and the dealer dispatches the goods in the EU then this contradicts current trademark law. This cannot be the intention of trademark law either.
Once again then we would urgently request the Commission to conduct further investigations into these few points and to inform Parliament of the result, and not to refer to a NERA study which in our view does not address these problems.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite having subscribed to the Mayer Report, I was somewhat surprised by the question put to the Commission, since the prescribed timeframe for carrying out these studies was not respected.
What is more, I am convinced that the transition from a Community-wide exhaustion of trademarks to an international exhaustion might have negative effects from both an economic and legal perspective.
Neither the NERA study nor that carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit proved that the international exhaustion of rights system has a significant long-term effect on prices for the consumer.
The consumer would not benefit from such a change and I have here an article published recently in the Evening Standard on 4 September, pointing out that Tesco, which is well-known for its support of the international exhaustion of rights system, has not passed on considerable savings made through parallel imports to the consumer.
Furthermore, if we wish to adopt international exhaustion, we must amend not only the 1988 Directive, but also the 1993 Regulation establishing the Community trade mark and laying down the rule of Community exhaustion.
It would be inconceivable for the international exhaustion to apply to the national trade mark and the Community trade mark to be exempt.
A solution of this kind would certainly spell the end of national trade marks which are highly valued by Member States and which are needed by businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in the frequent cases when a protection throughout EU territory is, in their view, worthless and costly.
More than ever in a context of heightened globalisation, we must affirm the economic importance of the European Union by integrating the single market and attaching more value to our creativity.
Neither the United States nor Japan has adopted international exhaustion of trade marks.
If the European Union unilaterally decided to transfer to this legal system, it would introduce distorted competition between the European Union and third countries.
Trademark protection is crucial for the European economy and for consumer safety.
A trade mark is the guarantee of a product's authenticity and quality.
Furthermore, the current system allows us to better protect ourselves from counterfeiting; since parallel imports pose a major risk as they use the same channels as pirated products and counterfeits.
A question was raised by Mr Mayer, but I, on the other hand, am thinking about another question which I believe to be crucial: why has the European Union not yet signed the Madrid Protocol, which would enable us to provide an integrated, efficient, global and transparent trademark protection system?
I am therefore hoping and praying that the European Union will sign this protocol.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the group which has put the question and in particular Mr Mayer, since it is very timely.
I also thank the Commissioner for his reply.
I believe that, although the time limit stated in last year's European Parliament resolution has not come to an end, to monitor it and stay informed, to continue the debate, is our obligation as Members of Parliament.
During the debate on the Mayer Report last year, we had the opportunity to witness - as is also happening today, through the previous speakers - the difficulties involved in achieving a broad majority view on this sensitive issue, both in this house and in society.
I believe that the problem is not so much with the trade marks directive but with the interpretation contained in the Silhouette judgment on Article 7 of the trade marks directive.
Before that judgment, there were countries where, either through legislation - as in Sweden - or through case-law - as in Spain - the principle of the international exhaustion of trade marks was permitted, but following that judgment it was clearly prohibited.
While it is true that there are many conflicting interests, it is also the case that we must attend to the interests of the consumer and it is unthinkable that European consumers, as a result of an excessive interpretation of trade mark law, which goes beyond the principle that the trade mark is restricted to designating the origin of a product, should not be able to acquire products at lower prices.
The issue cannot be resolved, as some reports say, exclusively by applying the Treaty's competition rules, for the simple reason that the abuse of a dominant position is only applied to those who have a dominant position in a certain significant market, and we all know that, with these types of products protected by a trade mark, it is very unlikely that a trade mark would warrant being classified as dominant.
So far the Commission - we await these reports which it has requested - has mentioned the Nera Report, which guaranteed that the recognition of international exhaustion would not affect prices beyond 2%.
I do not agree with this conclusion and, while personal experience is of little worth, I can give endless examples of how products which in other countries or in my own country, when international exhaustion was allowed, could be sold at significantly lower prices, since the Silhouette judgment can only be found on official distribution networks and at considerably higher prices.
With regard to the Nera Report, the Commission is undoubtedly aware of the work done by the Swedish competition authority, which reaches radically different conclusions to those of the Nera Report and those maintained today by Mrs Fourtou.
I therefore believe that the time has come to invite the Commission to present the report, as the European Parliament previously requested.
When it does, I believe we will once again have the opportunity to insist on this debate.
Mr President, I should like to take Commissioner Bolkestein back to the last part-session here when we discussed sales promotion.
He may remember that I complimented him because he had written an article in a journal complimenting Parliament on rescuing the internal market.
It is slightly disappointing therefore to find him back here at the following part-session adopting such a cautious approach on such a fundamental single market issue.
In this case we are not talking about the single European market.
We are talking about global markets and about the freedom of consumers to be able to benefit from lower prices for identical goods that are placed on the market, quite legitimately, outside the European Union, and which are then imported.
I want to remind him - and he cautiously skirted around this in his answer - that we are discussing an archaic piece of legislation.
The Trademarks Directive in its original form was certainly introduced to protect trademarks and to secure consumer confidence that they would know what they were buying.
But subsequently, in cases before the Court of Justice, it is now being further elaborated into a means whereby trademark owners can actually protect their brand, or supposedly protect their brand and their authorised distribution systems, by essentially keeping prices higher artificially.
He asked us quite rightly to say what has changed.
I shall tell him what has changed.
The first thing is that consumers are getting increasingly irritable about what they see as the failure to act on what ought to be a fundamental right.
That consumer pressure was quite rightly cited by his colleague, Mr Monti, when we had a complete and total reform of the legislation relating to the selling and servicing of motor cars.
What has that done?
It has opened up the distribution system across the European Union. Essentially, cars will be available across borders much more freely than they were before and prices which differ from one market to another will clearly converge.
So why should this be any different?
I have to disagree with my colleague Mrs Fourtou.
It is not a question of counterfeiting or other spurious issues.
Surely the reason we have so many of these counterfeit brands is because the genuine brands are prevented from being sold at the price that consumers want to buy.
It is a circular argument.
I hope that in the July report he has commissioned he will have the facts available and that he will be able to meet the deadline of the end of December that we asked him to meet.
This needs to happen so that we can come up with a sensible balanced view, not looking to the past, looking at all the evidence, to the benefit of consumers.
We need to continue together with the Commissioner the task of creating a true single market for consumers.
I hope he will give us an assurance this evening that he is prepared to move from his overly cautious approach and join with us in the crusade to give consumers across Europe a better deal.
I should like to thank the Members who have spoken on this subject very much for their views.
I shall start with Mr Harbour, who has in his usual eloquent manner impressed the Commission with the need to change over to international recognition.
In his closing remarks he said that he wants the Commission, and this Commissioner in particular, to see that consumers get the benefits to which he says they are entitled so that there can be a true single market.
I should like to tell Mr Harbour that we already have a single market.
That market is confined to the European Union.
It is not something that appertains to the whole world.
The Commission is aware that consumers benefit from lower prices.
That is obvious.
The Commission is very much in favour of seeing to it that consumers benefit from prices which are as low as possible.
However, they are not the only ones involved.
It is not just consumers who are interested in this matter.
Producers are also involved and, in particular, trademark holders.
Just as consumers are entitled to the lowest prices that are economically feasible, so the producers of trademarked goods want and are entitled to get protection for their trademarks - but not unlimited protection.
That is the reason behind exhaustion in the European Union.
There should certainly be a balance between, on the one hand, the interests of the consumer and, on the other hand, the interests of the producer, and the Commission continues to believe that European exhaustion provides for that balance.
The Commission has not changed its mind since we last spoke about this issue 12 months ago.
I accept Mr Mayer's apologies.
He said the studies are of insufficient quality. I do not accept that.
I do not understand why the NERA study should be of insufficient quality.
The NERA study, as is well known because it is available, states that the changeover from European to international exhaustion would have a negligible effect on prices.
Mr Mayer may know that in his country, Germany, there was once a system of international exhaustion.
Because of the policy accepted in Germany on account of the European Union, the changeover was made from international exhaustion to European exhaustion.
It was then claimed that certain luxury goods producers had to raise their prices, but we then heard from those luxury goods producers that they had in fact lowered their prices.
So, in that specific case, international exhaustion did not produce prices any lower than European exhaustion - quite the contrary.
Mr Mayer may have in mind the studies carried out by the UK and Swedish Governments two years ago.
Those studies - interesting as they are - showed that there is a great disparity in prices between the different countries belonging to the European Union.
What stuck most in my mind was the 40% difference between electronic goods sold in Sweden and those sold in Germany, which are almost neighbours, apart from the stretch of water between them.
A 40% difference in price means that the internal market is not working as it should, because, if it did, prices should be related to objective costs - costs of transport, distribution, etc. But 40% means that other factors come into play.
40% is far and away bigger than any differences in prices that come into play and are discussed in comparisons between international exhaustion and European exhaustion.
So I am afraid that the studies of which the Commission is aware - the NERA study was commissioned by the Commission itself - do not support the view that international exhaustion would lead to lower prices, quite apart from the fact that, as I have said before, the rightholders of trademarks are entitled to proper protection, not unlimited protection, but substantial nevertheless.
I thank Mrs Fourtou very much for supporting the NERA study.
She has cited the United States and Japan.
The Commission agrees with her view.
As to her question on the Madrid Protocol, I must tell her that this is in the hands of the Council, and the Commission can only wait for the Council to take a positive decision in this area.
Once again, the report will deal with matters of abuse of trademarks.
As I have said, the Commission has sent out 60 letters to companies and legal bodies asking for evidence of abuses of trademark rights.
The answers should be in by the end of September.
We do not have all the answers yet.
We shall wait for them to come in.
We shall analyse them.
They will be included in the report due at the end of December.
I should like to confirm that Parliament will indeed receive that report at the end of December.
I should like to conclude by stressing that the Commission has an open mind on this issue.
Only those who have no ideas never change them.
The Commission is full of ideas and has an open mind.
It is always willing to reconsider.
As I said a year ago, the problem is more a lack of definitive evidence showing that there is an advantage in opting for international exhaustion over European exhaustion.
I do not believe that the Commission should change its policy without clear evidence of there being an advantage in doing so.
With these remarks, I should like to end my response in winding up this debate.
Once again, there will be a report at the end of December.
I look forward to a further exchange of views with Parliament once that report has been brought to the attention of this House.
The debate is closed.
(The sitting was closed at 10.35 p.m.)
- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Santini's report (A5-0312/2002).
We agree that the EU should establish minimum rules for legal aid etc. We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position.
Activities of the European Ombudsman (2001) Deliberations of the Committee on Petitions 2001-2002
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:
the report (A5-0267/2002) by Mr Wyn, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2001 [C5-0296/2002 - 2002/2086(COS)], and
the report (A5-0271/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2001-2002 [2002/2019(INI)].
Mr SÃ¶derman, the European Ombudsman, has the floor.
Madam President, on 1 September 1995 the Ombudsman's office started work.
From then until 15 September 2002, the office received 10 535 complaints, of which 10 437 have been examined.
We carried out 1 385 full inquiries of which 19 were own-initiative inquiries.
1 149 of these cases involved the Commission, 137 cases involved the European Parliament's administration, 53 concerned the Council and 12 concerned the European Investment Bank.
Looking at the results, 345 cases were settled by the institution concerned, after the Ombudsman had informed it of the complaint.
In 206 cases a critical remark was made, in 48 cases the inquiry resulted in a draft accommodation or proposal for a friendly solution, most of it achieved a success for the complainant.
In six cases a special report was made to the European Parliament, in four of these cases Parliament upheld the Ombudsman's recommendations, and two other cases are still pending.
In 659 cases, a thorough inquiry resulted in the Ombudsman finding that there was no maladministration in the activities of the institution.
When cases are outside the Ombudsman's mandate, we always try to advise the complainant of another body that could deal with the matter.
We advised the complainant to go to the national or regional Ombudsman, or petition a national or regional Parliament in 2 293 cases, to petition the European Parliament in 884 cases and to address the Commission in 913 cases.
Over the years, critical voices have been raised, saying that the Ombudsman is not sufficiently known, and that the results for citizens are inadequate because the institutions neither cooperate nor respect their obligation of good administration.
Some critical voices have also suggested that the mandate is too narrow and that the European Ombudsman should deal with complaints concerning Community law wherever it is applied in the Union or even be a People's Tribune, always ready to condemn injustice wherever it occurs.
The European Ombudsman is certainly one of the best-known ombudsman institutions in the world.
Our information campaign is in 12 languages and addresses 350 million citizens and residents of 15 Member States.
We have visited every Member State, issued press releases, published information brochures and given many lectures and seminars to publicise the work.
One of the most effective ways of communicating with such a vast audience is via the Internet.
Around 2 500 websites contain an active link to the European Ombudsman's site and nearly 42 % of complaints are now submitted electronically, many of them using the on line complaint form.
The steady increase in the number of complaints is the best proof that the Ombudsman is better and better known.
Almost 200 new complaints arrive each month, nearly a 300% increase compared with the first full year of cooperation in 1996.
The results of the Ombudsman's work for European citizens are also impressive.
As well as obtaining redress in individual cases, we have achieved major improvements in the general functioning of the institution.
Three of these call for special mention.
First we persuaded the institutions and some bodies, including the European Central Bank and Europol, to improve public access to their documents.
Second, an own-initiative inquiry led 17 institutions and bodies to adopt codes of good administration, based on a draft suggested by us.
Following a special report, the European Parliament last year adopted a revised version of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour.
We have distributed this improved version of the Code widely throughout the institutions and to European citizens, whose right to good administration the Code embodies.
As instructed by the European Parliament, we apply the Code in deciding whether or not there is maladministration.
The third achievement concerns the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed in Nice in December 2000.
The Ombudsman proposed the idea that the Charter should include the right to good administration.
This was included as Article 41 of the Charter.
The Ombudsman has also promoted the full and correct application of the Charter.
The Union institutions solemnly proclaim the Charter to the citizens as embodying their fundamental rights.
The Ombudsman therefore regards the institutions' failure to respect those rights in their own activities as maladministration.
Furthermore, the Ombudsman's proposals to the European Convention include the idea that the Charter should be legally binding wherever Community law applies.
Contrary to what the critical voices say, the institutions and bodies deserve credit for their mainly cooperative attitude to the Ombudsman.
They have usually responded properly, fully and promptly to the Ombudsman's inquiries and have been willing to accept the Ombudsman's friendly solutions and draft recommendations.
Problems have arisen in only a small number of cases.
In one case concerning access to information, the Commission rejected the Ombudsman's draft recommendation and has failed to act on a resolution of the European Parliament supporting the Ombudsman.
I regret that this case seems to be part of a more general trend towards the misuse of data protection rules to halt or reverse the commitment to openness.
Most of the institutions and bodies have also adopted a code of good administrative behaviour.
I still cannot understand why Parliament's resolution of September 2001, calling for a European administrative law, has not been followed up.
To me, a uniform set of rules applying to all the institutions and bodies could only enhance the Union's relations with its citizens.
I also regret that the Staff Regulations maintain the outdated requirement of prior approval of publications by civil servants.
I acknowledge that the European Ombudsman's mandate is limited.
I have consistently maintained the view that a network of ombudsmen and petitions committees is needed to supervise the application of Community law by the Member States.
We have developed such a network, to share information, give advice and ensure that complaints go to the most competent body.
Further development of the network could help the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, to focus its resources on the most important issues of principle.
The citizens can never fully believe in the European Union unless Community law is respected at all levels of the Union.
In future Community law, the Member States could include the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
The network of ombudsmen in the Member States could also play an essential role in supervising the application of the Charter.
The European Ombudsman would be ready to accept responsibility for referring fundamental cases to the Court of Justice, if no solution could be found in a normal ombudsman investigation.
I do hope that Parliament's representatives in the on the European Convention will support these proposals.
Finally, I would like to express my thanks to all the institutions and bodies, above all to the European Commission, which has cooperated effectively with the Ombudsman to the benefit of the European citizens.
I would also like to thank the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions for their good advice and support.
Special thanks are due to the chairman of the Committee, Mr Gemelli and the rapporteur dealing with the Ombudsman's Annual Report this year, Mr Wyn.
I thank you.
I welcome their proposals for closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, which I hope will lead to a concrete outcome to benefit the European citizens.
Madam President, it is my pleasure in this report to endorse the annual report for 2001 submitted by the Ombudsman, which is a comprehensive and detailed overview of the activities conducted during the year and in particular of all the various cases processed.
After seven years, the role of the European Ombudsman - to enhance openness and democratic accountability in the decision-making and administration of the European Union - is well established.
By tackling maladministration in the Community institutions and bodies, the role of the Ombudsman has made an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions are truly taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen.
The fact that the number of direct complaints is still on the increase again in 2001 clearly demonstrates that the Ombudsman is reaching more and more people in the course of his activities.
Despite this steady rise in complaints, the report welcomes the reduction in time taken to deal with each case.
The present Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, from whom we have already heard, has become a well recognised and respected figure in the European Union and his receipt of awards such as the Alexis de Tocqueville prize further demonstrates this.
He has even paid a visit to my own country, Wales, showing a commitment and dedication through his work to visit some of the most important places in the world.
During his time in office he has emphasised the Rule of Law, taking fundamental rights seriously and applying basic principles of good administration, such as transparency, responsibility and respect for citizens.
This has been done in no less than 15 Member States and through the medium of 12 Community languages.
He deserves his retirement!
The report very much welcomes the fact that the European authorities are increasingly taking action to settle a complaint once they are made aware of the problem in question and that, in other cases, a friendly solution has been arrived at.
The Ombudsman must also be commended for his efforts to inform more citizens of their right to complain.
This is a matter that the Committee on Petitions is continually aware of.
This means that the Ombudsman's work has to include the continuous updating of his website with a view to making his role known to an ever-wider public and to establishing networks of links with regional ombudsmen.
In this regard the Ombudsman is faced with, on the one hand, wanting to inform as many people as possible of this right to complain and, on the other, remembering that the remit of his office is limited to the Community institutions.
We in Parliament have a role to play here, in ensuring that we remain aware of the Ombudsman's role and informing citizens of this right.
The work of the Ombudsman, however, has not been without obstacles during this period.
In the field of good administration the European Parliament adopted unanimously last September the European Union Code on Good Administrative Behaviour and called on the Commission to propose a regulation on the subject.
I welcome the Ombudsman's decision to apply the principles set out in this code in his activities.
I should like to express my disappointment here, however, that the Commission has yet to act on this important request.
The report calls for Parliament to consider drawing up a legislative initiative report on the basis of this model code under Article 192 and Rule 59.
In relation to openness and good administrative behaviour this report notes attempts by certain institutions to use recently adopted data protection rules to impose confidentiality on their activities.
It must be made clear that data protection rules are mainly concerned with the protection of private and family life and certainly should not in any way restrict the information available to citizens on the activities of the European Union institutions.
With regard to the infringement procedure, the Article 226 procedure, in which the Commission investigates complaints about infringements of Community law by Member States, which continues to be the subject of complaints to the Ombudsman - and this is something with which we in the Committee on Petitions are all too familiar - the report finds that, despite recent improvements, this procedure is secretive, and that the complainant is still not recognised as a participant.
Delays occur because the Commission has too many cases to deal with.
The Ombudsman was on the record for criticising the Commission's recent handling of the Greek environmental complaint, in this case involving infringements of Community environmental law by the Greek authorities; enquiries revealed a catalogue of information being concealed, the wrong directive being applied and a failure to ensure that the case was dealt with impartially.
Whilst we appreciate the hard work carried out by the Commission, the Ombudsman and our Committee on Petitions depend on their investigations being effective, and we must be confident that such cases are being handled correctly.
Finally, I welcome the offer by the Ombudsman to develop joint activities with the Committee on Petitions with a view to reinforcing the contacts and exchange of experience with national and regional Ombudsmen and committees on petitions.
Closer cooperation between the European Ombudsman's office and the Committee on Petitions is vital.
Our work is very much interlinked and we were provided with excellent examples of how this could be achieved when the Ombudsman addressed the Committee on Petitions in April.
I commend the report to the House and wish the Ombudsman a very happy retirement.
Madam President, the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions in 2001-2002, for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur, and the parallel annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman, which are being debated jointly today, should not be seen as two routine reports. And there are very specific reasons why not.
These reports concern two fundamental rights - the right of petition and the right of complaint - of European citizens.
These rights are inextricably linked to their nationality and are the main means of consolidating political control by the European Parliament of where and how Community law is being applied by the Community institutions and the Member States.
These petitions and complaints give us a very specific idea of the degree to which European citizens' expectations of Europe are being fulfilled.
We can, to a large degree, give real expression to the aim of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, the promised strengthening of the democratic credentials of the European Union and, more especially, of the European Parliament, and the much-vaunted objective of greater transparency, by properly developing the institutions of petition and complaint.
This being so, I should like, if I may, to invite my honourable friends to carefully study these reports and the proposals, all of which are designed to increase the reliability of the Community institutions and ensure that measures taken are implemented more efficiently.
Many of these proposals can be implemented within the framework of the current Treaties.
Others need the Treaties to be revised and the report drafted by Mr De Rossa on behalf of the Committee on Petitions for the president of the convention on the future of Europe is of interest here.
In both cases, whatever else, these issues should be at the top of the agenda of the political groups.
As to the proposals contained in my report, which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Petitions, I should like to start by commenting on one which I consider is of both practical and symbolic value.
Parliament examines three reports every year.
The first is the report by the Committee on Petitions, examining the petitions filed by European citizens on shortcomings in the application of Community law by the Member States.
The second, the Ombudsman's report, examines complaints about the failure of Community institutions to comply with Community law.
The third, which is submitted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, concerns the application of Community law by the Member States.
In other words, three reports which are directly related and have common objectives and which do not warrant separate consideration.
They should be dealt with jointly in a part-session with as much publicity as possible.
At the same time, in view of the fact that, one way or another, all three reports involve national authorities, such as national parliaments, national courts and national administrative departments, and many of the issues touched on in them depend on their degree of involvement and control, I think that the possibility of these reports being debated in the European Parliament in the presence of representatives of the national authorities should be addressed.
This will improve cooperation, especially with the national parliaments, and the debate will gain maximum publicity and incite the interest of European citizens.
Another point to emerge from the study is the increased number of petitions and complaints which, from one point of view, is a good thing, because it shows that citizens are broadly involved in the exercise of these rights.
But, after a certain point, it creates practical problems which need to be addressed.
Obviously these problems will increase with enlargement.
So, sooner or later, we will need to set these institutions on a new footing.
To be precise, we shall need to examine the possibility of decentralising services with the help of national ombudsmen or committees on petitions and, possibly, the offices of the European Parliament in the capitals of the various Member States.
There are other proposals which merit consideration, but there is too little time for me to comment on them.
I shall confine myself to a few words on the content of the report.
Social issues were again the most sensitive area in the year under review.
Problems connected with free movement, such as violation of the right of residence, double taxation, failure to safeguard insurance rights, environmental issues and the recognition of diplomas and skills.
What is encouraging is that, in numerous cases, once the relevant national authorities were contacted, petitioners obtained justice.
It is also encouraging that there has been an increase in the number of collective petitions, i.e. petitions with more than a thousand signatures.
The potential of collective petitions is something we should be looking at, because it also involves non-governmental organisations.
To close, it would be a huge oversight on my part, in view of the imminent departure of the Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, if I were to fail not just to congratulate him but to express my admiration for the work he has done, work which justifies the institution of the ombudsman in the eyes of the citizens of Europe and leaves behind it an important heritage which needs to be safeguarded and strengthened in the future.
Madam President, the annual debate on the activities of the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman focuses our attention on the relationship between citizens and the institutions.
This relationship is fundamental, and forms the basis for all our policies since ultimately they are addressed to the citizens.
It is therefore important that once a year Parliament, the Ombudsman and the Commission take stock of how this dimension is taken into account in their regular and day-to-day activities.
However, this year the debate is different for two reasons.
Firstly, work on the Convention is in full swing.
It will map out the future of Europe, and both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have referred to that body the issue of citizens' rights through proposals concerning, on the one hand, the right to petition, and on the other, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, an administrative law and means of appeal.
Secondly, the Ombudsman, Mr SÃ¶derman, has told Parliament that he wishes to stand down at the end of March 2003, so this is the last time that he will present an annual report to this Assembly.
Allow me to take this opportunity to thank Mr SÃ¶derman, on behalf of the Commission, for the work he has carried out since he was appointed in July 1995.
As the first EU Ombudsman, he has played a pioneering role, helping to bring about a real change of culture within the Commission, and I am sure that this also applies to the other institutions and bodies.
In addition, his own-initiative enquiries have also had direct consequences, and resulted in positive administrative reforms.
I should like to mention some of them.
Firstly, the Code of Good Administrative Conduct which, it should be stressed, was the result of an initiative by Parliament when adopting the Perry report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 1996.
Then in the recruitment sphere, there have been firstly the removal, in two stages, of the age limit in competitions and, secondly, the Ombudsman's success in obtaining the right for any participant in a competition to have access to their corrected papers.
Both these things required quite a change in administration and tradition in the institutions.
Lastly, his efforts have prompted us to organise more structured relations between complainants and the Commission in infringement procedures.
These are the areas in which the institutional relations between the Ombudsman - often supported by Parliament, moreover - and the Commission have led to genuine progress.
I should like to return briefly to the Code of Good Administrative Conduct, because the reports by Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis raise this matter.
It should be pointed out that from the outset the Commission was receptive to Parliament and the Ombudsman.
It has drawn up various drafts starting in 1998 and now under the present Commission it has drawn up and adopted its own Code of Conduct aimed at the citizen, binding in nature and corresponding to many of the points in the Code of Conduct drawn up by the Ombudsman himself.
This important work led the Commission to amend its own Rules of Procedure in October 2000.
Not all the institutions have acted in that way.
Of course there remain certain differences compared with the latter code, as the Ombudsman, Mr Perry, and now Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn have pointed out.
Be that as it may, the Commission code represents real progress.
Of all the codes adopted by the institutions, it is the one which corresponds the most closely to the Ombudsman's proposals.
It entered into force in November 2000, and a first evaluation report has now been finalised.
It will be circulated shortly.
The Commission is well aware that, despite all its efforts, the European Ombudsman would like to go further.
He has in fact referred this issue to Parliament in a special report, with the result that a year ago Parliament expressed itself in favour of a single harmonised code for all the institutions.
This is still the position today of your rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis
The Commission realises that the situation is not totally satisfactory at present since European citizens are confronted with different standards of good administration depending on which institutions they contact.
However, the Commission is not in a position at present to launch a legislative initiative.
The first report on the application of the Commission code covers only a few cases, as you will no doubt see, and we know nothing about how the other codes are being implemented by the other institutions.
In addition, as I have just mentioned, discussions are in progress at the Convention concerning the adoption of an administrative law, and we should undoubtedly wait for its results.
I notice in this connection that the proposal made by the Ombudsman to the Convention provides for the adoption of such a law within one year of the entry into force of the Treaty.
It seems to me that this gives us some room for manoeuvre.
Lastly, while it is true that an interinstitutional approach aimed at the adoption of a single code and a single law is no doubt useful, the fact remains that the situation in each institution is specific, and a degree of flexibility is called for.
I will not go through all the points raised in the reports by Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn, but I must say that relations between the Ombudsman and the Commission, although cordial and very productive, may from time to time give rise to disagreements in the context of institutional relations.
While the Commission pays tribute to the work accomplished by the Ombudsman, the fact remains that there are still differences of opinion on certain points.
Firstly, there is the question of the application of the relevant provisions of Regulation 1049/2001 to infringement dossiers and how to interpret the data protection directive.
However, I will not repeat here the position expressed on behalf of the Commission by Mr Bolkestein on this latter point or the opinion expressed by the Commission concerning the proposal to amend the rules governing the Ombudsman.
Both Parliament and the Ombudsman are well aware of these positions.
Nevertheless, I should like to return for a moment to the report by Mr Koukiadis on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions.
The Commission shares the rapporteur's main concern of organising more efficient working and cooperation conditions between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions.
Incidentally, as the President and some Members will know, I have personal experience of very well-organised cooperation with the committee in a specific case.
Returning to the text, the prospect of enlargement should prompt us to improve our procedure still further and, in this connection, I would reiterate the Commission's willingness to debate a review of the interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament on the examination of petitions.
The Commission also agrees with the rapporteur about cooperation with the national parliaments and with the national administrations as part of the efforts to find solutions to problems raised by petitions.
Allow me to conclude with a few points which should be made at this time of institutional deliberations.
One of the objectives of the Convention is to bring the institutions closer to citizens.
In this context, there can be no question of reducing the possibilities with regard to exercising the right of petition, but rather of consolidating them or providing a framework for them.
In addition, it is clearly very important, as part of the clarification of the institutional system, that citizens should be aware of the various means of appeal available to them at the various levels of the institutional machinery.
The Commission therefore welcomes the contributions by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, and undertakes to examine them constructively.
Moreover, by adopting a constructive dialogue approach, the Commission, the Ombudsman and the European Parliament will make the best possible contribution to defending the interests of European citizens.
Madam President, we are debating the last annual report which will be presented to the Parliament by Jacob SÃ¶derman.
Today is not the time when we say farewell, but it is a moment to appreciate the work that Jacob SÃ¶derman has carried out and his efforts on our behalf and very much in the interests of Europe.
The European Union institutions are inevitably a large and complex bureaucracy and, of course, there are going to be mistakes and administrative errors.
The institutions seek to minimise those errors, and they must be prepared to listen to advice on how to do that.
The Ombudsman is there, as we all know, to act as the arbiter in a fair and objective way.
I would say to the Commission that they must think long and hard before they reject any of the Ombudsman's findings.
I been appalled to come across examples where the Commission has blatantly rejected the Ombudsman's findings.
Without going into details, I have a letter here from Mr Prodi to one of my colleagues.
The Ombudsman found there had been maladministration and the Commission flatly refused to reverse the situation.
Mr Prodi writes: 'I am convinced that the solution we offer is the most suitable in the light of the specificity of the case and I am disappointed that your constituent does not see it this way'.
It is hardly surprising that the MEP concerned has written to me in the Committee on Petitions to say that the reply from the President of the Commission is preposterous.
It is impossible to defend that before the citizens.
I am sorry in some sense that it is Commissioner Liikanen who is here this morning.
I always appreciate his words and certainly acknowledge the good relations between his department and the Committee on Petitions.
I was very heartened to hear his words this morning about the Commission's preparedness to look at the review of the inter-institutional agreement.
The time for that is certainly getting very close.
I want to make stronger points about the Code of Administrative Behaviour.
Last December, Commissioner Kinnock promised to this House that we would receive a review on the workings of the voluntary Code.
We are yet to see it, although we have heard it will come in the near future.
To my mind, it is already a year late.
A code has to be binding, it must not be a voluntary code; and it also needs to be consistent.
The citizens of Europe do not distinguish between the institutions of the European Union.
To them, Brussels is one place, Strasbourg is somewhere else.
They want a consistent code across each of the institutions.
I have analysed the voluntary code of the Commission and compared it with that proposed by the Ombudsman.
In over 70% of the articles, there are differences.
Some differences may be small, but some are very big indeed.
The Commission code does not explicitly recognise the need for courtesy.
There is no provision for an apology or correction of mistakes.
The Commission code is very weak on access to documents and on discrimination: it does not recognise that discrimination can be based on language, membership of a national minority or even appearance.
The Commission's code says staff shall not be guided by personal interest.
The Ombudsman's code says the official shall not take part in a decision in which he or she or any close member of his or her family has a financial interest.
I would urge the Commission to be more relaxed about it, to listen to the code that is proposed by the Ombudsman and endorsed by this House, and to accept it.
It should be in the forefront, it should not say: 'Well, none of the other institutions has done so'.
I know that is the case.
Nevertheless, the Commission is in the driving seat here and should be much readier to accept the advice, coming from friends, which will enable it to face the citizens of Europe much more confidently.
I am delighted to say that the Committee on Petitions had a recent meeting with the Danish presidency at which the presidency expressed its willingness to look at the new interinstitutional agreement.
We have the communication from the Commission on complaints and petitions, and we now have Mr Liikanen's proposals.
The time has come for us to have that new interinstitutional agreement.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I join with Roy Perry in saying that we should not let this occasion pass without expressing our gratitude for the work of Jacob SÃ¶derman, the first Ombudsman of the European Union, and for the success with which it has been rewarded.
I would also like to say that we can congratulate ourselves on having had the courage, in 1995, to entrust this great task to - if I may say so - a rather unknown representative of a new Member State.
I would like to congratulate Jacob SÃ¶derman on having focused our attention on the essential matters, namely the total reform of the European institutions, in which secretive dealings of one sort or another gave way to the principle of openness and transparency.
Above all, I also thank our Ombudsman for the very quiet, calm, but determined way in which he did his work.
We know the examples, and that we could not take an easier way, but we see from the successes chalked up by the administrations in the EU's northern countries - Finland, Sweden and Denmark, which score lowest on the index of corruption - that there is no such alternative.
I share the disappointment expressed earlier at the spectacle, over and over again, of the hesitancy manifested by the so-called Brussels bureaucracy.
This is an area in which we need to press on.
It was not least this opacity, this inability to identify what was going on, that brought down the European Union's last Commission.
By touching on sore points, Mr SÃ¶derman has done the right thing.
Let us recall the delayed payments.
The Commission is one of the worst bodies in Europe when it comes to paying up, yet see the self-assurance with which it lays down rules for all economic actors, while itself being in fact incapable of making payments in a proper manner!
In the most simple terms, this is about bringing administration closer to the citizen.
It is the experience of all of us, again and again, that the people back home talk about how big our bureaucracy is in Brussels.
We know that it is a very small one, but it acts big.
I have to say, as rapporteur for the Budget, that I am a little ashamed - although I am aware that it is mainly the fault of the Finance Ministers of the fifteen Member States - of our manifest inability to equip the European Ombudsman's office with the staff its importance warrants.
We in Parliament are doing our best, and we will find a solution, but the finance ministers obviously think that enlargement is not actually in the offing and that the Ombudsman will not need extra staff.
This really saddens me, and it is something I have to say in the hearing of many members of the public.
Emphasis has been laid on the good cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions.
It is Jacob SÃ¶derman's leadership that has given us the modern institution of a European Ombudsman.
Now, perhaps, it is our responsibility, and that of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament as a whole, to bring our activities up to a comparable standard.
Madam President, Commissioner, Ombudsman, I am delighted, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to take advantage of this historic moment to thank Mr SÃ¶derman for his work in promoting values we hold dear.
Like everyone else, I am thinking particularly of transparency and good administration.
We note that, yesterday, the Ombudsman once again pointed out the misuse of data protection, that is to say of the personal data laws, to prevent the transparency we desire.
I want MEPs to be aware of the fact that the Ombudsman is pointing in this case not only to the Commission but also to Parliament.
We must turn the focus upon ourselves when we reflect upon how we work.
I also see that Mrs Hautala, who is one of the rapporteurs in this area, is present in the Chamber.
We are talking with forked tongues today in Parliament too.
It is also interesting to see that, in the ongoing consultation procedure on data protection, at least four Member States have proposed significant changes.
I hope that we in Parliament will support these changes when they reach us.
When it comes to the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour, I have to admit that I do not properly understand Commissioner Liikanen's approach, the consequence of which is that the Commission is now unable to do anything.
Like many Member States, we noted that the discussion on good governance had opened up possibilities.
In Parliament, we have spent a long time studying the legal base for the proposal tabled and are left in no doubt that there are legal possibilities there.
Why waste time when it is a question of doing something that will benefit people?
Even though there is now better cooperation, I personally am extremely disappointed at the Commission's response to our initiative regarding the Ombudsman's statute.
The amendments we tabled were very modest and not at all extensive.
I therefore hope that the Danish Presidency can instead achieve some success in this area.
The Ombudsman needs to be able to carry out his work in full.
On Monday, Mrs Corbey raised an issue in Parliament concerning the ways in which the Commission helps people to resolve issues and solve problems in connection with the application of Community law.
It seems to me that the Commission is at a complete loss here.
The Solvit system, which will shortly be presented in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has been introduced, while Eurojust, referred to by Mrs Corbey, is not being maintained.
Citizens Direct is being launched, but without any real success.
We have a lot to do in this area. It is very unclear how the Commission is to utilise resources.
Finally, I should like Parliament itself to reflect upon how we deal with the complaints that come in.
We shall prepare the legislation on the recognition of examinations later this autumn.
It is an area in which we have received a great many proposals.
It nonetheless seems as if many people prefer not to take account of these proposals but, rather, to stick to national legislation and not accept the signals coming from our citizens.
What, in my view, is most gratifying about this debate is the fact that the Commission has declared itself willing to study the interinstitutional agreement and how we are to handle complaints, something which, as Mr Perry mentioned, the Danish Presidency is also prepared to do.
There is a window of opportunity this autumn.
We must use that window in order to improve the position of our citizens and not wait until the Commission takes the initiative.
We should also study the Ombudsman's draft Convention as it relates, for example, to recourse to the EC Court of Justice, for there are some problematic issues where the conflict has not been solved between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Ombudsman and Parliament, on the other.
Finally, may I say a big thank-you to Mr SÃ¶derman, who speaks the same beautiful, and most easily understandable, form of Swedish as I do.
Madam President, I believe that nobody doubts today, and nor should they, that the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman contribute to two fundamental principles of European construction: the application of Community law and also the institutions' knowledge of the citizens.
Nevertheless, I believe we must make improvements in certain areas in order to prevent the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman from confronting problems while carrying out their everyday work.
Firstly, on a very practical level, I believe we should strengthen the services of the Ombudsman, the services of our own secretariat and the services of the European Commission which work closely with us, Commissioner, because sometimes they have difficulties providing us with information on the petitions we send them.
Secondly, the presence of the Council in our Committee on Petitions should sometimes be essential, but it never appears.
I believe that time limits should be reduced, otherwise we will lose credibility.
We should renounce those Member States which obstruct the work of the Committee on Petitions. There are some and we all know who they are.
We should be able to suspend projects that violate Community law and Europe's natural and cultural spaces.
Madam President, I believe that the method of a joint report by the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman should also be used for the joint annual report on respect for and application of Community law, because that would show us how essential the work of the Ombudsman and the work of the Committee on Petitions is in assessing the application of Community law.
I would like to end, Madam President, by thanking the European Ombudsman for his work promoting the transparency and efficiency of the European institutions and furthermore for his independence, which has been clear to us throughout this time.
Madam President, I would like to thank both rapporteurs for their conscientious work and also the Ombudsman and his team for their hard work in ensuring that the rights of citizens and residents are upheld and good practice is pursued, if not always attained.
We also appreciate very much the work of the Ombudsman in developing the network of ombudsmen across the whole of Europe and in other countries.
This leaves a very sound basis for his successor and my group would also like to add their thanks for his work.
I should like to draw attention to Conclusions 9 and 16 of Mr Wyn's report on the work of the Ombudsman, and to the lack of progress in one particular case.
Some people have already referred to this and I was Parliament's rapporteur.
This case raises serious issues of what happens when Parliament upholds the Ombudsman's view on a case, this one relating to data protection and access to information, and the Commission does not agree.
It raises questions of institutional balance, as well as issues surrounding the application of data protection itself.
The lack of a conclusion so far certainly means that the complainant is left in limbo, not quite understanding what it means when elected Members can come to one conclusion and the Commission another.
What is the way out?
We need to look at that as well as to consider the future role of the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, especially with the development of competences in the field of justice and home affairs and also with enlargement.
While we are looking at the role of the institutions I would also like to reinforce Conclusion 11 of Mr Koukiadis's report which mentions the Council's 'lack of enthusiasm' - very tactfully put I felt - with regard to the Committee on Petitions.
Mrs Thors has already mentioned issues about the mutual recognition of qualifications.
One of the other big problems we have in making progress in certain cases, especially those relating to the environment - such as waste disposal, water quality, etc. are the delays at national level in providing information to the Commission.
Despite some of the criticisms of the Commission, at the level of the Committee on Petitions we generally work very well together.
That brings us to Conclusion 18 of the Koukiadis report, which has already been mentioned by Mrs GonzÃ¡lez Ãlvarez and talks about the possibility of introducing interim protective measures which suspend actions.
We do not say this lightly, but sometimes we get the impression that delaying tactics are put in place by Member States and authorities to allow projects to go past the stage where they might be halted.
That needs very serious consideration in future.
Madam President, the twin bodies of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman form a key plank in bringing the European Union closer to its people.
Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union.
As a directly elected representative of the people, I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents.
Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee.
I would like to offer Mr SÃ¶derman my fullest congratulations on an outstanding tenure of office.
He came to Strasbourg with already considerable experience in defending citizens' rights in his own country.
Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one.
There is no doubt that in areas such as openness, transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people, the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective.
Mr SÃ¶derman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year.
He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post.
Informing citizens about this important office naturally requires time and resources, and it is true that work remains to be done in increasing the profile of the European Ombudsman.
Whoever Mr SÃ¶derman's replacement might be, and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way, he will have a lot to live up to.
Mr SÃ¶derman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe.
He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration.
I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long, cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland.
Madam President, great praise has been showered on Mr SÃ¶derman and also on the two rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis.
It is as a matter of principle that I wish to reiterate this, having read this great tome that comes out every year and found that he has achieved an enormous amount.
It is lamentable that the Committee on Petitions is prevented from playing the part to which it might do justice by the excessive inadequacy of the resources with which it is equipped.
The Committee on Petitions must be a real point of contact for citizens, but the Council should also take even more account of it.
The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens.
This might present an opportunity to do this at this level, and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombudsmen and with committees on petitions.
The European Union will always find it difficult to be recognised in the Member States as the servant of the people that it is meant to be.
In particular, more attention needs to be paid to Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
This is where it is enormously important that the Charter should become legally binding and be incorporated into the Treaties.
If we do not manage to force this through, we will find the European Union's credibility hard to defend.
Madam President, I am going to comment on the Koukiadis report.
Hardly a year has passed since we debated the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions for 2001 - for which I was rapporteur - and I am pleased to note that the right of petition is increasingly strengthening the political control that the European Parliament can exercise in relation to excessive violations of Community law.
This also allows us to assess the state of the application of that law within the Union and the degree of satisfaction amongst the citizens with the Community institutions, which are absolutely essential in a Union which is so large, so multi-faceted and sometimes so disconnected from those institutions.
All of this is taken up superbly in the report by Mr Koukiadis which, furthermore, comes at an historic moment for the Convention, which should not sidestep - this would be a great mistake - the strengthening of the right to petition and the enlargement of a uniform administrative code of conduct.
For all these reasons, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koukiadis.
However, we once again regret - and this aspect is also taken up in the report we are debating - the lack of attention the Council is paying to this inalienable right of the European citizens, since the Council is still absent throughout the process, and this at a time when it is trying to gain more power for itself, to the detriment of Parliament and the Commission.
Furthermore, we are delighted at the intention to introduce preventive measures to prevent abuses of cultural and environmental heritage - which, by the way, are issues which are at the forefront of the European citizens' concerns.
I will end by insisting also that we should investigate procedures aimed at effectively remedying the national authorities' lack of willingness to cooperate with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament.
We must study them and implement them as soon as possible.
We have had enough of the lukewarm positions of the Council and the national governments.
As the rapporteur suggests and as has been proposed in corresponding reports in previous years, we should even go as far as to renounce, in press conferences, the obstructive and reticent attitudes of the governments to the resolutions of Parliament's Committee on Petitions.
And I would also like to wish Jacob SÃ¶derman all the best for his Iberian retirement.
Mr President, the report submitted by the Ombudsman demonstrates that this is an important and necessary post.
We must safeguard the financial resources of the Ombudsman's office.
This is something that is not always taken sufficiently seriously in Parliament's Committee on Budgets.
I will use the same figure of speech the former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the former Soviet Union used referring to the present Chairman of the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, Mikhail Gorbachov: the Ombudsman must have iron teeth.
With regard to human resources management in the EU the Members of the Commission act as both prosecutors and judges.
This is shown once again in the case of Martha Andreasen.
It would be appropriate if the impartial Ombudsman were also to look into that person's punishment.
The present system does not provide legal protection.
It would also certainly be worth the Ombudsman's while to undertake an own-initiative enquiry and report with regard to the administrative practices of the European Central Bank.
The bank's openness and the transparency of its administration represent the worst standards in the EU.
It is regrettable that the Ombudsman in his annual report should have to state that the EU institutions have failed both to put the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and implement the decision on the European Parliament's good administrative behaviour.
The remarks about administrative discrimination on the grounds of age or gender are particularly regrettable.
In the annual report there are 21 photographs of the Ombudsman, and in most of them he has a gentle expression on his face.
When it is a matter of a departure from good administrative practice the friendly exterior should deceive nobody.
Our Ombudsman acts fearlessly, like Jaakko Ilkka in the Finnish Cudgel War, against the tyranny of the administrative nobility.
Mr President, I will not use up my two minutes to thank the Ombudsman - because it would be quite possible to do so - but instead I will focus attention on a matter raised in Mr Wynn's report.
The Ombudsman has appealed to the Convention proposing that he should in some cases be able to refer violations of fundamental rights to the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
This is a notion that should be taken seriously, because the Ombudsman seems to be the sole European institution that is really founded on the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
All the other institutions seem instead to be backsliding with regard to its demands, although it is the very institutions themselves these demands should be binding on.
Secondly, I would like to raise a point made in the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, which is absolutely crucial with regard to what Mr Kronberger said about strengthening the powers of the Committee on Petitions so that it could represent and defend the rights of citizens.
Point 5 of Mr Koukiadis's report states the notion that the Treaties should provide the possibility for citizens to initiate reform of Community law by petitioning the European Parliament.
I ardently support this view and believe that, as we are discussing opportunities for citizens to have an influence, we should at long last include citizens as participants in the decision-making process and not just as the subjects of that process.
We might take an example from a country like Switzerland, where the people can indeed initiate the legislative process.
I believe we need such initiatives if we want the public to accept that the European Union has jurisdiction over their lives.
Mr President, the task of Ombudsman demands both great patience and considerable optimism in terms of getting the EU institutions to comply with basic demands concerning the Rule of Law and democratic accountability.
Mr SÃ¶derman has carried out his task with infinite patience, particularly in regard to the Commission which has shown no understanding of elementary administrative culture.
It is difficult to sustain optimism, however.
I do not want to suggest that Mr SÃ¶derman has given up, but the fact that the EU's competent and patient Ombudsman has chosen to retire early is a signal that the Commission's absolute power is too overwhelming.
Absolute power does not only result in passivity; it is revealed in the active opposition to the Ombudsman's efforts to introduce the Nordic countries' administrative culture into the institutions of the EU.
A couple of examples: freedom of expression is practised as the freedom to employ several hundred million euro on spreading EU propaganda, in conjunction with the ruthless censorship of critical voices.
One has only to read about the latest victim of the arrogance of power. Her name is Marta Andreasen.
Data protection is used not to protect citizens' private lives but to secure the Commission's monopoly on knowledge.
The Ombudsman's right to gather uncensored information is sabotaged outright by the Commission.
I would take the liberty of referring to the Ombudsman's brilliant answer to the Commission's scandalous statement of 6 March of this year, a statement characterised by the Ombudsman in terms of the negative points of view and false assumptions it contained.
There is a long way to go.
With his latest report, Mr SÃ¶derman deserves a big thank-you for having tried to make the way shorter, but his departure gives new topicality to the issue of whether we shall ever reach the end of the road or only remain at the start of it.
Is the EU system, characterised as it is by absolute power, simply resistant to the Rule of Law and democratic accountability?
There are an appallingly large number of witnesses to the fact that the answer might be in the affirmative.
Mr President, Strasbourg has come to symbolise not only peace, but also human rights, civil liberties and parliamentary government.
It was here, fifty-three years ago, that the Council of Europe was set up, and where it still has a special concern for human rights.
It was here, fifty-two years ago, that the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted, our neighbour the European Court of Human Rights being its fruit.
It was here, fifty years ago, that a European Parliament met for the first time.
This week has found us observing its fiftieth anniversary.
It was here too that we had our first joint session with the European Council's Parliamentary Assembly, which might well have been rather tricky in technical terms, but I must say that those responsible overcame the difficulties brilliantly.
This was also a long-awaited opportunity to build stronger links between these two institutions, the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council.
Strasbourg is also the seat of the European Ombudsman, who expresses our vision of a citizens' Europe, a Europe of human rights.
It has already frequently been said that Brussels, being the home of the Commission and of the Council, is increasingly synonymous with bad administrative practice.
I consider this rather unfair, and have to say so too, as Brussels is where the administration of the Council and the Commission does much that is exemplary.
Indeed, the present Commission - and I have for some years been numbered among the great critics of the Commission - and Mr Liikanen as well, have done much to systematically improve its administrative practices.
Despite that, there is still a staggering amount remaining to be done.
Unlike Mrs Hautala, I do not believe that the introduction of more direct democracy will win the public over to European integration.
What works outstandingly well in the small democratic structure that is the canton of Appenzell, will not work in the same way in a Community with half a billion inhabitants.
The end result would be a society governed by hysteria, in which politics would be run by demagogues in television companies.
What we need is decentralisation and the Rule of Law.
A great deal has been said today about the Nordic culture.
I welcome that.
The Ombudsman is a Nordic invention, but we are not the Nordic community; we are the European Community.
The concept of supranational law is a Roman achievement.
That is why I was very glad to hear something Mr Gemelli said.
'What is decisive,' he said, 'is that people are aware of their European citizenship.'
You can say it in Latin just as well: 'Civis europaeis sum.'
Only when people can say that will the unification of Europe have been achieved.
That is why we need good administration, clear principles of human rights, and Europe as a Community based on the Rule of Law!
Mr President, I must also applaud the splendid work done by Mr SÃ¶derman as European Ombudsman.
I also want, however, to emphasise that Mr Posselt and Mr Liikanen have made an important point.
We must have institutions that fight for citizens' rights in the EU.
We must have colleagues who show that they are in favour of securing citizens' rights, but that is not enough in itself.
It is our task to ensure that citizens are also given resources to campaign themselves for their own rights. It is our task to guarantee that the individual is not powerless before the institutions of the EU.
That, moreover, is precisely the job of the European Ombudsman.
It is therefore also our task in the European Parliament to ensure that the Ombudsman is given the opportunities and the tools that make for the right working conditions, including access to documents and the opportunity of talking with employees and obtaining clear answers.
I would urge the Danish Presidency to make efforts along these lines in order to ensure that the European Ombudsman is able to operate as intended.
Mr President, may I too start by congratulating the European Ombudsman on what is indeed a valuable job extremely well done, before commenting on the excellent report by my honourable friend, Mr Koukiadis, and drawing the House's attention in particular to two points which, in my view, should be included in the Treaties on the occasion of the Convention.
The first concerns point 17, calling for ways to be considered of persuading the national authorities to respond to petitions by citizens and questions asked by the Committee on Petitions and the Commission.
We often encounter indifference or have to deal with obstructionism.
The rapporteur and the Committee on Petitions unanimously adopted the following proposal which I had the honour of tabling: "In the event of indifference or obstructionism on the part of the national authorities, the national media should be informed of this negative attitude and of the content of the petitioner's complaint."
As we all know, nothing affects or upsets national and local authorities more than their illegal acts or omissions or even their indifference towards their citizens being publicly exposed.
This publicity could be achieved by issuing press releases in the language of the country in question and by organising press conferences in which national MEPs, especially the members of the Committee on Petitions, could participate.
Secondly, I should like to point out that the Committee on Petitions receives huge numbers of petitions complaining about works planned or under way or conduct on the part of national authorities which violate mandatory Community rules, often resulting in irreparable damage to the environment or European cultural heritage.
Proceedings resulting in convictions by the European Court are so time-consuming as to be useless, because the damage has already been done and cannot then be rectified.
That is why I believe we should find ways of preventing damage pending a final decision by the European Court, where a petition has been referred to it.
As you know, temporary prohibitory or mandatory injunctions can be issued under national legislation, preventing damaging activities from starting or continuing until a decision is taken on whether or not they are legal.
This motion proposes something along similar lines and we should ardently support it.
Otherwise, what happens if a natural habitat is destroyed, for example?
It cannot be restored.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by pointing out that the protection of the citizens and their rights is one of the fundamental principles of our democracies.
I believe that if we safeguard the rights of the citizens and provide them with sufficient protection, we can also call upon them to discharge their responsibilities.
In my opinion, this should be the main consideration.
We must therefore consolidate these rights, and the way to do so is through the right of petition, which provides the individual citizen with the possibility of appealing to a dedicated body which can then carry out controls, whether it is the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions or the European Ombudsman.
I greatly welcome the cooperation between the two institutions, which I feel has been an extremely positive development. The network is up and running and is constantly improving, and I therefore feel that access must be further facilitated.
Improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies, but I believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible.
Therefore, we still need to do much more in terms of disseminating information.
It would be useful, for example, for all the publications issued by the European institutions for the public to read to contain, in future, a section on how to contact the Ombudsman and how to contact the Committee on Petitions, so that the individual citizens are provided with the possibility of receiving help at those times when they consider that the public administrations are not doing their duty and that their rights have been infringed, and to ensure that they are aware of the existence of this facility.
This would help us to improve our structures because, in actual fact, if we are aware of real or alleged malfunctions, we will be able, not least as Members of the European Parliament, to take appropriate measures to address them.
I will end on a very personal note.
In 1995, Mr SÃ¶derman, I voted for the occupant of the office adjacent to mine, who was not yourself but Mr Siegbert Alber.
It is therefore with even greater conviction that I thank you most sincerely for your work and for your efforts on behalf of the citizens.
Thank you and good luck for the rest of your term of office.
Mr President, I thought I would conclude by speaking my own language.
Finland is a bilingual country in which the linguistic minority enjoys a high level of protection, as I should like to demonstrate.
Secure protection for minorities is something we could certainly export to many corners of the world.
In the debate in Parliament today, almost everyone stood by the same values.
There is consequently not so much to say about this debate, but I should like to express my gratitude for all the kind words spoken in my honour.
You must all appreciate that those words really also apply to everyone else who has been involved in the same process including, of course, all the MEPs who have taken an interest in the Ombudsman's work and provided encouragement through their advice and criticism.
They also apply of course to the institutions represented today by Mr Liikanen and by the officials Mr Massangioli and Mr Godts, who have done a lot of work in conjunction with their colleagues to produce answers for the Ombudsman and to ensure that issues are straightened out.
Moreover, the Ombudsman does not do much other than head up the work.
I should also like to thank my staff for the sound work they have done and for the high level of motivation they have shown in their desire to help all European citizens.
Finally, I only hope that my successor - and, as you know, there are a lot of very good candidates - will be given the same stimulating and business-like reception as I have been given.
In that way, I believe that the citizens of Europe will thrive in the wake of my retirement.
I shall no doubt accept the invitation to visit sunny Ireland.
I too would like to thank Mr SÃ¶derman for all his work over the past few years.
The debate is closed.
The vote will take place at 12 noon.
The next item is the report (A5-0278/2002) by Mrs Boudjenah, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the European Parliament's recommendations to the Commission concerning the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP countries and regions [2002/2097(INI)].
Mr President, the main objective of any agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union should consist of promoting sustainable forms of development which help to reduce poverty and constitute a basis for the integration of the ACP countries into the world economy.
This excerpt from the Cape Town Declaration sums up fairly well the spirit in which the Committee on Development and Cooperation drew up the report that I shall present to you today.
First of all, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who contributed by tabling numerous amendments or by participating actively in the hearings we organised, one with Commissioner Lamy, another with the Secretariat of the ACP group and two representatives of African and European NGOs.
I would also like to thank the many interlocutors, key figures, NGOs and trade unionists with whom I have tried to take account of all the problems raised.
The negotiations for economic partnership agreements will therefore take place tomorrow in Brussels.
This is an important event that marks the end of one stage, but also the beginning of another, in which each individual must make themselves heard.
With the Cotonou Agreement promising a new participative approach, the time has come to innovate.
Broad public debate together with open, transparent negotiations would be a good starting point.
The purpose of these negotiations coincides directly with the current debate on the correlation between trade and development.
The development dimension is increasingly important in our commercial policy, as stated by Commissioner Lamy and duly noted.
We are still concerned, however, that development is thus being progressively reduced to a mere dimension, an accessory to the liberalisation of trade, whereas it is specific policies that are needed here.
We should certainly ask ourselves what the merits are of opening up markets in itself.
It will not, for example, curb the deterioration of trade terms for poor countries, even though this is one of the main obstacles to their development and, more importantly, to their survival.
Does the world really need an extra dose of free trade or a new approach to development?
Can the eradication of poverty in the ACP countries be reduced to trade?
Should trade not be, first and foremost, a tool for development, for satisfying the people's needs?
Should we not first address the structural causes of poverty?
We believe these lie mainly in the shortcomings of production and marketing structures centring on the immediate export of raw materials instead of processing them locally and promoting South-South trade.
Non-tariff barriers also constitute major obstacles to accessing the European Union market.
As for guaranteed-price schemes, have they not lacked the necessary means to prevent the efforts of developing countries from being ruined by unfavourable circumstances?
Lastly, the introduction of conditional criteria for structural adjustments under the aegis of the IMF and the World Bank, and the weight of reimbursing the debt certainly fall into the category of EU-ACP failures.
We should nevertheless listen to the ACP countries when they campaign to retain the best aspects of LomÃ©, which relies heavily on the principle of non-reciprocity.
The proposal for new trade relations could therefore turn out to be counterproductive were it to consist of proposing benefits which are in themselves obstacles that must be overcome.
An African expert gave this example by way of illustration: we can export computers, sports cars and equipment for nuclear power stations without paying customs duties; the only trouble is that we do not make any.
It is touching to know that sorghum and manioc can be exported to Europe, but sadly European consumers do not want any.
Under these circumstances, do we need to establish new free trade agreements, or rather invest in production tools and make the conditions for granting manufacturing licences more flexible?
These are the subjects of parallel negotiations taking place within the WTO.
The European Union and the ACP countries together form a considerable proportion of WTO members, in other words a majority, a force which can and must influence negotiations until 2005, ensuring that the rights of developing countries are recognised.
These countries suffer from weak economic structures which justify special treatment in order to address the causes of inequality in the world.
What is needed is special and differential treatment to tackle new challenges and simultaneously encompass long-term technological, financial and trade measures designed to build sustainable capacity in each area in which there is inequality between countries.
Lastly, allow me to raise a few specific questions.
What is the probable impact of free trade areas on the social, economic and environmental situation of the ACP countries?
Mr Lamy announced a detailed study over four years to accompany the process.
Fine.
But how can a relevant opinion be formulated on the proposed guidelines without using this essential information as soon as possible?
Furthermore, can the Commission tell us which criteria were used for this study and what means will be available to the ACP countries to carry out their own assessment?
What coherence is there between all the free trade agreements that the European Union is currently signing with various partners?
What is the point, therefore, of the ACP countries signing these agreements?
Let us now consider the organisation of the negotiations.
Are the Commission and the Council prepared to accept the ACP group's proposal to allow a sufficiently long first stage to clarify, as emphasised by Mr Goulongana, Secretary-General of the group, the objective of the EPAs, the principles, the ground rules, etc.?
We are convinced of the need to do all we can to preserve the cohesion of the ACP group.
This is also true with regard to the integration and unity process currently underway in Africa.
With regard to services, we shall consider any liberalisation proposals, with the exception of education, health, water, energy and transport.
That is why I am prepared to accept Amendment No 2 tabled by the PPE-DE, but as a supplement.
Public services are essential factors in the social model ?
(The President cut the speaker off)
Madam President, the Commission appreciates and welcomes the strong interest the European Parliament takes in EU-ACP negotiations of economic partnership agreements, as witnessed by the report of the development committee by Mrs Boudjenah and the opinion of the industry and trade committee by Mr Titley.
I would like to thank the honourable Members for their work.
The European Parliament has also shown an impeccable sense of timing by tabling this report just before the launch of the EU-ACP negotiations on the economic partnership agreements tomorrow.
From the Commission's point of view, the main strength of the report is that it puts ACP development at the centre of the EPA negotiations.
This is exactly where the Commission wants it to be.
EPAs shall be a tool for the smooth and gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy, thereby promoting sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication.
To this end, the ACP and the EU have decided to negotiate in a spirit of partnership the progressive removal of barriers to trade between them.
The resulting agreements will extend to all areas relevant to trade, notably non-direct measures.
The EPAs shall also be WTO-compatible and build on ACP regional integration initiatives as key instruments for ACP integration into the world economy.
This is in a nutshell what was laid down in the ACP-EU agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000, an agreement endorsed by the European Parliament.
In Cotonou the ACP and the EU agreed to enter into EPA negotiations and laid down objectives, principles and modalities for these agreements.
Some of the questions raised in the report had thus already been settled at the time of the Cotonou Agreement.
The Commission refers, for instance, to those parts of the report which call for the continuation of non-reciprocal trade preferences for the ACP.
Non-reciprocal preferences have not achieved, and cannot achieve, the closer integration of ACP countries into the world economy.
A more comprehensive approach is needed aimed at enhancing ACP supply and trading capacities and the capacity to attract investment.
This was the joint conclusion of the ACP states and the EU when negotiating the Cotonou Agreement, and that is why they agreed to conclude WTO-compatible trading arrangements to progressively remove all barriers to trade between them.
Trade liberalisation on both sides is an indispensable element of this undertaking, provided it is not pursued blindly but flexibly.
In short, our common objective is to use trade for development.
Likewise, retention, consolidation and possible extension of the commodity protocols is not in line with the Cotonou Agreement, which says we will review these protocols.
The Commission is of the opinion that we should not prejudge this review.
Lastly, any decisions on alternatives to the EPAs under the Cotonou Agreement are only to be taken in 2004 should the EPA negotiations show that EPAs do not offer the appropriate solutions for specific cases in the countries concerned.
The Commission agrees with the need, highlighted in the report, for analysis and assessment of the impact of the EPAs on sustainable development.
This will require a thorough and sustained effort throughout the negotiations.
The sustainability impact assessment foreseen in parallel with the negotiations is designed to achieve this goal.
It will enable systematic analysis of the impact of the different policy options considered in the course of the EPA negotiations as they evolve, and will thus inform negotiators' choice.
Its ongoing results should keep the negotiations on track towards genuine sustainable development.
The Commission also supports ACP countries and regions that want to undertake their own studies.
We have ensured that considerable amounts of money are available under national, regional, and all other ACP programmes not only for studies but for trade-related assistance and capacity-building more widely.
Meanwhile the Commission is going ahead with the sustainability impact assessment and we will do so in full transparency with regard to the European Parliament.
Mr President, the Committee on Industry in general welcomes the Commission's communication because the EPAs between the EU and different regions could reinforce economic cooperation between ACP countries and encourage their economic development.
Therefore, we particularly welcome the Commission's proposal that treatment granted to the EU be extended to all ACP-EPA partners before trade liberalisation with the EU.
This is particularly important.
It is not going to be easy, and some of the reasons for that have been outlined.
We have to proceed with caution and with flexibility.
We must not put pressure on ACP countries to enter into negotiations they do not feel to be appropriate, and we must safeguard and respect the rights of LDCs to non-reciprocal trade preferences.
We need, however, in particular, to encourage technical assistance to achieve institution building, which will allow balanced results.
We need to ensure that we take into account the capacity constraints of the ACP countries and seek to build those as part of the process.
We need to bear in mind that the abolition of tariffs could well cause a loss of public resources and, therefore, create budgetary problems.
We must not lose sight of our objective in relation to the Cotonou Agreement of poverty eradication and sustainable development.
Thus the Committee on Industry's position is very much to support the Commission's point of view and welcomes the fact that negotiations are going to start tomorrow but to ask that we proceed with sensitivity and caution.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement with the ACP regions represents an attempt on the part of the European Union at putting future development cooperation with these states on a new basis, one with better prospects and greater likelihood of success.
The intention is that greater economic exchange should combat poverty in the long term and eventually contribute to improving the earnings potential of people who live in the ACP States.
By means of regional cooperation on their part, the ACP States are to be put in a position to develop their own functioning markets, which are necessary if there is to be greater trade with us in both goods and services.
The mutual market opening, especially the opening of the great European internal market, is intended to enable them to achieve better sales in this market of their existing products, and perhaps also of those of higher quality yet to be developed, and thereby lay the foundations for the development of their national economies.
As part of this, the EU is holding out the prospect of generous technical aid to equip the economic and administrative actors with better qualifications.
The negotiations that are now getting underway should therefore focus on turning the ACP States into more effective economic partners, enabling social and cultural development, too, to be further accelerated.
Mrs Boudjenah's own-initiative report would, I regret to say, need to be further substantially improved by the incorporation of various amendments if the European Union is to negotiate from a stronger position, rather than for that position to be weakened as it is at the moment.
In the long term, we have to attempt to reach a realistic accommodation with the interests of the ACP States.
There is little point in this if it involves what gleams through at various points in this report - attempts at levelling accusations at the Commission, which has, in recent months, stepped up dialogue with the ACP States and made proposals to them concerning their sustainable development, which have included technical aid.
What matters is that the Commission, with our help, is pressing on with the creation of the new ACP economic area.
Some better system must replace the outdated and inefficient system of preferences for certain imports.
The rules both of the WTO and also the Cotonou Agreement should be applied, but with flexibility, and without their objectives being turned on their heads.
In that respect, the position of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - the Titley Report - is substantially in line with our way of thinking, but we demand that the opening of markets should - as provided for in the WTO rules and in the Cotonou Agreement - concentrate on goods and services.
For example, there is no internal market common to both Europe and Africa, which is why there can be no generally free movement of workers either.
Our demand is that liberalisation be handled flexibly, with transitional periods, but that liberalisation in important economic sectors should not be ruled out.
It is also our view that investment must be well protected in order to prevent this leading to the economic standstill and retrogression now evident in policies in Zimbabwe and other countries.
We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa, but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this, which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time.
We do not want to develop alternative rules for our relations with the ACP States; we should abide by the WTO's rules and the rules of our own Cotonou Agreement, which should be applied flexibly and with transitional periods.
We are therefore proposing amendments that, if accepted, will make it possible for us to support the report, failing which we will vote against it or abstain.
Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this timely report.
We in the PSE Group strongly align ourselves with her sentiments in relation to trade being a means to an end, not an end in itself.
The end is development of the ACP economies and poverty reduction for the poorest people in those countries.
One test of the Commission - I think Mr Liikanen was disingenuous in what he said this morning - is whether there is a genuine openness to alternatives.
It was never part of the Cotonou Agreement that the proposal for alternatives to EPAs would be delayed to 2004 and I hope he will withdraw that point when the debate is closed.
We also want to record strong agreement for what Mrs Boudjenah puts forward in terms of the need to advance the impact assessments so that we can genuinely see the impact of these negotiations.
The Commission again, in relation to the sugar industry, and the 'Everything but arms' proposals of a year and two years ago has not got a particularly strong track record in relation to impartial impact assessments and trade matters.
I have been selected as the nominee to chair the trade committee in the Joint Parliament Assembly between the EU and the ACP.
We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in overseeing these trade negotiations and promoting their transparency.
The Commissioner will agree that the Cape Town Declaration agreed by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly earlier this year gives us a strong opportunity for parliamentarians and civil society more generally to play a far greater role in the discussions that these crucial negotiations entail.
We want to see CAP reform being discussed.
The Commission is wrong there.
There are difficult issues for the ACP that the Commission forced on to the agenda.
